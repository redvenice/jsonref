I used to have some people tell me, date someone for a year, get to know them and see them. I have had some really crazy relationships.\u0027And men over stepping their boundaries. I am very much about a man being a man and a woman being a woman. And I am all about power couples like Jay Z and Beyonce.\u0027It is a rarity you do not find that every day. I know that Jimmy Kimmel and everyone are saying that women are resorting to dating fish - that is how bad the spectrum is to dating. I am back in my bachelors program and I am not focused on dating. But when I do date, I am not really intrigued right now.       Abraham voiced her concerns for her 10-year-old daughter Sophia\u0027s online life\u0027With all my life experiences I feel like I have lived about five different lives from successful businesses to TV shows to being creative. And I do feel like I will find a man that fits my goals and aspirations and someone to help me with those and be a partner in that.\u0027A person needs to be a serial entrepreneur like myself . And I have only seen very few men who can do three things at one time. Some men can only do one thing at one time, and I am like, you have got to do it all. And when it comes to first dates... I am not one for a drink and a date. I am like, I will meet you in Bali, let\u0027s go have an experience. I take it to another level. I am a whole lot of fun.\u0027Abraham spoke at the Nazarian Institute\u0027s ThinkBIG 2020 Conference at 1 Hotel West Hollywood.

Tom Oliver, an ecologist specialising in land use, the climate crisis and bioersity, believes we need a major shift in that direction. His view is that science now demands this change, and that only by making it will we become capable of responding to global warming and a host of other problems. The idea of the self as a relatively closed system is a delusion that has often conferred advantage, but is now a dangerous trap. Moving through difficult science with valuable clarity, Oliver tells us why.He starts with the science of the body. Complex forces make it, sustain it and break it down. Like the body itself, these forces are not closed systems with hard outer boundaries. The atoms that compose us derive from the fusion of hydrogen and helium in the big bang, and many come from far regions of the universe. The molecules that form our bodies have travelled the atmosphere and perhaps been in other animal body parts. Viruses and bacteria bring in new genes. Our cells live for seven to 10 years on average, some only for days, weeks or months. Oxygen, food and water enter our bodies, while heat and waste leave us for other parts of the system.Bacteria and fungi inhabit our bodies, their 38tn cells outnumbering ours. A human mouth contains over a thousand species. Genes pass between them. New species invade. Some leave or die, perhaps because of something we eat or stop eating. Some stay for life. Many are part of the functioning of our bodies. Even inside our cells there are mitochondria, energy-generating organs inherited from bacteria that fused with our single-celled ancestors two billion years ago. Correction: they were some of our ancestors.Gut bacteria break down food for us. Intestinal bacteria have a protective effect against illnesses including bowel cancer, while others release molecules that increase our susceptibility. Even feelings and actions, which we might think define our identity, are not necessarily simply our own. Bacteria make a difference to moods and depression. Alarmingly, there are parasites that assist their own life cycles by modifying their hosts’ behaviour, for example toxoplasma, which makes rats behave recklessly and expose themselves to predation. People who carry this organism are more likely to be involved in traffic accidents.Neuroscience brings more evidence. When we experience thoughts and memories, what happens physically is that electrochemical impulses travel between neuron brain cells, forming paths. The collection of paths at any one moment comprises that person’s “connectome”, which is the best match for our concept of self that materialist science can produce. Like other parts of the body, it is always being moulded by the world. Oliver quotes Susan Greenfield’s view that identity is an activity, not a state. New paths constantly form in huge numbers. Some paths fall into disuse, or the neurons reabsorb them. Oliver uses the image of a well-trodden road compared to an overgrown track. Selfhood holds its shape only through use. He compares the neurites, the millions of miles of connecting filaments in a brain, to the fibre-optic cables, mobile phone masts and satellites that enclose the globe in a web of technological communication. Both are parts of the process that forms our identities, as are the land and the climate.As western capitalism has become global, the consumerist idea of self has spread further. Advertising presents consumers with visions of their selves enhanced by the possession of each new commodity or ability. The structures that reinforce this kind of self are formidable nevertheless, Oliver hopes that we may be approaching a tipping point. The science that finds the outside world at work in all our components of selfhood is pulling us that way, as is the immensity of the ecological crisis.His tone changes. The book’s title recalls Richard Dawkins, and, early on, Oliver occasionally shows a Dawkins-like exasperation at the world’s refusal to fall into line with objective science. For each of us, I presume, our consciousness feels like a centre, a fixed point from which we see things, however aware we are of the problems with this view. To Oliver, initially, this stubbornness resembles that of the flat-earthers who refused to accept the Copernican revolution. Yet he comes to see that the inidualistic concept of self is a more ambiguous case. Qualifying adjectives start to appear more frequently. The independent, atomised, unchanging, coherent, autonomous self is the problem. We do not have to reject all forms of iniduality.That inidualistic idea of self has had great advantages, both evolutionary and moral care for the self is a primal motive for ingenuity in finding food, shelter and reproductive success. But Oliver calls it a white lie, an adaptive delusion. In small precarious communities, the need for sharing and mutual protection will have been a strong counterbalancing force, making excessive selfishness costly. Perhaps it is only in the context of ecological crisis and global consumerist capitalism that the adaptive delusion has become maladaptive, and the moral balance is tipping. And it is not reassuring to recall those societies in which masses of people have been willing to die for a collective identity such as nation, religion or a political cause. Essential to Oliver’s argument here is the moral difference between a collective identity that defines itself against others, and the ecosystem, which has no outsiders. Accepting the science is only the beginning. Moral weighing and reweighing must never stop.At the end, I was curious. What will we fear and desire in this future? How differently will we fall in love? Will we be more reconciled to mortality? What will our favourite stories be like? These will be fascinating questions if the shift begins in earnest.

Since Occupy Central – and the umbrella movement that succeeded it – ended without achieving its stated goal, Hong Kong has entered one of its most challenging chapters. Protesters coming out of a failed movement are overcome with disillusionment and powerlessness. The appeal sentencing of myself and my fellow umbrella leaders Nathan Law and Alex Chow has dealt yet another devastating blow to the morale of pro-democracy activists. Even though it feels as if we have hit rock bottom, we need to stay true to our cause. We must. To my friends who have decided to walk away from politics, I hope my being here and writing you this letter will convince you to reconsider. If not, our sacrifices will have been for nothing.I miss my mum’s hand-brewed milk tea terribly, and the chicken hotpot at the street-food restaurant where my friends and I always hang out. That’s the first place I’ll visit as soon as I’m out of here. But at the moment, my biggest worry is the state of my political party. Ever since Nathan and I co-founded Demosisto in April 2016 we’ve suffered a series of significant setbacks. Four weeks ago, Nathan lost his hard-won seat at the legislative council (LegCo) after he and five other members were disqualified on the grounds that they had failed to properly recite their oaths during the swearing-in ceremony. Nearly everyone is now out of a job, while half of our executive committee is behind bars, or will be in the coming weeks. My message to the pro-Beijing camp? Don’t celebrate too soon. I began my journey in 2012 when I led the campaign against the national education curriculum. It’s been a tumultuous five years. I didn’t shed a single tear when the judge announced my sentence, not because I was brave but because I wanted my supporters to embrace my loss of freedom as a necessary step on our collective path to democracy. To quote JK Rowling’s Hagrid: “What’s coming will come and we’ll meet it when it does.”Hong Kong is at a crossroads. The ruling regime will stop at nothing to silence dissent. For those who dare to stand up to them, the only way forward is together. And tonight, alone in my cell, I ask you to keep your chin up and use your tears, anger and frustration as motivation to charge ahead. Hong Kong people, carry on!I’ve been assigned a two-person cell. My cellmate seems friendly enough, although we didn’t have a chance to say much to each other before the lights went out. So far the biggest source of discomfort is perhaps the bed. In fact, calling it a bed is an over-statement. It’s nothing more than a wooden plank with no mattress. But, then again, if I could spend 79 nights sleeping on a highway during the umbrella movement I’m sure I can get used to this too.Twice a day, the news is broadcast on the PA system. This morning I was woken up by a story about Chris Patten, the last governor of Hong Kong. “Mr Patten told reporters that he was heartened by the sacrifices made by Joshua Wong, Alex Chow and Nathan Law, and that he believed these three names will be carved into history ...” It felt surreal to hear my name mentioned. The reality that I’m a convicted criminal has finally sunk in.I feel a little embarrassed about the enormous media attention that Alex, Nathan and I received last week. Local newspapers plastered my picture on their front pages the day after I was sent to prison. The reality is that countless others are being tried or are about to be tried in Hong Kong for their activism work. Many face much harsher prison terms than we do.Being phoneless is like having my limbs cut off or an itch I can’t scratch.LegCo member Shiu Ka-chun, nicknamed “Bottle”,  came to see me this morning. I met him six years ago, when I was a 14-year-old secondary school student and he a social worker and radio presenter. He later hosted some of my anti-national education rallies. In the documentary Netflix made about me, Joshua: Teenager vs Superpower, there is a scene in which I appear on Bottle’s radio show and he asks if I have a girlfriend. “My mum told me it’s too early for me to be dating,” I reply, and everyone in the studio bursts out laughing. Neither of us would have guessed that five years later we would be talking to each other on different sides of a glass partition.A prison supervisor approached me this afternoon for a chat about recent news events. He began by declaring himself to be an “independent”, and that he’s neither a “yellow ribbon” (a supporter of the umbrella movement) nor a “blue ribbon” (a supporter of the government and the police). He asked me whether I had any regrets about entering politics and ending up behind bars, before launching into a 30-minute monologue on my conviction. His point – if there was one: we all got what we asked for.Like every other day since I arrived, a handful of inmates and I spent most of today sweeping the 2,000-sq ft canteen. We clean after every breakfast, lunch and dinner. Most twentysomethings in Hong Kong live with their parents and many middle-class households have a live-in maid. My family is no exception. I’ve never cleaned this much in my life and I keep telling myself that it’s good for my character.Twice a day, a senior correctional officer visits the facility. All inmates have to stand in a straight line with our chests out, make a fist with both hands, and stare, not straight ahead, but 45 degrees upwards.Today I had my first dreaded morning march. I’m scrawny and spend nearly all my spare time playing video games and watching Japanese anime.I don’t go out much and I’ve never been athletic or particularly coordinated. I’ll be lucky to get through the march without embarrassing or hurting myself.Three years ago, I joined hundreds of thousands of brave citizens in the largest political movement in Hong Kong’s history with the simple goal to bring true democracy to our city. We asked to exercise our constitutional right to elect our own leader through a fair and open election. Not only did the Hong Kong government – appointed by Beijing and under its direction – ignore our demands, it also arrested and charged many of us with illegal assembly.Until recently, the charge of unlawful assembly was used only to prosecute members of local gangs. In the past, the term “political prisoner” conjured up frightening images of dissidents in mainland China being rounded up and thrown into jail. It’s hard to imagine that the term now also applies to Hong Kong. As Beijing’s long arm reaches into every corner and threatens our freedoms and way of life, the number of prisoners of conscience is only going to increase.Unfortunately, few foreign governments are willing to take on the world’s second largest economy and hold its actions to account. For instance, I was disheartened by the latest Six-Monthly Report on Hong Kong published by the British foreign secretary, Boris Johnson. Despite the political persecution of activists like me, he concluded that the “one country, two systems” framework was “working well”. As a signatory to the Sino-British joint declaration on Hong Kong, Britain has both a moral and a legal obligation to defend its former subjects and speak up on their behalf.More than one inmate has asked me: “How much do they pay you to do your political stuff?” At first I thought they just wanted to provoke me with accusations that I take money from foreign governments. But I’ve slowly realised the questions are genuine. Most people don’t understand why any sane person would risk prison to do what I do if it wasn’t for money. Today is the third anniversary of my Civic Square siege, the event that set in motion the umbrella movement and a turning point in my life. This time three years ago, I scaled a metal fence near the government headquarters and called on other protesters to follow me. I was tackled by a dozen police officers and taken into custody. There’s a huge variety of political views here. The younger prisoners tend to be yellow ribbons. Several of them have opened up to me about their involvement in the umbrella movement and subsequent protests. But there are plenty of hardcore blue ribbons too. Yesterday someone from the security unit pulled me aside and told me that some older guys in the workshop had heckled me and yelled “Traitor” when I walked past.I received letters from a few university classmates today. We started in the same year and now they’re about to graduate. By summer next year they’ll be starting their first jobs, moving ahead in life.My last day in prison came and went like any other. By the time I’m released I’ll have spent 69 days behind bars. They represent an important milestone in my seven-year journey in political activism. I’ll come out of prison stronger and more committed to our cause than ever.In June 2019, on the heels of the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre, a controversial fugitive transfer arrangement with China tabled by the government set off a fresh round of protests. It felt as if it was the umbrella movement all over again, except this time protesters were angrier and more combative. Young people’s voices went from loud to deafening as they refused to be brushed aside as they had in 2014. Street demonstrations escalated quickly after million person marches failed to move politicians. Peaceful rallies soon gave way to full-scale urban guerrilla warfare.A new cold war is brewing between China and the rest of the democratic world, and Hong Kong is holding the line in one of its first battles. Nothing captures that tension more vividly than the moments on 1 October 2019 when live coverage of the 70th anniversary celebrations in Beijing were shown side by side with scenes of demonstrators braving teargas and throwing eggs at Xi Jinping’s portraits on the streets of Hong Kong. The contrast sends a clear message to the world that China’s tightening grip on Hong Kong is part of a much broader threat to global democracy.In May 2019, I went to prison for the second time. I spent seven weeks at Lai Chi Kok Correctional Institution for violating a court injunction during the umbrella movement. I tried to comfort my parents and joked that my biggest regret was having to miss the opening night of Avengers: Endgame, the sequel to Avengers: Infinity War. Before I headed to prison, a foreign reporter asked me for a soundbite about my second incarceration and China’s crackdown on pro-democracy activists in general. I thought about the discussion I had with my parents and said: “This isn’t our endgame. Our fight against the CCP is an infinity war.” The infinity war that has ravaged Hong Kong for years, I am afraid, may be coming soon to a political theatre near you.• Edited extract from Unfree Speech by Joshua Wong and Jason Y Ng, published by WH Allen (RRP £9.99) on 30 January.

No wonder so many end up with PTSDIt was the day before my nephew’s barmitzvah, almost 20 years ago, when family and friends would gather to celebrate my sister’s son’s coming of age. After nine years, my parents had just accepted my wife into the family: this was going to be an important moment for us as a couple. But it wasn’t the happy event I’d hoped for.My wife and I had already told my parents – and others – that we were pregnant. I wanted a boy, and we knew his name: Eli. That day before the barmitzvah, I was due to have the all-important first scan where a heartbeat would be detected – but when I woke that morning I knew something was wrong.At the hospital a scan showed the sac but no heartbeat. I was to return to the hospital on Monday but first had to go through an entire weekend of family celebration. I’d alerted my parents, telling my dad not to ask me to dance as I probably wouldn’t want to, so he danced with my wife instead – something I never thought I would see.On Monday I was given medication to start the miscarriage. From hospital bed to my own bed, I was in the most excruciating pain, unable to get any relief. A day later I had a D\u0026ampC procedure to remove anything that was left from my uterus, and that was it. Eli was gone. We were heartbroken. That was to be my only pregnancy. Friends came to the rescue. Those who had miscarried were sympathetic and kind. Those who had given birth were very much aware of their luck. I am glad we previously shared our excitement about the pregnancy with those friends, regardless of any supposed 12-week rule – it meant they were there for us right from the start through to the end. Our friends enjoyed our good news and grieved with us in our sad news. Whom do we protect if we remain silent? We need to talk about miscarriage more – we need to talk to the professionals but also to each other.Prior to treatment, because we were a same-sex couple, we had to undergo counselling to ensure we would be “good” parents. When I miscarried there was no counselling offered. Maybe this has changed now, but given my miscarriage and the experience of other people I know, it’s clear we need greater care and support. This is vital for our mental and physical wellbeing. Our bodies and minds have suffered a great trauma. We have been filled with pregnancy hormones, readying us to carry a child, to nourish it, watch it flourish and enter the world. To lose that causes tremendous distress. It’s not surprising then to read a study this week that suggests “one in six women who lose a baby in early pregnancy experience long-term symptoms of post-traumatic stress”. We need help.After I miscarried, a friend who did have a child said to me, “Oh well, nothing’s changed for you, your life is the same as it was before.” We are no longer friends. Everything had changed.Society has much to answer for on this. To be a family is seen by many as having children. Women are expected to procreate. The number of miscarriages some women go through before a live birth is shattering. Is this because as women we do not want to be seen as failures? The very formulation of the word miscarriage can denote a mistake, an error, a failure to meet the intended result. But it is not a mistake or a failure, it is just unlucky. It is simply an ending.All of us – including the medical professionals – need to rethink our language around miscarriage. We should not camouflage what has happened and pretend it is something else in case we cause upset. We are already upset. Those cells and tissue are part of us, not some alien matter. Miscarriage is tough. Whether we miscarry at six weeks or 12 weeks or 23 weeks, the result is heartbreaking. Our minds and bodies are deeply distressed. We are grieving. We need proper care from those who are trained to give it, acknowledging our loss and offering space to heal.My miscarriage was almost 20 years ago, but my wife and I still relive it. We still wonder who Eli would have grown into, how we would have raised him. We note his would-have-been birthdays every year. The pain never goes away completely. We cried for a very long time. We still cry. And we still talk about it. Because dialogue matters. It really matters. The right words matter.• Shelley Silas is an award-winning playwright.

Pupils told her they had been put in isolation over minor uniform breaches or the wrong hairstyle.Longfield is also concerned that isolation is being used by some schools as a “gateway” to exclusions and that it affects disproportionately high numbers of children with special educational needs.Last week, the Centre for Mental Health charity warned that putting challenging pupils in isolation for extended periods at school could harm their mental health and that young people who had already suffered trauma were particularly vulnerable.But some in the education sector back the the use of isolation for disruptive children. The government’s behaviour tsar for England, Tom Bennett, recently told the  that “removal rooms” were used so children could learn in a safe, calm environment.“They aren’t isolation rooms – I’ve never seen a school leave a child unattended. They’re supervised, and more often than not, accompanied by other students. So claims that these are isolation spaces is nonsense. These are safe spaces, run by adults,” he said.Other headteachers say the use of well-run isolation rooms means lessons are disruption-free for other children. Ruth Robinson, a school leader from Swindon, explained on Twitter that at her school 10-15 out of 900 students on average spent the day in the school’s isolation room, though booths were not used.“The impact of this approach is that every single lesson taught at the school is disruption-free. No teacher is ever talked over. Pupils are not rude. Pupils don’t refuse to work. This system is strict but it isn’t draconian. It works because it’s fair and because everyone understands it.”In an interview with the , Longfield said: “I get lots of anecdotal evidence, lots of kids and some parents, telling me about the awful experience they have had in isolation and isolation booths.“I get to hear about children who have spent long periods of time in isolation rooms. They have told us that they find it distressing and degrading. They said they feel like they are being warehoused in isolation, and they say sometimes it’s for days or weeks at a time.“I was told of a school where they were converting a toilet section into isolation booths – and the comment there was it was very handy because they had already got the cubicles.”Longfield said she had also heard of schools where teachers were having their classrooms taken away because more booths were wanted, “and I heard of one bizarre example of how they had a kind of portable booth which was a cardboard booth which they just put over the child wherever they were sitting”.There are no official figures, but one BBC investigation said more than 200 pupils had spent at least five straight days in isolation areas in schools in England in 2017. A “Lose the Booths” conference has been organised for next weekend to encourage headteachers to remove booths and employ better practices.John Procter of Corporate Office Furniture, which sells isolation booths, said about 50 schools had acquired units from him over the last five years. In the last three months alone, around eight schools have bought around 100 units, each costing £175.“It’s not cruel,” said Procter. “These people who say it’s wrong, they need to spend a day in a school and see actually what these teachers have to go through. The teachers have not signed up to being abused.”Many in the sector say a distinction should be drawn between isolation rooms and the use of confined booths, in which children have to face the wall and cannot communicate with each other. They say there is also a balance to be struck between the needs of challenging pupils and those who want to work without distraction.But Longfield said she was concerned that there may be a link between the use of isolation and exclusions. “Often parents, especially those with children with special educational needs, will talk to me about how their children are always being put in isolation booths.“Some children have said they even just sleep in the booths. In fact, one child even said: ‘Oh well, they’re not that bad,’ – they get to have a sleep.”The government is due to publish fresh guidance later this year on managing behaviour and the use of isolation rooms and exclusions. “All kids have a right to a good education and if they are being removed from a classroom and put into isolation they are not getting their education,” said Longfield. “I’m being told that some children are put in isolation because they have their hair in the wrong style or they have forgotten something or they are wearing some part of the uniform that isn’t right. I don’t want kids put into isolation about that.”Longfield said she accepted there needed to be quiet areas outside the classrooms where children could calm down. “But what I’m concerned about is when those isolation booths seem to be booming in some schools and when those periods of isolation outside the classroom become very much the norm and when they are being abused.”A Department for Education spokesperson said: “Schools may choose to use in-school units, whether that be to provide additional support to vulnerable pupils, or as a sanction to remove pupils with challenging behaviour from the classroom.“Our guidance is clear, however, that use of isolation must comply with pupil safeguarding and welfare requirements. Pupils are not to be kept in isolation longer than necessary and their time spent there must be as constructive as possible.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29c636822a4eaa9d96e13f3e88881b8af680166e/404_0_4738_2844/master/4738.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aa3e16c2c0012feee02b988d25f81096","title":"free period products to be available in schools and colleges in england","story":"State scheme starts from Monday as part of government bid to tackle ‘period poverty’Tampons, sanitary pads and other period products will be made freely available to all state schools and colleges in England starting next week, with the launch of a scheme funded by the Department for Education.The scheme follows the government’s commitment last year to pay for sanitary products for primary and secondary schools, in an effort to tackle “period poverty”, which can cause girls from low-income families to missschool.“We know that it is not easy for everyone to access period products where and when they need them. This scheme will deal with those problems so young people can go about their daily lives without getting caught out,” said Michelle Donelan, the children and families minister.The DfE said the scheme was designed “to give pupils easy access to period products at school or college” as well as breaking down stigmas and raising awareness around menstruation.Amika George, the founder of Free Periods who began campaigning to end period poverty in 2017, said: “We ask that schools have open conversations with students about what they need and start signing up to the scheme – no child must miss out.“Free products in schools will ensure that every child can learn and be their very best, without periods holding them back.”Rosamund McNeil, the assistant general secretary of the National Education Union, said more than 137,000 pupils missed school in 2018 because of their period. “No girl in the UK should miss out on education because they can’t afford these essential products,” McNeil said.The scheme is to cost up to £20m this year for an estimated 1.7 million students. From Monday, staff will be able to order products from a commercial supplier, PHS group, awarded the contract by the DfE after a tender last year.The range available to more than 20,000 schools and colleges includes environmentally friendly pads and reusable products, the company said.The government initially pledged to provide sanitary products to all state secondary schools and colleges in last year’s spring statement. But the coverage was extended after campaigners pointed out menstruation began for many girls during their time at primary school.Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, applauded the government’s effort to extend provision to all schools.“We’d urge the government to monitor the new scheme closely, so that if take-up numbers are low initially, then more can be done to advertise the service and to guarantee that every pupil can access a period product that meets their needs,” Whiteman said.The scheme in England follows a groundbreaking 2018 decision by the Scottish government to fund free menstrual products to young people in schools, colleges and universities across Scotland, after a survey found that one in four struggled to obtain tampons or pads.The Welsh government followed last year, offering free products to all state schools and colleges. NHS England also announced that women and girls in hospital would receive free sanitary products on request."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4f50089574a9db1b14e1a4ef2a5d04dddb23e93/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=863bd7e94ba748f89df2ba376b490d40","title":"how ofsted drove me out of teaching job i loved","story":"Teacher Lynne Fox received a prestigious Pearson national headteacher of the year award last summer. Judges praised her as a “tour de force” who had transformed her comprehensive, Bramhall high school, overcoming significant challenges such as funding cuts and staff redundancies to secure “the very best educational experience for students”. The school, they said, was “a vibrant environment where enthusiasm and creativity are encouraged”, leading to “outstanding” results.A few weeks later, Fox found herself leaving a meeting with Ofsted inspectors in tears. “It was the only time in my professional career as a leader that I’ve ever felt that bad. That low.”The watchdog told her Bramhall high – currently the second-highest performing school in Stockport, despite suffering budget cuts of £400,000 over the past three years – did not provide a “good quality education” and “requires improvement”.Fox, 58, who has calmly weathered 12 Ofsted inspections in her 17 years as a headteacher, was shaken to the core. “For three years running, when GCSEs have got more difficult nationally, our results have bucked the trend: we have gone up and up in our outcomes. It just doesn’t correlate. It’s so unjust.”In September, the watchdog overhauled its entire inspection framework, announcing it was shifting its focus on to “the real substance of education: the curriculum”. Now, even when a school is rated “good” by the inspector in all areas other than “quality of education”, it can be given a rating of “requires improvement”. This is exactly what happened in the case of Bramhall high.The government recently announced plans to increase Ofsted’s powers to carry out school inspections. Longer, more detailed inspection visits are now in the offing, along with more frequent inspections for outstanding schools. By contrast, Labour’s manifesto had pledged to scrap Ofsted entirely, amid reports of teachers experiencing record levels of stress.Since the judgment was handed down, Fox has needed extra support from friends and family and has had sleepless nights and recurring feelings of bitterness and frustration. “I’ve never felt so powerless as I do now.”Challenging the report did not help. In response, she says, Ofsted inspected its own inspection and upheld its original rating. Fox then asked the watchdog to share evidence about how it had reached its “astounding conclusions”. But she was told just before Christmas such a disclosure would “harm potential future inspection activities” and was not in the public interest.This proved the last straw and she announced to staff and parents last week she was taking early retirement and would be leaving in the summer. “I feel totally disillusioned and angry. That isn’t healthy for me – and it’s not in the best interests of the school.”After the report was published, more than 300 parents wrote to Ofsted praising the school and its impact on their children, she says. “All our data shows a three-year improving trend. That should have been recognised. Our teaching is of high quality, our outcomes are brilliant, our kids are engaged and our staff are hard-working.”She is scathing of Ofsted’s autocratic approach: “This process has not provided us with anything that will bring about school improvement. It’s just caused disillusionment across the school.”An Ofsted spokesperson said: “We are saddened that the headteacher has made the decision to resign, especially as our inspection team judged the school’s leadership and management as good. Beyond this the inspection report explicitly commented on the good job that she and her senior staff had done in improving the school. The report also recognised the school’s improvements in the pupils’ behaviour, personal development and GCSE results, while pointing out the improvements needed to the quality of education. However, we do understand the strength of feeling among the school community about the head’s departure.”The watchdog added that while it does not comment on inidual complaints about Ofsted inspections, it treated them all seriously and investigates them thoroughly. “As an accountability body we recognise the value of external scrutiny and we report on the handling of complaints each year in our Annual Report and Accounts. This shows that, where appropriate, Ofsted takes prompt steps to put things right when a complaint is upheld. If a school requests an internal review it is considered by a panel that normally includes an external representative who is not employed by Ofsted but is, for example, a school leader. If a school is still not happy then it can complain to the Independent Complaints Adjudication Service for Ofsted, which reviews the way that we deal with complaints. And, more broadly, Parliament scrutinises our work.”For Fox and her staff, these words will bring little comfort as they await the next gruelling visit from Ofsted’s inspectors, which could take place at any time. “I have no faith left in the system,” says Fox. “You can’t win. Ofsted is a machine you can’t beat.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c933055d3ffef649cbba7ce04a25cf80e43ea24c/643_190_2857_1715/master/2857.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26f0d23b70d8a32d0593ab631b222c2a","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"The pick of the best flora and fauna photos from around the world, including an iguana and an injured leopard"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea334c49b6cccef4b3f4727229dd1d6c51c5aabb/0_69_3575_2144/master/3575.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5eeb2750298efd8fac28972a7dc68eee","title":"jean paul gaultier bows out as fashion designer after 50 years","story":"Gaultier says his high-end fashion and perfume business will continue along with a new concept as yet to be revealedThe renowned designer Jean-Paul Gaultier is bowing out from creating clothes after a 50-year career, he has said. But he has told fans not to worry, because he will be turning his hand to other creative projects.While his high-end fashion and perfume business will continue, Gaultier will take a step back from designing garments, he said. The designer tweeted the news in a video post on Friday, saying his next Paris show, on Wednesday, will be his last.“I’m going to give you a scoop,” he was filmed saying in a jokey telephone conversation, done as if speaking to a journalist. “This will be my last haute couture show. My last Gaultier Paris show. You have to come, you can’t miss that.“But, but, but I assure you: Gaultier Paris will continue, haute couture will continue. I have a new concept I’ll tell you about it later, I’ll tell you all the little secrets. But it is going to continue.”His irreverent style and provocative reputation brought him both fame and contempt from other fashion designers. In 2018, for instance, he produced a tongue-in-cheek fashion range inspired by cigarettes.In recent years he dropped more regular collections, focusing on producing one-of-a-kind ranges presented during haute couture fashion weeks in Paris.His brand confirmed that his plans to step back related only to his fashion and perfume business.Gaultier, 67, stopped designing ready-to-wear clothes in 2015 to concentrate on haute couture – handmade clothes that only the world’s richest people can afford.But, as late as last year, he insisted he had no intention of putting down his scissors, although he despaired of animal rights activists pressuring him to stop using furs.A teenage prodigy who rose to fame in the 1980s, when the Paris fashion scene was at its most decadent, Gaultier also carved out a parallel television career as the co-presenter of a ribald series, Eurotrash.In 2018, he staged his own hit cabaret show based loosely on his life story, called Fashion Freak Show, which opened at the Folie Bergère in Paris.A spokeswoman for Gaultier’s brand said that the designer would be back. But, like the veteran Japanese clothes creator Kenzō Takada, who has moved into interior design, it would be in other areas of creativity."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b499ed26972d43fc2601691e0f1d72dcb5b1eb5/0_406_3677_2205/master/3677.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=79e3c3fb3ef6e23ffd32c8649f93e2e7","title":"jack oconnell not many actors come from where i am from i am proud of that","story":"The actor on his Derbyshire roots, travelling in his caravan and reforming OasisBorn in Derbyshire, Jack O’Connell, 29, had a role in This is England in 2006 and went on to appear in Skins from 2009 to 2013.

It was Zimmer’s close friendship with Bond producer Barbara Broccoli that led to his initial involvement with the film. “I never thought I would do this. I honestly never thought about it other than that Barbara Broccoli is a really dear friend, I just love her as a human being, very much,” he said.Zimmer is one of Hollywood’s most high-profile composers, winning an Oscar for his 1994 theme for The Lion King. He is best known for his collaborations with Christoper Nolan on Inception, Interstellar and the Dark Knight movies.Earlier this week, Billie Eilish announced she would be writing and singing the theme song to No Time to Die. The 18-year-old musician is youngest artist to provide the soundtrack to a Bond film, which has over the years morphed into an highly anticipated music event.Eilish said: “It feels crazy to be a part of this in every way. To be able to score the theme song to a film that is part of such a legendary series is a huge honour. James Bond is the coolest film franchise ever to exist. I’m still in shock.”She follows some of the industry’s biggest names in creating a song for the franchise, including Shirley Bassey, Paul McCartney, Duran Duran, Madonna, Sam Smith and Adele. The UK’s Official Charts, which described Bond’s theme songs as an “integral part of British music and film legacy”, notes that Smith’s theme song for 2015’s Writing’s On The Wall is the only one in the franchise to reach number one, while Duran Duran’s A View To A Kill and Adele’s Skyfall each peaked at number two in 1985 and 2012 respectively."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea7a7d8f0e3c1b2714ef40b088f9b10904eb1aa1/0_1133_3408_2045/master/3408.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c0f49d81c211085d33111223fd0c7e8","title":"meera sodha vegan recipe tofu katsu sado celeriac apple slaw","story":"A fried tofu cutlet slathered with curried ‘mayo’ and covered in an eye-opening slaw – this is how to make sandwiches excitingMy life can be carved into two parts: a time before katsu sando and the enlightened after period.It’s hard for a sandwich, the lunchtime stalwart, to break ranks and become exciting and even famous, but it’s easy to see how this Japanese take on it has done just that. Here, a tofu cutlet is coated with panko breadcrumbs, fried until crisp, then slathered with curried ‘mayo’. Then it’s covered in an eye-opening celeriac and apple slaw before being sandwiched between the softest bread available. It’s carb-on-carb action, and a satisfying sandwich of contrasts.In January, when UK-grown veg is not very abundant, tofu is a brilliant store-cupboard ingredient to have at your disposal, though cooked, breaded and fried pumpkinsquash or aubergine would also make great fillings. If you have one, use a food processor with the right slicer blade to matchstick the apple and celeriac, or a julienne peeler.¼ large celeriac (250g) peeled and cut into matchsticks2 medium apples (about 200g), core removed and cut into matchsticks2 tbsp rice-wine vinegar1½ tsp fine sea salt2 tbsp coriander leaves, roughly chopped8 tbsp vegan mayonnaise (I like Leon’s) 2 tbsp tomato ketchup 4 tsp medium curry powder 2 x 280g packs extra-firm tofu50g panko breadcrumbs Sunflower or rapeseed oil, for frying 8 slices white breadIn a medium bowl, toss the celeriac and apple with the vinegar, a teaspoon of salt and the coriander, then leave to soften. In a small bowl, whisk half the mayo with the ketchup, two teaspoons of curry powder and a quarter-teaspoon of salt. Drain the tofu, squeezing out any moisture with your hands, then pat dry with kitchen paper. Cut each block horizontally into four “steaks”, to give eight in all. Put the rest of the mayo, curry powder and a quarter-teaspoon of salt into a shallow bowl, add a tablespoon of warm water and stir to loosen. Put the panko on a lipped plate.One by one, cover both sides of the tofu steaks in the curried mayo, shake off any excess, then press into the panko to coat, and lay on an oven tray. Pour ½cm oil into a high-sided, nonstick frying pan and put on medium heat until simmering. Fry half the panko-coated tofu steaks for a minute and a half on each side, until crisp and golden, then transfer to a plate lined with kitchen paper to drain. Repeat with the rest of the tofu.Spread half the curried mayo on four slices of bread. Lay two tofu steaks on top of each slice and top with slaw. Spread the rest of the mayo on the other slices of bread and place on top, mayo side down. Using a bread knife, cut away the crusts, so the bread is the same size as the tofu, then cut each sandwich into four and serve with extra slaw on the side."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a71b3e56df814ac2a65cfff12627908b405c4d3c/0_1078_3720_2232/master/3720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a205f2d64743d6379f3a71725fc10b8","title":"yotam ottolenghi slow cooking recipes mushrooms parsnips and brussels sprouts","story":"Watch your humble vegetables transform into luxurious delicacies after a warm bath in oil and aromaticsSlow-cooking in fat, or confiting, to use the fancy term, is usually associated with meat (or for preserving fruit in sugar syrup). For me, however, vegetables are the biggest winners from a long, warm bath of oil and aromatics. In the process (which isn’t actually that long with veg), they tenderise and soak up a bunch of flavours that make them rich, unctuous and delicious. It’s a total transformation of something mild and humble into something rich and luxurious. All they then need is a spot of acidity or a touch of heat, and you’ve got glorious vegetables, reimagined, on the table.This is a sort of vegan equivalent of steak and mash. The oil the mushrooms are cooked in turns into something similar to harissa, with a deep, umami flavour and a real kick, so leave out the red chilli if you prefer less heat. This will make more oil than you need: keep any excess in a sealed container in the fridge, for spooning over grilled veg or meat.The mash can be warmed up or served at room temperature.Prep 15 minCook 1 hr 35 minServes 4 as a mainFor the mushrooms8 medium to large portobello mushrooms (about 650g), stems removed10 garlic cloves, peeled1 onion, peeled and cut into 6 wedges1½ tbsp chipotle chilli flakes1 red chilli 4 tsp cumin seeds, roughly crushed in a mortar1 tbsp coriander seeds, roughly crushed in a mortar2 tbsp tomato paste400ml olive oil1 tbsp flaked sea saltFor the puree500g freshly cooked or good-quality jarred butter beans (drained weight)1½ tbsp lemon juice1 tbsp olive oil½ tsp flaked saltHeat the oven to 170C (150C fan)335Fgas 3. Put the mushrooms domed side up in a large, ovenproof saucepan for which you have a lid, and arrange the garlic and onion in and around them. Add all the remaining mushroom ingredients, then cover with a piece of greaseproof paper, push it down gently to cover the mix, then top the pan with a lid. Bake for an hour, then remove the pan, turn over the mushrooms, replace the paper and lid, and bake for 20 minutes more, or until the mushrooms are very tender but not falling apart. Use a pair of tongs to transfer the mushrooms to a board, cut them in half and set aside.Use a spoon to lift the onion, garlic and chilli (discard the stem) out of the oil – don’t worry if you scoop up some of the spices and oil, too – put in the small bowl of a food processor and blitz smooth. Return the onion mixture and mushroom halves to the saucepan, put on a medium-high heat and cook for five minutes, so all the flavours come together.Meanwhile, make the puree by blitzing all the bean ingredients in a food processor with two tablespoons of water, until completely smooth. If you prefer a warm mash, transfer to a saucepan and heat gently.Divide the puree between four plates, top each portion with four mushroom halves and generously spoon over the oil and its solids.This dish is made special by the complex sweetness and depth of Shaoxing wine, a Chinese wine fermented from rice that you can now find in large supermarkets and most Asian food stores – if you can’t get it, use pale dry sherry instead.

Cover tightly with foil and roast for 35 minutes, until the shallots are soft but still hold their shape. Stir in the grapes, cover again with foil, cook for 10 minutes more, then remove from the oven, discard the foil and set aside the tin while you roast the sprouts.Turn up the oven to 240C (220C fan)465Fgas 9. Toss the sprouts in two tablespoons of oil and a quarter-teaspoon of salt, then spread them out on two oven trays lined with baking paper. Roast for 16 minutes, switching the position of the trays halfway through, until browned, then tip the sprouts into the shallot tin, gently mix everything together and leave, uncovered, at room temperature for an hour, ideally, and at least 30 minutes, to give the flavours time to develop.Meanwhile, in a small bowl mix the chillies, rice vinegar, sugar and an eighth of a teaspoon of salt, and leave to pickle for at least 30 minutes.Once the sprouts have sat for a while, stir in the remaining teaspoon of rice wine and two tablespoons of soy sauce, and the parsley, and transfer to a large, shallow bowl. Top with the pickled chillies and their pickling liquid, and serve.These parsnips are intensely flavoured with vinegar, chilli and smoke from the grill, which adds a wonderful dimension but isn’t strictly essential, so skip the charring stage if you want to save time.

Kelly does well to gather Harrison’s low whipped delivery.41 mins: Eze, a class above everyone else on the pitch, releases Amos with a gorgeously languid outside-of-the-foot pass, and the midfielder charges through the middle and makes it to the edge of the Leeds box before being stopped in his path by White. A minute later, Osayi-Samuel picks the ball up on the right and wrestles his way past Dallas, whose rugby tackle earns him a booking – just what he doesn’t need.38 mins: A bit more needle, Chair hauling down Phillips in midfield and the Leeds player kicking out in frustration. Both men receive a stern talking-to and clash again – legally – moments later. then Costa find space on the edge of the box but his shot is deflected wide.34 mins: Again QPR’s wingers cause problems, first Osayi-Samuel gets down the right but is well shackled by Dallas, but then Eze picks up the ball and lures Ayling into a rash foul. He floats in the free-kick from the left, which finds an unmarked Wells who can only side-foot badly wide from five yards out. Then, somehow, the resulting goalkick sets Bamford clean through – and Kelly scampers out into no-man’s land! But the Leeds striker lashes an early strike high and wide when the situation called for calm. Oh dear. “How awesome is it to watch football without VAR?” writes JR from Illinois. “It’s like being in the past when things were simple and wonderful. It also doesn’t hurt that VAR would have ruled out that QPR goal and I happen to root for the Baggies.” Quite right.30 mins: It comes to nothing, and QPR counter brilliantly, Eze to Chair, whose raking ball picks out Osayi-Samuel. His trickery gets him into the box and he squares to Chair on the D, but his low effort is rushed and trickles wide.28 mins: After a shaky start, Leeds have settled into the game. Costa dances in off the flank and looks for Bamford, who can’t escape his marker. From the resulting corner, Costa picks the ball up again and wins a free-kick on the left.26 mins: Bamford gets his first proper sight of goal, collecting the ball from Ayling and drilling an effort from an acute angle, beaten away by Kelly.24 mins: The first sign of needle, as Hernandez and Amos contest a loose ball and get involved in some heated but just-about-above-board midfield scrapping, the Leeds player eventually tackling his opponent with needless force.QPR lead! Eze’s driven free-kick doesn’t get past the wall but Wells gathers the loose ball and taps in from close range. But he controlled it with his hand! Unwittingly, but unequivocally. Leeds are furious. The goals stands. One-nil.19 mins: From the resulting corner, Osayi-Samuel picks up the half-cleared ball on the halfway line and storms majestically forward, right at the heart of Leeds’ flailing defence, eventually winning a foul right on the edge of the box. He’s been superb so far.18 mins: Costa draws a foul on the right. Hernandez whips in a glorious cross, but again no Leeds players can meet it. White’s looping clearance forces a save from his own keeper.16 mins: Ayling scoots up the right flank and is found by Costa. He drills the ball low and hard across goal but no attacker can get a touch and the ball is cleared. 14 mins: Osayi-Samuel drives in from the right against and feeds Well’s, whose first-time layoff is curled goalwards by Amos. Casilla tips wide. 12 mins: Eze carries the ball down the left and zips it into the feet of Wells, who lays off to Osayi-Samuel. He skips into the box but mis-hits his shot. Positive stuff from QPR so far.10 mins: Dallas steams forward, plays a lovely one-two with Harrison and tries to pick out Bamford in the box, but his pass is loose. 8 mins: QPR hem leeds into their own half, with Chair, Eze and Osayi-Samuel taking turns to run at a Leeds defence that eventually clears. On the counter, Bamford unleashes an audacious chip from almost the halfway line. It sails over Kelly but drifts a few feet wide.5 mins: QRP are clearly under instruction to send the ball early towards Osayi-Samuel and isolate him against Dallas, Leeds’ stand-in left-back. down the other end, Leeds mount an attack that ends with a volley scuffed into the floor by Harrison.3 mins: And now Eze, on the other wing, ghosts past Ayling with a drop of the shoulder but can’t quite find a hooped shirt from the byline. Three minutes in and QPR’s danger men look up for it.2 mins: Osayi-Samuel stretches his legs on the right wing, chasing a lovely long pass from Hall and drawing a hideously rash tackle from Cooper, who misses the ball completely. White sweeps up. The teams are out, and it’s a glorious afternoon in west London. Handshakes are exchanged and formations adopted – and we’re off. Leeds get going with a bit of keep-ball, before Costa’s driving run is curtailed as he reaches the QPR box.The hardest-worked defenders today, though, might just be Leeds’ two full-backs, who’ll be up against the combined trickery of Bright Osayi-Samuel and Eberechi Eze, two outrageously talented dribblers with no shortage of final product and who can switch flanks at will. You’d imagine a busy afternoon awaits for Luke Ayling and Stuart Dallas.Speaking of that defence, 21-year-old former Liverpool youth-teamer Conor Masterson is making his league debut for QPR today at the heart of it. He can’t do any worse than what’s come before him, right…?Die-hard QPR fan Aditya emails from Mumbai to get us in the mood: “Love to see the way we’re playing this season. We’ve got the best front three in the league (okay, second best to Brentford) and a shocking defence – every game is a rollercoaster. Looking forward to seeing how we square up against a stuttering Leeds.”Just the one change for Leeds, then, and a forced one at that – Pablo Hernández coming in for the injured Barry Douglas. Bielsa is clearly of the mind that no tinkering is needed despite the ominous downturn in results.As for QPR, they make three changes with the most notable being the omission of Jordan Hugill who misses out with what the club describe as a “knock”. But the real story here might just be on the hosts’ bench, where there’s a spot for the teenage attacker Jack Clarke who joined this week on loan from Tottenham. Clarke joined Spurs in the summer from – you guessed it – Leeds, and was promptly loaned back to them this season, only to be recalled by Spurs in December because he wasn’t being given a game. Got that? If not, here’s the short version: Clarke has a point to prove. Funny league, the Championship. Despite being runaway favourites for the automatic promotion spots and sitting snugly in first and second, neither Leeds nor West Brom have won a league game this decade! In fact, the only victory they’ve managed between them in the last month was Leeds’ 5-4 win at Birmingham – a glorious occasion, but hardly the stuff of hard-nosed champions. And yet here we are, with Marcelo Bielsa’s boys heading down to the capital with top spot in their sights. A win would take them there – at least until their rivals play on Monday night – although leaving Loftus Road with three points might be rather more easily said than done for a side who, just as they started to look dead-certs for promotion, have hit that fabled winter wobble – the one their manager seems to carry with him wherever he goes.Standing in their way this afternoon are Mark Warburton’s magnificently freewheeling QPR side, who are by no means out of the promotion chase themselves – and encouragingly for us, have scored more goals than any team bar the one at the very top, and conceded more goals than team bar the one at the very bottom. They also have the twinkle-toed Eberechi Eze, who if he isn’t the ision’s best player is almost certainly the best to watch. And you thought Leeds were the Championship’s most exciting side. This should be good – strap in!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03ecc1e260cd85d4748fc3bc16ae5cbff3dbfd93/0_248_3756_2255/master/3756.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b1600a055246af871e117512e1b6d914","title":"watford v tottenham hotspur premier league live","story":"Half-time entertainment. Liverpool v Manchester United isn’t the only super showdown tomorrow. Here’s Suzanne Wrack on Chelsea’s must-win trip to Arsenal in the WSL.It’ll be better in the second half. It has to be.45 min +1: In the first of two added minutes, there’s a bit of space for Sarr down the right. The ball drops towards Chalobah. Aurier flicks a header clear just in time.44 min: So having said that, the game goes totally flat. Half-time, please!42 min: Chalobah, to the right of the D, dinks a diagonal ball into the box. Deeney guides a header towards the top left, but Gazzaniga is all over it. The game is finally opening up. A shame the half-time whistle is coming soon.40 min: Spurs nearly score a spectacular goal. Vertonghen, in the centre circle, creams a glorious long pass towards Son, cutting in from the left. Son meets the dropping ball with a screaming volley, sending the ball over the crossbar from the edge of the box. That would have instantly become Tottenham’s second greatest goal at Vicarage Road.38 min: Spurs break quickly upfield. Alli slips a pass down the inside-right channel for Moura, who strides into the box and tries to slip a shot under Foster. But the keeper makes himself big, and blocks brilliantly, the ball pinging away from danger. The clearest chance of the game so far.37 min: A throw for Watford on the right. Mariappa flings it long. Deeney flicks it on. Lo Celso hacks the dropping ball clear.35 min: This is a booking, though. Capoue slides in cynically on Lo Celso, who was threatening to break. He’d probably not have made that tackle had he been censured for the challenge on Tanganga earlier, but here we are.34 min: Aurier clips Deulofeu as the Watford man scampers down the left. The free kick is a waste of everyone’s time. Aurier wants to watch himself, that’s another slightly rash tackle. But again he escapes a booking.32 min: A first spell of serious pressure from Watford. Capoue crosses from the right. Deeney nearly flicks home. Deulofeu sees a shot from a tight angle on the left deflected into the side netting. Capoue flings in another cross, and Gazzaniga is forced to claw out from under the bar. That’s got the crowd going, on matters that have nothing to do with video refereeing this time.30 min: We’re off again at last. Son and Alli combine down the inside left, the former sending a shot towards the bottom left that’s easily claimed by Foster.29 min: We’ll play on? Scrub that. Referee Michael Oliver has to stop play because the batteries on his walkie-talkie and earpiece combo have run out, and he’s forced to get a new set. While we wait, the crowd burst into a chorus of the popular English folk standard Fuck VAR. Modern football in a nutshell, right there.27 min: Capoue sticks out a boot to contest a 50-50 with Tanganga. He wins the ball, but also catches the Spurs defender on his knee with the follow-through. Spurs aren’t happy, but VAR isn’t interested. We’ll play on.26 min: Son and Alli nearly open Watford up down the left with a cute one-two, but Mariappa is wise to their game and intercepts just in time.24 min: Another punt down the Watford right. Sarr brings it down, with Alderweireld and Vertonghen both looking a little concerned on the edge of their box. Sarr threatens to spin away again, but he’s flagged for bringing the ball down with his arm. Spurs don’t look particularly happy under the long ball.22 min: Aurier sweeps into the box from the right, latching onto a Lo Celso pass, and harmlessly prods wide of goal. A decent chance made to look more difficult than it was. Aurier is getting a bit of joy down this flank.20 min: A long ball down the Watford right. Tanganga misjudges a header, allowing Sarr to spin off. Tanganga drags him down, and that’s an obvious booking and a free kick, just to the right of the box. Danger for Spurs here. Watford load the box. But with options in the middle, Chalobah tries to whip a cute one into the top right, and blooters it wildly into the stand. The dugout fills with steam, freshly pumped from the ears of Nigel Pearson, who also uses words such as eff and cee with much passion. That’ll be mentioned in the half-time team-talk, you can be sure of it.18 min: Doucoure robs Winks on the left and romps down the wing. He pulls back for Sarr, who is in acres on the penalty spot. But the young striker doesn’t want to hit the ball with his left peg, so takes a touch to shift it onto his other foot and hoicks it over the bar, having made a good chance a damn sight more difficult. Still, that’s better from Watford, who have finally shown something in attack.16 min: Watford have barely ventured into Tottenham’s final third. It’s the away fans making the most noise at the moment.15 min: A lovely sweeping Spurs move, as Lo Celso, Moura and Son exchange crisp passes at high speed down the middle. It’s not quite enough to open Watford up, but very pleasing on the eye nonetheless.13 min: Aurier works space to cross down the right. But instead of crossing he starts lolloping around, turns tail, then loses control of the ball and launches into a wild tackle on Cathcart. Free kick, and he’s slightly fortunate to escape a booking, because he introduced a stud or two into that lunge. He’s never boring, you have to give him that.11 min: Son crosses long from the left. Aurier, from the other flank, sends it back into the box. Cathcart does extremely well to eyebrow away from danger with Moura lurking. Then Tanganga is afforded space for a shot, which he whistles towards the bottom left. Foster gathers. Watford need to wake up, because they’re asking for trouble with these passive tactics.9 min: Watford seem happy to sit back at the moment, seeing what Spurs have got. They’re holding their shape well enough, but the away side are on top at the minute.7 min: Lo Celso feeds Aurier down the right, and the wing-back wins the first corner of the game. Lamela takes, and Foster punches miles clear with purpose. But Spurs come straight back at Watford, Lamela taking a speculative look from 25 yards. He flies right to left before dragging a low shot wide right of the target. Spurs look lively.5 min: Watford haven’t seen much of the ball yet, though they’re flying into a few tackles in a very businesslike manner. Nigel Pearson will be happy enough with that.3 min: Son whips a shot towards the bottom left from 20 yards. Foster gathers. On the touchline, some breaking news: Jose has a face on. He’s not happy, wondering why VAR didn’t take a proper look at the Cathcart handball and award his men a penalty.2 min: Spurs enjoy some early possession, and stroke it around nicely. Son threatens to break clear down the left, not once but twice. The ball breaks into the Watford box and bounces off Cathcart’s arm, Moura flicking on. But the players were too close together, so no penalty. Deulofeu races off up the other end as Spurs appeal, and lashes a long-distance effort wide right. Let’s hope the game continues in this manner.And we’re off! Watford get the ball rolling, then launch it long. Then lose it, and concede a free kick in the centre circle. A fun-packed first 12 seconds.Here come the teams! The theme from Z Cars blasts from the speakers. Tributes are being paid to legendary Watford manager Graham Taylor, one of the nicest men in the entire history of football having passed away three years ago. The home heroes in yellow and black, Spurs sporting first-choice lilywhite. Nice to see the visitors haven’t defaulted needlessly into their keeping-the-marketing-manager-happy away colours, like so many clubs do these days. Off in a minute!If Nigel Pearson gave a pre-match interview, your hapless MBM correspondent must have missed it. I’ve failed you, dear reader. O can you ever forgive me? If it makes up for it at all, I can report that he looked very chipper as he watched his charges warming up, laughing heartily with his players in a manner that’d make Jurgen Klopp look like Alex Ferguson in hairdryer mode. A happy ship at the moment, Watford. On the other hand, here’s Mike T: “Seems to me Spurs fans are ided. Some are gleeful at watching football in a spaceship shopping mall applauding Mr Levy’s zero net spend. And the rest, livid that we don’t win anything. Either way can anyone say they are excited at this starting 11 compared to a few years ago?”Jose Mourinho, slightly flat, not exactly exuding sunshine this morning, speaks to BT Sport. “If I focus on the Leicester, Liverpool and Middlesbrough matches, I have to be happy with what the boys did. So let’s hope that we can follow that direction, because we were intense, we played well, we were organised. Defensively we didn’t have big problems, we created a lot of chances, we played very nice quality football. We probably didn’t score enough goals for what we did, but let’s see if we can follow. We don’t have the striking power, the number-nine target we used to play with, so we have to try to play in a different way.”Watford are in if-it-ain’t-broke mode. No changes to the side that trounced Bournemouth 3-0 at their own gaff.Four changes for Spurs, though, from the XI named against Boro midweek. Eric Dier, Ryan Sessegnon, Davison Sanchez and Inter’s Christian Eriksen drop to the bench Serge Aurier, Toby Alderweireld, Dele Alli and Son Heung-min step up.Watford have only beaten Tottenham Hotspur twice in the last 32 years. And one of those victories was a futile one-goal win after a 6-3 first-leg larruping in the League Cup. Oh Watford!But all is not lost. The other win came in this fixture last season, Troy Deeney and Craig Cathcart scoring the goals in a 2-1 win. And there’s more good news for the Hornets at this, the more recent end of our historical sample.Watford also outplayed Spurs at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium back in October. They felt a little hard done by to come away with only a 1-1 draw, having created plenty of chances only to be pegged back late in the day by Dele Alli. Additionally, they’re in by far the better form right now. Spurs have only won one of their last five Premier League games, losing three Watford by contrast are on a success bender under new boss Nigel Pearson, having picked up 13 points from the last 15 on offer.Spurs did have a confidence-boosting win in the cup over Middlesbrough during the week. And on another day they could have turned their home loss against leaders Liverpool into a draw or even a precious victory. So you can make a case for both sides going into this match with hope ... and another argument for them kicking off in trepidation. But this is why we play the actual matches rather than just yakking on about them. Can Watford continue their steady climb out of bother? Or will Spurs reignite their top-four hopes with a much-needed win? We’ll find out as we eat our lunch. It’s on!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e0f1cdff0addcc3446b5f5406c3e2a4c60b96ada/94_107_3125_1875/master/3125.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=46797d2cd8b932d13967f89841708250","title":"meghan gets more than twice as many negative headlines as positive","story":" analysis appears to support claim Duchess of Sussex receives more critical treatment than Duchess of CambridgeThe Duchess of Sussex gets more than twice as many negative headlines as positive ones, according to  analysis of articles published between May 2018 and mid January 2019.The main analysis is based on articles which appeared in the news and comment sections of 14 UK print editions where the accompanying headline included the terms “Meghan”, “Meg” or “Sussex” between 18 May 2018 - the day before the Sussex’s wedding - and 14 January 2020 and were sourced from ClipShare.Articles were categorised by three iniduals as “positive”, “negative” or “neutral” depending on the tone of the headline and article the phrasing of the story.An equivalent search covering the same time period was carried out to capture headlines which included the terms “Kate”, “Catherine” or “Cambridge”.The findings come as the couple plan their exit from the “senior” ranks of British royalty. Claims that their period of transition is soon to begin, backed by reports on Friday that staff at their Frogmore Cottage home were being reallocated.A month-by-month breakdown shows that Meghan did receive more positive press than negative in May 2018 – the month she married Prince Harry – and in the month following.However, her honeymoon period in terms of press coverage was short lived: by July of the same year the proportion of articles that painted her in a negative light outstripped the positive.Negative spikes occurred on several occasions, particularly around the couple’s desire for privacy, especially their decision to keep details about their child’s birth and baptism private. This is when the couple were accused of wanting to have their “cake and eat it too”.A number of articles quoted sources claiming that Meghan was a “boastful”, “self-obsessed” celebrity who craved media attention, an accusation which intensified when she guest-edited an edition of British Vogue in September last year.A number of the pieces associate Meghan and her family with drugs and violence. These include articles that make claims about her nephew’s involvement with drugs, as well as claims that guests were given “party bags” of cannabis at Meghan’s first wedding. Past coverage of her family has associated Meghan’s birthplace, and mother’s home town, with gang violence.Other intense periods of negative press coverage included articles about the couple’s use of private jets and the duchess’s relationship with her father. The media returned to this topic time and again over the period covered by the analysis. Articles about her relationship with her father accounted for almost one third of the negative articles about the duchess.

The people who have done it talk emotions, legal hurdles – and WhatsApp birthing groupsIn a flat in north-east London, Abi is cradling her best friend’s baby. At 15 weeks old, the little boy is smiling up at her, testing out his first sounds. His mother, Rachel, prepares his bottle while Abi rocks him, showing all the love she would to any of her friends’ children. The only difference is that Abi gave birth to him.Abi and Rachel, both 35, met on their first day at university in Birmingham in 2003 and rarely left one another’s side. At 16, Rachel had been diagnosed with MRKH, a congenital condition meaning her uterus was undeveloped. Although she produced eggs, she would never be able to carry children, something she kept to herself. “I’d tell people I didn’t want kids but deep down I was insanely jealous,” says Rachel, who works as an events producer in London. “I wanted them so badly but assumed I’d never have my own, so I learned to live with it.” After meeting her boyfriend, Sam, at a warehouse party on the eve of 2014, she avoided the “family” chat for two years before confiding in him. “We continued our relationship knowing kids may or may not happen,” she says.A weekend stay at Abi’s home, in November 2017, bringing together five friends, their partners and kids, presented an opportunity to open up to them, too. Abi, a mother to three boys, remembers: “My partner, Rich, was cooking a curry, the kids were asleep and we were sitting around the kitchen table. Everyone spilled something personal. When Rachel told us about her condition, I knew, in my gut, that I would help her to have a child.”Rachel and Sam had explored IVF, surrogacy and adoption, but had dismissed using agencies, which can be vastly oversubscribed, with waits of up to two years to find a match. “It felt too impersonal too life-changing somehow,” she says. Her younger sister had yet to start her own family had she already had children, Rachel might have asked her to be a surrogate. Abi and Rich, meanwhile, “spent Christmas contemplating what being a surrogate would mean for everyone. We had been so lucky, yet one of the people I love most hadn’t,” she says. “I hate this phrase but it was a no-brainer.”She called Rachel in the new year and told her to sit down before offering to carry her baby. Rachel remembers: “She said it would be like ‘babysitting’ our embryo and that term stuck. She’d made up her mind, and that blew me away. I hadn’t told my friends expecting one of them to be the answer. When Abi offered, it felt, for the first time, as if having a child was a very real possibility.”Surrogacy is a delicate arrangement with high stakes. Pregnancy and childbirth can be gruelling, and present health risks, while the unknown territory of handing over a baby you have carried – or parenting the child you have not – presents added fears over bonding or changes of heart, albeit rare.When there is an existing friendship at the arrangement’s heart, the stakes can feel higher still, for both the surrogate carrying a longed-for child and parents asking such as sacrifice of someone they care for, typically with a family themselves to consider. (Medics and lawyers advise against surrogacy until women have completed their own families, citing concerns about reproductive health and fears that it would be harder for them to give up the baby.) Not surprisingly, the friendships that underpin these arrangements are life-changing.Abi, Rachel and Sam embarked on medical appointments at a London fertility clinic. The friends were invited for counselling and asked to consider everything from how they would feel if Abi backed out, to how she would feel if she gave birth to a girl, after three sons. They set up a WhatsApp group. “We left Rich off that,” Abi says. “I’ll talk about body parts and womb washing till the cows come home but he saw his role as keeping things normal – remaining practical and pragmatic in a hyper-emotional situation.” They told their families, including Abi’s boys – four, three and nine months at the time. “We always talked about ‘Rachel and Sam’s baby’. We said, ‘Rachel’s womb doesn’t work but Mummy’s does, so we’re going to look after a baby for them.’” After initially being refused any NHS fertility treatment that would lead to surrogacy, Rachel successfully lobbied her local commissioning group for a single round of IVF, in May 2018, allowing her eggs to be extracted for fertilisation by Sam’s sperm, creating a viable embryo. It would later be placed in Abi’s uterus at a private clinic, using money Rachel’s parents had saved for her wedding. “Surrogacy is still seen as something you do if you’ve got money rather than through biological need,” Rachel says.Abi was given oestrogen and progesterone, and the embryo was transferred, via catheter, in a simple, minutes-long procedure, on 2 October. “From that moment, it was out of my control,” Rachel says. “I felt like I was holding my breath.” When Abi took a pregnancy test, at 7am on a Saturday morning nearly a fortnight later, Rachel and Sam were in bed, on the end of the phone. “When she sent through a picture of the positive test, we were in total shock it was extremely emotional. We didn’t know how to get on with our day other than staring at that picture.” They remained in daily contact and Rachel travelled the 150 miles to Abi’s home for midwife appointments and scans, as well as attending antenatal classes, along with Rich. “In hindsight, the distance was a good thing,” Rachel says. “If we were round the corner, I’d have been posting steak through her letterbox.”They had to consider how to announce the pregnancy. Rachel would say: “We’re expecting a baby, but I’m not pregnant. My friend is carrying our baby.” Abi, who works in public engagement at the BBC, recalls: “Everyone’s mouths dropped at work. My mum asked, ‘Why you?’ But they all thought it was amazing.”When it came to maternity leave, Abi was entitled to a year, but took six weeks, while Rachel was entitled to a year’s adoption leave. Outdated surrogacy laws require that Abi’s name is on the birth certificate alongside Sam’s had Abi and Rich been married, he would have been named as the father. They also recognise Abi as the mother until Rachel obtains the court order granting her legal parental status. Seven months on, she is still waiting. “The fact that on paper he’s still not my son is upsetting,” she says, “but I can’t dwell on it. It’s a process, so we treat it that way.”Many surrogacy pairings put an agreement in place. Although not legally binding – it is illegal for solicitors to negotiate one – it helps mitigate against concerns over all aspects of the pregnancy, from supplements to who first holds the baby. Rachel and Abi decided against it. “If Abi had changed her mind on anything, we all would have,” Rachel says.Surrogates can receive reasonable expenses, such as extra food, travel, childcare or housekeeping costs, and Rachel and Sam gave Abi a cash card. “It’s the trickiest part because no expenses can repay her,” Rachel says. “She was militant about not asking for too much, but I wanted her to have a meal on us because she had our son with her.” The baby was born on 8 June 2019. Rachel and Sam drove Abi to the hospital and witnessed the birth. “I could hardly believe it was real,” says Rachel, who fainted as he was delivered into her arms. The couple spent the first two nights after his birth in hospital, down the corridor from Abi.“Rich was working late and arrived to find us all in the room together and the baby just minutes old,” Abi says. “He stayed for the placenta delivery, had some tea and toast and went home to be there for our boys in the morning. I don’t think the scale of what we’ve done will hit us for a long time. I’m relieved at how normal it feels when I see the baby. Rachel was so generous with her trust in me.”Rachel adds: “Abi put herself mentally and physically through the most selfless act for me, to make us a family. She gave up a huge part of her life during those months to change ours for ever. I couldn’t handle what I was putting her through at times but she’d always say: ‘You’re not putting me through this, I’ve chosen to do it.’ If I ever asked why, she would say: ‘Well, I can’t think why not.’”As fertility medicine has advanced and different family units evolved, surrogacy has emerged as a more familiar route to parenthood, but demand far outweighs the number of women willing or able to volunteer, and the British legal system is playing catchup. London-based family lawyer Joanna Kay, who has advised on surrogacy for more than a decade, says: “The landscape of what a family looks like has changed beyond recognition, but the laws are from the mid-80s. Without a court order, intended parents can’t make decisions about their child’s medical care or education there can be problems with passports and inheritance. I don’t think anyone would argue against the need for reform. “In most cases, everyone knows what they’re signing up for and is happy to honour their agreement. On rare occasions things go wrong and the courts are asked to intervene. There have been a handful of cases where the surrogate didn’t want to hand over the baby or the intended parent didn’t want it.”Other relationships between parents and surrogates have been deep and enduring. Kim Cotton, who became Britain’s first surrogate in 1985, went on to help her friend Linda, who was unable to carry children because of complications associated with a miscarriage Cotton gave birth to twins in 1991. “The family moved to New Zealand when the twins were teenagers but I still track their lives, mostly through Facebook now,” says Cotton, who is 63, and the founder of the Cots surrogacy agency. “Christmases and birthdays are still special and the twins and I always send messages to mark them. My friendship with Linda remains the kind where you are for ever aware of that person and can pick up with them anytime, even if you don’t speak often.”Yet even longed-for pregnancies don’t always run smoothly. After Laura was made infertile five years ago, at 28, by treatment for stage two cervical cancer, her best friend Kerrie represented her only hope of becoming a biological mother. Last year, Kerrie offered to carry Laura’s fertilised eggs, frozen before she began intensive chemo and radiotherapy five years ago.They had been friends since childhood and shared everything, Laura says, over a cup of tea at Kerrie’s home in Lancashire. “Relationships, breakups, marriages, my illness she cries with me and laughs with me,” she says.In 2014, Laura, a nursery manager, and her now-husband Grant were about to start IVF for problems unconnected to her own fertility when a routine smear test detected cancerous cells. “They talked about a hysterectomy,” she remembers. “Knowing my illness would take away my chance of having children was what broke me, not the cancer.” By this point in the story, both women are in tears. “As we left the hospital, I told Grant to leave me,” Laura adds. He didn’t. And while a hysterectomy was ruled out, Laura spent Christmas and New Year’s Eve undergoing treatment, with Kerrie by her side. She had delayed it by one month, so her eggs could be extracted and later used to try for a child via surrogate.In April 2015, a scan revealed the tumour had gone. When Grant and Laura married in Cyprus in 2016, Kerrie was a bridesmaid. “When I was ill, a few friends had offered to be a surrogate,” Laura says. “And when we finally came round to thinking about it, two years ago, it was Grant who said: ‘It has to be Kerrie.’”Kerrie, 33 and a hairdresser, had a similar conversation with her husband, Danny. “At the clinic, he told us he knew when Laura became ill that I would do it one day. I’d had two good pregnancies and it would only be nine months of my life to improve hers for ever. I focused on seeing them with a child.”Although it was NHS-funded IVF that had led to the discovery of Laura’s cancer, when surrogacy became her only option, the funding was withdrawn. “I didn’t let it go without a fight,” she says. “Ultimately they were taking it away because I had cancer. The NHS saved my life to then dictate that life isn’t fair.”In the end Laura’s family paid for her treatment. “They would have helped me with a house deposit but I said, no, give me a baby, please.” The surrogacy was delayed when Kerrie unexpectedly became pregnant with her third child in 2018, but in October 2019 Laura’s eggs were thawed. Eight had been fertilised – but only one looked viable for transfer and pregnancy. It was placed in Kerrie’s womb on 7 October. The women held hands as they sat on the clinic’s bed. “When they told us there was only one chance, I couldn’t look at Laura,” Kerrie says. “She can read my thoughts. I wanted to stay positive for her but the pressure was huge.”On 23 October, two clear lines showed on the pregnancy stick, but Kerrie tested and retested, with Laura by her side, to be sure. Both women were ecstatic. However, on 1 November Kerrie started bleeding. A miscarriage, at five weeks, was confirmed two days later at hospital.“It hit me like a ton of bricks,” Kerrie says. “I’d been carrying her most treasured possession. We were numb. We drove home in silence. My priority was being strong for her but I was broken. We went from speaking all day, every day, to nothing for 48 hours. I’d type a message asking, ‘Are you OK?’ then delete it. When we eventually sat down together, we cried our hearts out. I felt responsible but I knew I’d done everything I could.”Laura is still coming to terms with her grief. “I was uncontrollable, heartbroken. We each had our own grieving to do it wasn’t that we didn’t want to speak, we just didn’t have the words and didn’t want to add to each other’s pain.”Kerrie has offered to be a surrogate again, with a donor egg, but Laura says she couldn’t put her friend through it. She has also thought about adoption but needs time to heal before giving it serious consideration.“I don’t think anybody realises how difficult the process is,” she says. “Kerrie gave me my only chance of being a biological mum. I didn’t know I could love her any more than I already did.”In Kent, Kevin, 45, a chief marketing officer, and Spencer, 30, a solicitor, are getting their six-month-old son ready for bed when the other half of “Sawyer’s birthing squad” (the name they gave their pregnancy WhatsApp group) arrives: surrogate Leanne, 36, and her sister Rachael, 33, Sawyer’s egg donor. “There’s not many teams like us out there,” says Leanne, grabbing a bedtime cuddle.Spencer and Kevin have been together 10 years and married in 2015. “I told Kevin on our first date that I needed to be a dad,” Spencer says. “The biological connection was important to us. We wanted to be involved from the start.” They explored agencies but the networking aspect turned them off. “It was like speed dating. There were more couples than surrogates. It felt hard to be your true self.” They spoke to relatives and asked close friends but none provided an obvious solution. So, despite reservations, they turned to an agency and invested five months getting to know a potential surrogate, only to be let down by an early morning text weeks before treatment was due to start.The one thing they did have was an egg donor. (Medics typically discourage having the same woman perform both functions, to offset concerns around the possibility of bonding too strongly with the baby.) Spencer and Rachael, a credit controller, had become friends two years earlier after meeting on an IVF forum on Facebook. Rachael, then pregnant with her third child, was exploring egg donation, and Spencer wanted to know more about surrogacy. They lived nearby and began meeting up, forming a close friendship that involved weekends together, takeaways, dinners and days out. Spencer and Kevin became unofficial uncles to Rachael’s youngest son and joined in family celebrations, which is how they grew close to Leanne, a mental health support worker who had three sons of her own.Leanne remembers: “Kevin and Spencer were lovely, and I’d seen how close they all were and how badly the boys wanted to be parents. When Rachael told me their surrogate had let them down, I instinctively offered.”The group drew up a 12-page “intention agreement”, detailing expenses, medical tests, pregnancy supplements and protection – including life and critical illness insurance – for Leanne’s children in the event that anything went wrong. Kevin and Spencer spent £25,000: £6,000 for the cost of Rachael’s egg donation £6,500 on medical appointments, screening tests (for all four), medication and scans £2,500 to transfer their embryo to Leanne’s womb and £10,000 on surrogate expenses. On pregnancy test day, they sat around Leanne’s kitchen table together, dipping the stick in a cup she’d wee’d in.“This was the next best thing to carrying the baby ourselves,” Spencer says. “We were so involved. Friendship-first gave us trust and openness.” The expectant dads attended scans, sent hampers each trimester – the first contained ginger biscuits and tea for morning sickness – and downloaded an app that allowed them to read bedtime stories for Leanne to play to her belly. When her waters broke three months early, at 28 weeks, the responsibility weighed heavily for all. Leanne says, “You don’t want to let anything go wrong. Decisions about what happened next were theirs to make. I felt guilty.” The men felt responsible, too. “Leanne has three children she had to go home perfect at the end of this,” Spencer says.Leanne was monitored as an outpatient until labour started a month later. When Sawyer arrived, at 2.36am on 6 April, eight weeks premature and weighing 5lb, all four were in the room, Rachael as birthing partner. Sawyer spent 16 days in neonatal intensive care. His fathers stayed by his side but the now familiar outdated legalities meant Leanne had to return for his discharge.Even once they have left hospital, it is common for surrogates to be contacted by health professionals seeking consent for newborn checks, despite parents being present. Kevin remembers: “Before the birth, our consultant emailed ahead to enforce our right to be there. Some nurses called Leanne ‘Mum’ which none of us wanted. It felt antiquated. I think it’s sexuality and gender more than surrogacy. It took us being by his side for 16 days to prove ourselves, and it shouldn’t be that way.”After the birth, Leanne was flooded with emotion: “Your body doesn’t know you’re a surrogate he was premature and my natural instinct was to know he was all right. I talked a lot with Rachael to be sure what I was feeling was OK. The openness and honesty between me and the boys was vital. Once home, I was back to being Leanne again.”She expressed and froze milk for Sawyer for two weeks before returning to work. Going home from hospital, Kevin and Spencer stopped at her house, “to give her boys the first cuddle,” Spencer says. “They’d been through a lot, too.”When the friends share their story with others, it is the egg donation that tends to generate the most interest, Kevin says, but for Rachael it represented nothing more than a tiny piece of DNA. “It’s that black and white for me,” she says. “My own children are the ones I’ve created with my husband. The way Kevin and Spencer look at Sawyer is the exact reason I wanted to do this.”They see each other often and last month shared a Christmas outing and an early New Year’s Eve celebration before Sawyer’s bedtime. “I want our son to know who the two most incredible women on the planet are,” Kevin says. “They’ll for ever have that bond with him. The more love he has, the better.”Back in north-east London, Rachel and Abi echo the sentiment. As the baby goes down for his nap, the friends leaf through a photo book of their pregnancy, created for their children. “I can’t wait for my son to know how many people brought him into the world,” Rachel says. “It’s the biggest act of kindness imaginable I can never thank her enough.”Abi smiles. “But you don’t need to thank me,” she says, “because it just feels entirely normal. We were going to be friends for the rest of our lives anyway it’s just cemented our bond.” • If you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine’s letters page, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/526c428bfbf5e764881f83a066d4c429cb85b2e1/0_0_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9fd770df4812b4a412648d3c4d2300ec","title":"blind date alex charlotte","story":"What were you hoping for?Someone to go dancing in the moonlight with.First impressions?Wow, you’re here before me despite me being 15 minutes early.What did you talk about?The dares she was doing instead of a new year’s resolution, her film review blog, trips to New Orleans.Any awkward moments?Talking about the fact that we had to write a review of our date.Good table manners?Nothing to complain about.Best thing about Charlotte?She was willing to call time straight after dessert, rather than continuing when we didn’t have a connection.

So why are fake poo peddlers finding it harder to raise a smile?I can only blame myself for my parents’ career as unwitting joke shop owners. As a child, I was preoccupied with Monty Python, and longed for a rubber chicken. I had never seen one in real life, but had a sense that it would bring boundless comedic joy.At the time, my parents already ran a retail business, and their search for a chicken led them to Ray Peckett, the owner of the UK’s largest joke and costume wholesalers, Smiffys. As family legend has it, Ray would only sell them one if they promised to open a joke shop. So they did. Three months later, painted a retina-scorching orange, and with an eight-foot, 3D comedy nose and glasses sign on Edinburgh’s Victoria Street, Aha Ha Ha Jokes and Novelties was doing a roaring trade. It is said to have become JK Rowling’s inspiration for Zonko’s joke shop in the Harry Potter series. As a teenager, I spent every weekend and school holiday working there. Manning the till under a mirror ball and a menagerie of inflatable animals, I encountered people from every walk of life. Whoopee cushions, fake turds and things that go bang have egalitarian appeal even the most prudish lady will titter at a wind-up waddling willy. You are never too old for a blue-mouth sweet. I still remember selling two fake bottoms to a man whose breath was more nose-meltingly potent than any can of fart gas.There were a few notable customers, too. Once, Glen Campbell appeared in the doorway, resplendent in full Rhinestone Cowboy get-up. Mum flogged him a twirling bow tie and a stick-on third eye. An Oscar-winning director bought the shop’s entire stock of whoopee cushions, for reasons unknown.Today, the shop has barely changed the fake handcuffs and glow-in-the-dark bone maracas still hang next to the “giant mistake” novelty erasers. The most popular celebrity masks are no longer Margaret Thatcher and Mr Bean, but Donald Trump and superheroes. There’s a fair amount of schoolboy wizard-related items, and a certain 1960s bucktooth gigolo is still popular.People always laugh when I tell them my parents own a joke shop, but it’s a very serious business. The slow strangulation of the high street, the failing pound, Amazon and a generation of people who are happy to shop directly from their phones mean that the past few years have been difficult. After 26 years, my parents have decided to sell up and retire – but hope that the new owner continues to run it as a joke shop.How much do we still need them? In these distinctly unhumorous times, I set out to meet other joke shop owners determined to keep looking on the funny side.Coming into our shop is like going back in time. I display the stock in old boxes from the 1930s, 40s and 50s we don’t carry that stock any more, but people like to look at it and remember. People tell me about coming in when they were kids – it’s just a lovely memory for them. When younger people come in, they ask, “How much is that?” and then find it for £2 cheaper on the internet. I have a little eBay shop, but I do think we’ve been left behind a bit. I just can’t compete online.I like to meet customers and give them a bit of silly patter. Anything I sell, I go into character. If someone buys Elvis glasses, I’ll start talking like Elvis – I can’t help it. My kids find it a bit embarrassing. When we used to go on holiday, my son and I would put in false teeth and wear them out to restaurants. My daughter would be mortified, but you have to have fun. There used to be an old chap who would come in and buy clown noses: he just always wore one, everywhere he went. Even his bus pass had a picture of him wearing one. Back in the day, Tommy Cooper used to come in: he never bought magic tricks, but he did buy props for his show.Making people laugh is good. Grandad Dinsdale opened this shop 90 years ago. I’ve been running it for about 20 years, but I’m not going to celebrate our 90th birthday we’ll just quietly plod on. I always thought it would go on for ever, because kids would always want to spend their pocket money in a joke shop, but the past five years have been very difficult. I keep hearing of other joke shops closing down. All the shops in Hull have gone from the main shopping area – we’ve just lost M\u0026ampS and Boots. It can be demoralising on days when nobody comes in.Uncle George Dinsdale, who took over from Grandad, used to say that coming into the joke shop was like going to the doctor’s. Laughter keeps you healthy. Uncle George is still involved. One day we were chatting on the phone and a man walked in and said, “I bought a magic book off Mr Dinsdale in 1954, and he said if I wanted to bring it back he would give me a refund.” The man said he paid ten shillings, so Uncle George said, “I remember him, go in the till and give him 50p.” Recently, a man came in who had grown up in Hull but moved to Canada. He was with his son and showed him all the magic tricks he used to buy. He was so happy that we were still here after all this time. I was thinking, “Come on, spend a little bit of money.” The magic tricks were £2, but they left without buying anything at all.Mum and Dad had a shell shop about 50 years ago, but they always sold Kiss Me Quick hats and little novelty items. By 1977, they had opened a joke shop in the arcade, and next door they opened a bong shop. We moved both premises into one big shop nine years ago.I don’t think the function of a joke shop has ever changed. People’s sense of humour hasn’t changed. The whoopee cushion was invented 100 years ago and it is still funny. What has changed is fancy dress costumes: young people want to look unique, and there’s some things they just won’t buy, like Native American costumes. There’s been a few things that have been banned. We used to sell this thing you’d poke in a cigarette and it would make the ash “snow”. It said “harmful by inhalation” on the packet, and that got banned quite quickly. I sell a £1.50 retractable knife and I wonder when that will die out – it’s not a funny thing to pretend to plunge a knife into someone.I had cancer a few years ago and I had to let go of our general manager. So now my two adult nephews can do split shifts between the joke shop and the bong shop. I am going to keep the business going as long as possible – the joke shop can’t close on my watch. My nephews are going to take it over, hopefully. I have a daughter, but she’s only eight and I’m not sure what a joke shop will be doing in 10 years’ time.Margate has changed quite a lot recently: it’s got pretty cool, but I don’t think it’s affected our takings. Amazon and eBay are our biggest threat. I love it when people say they’ve bought something from eBay and not realised it will take 16 weeks to ship from China.I always joke that a joke shop is a non-profit organisation. It ebbs and flows. We do have times that are really busy, like Halloween, book week, Easter and New Year’s Eve. It can be stressful, but not as stressful as the seafood bar I used to run. The best bit is when a little kid comes in and spends an hour choosing something for 50p, and the worst days are when I don’t take a bean.We specialise in everything. I have over 3,000 lines of stock. The bestsellers are horrible sweets and fake poos. Anything disgusting, kids love. We have a disgruntled 80s pop star who comes in regularly and buys stink bombs. I think he breaks them in places he doesn’t like. One of my customers came in and said she had to stop buying stuff: she’d given her dad such a fright that he’d jumped up out of his chair and had a stroke. She’d played every prank on him, but in the end it was an electric-shock pen that got him.I read something that said “always know your target audience”, but our audience is everyone of every age. The only people we don’t appeal to are probably young women – I don’t think a clown horn is interesting to them. They buy costumes, but glamorous ones. We used to have a lot of little old ladies come in, then we had a lot of stag and hen dos. But they don’t really come to Blackpool any more it’s a lot more family-oriented now.The town itself is in disarray. There’s not another shop open on our street. We’re not on the promenade, but people still make the effort to come in. We have Chucky painted on the back of the shop and a clown on the side, so a lot of people take photos, too. The council wants to regenerate this area, and they want to buy back our lease. But what they have offered us won’t cover rent for a shop in town. It would be the end of us, and I’m not trained to do anything else.Things move in trends. People used to want to be a witch, but we haven’t sold a witch for 10 years. It was always a witch or a devil costume, then it was zombies and vampires. Halloween is our busiest time it’s also half-term so we get all the schoolkids coming in. We don’t do a stock take. We never started out doing one, so we’ve never done it. If something doesn’t sell, we laugh about it. Joke purchases are very impulsive, and that doesn’t translate to internet shopping. You can’t really sell a shocking pen online. It’s the whole impulse of going into the shop, seeing the shocking pen, laughing about it and thinking, “I’m going to go home and trick someone with this.” You don’t need a shocking pen, but you go home with two. But nothing surprises young people any more – they’ve seen it all on YouTube. It’s a shame, for them.My dad ran a flower shop in 1978, and someone gave him a box of jokes. He put them on the counter and they sold out. We still have the same counter. I’ve got three daughters, and two of them work here with me. I encouraged them to do other things, but they want to work here. There’s never a dull moment. Our motto is: if you can’t take a joke, don’t come in.• If you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine’s letters page, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a08f43291741729a294b5cc42a826685b5f90cb/0_207_3229_1938/master/3229.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=11989b301e567f9655277e30f165bda8","title":"which plants are the best bird feeders","story":"Although I feed song birds with meal worms, suet and seeds, I’ve come to realise that my garden can do the job just as wellI was admiring the glorious orange limbs of my strawberry tree, Arbutus unedo, meandering elegantly and covered in bright red baubles of fruit among glossy green leaves, when I spotted a blackbird, its beak crammed full of a single fruit. I was contemplating preserving this year’s bounty of fruit, but the sight of that happy blackbird was enough to make me realise I didn’t need any more jam in my life. This tree is far more giving to all of us in the garden than I could have conceived when I planted it to obscure my neighbour’s shed.The blackbirds are plucky enough to peck at the fruit, opening it for others to have a go at, and it’s all available when the birds want it rather than when I remember to fill the feeders.Still, there comes a point when the garden’s larder is empty and then it is all about the feeders. I am being ruthlessly selfish here I love to see birds from my kitchen window. The flutter of life on a cold, sunless day is a nature cure for winter blues. It is also essential for the summer garden. If you can ensure there is food year-round you’ll become part of the birds’ territory and they’ll stay around to root for sawfly grubs under your gooseberries, or pick off aphids from your apples in spring. It’s a lesson in reciprocity: show willing now and they’ll return the gesture over and over again.Bird feeders are not the prettiest things if you have squirrels you’ll have to invest in caged ones, and if you have neighbourhood cats you’ll need to site them somewhere the pets can’t sit menacingly below and on a metal pole that’s impossible to climb. If you can’t be doing with all that metal and plastic, make your own from pine cones filled with unsalted peanut butter and then rolled in seed mixes and hung wherever you can.

Instead of the usual pretty-women-meets-handsome-man trope, she wants to see love between able-bodied and disabled characters, mixed-race love and, why not, tall women with short men.It is with much shame that I admit to having been one of those women: the ones who judge the attractiveness of a partner as proportional to his height. My old online dating bio used to carry the tagline “six foot and above only”.It does seem like short kings – the internet’s pet name for short men – are having a moment. Ever since the comedian Jaboukie Young-White coined the term in 2018 (“We are valid. We are strong. We are at a lower risk of heart disease,” he joked on Twitter) there has been more space to talk about short men being desirable. Why not extend this newfound acceptance of short men to the big screen?Now, I know what you’re all thinking – there is such a dearth of ersity on screen, should this really be the hill we die on? But consider this: our obsession over tall men is related to patriarchy.Take the movies in which mixed-height couples do appear. In Shallow Hal, Gwyneth Paltrow (5ft 9in) towers over Jack Black (5ft 6in). The premise of that movie (man gets hypnotized so he doesn’t realize he is dating an overweight woman) tells us something about the rules of attraction in a patriarchal world: a short man can date a tall woman, but only if she is fat (and he is tricked into it).In the Hunger Games, Jennifer Lawrence (5ft 9in) plays Katniss Everdeen, who is taller than her partner, Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson, 5ft 7in). Peeta’s character is soft: he’s a bread-baker who hides from conflict rather than facing it. He can’t compete with Everdeen’s best friend Gale (Liam Hemsworth, 6ft 3in) who hunts and blows things up. At the end of the movie, Gale indirectly kills Katniss’s sister, which should probably be a lesson to us all about toxic masculinity.If the problem with toxic masculinity is that it idolizes men for all those things that pointlessly connote masculinity without equating to it – violence, machismo, confidence – then why not consider height in this equation?People constantly (and wrongly) equate height with masculinity. Men who are taller get promoted more, paid more and are considered better leaders. CEOs have an average height over 6ft.

If I don’t like Greta Gerwig’s film, who even am I?Nora Ephron famously felt bad about her neck. I don’t feel bad about my neck, not yet. Instead, I feel bad about Little Women.The reviews of Greta Gerwig’s film adaptation have been universally adoring. “Superb,” said Empire. “One-hundred-and-fifty-year-old literature never felt so alive,” agreed The Observer. Liking the film is now considered as much a part of being a thoughtful modern woman as supporting Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Because this movie isn’t just good, people wrote with urgency on social media – it’s important. It’s about women and creativity and it stars women – four of them! It’s an adaptation of one of the greatest women’s novels, done by Gerwig, who, like Phoebe Waller-Bridge, was decreed by The Council of General Consensus to be An Excellent Thing. As Marmee says in the book, “I never can wish you a greater happiness than this!”So I went to the cinema, as excited as if I were going on a Tinder date with Prince Charming. Hell, the algorithm guaranteed a happy ending. Louisa May Alcott’s novel was one of my favourites as a child, and like every bookish girl (what other kind reads Little Women?), I over-empathised with Jo March, the tomboy who dreams of being a writer. Also, I hugely enjoyed Lady Bird, Gerwig’s previous movie with Saoirse Ronan, who plays Jo in this version. So this film could not be more up my boulevard if it was my actual house and I lived in it.But to paraphrase another 19th-century novel much-loved by women, Reader, I did not love Little Women. Despite all the excitement, it looks as twee as the many other previous adaptations, while being more safe in the way it plays to the gallery. At the risk of being a Little Woman hipster (although all those homespun dresses they wear are quite hipster), every time someone coos over Ronan’s interpretation of Jo as an independent spirit, I can hear Katharine Hepburn, who played Jo in the 1933 version, hacking off her own hair in disgust.Much has been made of the way Gerwig has blended Alcott’s biography into the novel, ending the film with Jo publishing Little Women. This allows the director to fudge the storyline even more than she does by making Prof Bhaer, who Jo ends up marrying, a young and dishy Frenchman – as opposed to the old and ugly German he is in the book. This might be more satisfying for Jo fans, but it sands down Jo’s oddness. If Gerwig were going to change something about Bhaer, I wish she’d changed how Jo falls for him when he says her stories are rubbish. (It is amazing how many novels feature a woman getting turned on by a man telling her off, from Emma to Jane Eyre to Fifty Shades. As messages go, I’d like this to go in the bin, alongside girls being told that, when a boy pulls their hair, it means he likes them.)The novel ends with Jo and her husband opening a boys’ school, which doesn’t have quite the same feminist, inidualist punch as publishing one’s own book. But imposing modern attitudes on canonical characters in the belief they must be relatable is just lazy. This happens a lot with the Bennet sisters in Pride And Prejudice, and here with the March sisters. A good literary adaptation brings us to the characters, not the other way round in Emma Thompson’s Sense And Sensibility, Thompson and Kate Winslet don’t wang on about “the marriage economy”, as Gerwig’s Little Women do. Instead, we see how we would have thought in the 19th century. Because it’s one thing to fantasise that we are Jo, and quite another to fantasise that Jo is us. This tendency to overrelate to any fictional character, whether it’s Jo or Fleabag, is less about art and more about narcissism. We don’t have to make everything about ourselves.I am an enthusiast, and being cynical when everyone else is cheering is territory as unknown to me as the moon. If I don’t like Gerwig’s Little Women, who even am I for heaven’s sake? As I left the cinema, I was reminded of a time when a bunch of friends fixed me up with someone they knew I’d love. He was a book editor! And Jewish! But I rejected him, and they despaired – what more could I want? Sometimes ideas you love in theory crash on the rocks of reality.And sometimes they’re just overfamiliar. The trailers before Little Women were for the upcoming films of Emma and The Secret Garden. But there are many other great books about women – Toni Morrison’s The Bluest Eye, Zadie Smith’s On Beauty – that are less cosy, less white and have not been turned into a film a thousand times before. As the March sisters say, when bemoaning their poverty in the book: no one likes to see the same old dresses again and again.I didn’t marry the Jewish book editor – instead, I went off and had a fling with someone who was neither of those things. Similarly, I didn’t love Little Women, but instead fell for the next film I saw, Uncut Gems, an Adam Sandler thriller, of all unlikely genres. We don’t always want the dishy young French guy. Sometimes we surprise ourselves and prefer the ugly old German."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5b5b5a1a36ddbbc7bca5662f303eedcb2d77515/15_321_2293_1376/master/2293.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=219bc31347ac3f8ec6cbf42da4041bde","title":"pedal power behind the scenes at bristols temple cycles in pictures","story":"Temple Cycles is an independent firm inspired by Britain’s long tradition of bicycle manufacture, which has blossomed from a one-man startup into a thriving business in the space of six years.Mears’ mission is to create sustainable products that will last a lifetime.

And Kings Place takes on the entire universe, with a little help from Brian CoxEach encounter with Puccini’s La bohème – assuming the performance is up to scratch, which the Royal Opera’s latest revival is – makes you rethink the elements that make this work a masterpiece: time-proof and foolproof, as a blunt critic early last century put it, bemoaning the grandmotherly Mimìs, screeching Musettas and overweight Rodolfos he’d endured over the years (he’d have to watch his adjectives today). The plot jumps awkwardly between its four “tableaux” acts. Aspects of the story don’t quite make sense. Yet Puccini spins his material into a perfect mesh of mirth and tears. His theatrical instinct is faultless, and no other composer teases out strands of melody so apparently effortlessly and rhapsodically.In the case of Bohème this means, famously, from first encounter to full-blown love in a matter of minutes for the seamstress Mimì and the poet Rodolfo. Their big Act 1 duet, O soave fanciulla, is a reliable test, early on, of the evening’s emotional temperature. The Romanian-born British soprano Simona Mihai (a late replacement, who sang the role for the ROH last year and plays Musetta later in the run) and the American tenor Charles Castronovo scored highly, with the conductor, Emmanuel Villaume, pacing this slowly unfurling music with well-judged control. In this score, the woodwind weaves and soars, now buried in the texture (the exuberant oboe tune is near the start), now singing its own melody, so often voiced by solo clarinet. Though the ROH players must know this music inside out, it sounded fresh and alive.The bustling opening between the four young bohemians was slightly chaotic in this return (the second) of Richard Jones’s 2017 production, but singing was strong: Andrzej Filończyk (Marcello), Peter Kellner (Colline), Gyula Nagy (Schaunard) were zestful students, the veteran Jeremy White lovable and tiresome as the landlord, Benoît. Aida Garifullina, saucy and sexy as Musetta, knows exactly how to hold the stage without stealing the show. Gradually this production is putting down roots. This was never going to happen instantly, given that the ROH’s previous old oak of a production had run for 41 years. Yet Jones’s production, too, has its charms, in the handsome if stiff embrace of Stewart Laing’s designs, with its magnificent Parisian arcades, Cafe Momus, and bewitching falling snow. See the show live in cinemas on 29 January.Weather is one of many aspects that come under the heading Nature Unwrapped, the new series at Kings Place, which began last weekend. These year-long projects (Venus Unwrapped – focusing on female composers – has just ended) offer a form of integrated programming that other venues might achieve for a weekend or a short festival but, on the whole, are not mad or brave enough to attempt for an entire season. Somehow Kings Place succeeds, mixing musical genres, film and spoken word as if concert life had always been this way. Whether you want poetry, folk or Monteverdi, it’s here. An artist in residence, the sound recordist and composer Chris Watson, will provide an aural calendar of the natural world, which started with winter on the Wash. Hearing, as you enter this auditorium in London’s King’s Cross, the teeming cries of wading birds and wildfowl in north-west Norfolk, could grow addictive.On Tuesday, continuing Nature Unwrapped, the violinist Jack Liebeck “and friends” – an elite ensemble of five string players and harpsichordist – were joined by Brian Cox, physicist and media star. In between a crisp, rhythmically taut performance of Vivaldi’s Four Seasons, Cox explained – brilliantly and fluently if not entirely comprehensibly – the theory of relativity, the evolution of the universe, cosmology, quantum entanglement: the lot.

In contrast, Jess Phillips was more blunt in her criticism: she talked about how the broadband policy got laughed at on the doorstep, and how there wasn’t enough emphasis on crime in it. It feels like Phillips is shaping up to be the only candidate who is really trying to create some significant ideological distance between herself and Labour’s 2019 policy platform.Long-Bailey championed the “green industrial revolution, the biggest economic lever we have seen in a generation whether tidal power in Merseyside, solar panels on the top of schools and homes.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d675423d5d1f73c0bac3bb0e13517dc623afae2/516_307_1464_878/master/1464.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fe70798d9a7fa4bd62c676d9c1c98f56","title":"happy fleet could electric vehicles enhance the joy of driving","story":"EVs mean cleaner cities, but could they improve the experience for drivers too? One ground-breaking partnership piloted by Audi and Addison Lee Group uncovered some surprising benefits to going electricFor companies that rely on fleet vehicles, change is inevitable. A raft of green policies have introduced zero-emissions targets, along with financial incentives encouraging businesses to adopt cleaner cars and vans, such as no vehicle tax for electric company cars in 202021.However, as well as helping the planet and improving a company’s bottom line, the “greening” of vehicle fleets by going fully electric could bring additional benefits. A recent widely reported study found that jumping behind the wheel of an electric car – rather than a traditional petrol or diesel – could also make drivers happier, calmer and less stressed too.Those findings are backed up by Audi’s own research, which found that electric vehicle drivers typically get more pleasure from the experience. According to a combination of 1,350 surveys and 2,000 minutes of interviews, the benefits include a reduction in vibration and engine noise, which can leave drivers feeling less drained after spending time in traffic. EV drivers also reported being able to perform difficult manoeuvres much more easily, and a greater sense of control. Others felt more at one with the vehicle as a result of all the technology. As one respondent put it: “It’s part of me when I drive. It has so much tech involved in it.”That Audi research is now being put to the test as part of a forward-thinking pilot partnership with the Addison Lee Group’s business class car service, Tristar.Addison Lee Group has added five new luxury e-tron SUVs, Audi’s first fully electric cars, with a range of up to 237 miles, to its premium London lineup. The aim is to offer chauffeurs, customers, and both businesses a unique opportunity to understand the real-world performance, opportunities and challenges of going fully electric to achieve a zero-emissions future.The Addison Lee Group chauffeurs underwent simple training with Audi’s electric vehicle specialists before going out to work as usual, driving premium customers around the capital.The ongoing trial enables Addison Lee Group and Audi to see how the cars perform in a real-world, business-critical situation – where running out of battery is not an option. That includes collecting hard data on mileage and usage from the car’s telemetrics, along with the driver’s subjective feedback on the challenges of adopting electric in real-world conditions, including things such as the availability of charging.The proof, though, is in the driving. So what did Addison Lee Group’s trialists make of the experience behind the wheel?“From the beginning I said that I was going to drive it the same way I would a diesel car and that’s what I’ve done,” says Alan Meere, a platinum chauffeur for Tristar. “I feel more relaxed when I get home because I haven’t spent the day fighting the steering wheel. There’s also no droning constantly in your ear like you can get with diesel cars, and you notice that especially after a motorway run. You still get the noise of the tyres but even that’s quieter.”According to Meere, who lives in Sittingbourne, Kent and has been driving for the Addison Lee Group for nine years, any potential anxiety about range soon subsided.“When I came into the pilot, my main reservations were things like whether there would be enough chargers,” he says. “Also, would living so far from London make a difference? But once you realise how good the car is, and you start to understand how to fit charging into your daily routine, that all goes away. Many service stations now have these chargers.”“Being able to plug it in and leave it overnight is hugely convenient,” says Meere. “But if I’m not home long enough for work reasons, then there are also options close by where I can charge it quickly, ready for the next day.”According to figures from Zap Map, a listing app that helps you find your nearest charge points, there are more than 10,000 charging locations in the UK. Finding nearby charge isn’t dissimilar to seeking out your closest petrol station – you learn the locations of the points you use most often.“I’ve developed a map in my head of where I can charge,” says Meere. “If I need a speedy charge, there are three places I use regularly – one at Heathrow and two near where I live. On the 150Kw points I can get close to full in 40 minutes,” he adds.This partnership has been so successful that it’s been extended beyond the initial six months. “I believe our collaboration with Addison Lee Group has been invaluable as a means of further demystifying the concept of the fully electric Audi,” says Andrew Doyle, director of Audi UK.“Although the e-tron is revolutionary as far as our brand is concerned, this project has helped to emphasise its uncomplicated, user-friendly normality to everyone who travels in one. On the one hand, it has proved that it requires minimal compromise as a daily-use proposition by meeting the understandably rigorous demands of Addison Lee Group’s professional drivers in an undeniably challenging working environment. On the other, it has driven home the fact that in terms of comfort, configuration and general usability, the car is a home-from-home for anyone familiar with a contemporary Audi.”Paul McCabe, corporate director at Addison Lee Group, says the pilot has helped to inform the group’s decisions about the fleet choices it will make as it works towards its target of having a fleet capable of zero emissions by 2022. “By generating data-driven insights, the e-tron pilot has allowed us to evaluate the real-world performance and requirements of electric vehicles in our fleet of the future,” he says.Although big change is coming, much will stay the same, and that’s a comfort for those who will experience the revolution first hand.“It’s still a car and you still just drive it the same way,” says Meere, “but it’s just more pleasant to drive. If I had the choice, I’d stay with the electric vehicle now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/005664f5d4d6232bcf5bfde2ccabc45e44aa0eac/149_0_4658_2796/master/4658.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4109bc03a6e7125984613cf7cb3a11f7","title":"understated beauty great brands have one big idea that chimes with people","story":"For a brand such as Audi, form really does follow function – which translates into designs that instill a sense of reliability, efficiency and trustIt was the audacious simplicity of it. At last year’s Milan Design Week, a giant ring was suspended inside the courtyard of the city’s Seminario Arcivescovile, a seminary that was built in 1564.Ma Yansong, the founder of MAD Architects, which developed the installation with Audi, explained the thinking behind it: “The illuminated ring in the square boundary of the historical courtyard stands for mankind’s strive for perfection.”The installation, called “Fifth Ring”, was arguably a perfect metaphor for a design aesthetic that has long been associated with the German carmaker. The air of quiet confidence. The understated beauty. Its sheer efficiency.But the aesthetic is also a business ethos rendered into physical form.“Audi are an interesting brand in the way they tapped very deliberately into the whole German design aesthetic of engineering efficiency, rationality and modernity,” says Jeremy Myerson, chair of design at the Helen Hamlyn Centre for Design at the Royal College of Art and founding editor of Design Week. “Those values go back to the Bauhaus roots of good form, everything precisely as it needs to be – and there is still commercial equity in that, as we’ve seen in brands like Apple. The idea is that in a complex world you need simplicity, and that continues to hold its own.”Audi has made a virtue of those principles in its adherence to functionality and to the concept of progress through technology (better known as vorsprung durch technik). It’s a subtle message with a powerful appeal. The beauty of its cars flow from fundamental engineering values that feed into quality and consistency.“Most great brands have one big emotional idea, very simple, very recognisable and it chimes with people,” says Myerson, “You buy an Audi because you’re identifying emotionally in a high quality, technical machine. It instils ideas of reliability and efficiency – trust essentially. And that’s what the best brands are about.”Simplicity should never be mistaken for predictability or dullness. Audi has always been ready to push the envelope, whether it came to the aerodynamics of its iconic 1980s Quattro or the sporty elegance of the TT.“Audi has always been able to be creative within its own defined rules,” says Howard Guy, co-managing director of automotive and aviation consultancy, Design Q. “They were the first manufacturer to start using materials and finishes that play off each other very imaginatively. For instance, the TT dash had a superb grain, a texture and softness which didn’t make it feel like it was a great big injection-moulded piece of plastic like most things at the time. There were little details, a bit of gloss, a bit of brushed aluminium, the way the materials were brought together that was very refreshing and everyone began to copy it. It’s about perception, the way of making something mass market look expensive. It’s clever because it’s about playing with surfaces and colours – things that don’t cost much. It’s the same approach that makes for a great handbag.”Audi’s lesson is one of boldness and confidence in its ability to take materials and technology and synthesise them into something that symbolises progress in an elegantly understated way, whether it be the Audi A8 aluminium Space Frame of the early 1990s or the 1995 TT coupe that has proved so enduring.“The very first TT had the baseball interior with the heavy leather seats with the huge stitching. Nobody had done that before or been bold enough,” says Guy. “They were very sure of their ground.

The tips do not include stopping gambling.Angel Advance’s website also advises customers in difficulty to contact the Samaritans if they are struggling to deal with debt.A list of issues they might be facing includes job-related stress, alcohol or drug abuse and suicidal thoughts. It does not include problem gambling, despite the fact that betting addiction has been linked with elevated rates of suicide.Labour MP Carolyn Harris voiced dismay that the Done family could profit from gambling, counselling for gambling addiction and debt management all at once.“They get paid when you gamble, they get paid when you seek help for it and they get paid when you try to clear your debts,” she said.“It’s about how they can make the most of the vulnerable and squeeze blood out of a stone. It’s characteristic of the mentality of this industry.”Problem gambling has frequently been linked to high debt, including by industry regulator the Gambling Commission, which announced a ban on betting with credit cards earlier this month.Last year, the  reported on the case of a problem gambler who used nine credit cards to spend hundreds of thousands of pounds with online casinos, who she claimed ignored her obvious signs of a spiralling addiction.Debt charity Step Change said people with gambling problems who seek its advice usually have more debts than those who don’t, owing an average of £16,323 to eight creditors.Fresh revelations about the Done family’s interests come a day after the  revealed that brothers Fred and Peter, who are worth a combined £1.25bn and have given £375,000 to the Conservative party, also own Health Assured.The business provides gambling counselling to staff who work at NHS trusts and in parliament, prompting an allegation of “hypocrisy” from NHS mental health chief, Claire Murdoch.Both Harris and SNP MP Ronnie Cowan called on parliament to review its contract with the company.Cowan said: “For the UK parliament to contract them to provide support is beyond the pale.“To compound matters, for Fred Done to invest in a debt management firm after helping to drive so many people into debt beggars belief.“The Dones created the problem, then paid money to support the Tory party and then the Tory government uses taxpayers money to pay them to fix the problem they created. And we wonder why people don’t trust politicians!”“The management and directors of Health Assured and Betfred are also entirely separate and independent of each other,” they added.“What is more, Health Assured has always been open, and provided full disclosure on ownership during tender processes and new contracts won have been secured on merit.”A spokesperson for the House of Commons and the House of Lords said: “UK parliament is bound by strict procurement regulations. Our focus is to ensure high quality services and value for money for the tax payer. All contracts are reviewed regularly.”Marc Etches, chief executive of the leading betting addiction charity GambleAware, added his voice to concern about the Done family’s overlapping business interests.“It is important that anyone who is experiencing gambling harms has access to appropriate support,” he said.“However, this case understandably raises concerns about a potential conflict of interest.”Joanne Whittaker, a director of Angel Advance, said: “The business is authorised and regulated by the FCA, who are aware of the make up of its ownership, and it is run completely independent of Betfred, with an entirely distinct and separate management structure.“Any clients receiving debt advice arising from gambling-related issues would receive appropriate signposting and help in accordance with our approved protocols and procedures.”• Free help and advice about problem gambling is available online at BeGambleAware.org or by calling the National Gambling Helpline on 0808 8020 133"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f34a0efd1b54371f60f0a6fcaf23d8a08bf3fe2/0_0_4894_3256/master/4894.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c100cfca7c5dda7906dfb5d55df7982a 700w","title":"south africa v england third test day three live","story":"44th over: South Africa 113-5 (Nortje 14, de Kock 0) Dom Bess bowls the last four balls of the over he started before rain stopped play. Quinton de Kock defends each and every one, and life goes on.“Two things,” brasstacks Matt Dony. “Firstly, Robert Blanchard has made a colossal, ‘We’re gonna have a bowl’-scale error. If we’re looking at qualification through residency, then omitting the magnificent Tori Amos from his XI is a heinous oversight that might cause me to turn my back on OBOs once and for all. Secondly, we attribute ‘Nature abhors a vacuum’ to Aristotle. Might it have been a mistranslation? Did he actually say, ‘Nature abhors a competent English cricket performance. So enjoy the rain, suckers!’?”You should have heard what Aristotle said about premature banter.The restart has been delayed by a few minutes: 3.30pm local time. 1.30pm in England.“John Mallett, bruising Bath and England prop, was always known as ‘Shep’ at The Rec, which was in turn hacked down from the name of a cider-producing town not so far away,” says Jill Shepherd. “He now terrorises coaches and kids as director of Rugby at Millfield School, also not so far way...”Play will resume at 1.26pm! That’s a helluva turnaround from the groundstaff well played them. If it doesn’t rain again, we’ll have 39.4 overs tonight. And, no, I haven’t a clue why the restart time is 1.26pm rather than 1.25pm.A bit of news from India...“Barbara Castle should definitely be in the Redheads XI,” says Jacqueline. “Wicketkeeper maybe?”Elliot Carr-Barnsley has another suggestion for Dom Bess. “Surely, given Bess’s county side and evident world-class status, must be The Apple Kumble.”When I read that I thought , ‘Ha, that’s nice’. And then a split-second later - if that - a voice in my head screamed, ‘But ‘crumble’ and ‘Kumble’ is only an eye rhyme, it doesn’t work phonetically.’This is what journalism has done to me. This is the person I have become.Thanks for all your nickname suggestions. All the old favourites are there:“What would happen in event of the game being rained off?” asks Manish Ravala. “Would it be a tie or have there been enough overs for possible Duckworth Lewis?”It would be a draw, at least under the old laws. The covers are coming off! You heard. That’s an extremely pleasant surprise, although no time has been set for a resumption.“Not elaborate,” says James Hodgins, “but one of the best nicknames has to be Monde Zondeki, who was nicknamed ‘All Hands’.”Yep, that’s a good one. Although shouldn’t it have been ‘All Hand’? Oh for heaven’s sake, I’ve actually become a nickname pedant. This is a low.It’s raining again. I’d imagine play will be abandoned for the day in the next hour or so. But keep pressing that refresh button, because“Hi Rob,” says Matt Emerson. “Given the professional sportsman’s inclination to add a -y to the end of every surname I presume Dom Bess’s nickname is ‘Aunt’.”On that note, I wonder what’s the most elaborate nickname in sport. Not that ‘Aunt’ is especially elaborate, but it’s two moves from name to nickname rather than the usual one.“I love a long post-tea session,” cackles Gary Naylor. “What a delight it is to see bowlers and captains who slow the game into 25 overs in the mornings and afternoons try to cope with 40 before they can go off. Comeuppance is the mot juste, I believe. If a captain can’t deliver at least 28 overs in two hours in the absence of major delays, they’re not playing it right.”I’m loath to be too critical, especially as most mornings it takes me the best part of an hour to decide which playlist to put on in the office. Will it be Britpop 1993-94 or Britpop 1995-97?“Afternoon Rob,” says Robert Blanchard. “Once again, the OBO and its contributors have been shown up as sexist: all proposals for the ginger cricket team arewere men. Here is my proposal for an all-female team of redheads. I’m sure you will agree it combines leadership, aggression, poise, the ability to keep one’s head, and steady accumulation (scoring 111 is not to be sneezed at). I will brook no argument about their qualifications: Google says they arewere all redheads so it must be true.I can’t believe you omitted Christina Hendricks, daughter of the unsung England seamer Mike, or Six Feet Under Lauren Ambrose, sister of Sir Curtly and Tim.If you need a fix of live sport, we have a few other optionsThis is a bit more promising. The rain has relented and the groundstaff are milling around, trying to decide what to do next.“Surely a Tina Turner- inspired nickname: ‘Simply’?” says Tom Pugh. “Because at the moment, he’s Simply Dom Bess.”You say ‘at the moment’. Does that mean he’ll be Complicatedly Dom Bess in the future?The covers are back on. I suspect they will stay there until tomorrow morning.Thanks Tim, hello everyone. England have already secured a moral victory in this match, but an actual win is far from guaranteed. I’d be surprised if we get any more play today, and the forecast for the rest of the match is mixed. At least England, in the parlance of our time, moved the game along in the 25.2 overs that were possible this morning. They are one wicket away from if not the tail then certainly the rump.The rain has gone from cats and dogs to mere drizzle, so there may be hope. Time for me to hand over to Rob Smyth. Thanks for your company, your redhead XIs and your thoughts on how long a piece of cricket should be. A man with a plan. “Following is an amended version of a proposal I have sent to the OBO earlier,” says Abhijato Sensarma. “We should take a fifteen-minutes break at the end of the third session, and return for a ‘fourth session’ during each playing day of a Test match. The first three can be shorter in duration (24 overs each) to ensure the same amount of significant play happens in the fourth one, with the players recharged and at the top of their games more frequently than what a Test’s current format allows. The presence of this ‘fourth session’ will contribute to more dynamic passages of play tactics, and help the players stay energised, especially during times of extreme weather. Thoughts?” Interesting idea, but have you ever been to a Test, Abhijato? The 20 minutes of the tea interval are too little to get to he front of the queue for a cup of tea, let alone go to the bathroom as well. So it’s hard to see 15 being much use to anyone. A fourth session, though, is well worth thinking about: the third session is often uncomfortably long, as we may find this afternoon.“Does anyone know,” asks John Starbuck, “if Bess already has a nickname, either from school or his county? I’d have thought he should be known as ‘Good Queen’, with a soundtrack of a Brian May guitar solo.” A thought from John Galpin. “One thing I haven’t heard mentioned in the 4 vs 5 day Test debate is the impact of the weather such as we have now. Where would this match probably be headed if this was the third day of four? It will become far easier for teams on the wrong end of a drubbing to play out for a draw. Personally I expect that far more Tests will end up as a draw, rain or light stopped play or not. Do we really want that? On the other hand it may push teams to keep up a higher scoring rate than say England did here on the first day. But to me that’s part of the magic of 5 day Tests. It enables a longer term strategy to play out and really tests the mental and physical mettle of the two opponents. That’s what makes Test cricket one of the greatest ‘all round’ sporting contests there are.” Very true. Now that Sourav Ganguly has come out against them in his capacity as president of the BCCI, it looks as if mandatory four-dayers are dead in the water. I suspect we’re heading for a mixture, which, technically, is what we have now. There will be more four-day Tests, but still plenty of places where the full five-act drama lives on.Not that we’re done with the redheads yet. “Morning, Tim,” says Phil Sawyer. “Anyone putting together an England red-head eleven and not including the legend that is Glen Chapple is going to incur my ire. Alright, yes, technically he never played a Test for England, but that’s an injustice that I only bring up four or five times a day.” Back to the Pope and Bess show. “Hello, fellow Tim,” says Tim Sanders in Leeds. Always good to meet one. “If at a tangent from the religious theme, we can adapt the Gershwins and Heywards to give us ‘Bess, You Is My Spinner Now’, ‘I Loves You Popey’, whilst Somerset fans might mourn his absence on Test duty with ‘Bess, O Where’s My Bess?’” That’s absence from the 2nd XI, presumably.“As a South African who’s lived in England for a long time,” says Matthew Kentridge, “I don’t know whether to laugh or cry at the state of this Test match. However, when it came to Rabada’s face, yesterday evening, as Pope scooped him backwards over his head for six, more or less with his eyes closed, there was no contest – I had to laugh. I was afraid Rabada would burst a blood vessel with the effort of keeping his mouth shut. Hope the weather clears up, but that Eastern Province rain has been known to settle in and spoil a good day’s cricket, not to mention a good holiday.” Lovely to have a bit of local knowledge, especially when it comes from my next-door neighbour in London. We got him as a Kolpak, obviously.We interrupt this rain break to bring you more on red hair and the passing of time. “Ben Heywood (10.24) seemed down on his brown,” says Nick Killick, “but he’s revealed the great blessing of redheads – generally we transition to another colour before the grey sets in – in my case a bit blonde. We may suffer in the playground, but by middle age our revenge is being served very cold on our white-haired persecutors from youth.” Nice. And nobody ever wrote a headline about a brown-haired ninja.“For inclusion in your red-headed team,” says Steve Hudson. “KP and Jimmy both had red streaks at some point, so they qualify by ... residence, or something?” Ha. In my memory, KP’s streak was blue, but then my memory is hazy from around the time Pat Pocock made his exit.“Pat Pocock,” says Kim Thonger, “was a classic example of face not fitting. I remember his first sixfer. Elegant and interesting bowler, but the selectors were so incompetent at the time that they’d pick almost any other bowler ahead of him. He managed only 25 Tests in 17 years. These were the same selectors who routinely ignored Tom Cartwright. I’m still very cross with them fifty years later.” Great stuff. And yes, Percy Pocock was hard done by. But wasn’t it partly the fact that Ray Illingworth became captain, and he was an off-spinner too? And then Tony Greig took up off-breaks and bagged 14 wickets in a match. At least Pocock had an Indian summer, turning up as a golden oldie in David Gower’s team that went to India in 1984-85 and won. And then he was harshly dropped again, for John Emburey, who came straight back in after a ban, bearing his superior batting and a dismal strike rate. “It’s lashing down,” says Ian Ward on Sky, and the camera pans around to show that, yes, Port Elizabeth has turned into Old Trafford.Back to the serious stuff. “Speaking as a former redhead,” says Ben Heywood, “it can go one of two ways – it can all fall out (can’t think of anyone this has happened to, ahem), or the ginge tinge turns grey, white or in my case, weirdly, brown. My younger son (carrots) didn’t believe I was a ginger until I inadvisedly showed him some old pictures. Now he thinks I used to look like Ronald McDonald.”Even this weather may be on England’s side. “Might a rain-interrupted day with perhaps an early finish be of benefit to England,” wonders Geoff Wignall. “Assuming they manage to take the remaining first-innings wickets or at least most of them? I’m thinking of course of an enforced follow-on with the bowlers sufficiently fresh and well rested.” Poor old Faf: it never rains, but it pours.Anything Pope can do, Bess can do almost as well. No sooner has Pope become the youngest right-hander to make a Test century for England since 1954 (the early days of Colin Cowdrey), than Bess becomes the youngest English spinner to take a Test five-for since 1968, when Pat Pocock grabbed six for 79 against Australia at the age of 21. Hat-tip to Cricinfo, full list here.“From Bangkok on a boozy afternoon,” says Mike Brady. I’m not sure if that’s the most promising start to an OBO email ever, or the most worrying. “Obviously Stokes is God, and he has a Pope, but how should we worship Bess?” As the new leader of the Dominicans, following a brief stint from Dom Sibley.“Lovely scoreboard to wake up to,” says Kim Thonger. “I wonder if there’s a winning formula for future England home Tests? Prepare pitches for spin and select an attack of Bess, Leach, Rashid and Moeen, backed up by pace variation from Curran and Stokes. And possibly play all home Tests at Taunton.” Hang on, what about Wood? He’s just taken one of the all-time great none-fors.“A very good morning Tim.” You can say that again, Brian Withington. “Just catching up with this morning’s OBO, not knowing who was on duty, when my heart lifted at the sight of a Norwegian Wood lyric casually yet deftly inserted into proceedings (over 34). Could I have safely addressed this email without even checking who was responsible?” Oh I don’t know – some of my colleagues have come across this old beat combo too. “What would you give to have penned the original lyric?” That is a good question. Only last Saturday, I heard Judy Collins sing it in Liverpool, bringing an 80-year-old’s elegance to bear on John Lennon’s youthful audacity.“Root’s drop,” says the subject line of an email from George Wigley. “Great captaincy from Root: he wants Bess’s five-for to be top order, unsullied by tail enders. The foresight!”Mid-44th over: South Africa 113-5 (Nortje 14, de Kock 0) The rain gets heavy quite quickly, like a conversation about your love life. The umpires take the players off and signal an early lunch. The morning belongs to Dom Bess, with a little help from Ollie Pope – just a couple of 22-year-olds, living the dream.“Just woken (Well, it IS Saturday) and checked in,” said Adam Goves, “in sleepy Norfolk”, a quarter of an hour ago. “Surely Bess could have parried that C\u0026ampB to Pope?! It’s totally messed up the aesthetic of an otherwise perfect scorecard, or am I being a bit greedy?”43rd over: South Africa 113-5 (Nortje 14, de Kock 0) Denly is still on, and still collecting dots, though he does dish up one bad ball which Nortje dispatches through midwicket. Bad news, lads: rain is falling.42nd over: South Africa 109-5 (Nortje 10, de Kock 0) So the best day of Pope’s career has been followed by the best day of Bess’s. Amazing stuff. For the good of the game, we could now do with a scintillating counter-attack from de Kock."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42c6156c16786b0fc6c7516aff7c9de8252cd5fc/0_399_7952_4771/master/7952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4af922eb114c10e0904f8ffc774d356f","title":"best budget spa holidays eastern europe health treatments","story":"From the Czech Republic to the Ukraine, quality (and unusual) health treatments can be found at a fraction of western Europe pricesFor 800 years the waters around Cieplice have treated the cream of central European society as well as US ambassador (later president) John Quincy Adams.

He doesn’t quite manage itIs Ed Balls charming? I’m really struggling with this question, watching Travels in Euroland With Ed Balls (Thursday, 9pm, BBC Two), a three-part series, for some reason, where Ed Balls goes around Europe asking workers why they voted for far-right parties and always getting the exact same answer, again and again and again, but occasionally doing what-the-humans-do bits in between to make it a TV programme rather than a doomed campaign trail. So we see Ed Balls take a castanet-clacking dance class in Spain, or Ed Balls swimming in the frigid northern sea, Ed Balls for some reason inviting himself into a succession of European homes to make himself a coffee or Ed Balls waving silently at someone’s non-English speaking mum.And throughout this, you are stuck in this strange liminal relationship with Balls, torn somewhere between liking him and not: why is Ed Balls in Europe again? And why are you watching him? The answer is: a new front of far-right-leaning populist parties have found continental success (basically, every European country now has its own version of Ukip, which is ironically quite a nightmare for Ukip itself: they come over here, don’t they, and steal our intolerance), and Ed Balls wants to know why.To do this, he goes on a Dutch fishing boat and asks the fisherman why they voted for the Netherlands’ Partij voor de Vrijheid (it’s not because they’re racist, it’s because PVV is standing up for the fishing industry), then goes to a traditional video shoot for Black Pete, the odd Dutch tradition of yuletide blackface, and asks the director there why he voted Partij voor de Vrijheid (it’s not because they’re racist, it’s because PVV is standing up for the Christmas blackface industry). Then he goes to Spain and meets the bullfighters (you get the picture), as well as the border guards for the 11km wall that ides the Spanish coast from Morocco (etc).The same message recurs throughout Euroland, from country to country and weird tradition to weird tradition: there is a boost in populism on the continent because most far-right parties offer something that could feasibly be described as “aggressive status quo” and they win a lot of votes based on that, and that they happen to tack on virulent anti-immigration rhetoric in with it is neither here nor there to most voters.If Balls made this discovery, say – and I’m spitballing – when he was part of a Labour party that could have done something about it, rather than now when he’s the man who came sixth on Strictly once, maybe the whole endeavour would feel less redundant. I’m not saying Labour should have come out absolutely swinging in favour of that cheese-rolling tournament they have in Gloucester every year, or gone to the debates with the message “Make Lewes Bonfire Night Great Again Or At Least Keep It Exactly As Great As It Is”. But I am saying that, based on evidence gleaned from watching Ed Balls jumping into the sea with some cheerful Dutch lads who love fish and have some incredibly iffy ideas about the role Muslims play in society, it probably would have won them a lot of votes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33bc211c50929b12ae64ce4938efbeeb2929328e/804_493_2696_1618/master/2696.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e608f07bc5efa9c0b8389ef6a02ccfc5","title":"pete buttigieg iowa conservative election 2020","story":"His campaign feared hostility in Iowa’s most conservative county. But the local response told a different storyPete Buttigieg knew he was foraying into unfriendly confines when he was en route to Orange City, the seat of Iowa’s most conservative county.The gay ex-mayor of South Bend, Indiana, may be in the top tier of Democratic presidential candidates seeking to win this vital first voting state next month, but his sexuality was seen as likely to be a major issue in this corner of the state, Sioux county.The campaign braced for protesters in light of public burnings of library books depicting gay relationships and vociferous opposition to the town’s annual gay Pride festival, said Ben Halle, Buttigieg’s Iowa communications director, to the .Halle said didn’t know what to expect as far as a crowd, but he said it was fair to expect opposition as Buttigieg’s campaign rolled into town.“What you need to realize with Sioux county is there’s a very strong religious flavor there, from their courts to their public squares,” said Ned Bjornstad, a former elected prosecutor in north-west Iowa turned veteran defense attorney who practices regularly in Orange City. “For a candidate like Buttigieg, I’d expect protesters.”As Buttigieg entered the Prairie Winds Events Center in downtown Orange City, a crowd of around 200 instead roared in a standing ovation.Regan Harms, a 22-year-old senior majoring in biblical studies at Northwestern College in Orange City, said she wasn’t at all surprised with the turnout. As she introduced Buttigieg, she described him as a neighbor and fellow midwesterner, one who understands life in rural America.“Iowans long for someone who understands them,” Harms said. “The second you meet him, you get that impression that he almost knows you. Of course he can come into Orange City, and people will like him. There’s that common bond among midwesterners.”In nearby Sioux Center in September, the Sioux County Conservatives alleged a restaurant was “celebrating sin” by hosting Pride brunch on a Sunday.When asked whether people in Orange City cared about whether Buttigieg was gay, Harms said she wouldn’t answer that question.“It’s a isive topic here in town, of course,” she said. “Obviously, some people care, but look at this crowd. Others don’t.”Buttigieg maintains he’s the candidate who can blaze the trail. After he announced he was gay, he won a second term in South Bend with a greater share of the vote.While the Orange City crowd wasn’t roaring when Buttigieg announced his socially progressive platforms, only one crowd member asked him whether the country was ready for its first gay president. Buttigieg replied that it had taken a leap of faith to run as a gay man in South Bend, and it would take another to win the presidency.“In the last 50 years, every Democratic president has a perspective outside Washington, is new on the national scene, and is of a new generation,” he said. “I check all those boxes.”With less than three weeks to go before the Iowa caucuses, Buttigieg’s chances are as good as any, said Brad Best, professor of political science at Buena Vista University in Storm Lake, Iowa. Buttigieg has consistently polled in the top four in Iowa and New Hampshire since the late summer, but has suffered a slide as of late as the campaign enters a frenetic final period.“I can’t think of anyone more anathema to the seat of Sioux county, but a packed house there suggests there’s broad appeal, for whatever reason,” Best said.Some Democrats believe that Trump’s behavior in office and scandal-plagued personal and political life may be hurting him even in this Republican stronghold and opening an unlikely door to candidates like Buttigieg – who himself confesses a deep religious faith.“Look at it this way: the red wall has begun to crack,” said the former state senator David Johnson, who used to represent the area. Johnson left the Republican party and declared himself an independent after it declared Trump its nominee.“Think about it: there were over 200 people in Orange City to see Pete Buttigieg and there aren’t even 2,000 registered Democrats in that county. That means there are independents and Republicans in that crowd,” Price said.Corrie Hayes, a 21-year-old senior at Northwestern College, said she was impressed particularly with his response to a question about abortion rights, when he said that in the Book of Genesis, life begins with breath. She wouldn’t get into her positions on policy – she said she was deeply religious and her faith guided her every day – but she said she could tell Buttigieg was sincere about his faith.Hayes feels it isn’t fair to question whether Buttigieg is “electable” simply because he’s gay."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/122b73b58101003d02122bf6ec9199f641aba134/0_116_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2747618ac126fb328806319d34f7ba24","title":"coronavirus what airport measures are in place to detect for sick passengers","story":"Three US airports introduce screening, following action already taken in several Asian countries International airports are stepping up screening for passengers exhibiting symptoms possibly connected with the previously unknown coronavirus that has infected nearly 50 people in China and caused two deaths there.Three major US airports – San Francisco International Airport (SFO), Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) and John F Kennedy International Airport in New York (JFK) – have announced they will screen travellers arriving from Wuhan. Passengers will be examined for symptoms of the pneumonia-like virus, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said, with an additional 100 health workers deployed at the airports.“Investigations into this novel coronavirus are ongoing and we are monitoring and responding to this evolving situation,” said Martin Cetron, the head of the CDC’s Division of Global Migration and Quarantine.“On arrival to the United States, travellers from Wuhan may undergo health screening, including having their temperature taken and filling out a symptom questionnaire,” CDC said on its website. Travellers with additional symptoms such as fever, cough or difficulty breathing will have an additional health assessment.Wuhan Tianhe international airport said that a temperature checkpoint would be installed at the entrance of its main terminal and all passengers would be checked. Those found to have fevers would be placed under quarantine.Authorities in Hong Kong have also stepped up detection measures, including temperature checkpoints for inbound travellers.Thailand has been monitoring incoming passengers at four airports receiving daily flights from Wuhan, including Bangkok, Phuket, Don Mueang and Chiang Mai, since 3 January. Two people have died in Thailand from the virus. One was detected at Bangkok airport by thermal surveillance equipment.Airports in Malaysia, Singapore and South Korea are also screening passengers from Wuhan, authorities said.Indonesian authorities said they have stepped up screening at all points of entry in response to the coronavirus outbreak. The Philippines is scanning all passengers at seaports and airports and those with fever will be interviewed for any history of illness and whether they have traveled to Wuhan, the country’s health secretary, Francisco Duque, said.In Australia, the New South Wales and Victorian governments both issued alerts to health professionals about the virus, urging doctors to “consider novel coronavirus infection in patients with fever and respiratory symptoms and travel to Wuhan City, China in the 14 days before illness onset”.The country’s chief medical officer, Prof Brendan Murphy, said there was “no current need for any travel advice in Australia”.“It is important to note that the new coronavirus was acquired in one seafood market in Wuhan, China, which has been closed, with no new cases reported in the last week,” Murphy said. “There is no clear evidence of human to human transmission at this time.”Murphy added that Australia was following WHO recommendations and had mechanisms in place to screen and respond to unwell travellers at airports and other points of entry to the country.The UK foreign office’s website travel advice on China does not mention coronavirus.Travel is unusually heavy right now as people take trips to and from China to celebrate the Lunar New Year.The CDC said the airport screenings are part of an effort to better detect and prevent the virus from the same family of bugs that caused an international outbreaks of Sars and Mers that began in 2002 and 2012.The WHO says entry screening “offers little benefit, while requiring considerable resources”. It suggests anyone with a respiratory illness should “seek medical attention and share travel history with their health care provider”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd7e2d204aaf7a54f2f7a6593a5e7a37d88413d9/0_161_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a871d722a5ef9648ad2eb1e15c4e9953","title":"rent rise forces revered lgbt bookshop les mots a la bouche out of gay district","story":"Les Mots à La Bouche’s move from the Marais shows loss of cultural heritage, activists say In the window of France’s best-known gay bookshop, above the display of Lucian Freud art books, opera singer Maria Callas’s memoirs and a history of the Pride movement, a poster warns in giant red letters: “Cultural heritage in danger.” An urgent note on the door adds: “We need your help!”Les Mots à La Bouche, a 40-year-old Paris institution, is the top LGBT bookshop in France and considered one of the best in the world – a focal point of Paris’s historic gay neighbourhood in the Marais district. But as property speculation in central Paris reaches dizzying heights – it is estimated that at certain times of year there are more Airbnb rentals than residents in the Marais – the bookshop is being forced out by rising rents.Its departure is a blow to Paris’s gay community as activists warn that central Paris is destroying its cultural identity by allowing luxury fashion shops aimed at rich tourists to force out local businesses, including gay bars.As the local cabaret star, Yvette Leglaire, said: “The gay Marais is dying.” The Paris tourist board still promotes the Marais as “an authentic yet trendy little village” but its gay scene, which began in the 1980s when the area was still working class, shabby and cheap, is slowly being eroded. Several historic gay bars have closed in recent years as fashion labels from Lacoste to Chanel move in.The Marais’ Jewish area, situated around Rue des Rosiers, is not immune, with commercial rents doubling between 2012 and 2018. There are fears that, as with Barcelona or Venice, property speculation and commercial pursuit of profit from tourism will strip central Paris of its originality and local appeal. One long-term resident says the onslaught of luxury fashion brands is turning the Marais into “a giant, open-air duty free shop”.Sébastien Grisez, manager at Les Mots à La Bouche, says: “Paris city hall promotes the gay history of the Marais and it has painted the crossroads here in rainbow colours, but no longer having our bookshop here seems absurd.”The shop, which has been in the Marais since 1983, is open seven days a week until 11pm and stocks more than 16,000 titles. But like many historic gay bars that closed under pressure from rising rents, the shop has been given until March to find a new location elsewhere in Paris . There are rumours that a Doc Marten shoe shop will take its place.Grisez says: “Ten years ago, there were far more gay bars here, now only a few are left. It’s true that gay sociology is changing – people are more spread out, there is perhaps less need to meet in bars when you can meet on apps. But even so, people regret that this neighbourhood meeting point is disappearing.”Alain Lesturgez, who works for the forestry federation, has been coming to the bookshop for 20 years. He says: “This move would be the end of an era. It’s a place where a bookseller would take time to advise you. Once, the Marais had a lot of life, but now the luxury shops make it look the same as many other places in the world.”At the Open Bar, a historic gay venue set up by rights activist Sébastien Fossa, the manager, says: “The neighbourhood is increasingly losing its soul. It started out as a working-class neighbourhood. Gradually, the arrival of luxury brands has broken the dynamic here.”Fayçal Khiatine, who runs nearby gay bar Cox, says: “When a bookshop leaves, it’s daily neighbourhood life that will lose out.”Christian Ducou, who was born and raised in the working-class Marais of the 1950s and 60s, looks out of his kitchen window at a shiny new two-storey Calvin Klein store. He has lived there since kids played in the street and many flats had shared bathrooms on the landing and no toilets. “The first rich person I saw was the photographer Helmut Newton when he moved here,” he says.His wife, Liliane, says: “Strangely, these luxury shops are often empty. It’s as if they only set up here to have a Marais address. This neighbourhood just doesn’t seem to work as a place for luxury fashion shops. There are tiny narrow streets with no place for a limousine to park, yet they’re putting in the same extremely expensive shops you’d expect to see on a boulevard with chauffeur-driven cars waiting outside.”As the spring mayoral elections approach, politicians are fretting about how to save central Paris’s soul from property speculation and intense tourism – or whether it’s already too late. David Belliard, a Green candidate, says the fact that Les Mots à La Bouche is being forced out of the Marais shows the French capital is being deformed and “now only aimed at tourists”. The local socialist mayor of the 4th arrondissement has promised to help the bookshop find a new location but, with a March deadline looming, one has yet to be found.Sébastien Raymond, an actor, says: “This bookshop always felt like a cocoon. You knew you’d be accepted here. You felt safe.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4143173.1579282255!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"what happens if i get sick health the core issue for waterford voters","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPat ‘the Lawnmower Man’ at Kearney’s on Convent Street in Tallow. ‘Give somebody a majority for five years and let them get on with it.’ Photograph: Mary Browne“Rural Ireland is closed,” says Pat “The Lawnmower Man” from Tallow in west Waterford.He won’t give his last name – everyone knows him as The Lawnmower Man, he says.

It could also further complicate discussions with Brussels.Talks with the EU already face a daunting schedule this year, with the EU probably agreeing its formal negotiating mandate only in late February and the official transition period expiring on December 31st. Mr Johnson says that deadline is immovable, while EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier calls it “extremely challenging.”The debate over how much Britain will erge from the EU with regards to regulatory standards is set to form a key plank for how the talks progress .German Chancellor Angela Merkel has warned that the further the UK goes it alone, the more it will be regarded in Brussels as a direct competitor.“There will be an impact on business one way or the other, some will benefit, some won’t, ” Mr Javid said in the Financial Times interview, urging companies to adjust their strategies accordingly. He plans to back more projects in regions outside London and the southeast, and pump more funds into training the country’s workforce.As for the UK’s finances, Mr Javid said he wants to bolster growth rates to between 2.7 per cent and 2.8 per cent a year.

Photograph: Will OliverEPAAn online fundraising campaign seeking to have Big Ben ring to welcome in Brexit at 11pm on January 31st has raised more than £150,000 (€175,000).Stand Up 4 Brexit’s “Big Ben must bong for Brexit” campaign had raised £152,470 of its £500,000 target from almost 10,000 donors on the GofFundMe website by Friday morning.Those who wish to celebrate Britain leaving the EU will want to do so in the same manner as New Year’s Eve – by looking at a clock, the campaign’s organisers wrote online.“The natural choice for this would be Big Ben but because it is currently undergoing refurbishment, special measures would have to be put in place, which could cost up to £500,000,” a statement by StandUp4Brexit founder Rebecca Ryan and Mark Francois MP added.“However, because there is a lead time to make the necessary preparations, we would need to raise this amount by this weekend.”Mr Francois had earlier accused the House of Commons authorities of exaggerating the cost of bringing the bell, which has been silent since 2017, back into operation.In a video posted on the fundraising site, Mr Francois said he was “delighted to announce that our Eurosceptic colleagues from StandUp4Brexit have agreed to host a crowdfunding campaign to help raise half a million pounds so that Big Ben can chime at 11pm on the 31st of January”.He added that the campaign hoped to get contributions “from across the four nations of the United Kingdom, what the prime minister likes to call the ‘awesome foursome’”.Mr Francois said it was “inconceivable” that the clock used to mark the UK’s departure from the EU “could be any other than the most iconic timepiece on Earth, which is Big Ben”.He finished his appeal by saying “please give an amount on this website now so we can properly celebrate becoming a free country again”.They added that “Britons are currently donating more than £80 a minute to the campaign, with an average donation of £16”.British prime minister Boris Johnson had said on BBC Breakfast on Tuesday that the government was “working up a plan so people can bung a bob for a Big Ben bong”.Donations to the campaign include £1,000 from Mr Francois, while business secretary Andrea Leadsom promised £10.There were also small donations from “Dominic Grieve”, “Jeremy Corbyn” and “John Bercow” but these were all thought likely to be fake names.Restoring the bell was discussed at a meeting of the House of Commons Commission on Monday, but it was ruled out after it was revealed it could cost £500,000.Commons speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle, who is chairman of the commission, said: “You are talking about £50,000 a bong.”Whether Big Ben bongs or not, Brexiteers intend to gather outside parliament to mark the UK’s departure from the EU.Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage said the Leave Means Leave campaign group had been been given approval to hold an event in Parliament Square on January 31st. “It is a big moment in the history of this nation to celebrate,” he said. – PA"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4142827.1579260255!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"uk labour party leadership race the five contenders","story":"The five candidates to succeed Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader will face off on Saturday in the first hustings of a three-month campaign that will produce a winner on April 4th. The five MPs – Keir Starmer, Rebecca Long Bailey, Lisa Nandy, Jess Phillips and Emily Thornberry – this week won the nominations of enough MPs and MEPs to get through to the second round of the three-stage contest.The leader will be chosen by all Labour members and registered supporters but candidates must win the support of enough unions and other affiliated organisations or of constituency parties to secure a place on the ballot. They need the backing of two unions and one other affiliated organisation (such as the Fabian Society or the Jewish Labour Movement) making up at least 5 per cent of the total affiliate membership. Or they can make the cut by winning the support of 33 constituency parties, which is 5 per cent of the total.The candidates have until February 14th to win enough support to get onto the ballot paper, which will be sent to about half a million Labour members and anyone who signed up this week as a registered supporter at a cost of £25.The election is carried out under the “alternative vote” system, with voters ranking the candidates in order of preference. If no candidate reaches 50 per cent on the first count, lower preferences are distributed until one of them does.Parallel to the leadership contest, Labour is also choosing a deputy leader under the same rules and procedure.Keir StarmerThe shadow Brexit secretary won the nominations of almost half the MPs who voted in the first round of the leadership contest and is viewed at Westminster as the candidate to beat. At 57, he has been in Parliament since 2015, succeeding the late Frank Dobson as MP for the London seat of Holborn and St Pancras.Before entering politics, he was a barrister and he served as a human rights advisor to the Northern Ireland Policing Board between 2002 and 2007. He became director of public prosecutions and head of the Crown Prosecution Service in 2008, a position he held until 2013.Starmer backed Andy Burnham in the 2015 leadership election but Jeremy Corbyn made him a shadow home office minister. Starmer resigned along with many other shadow cabinet members after the 2016 Brexit referendum and backed Owen Smith’s unsuccessful challenge against Corbyn.As shadow Brexit secretary, Starmer was loyal to the leadership in public, working behind the scenes to shift Corbyn and the Labour membership towards a more overtly pro-Remain position. He is presenting himself as a unity candidate in the leadership contest, calling for Corbyn’s left-wing economic policies to be retained but promising more openness and competence.With the support of Unison, Britain’s biggest union, and of Labour’s environmental affiliate SERA, Starmer is already most of the way towards a place on the members’ ballot and remains favourite to win.What could get in his way is that he is perceived as dull fears that his association with Labour’s opposition to Brexit could be an impediment in the Midlands and the North of England and the eagerness of many party members to elect their first woman leader.Rebecca Long-BaileyThe shadow business secretary is the anointed candidate of most of those around Corbyn, although the leader himself will not publicly support anyone in the contest. After a slow start, her campaign has picked up pace in the past few days and a Survation poll of Labour members this week put her ahead of Starmer.She already has the backing of Momentum, the campaigning group founded to support Corbyn’s leadership, following a poll of its members in which hers was the only name on the ballot. Long-Bailey is also expected to win the support of Unite, the union that is Labour’s biggest paymaster, and her place on the members’ ballot is assured.Aged 40, Long-Bailey was born in Manchester to Irish parents and worked as a solicitor before becoming MP for Salford and Eccles in 2015. An early supporter of Corbyn, she joined his front bench immediately after his election and was also appointed to the National Executive Committee (NEC), Labour’s governing body.The backing of Momentum and Unite will help Long-Bailey steal a march on her rivals in contacting Labour members, whose contact details will not be shared with candidates until a few days before ballot papers are sent out next month. Both Momentum and Unite have extensive databases of their own, as well as the infrastructure and volunteers to make sure that her message reaches the membership early and often.That message is one of unswerving loyalty to the Corbyn project (Long-Bailey gave his leadership 10 out of 10 in an interview last week) and to the idea of Labour as a radical, progressive party.“The British state needs a seismic shock, to prise it open at all levels to the people – their knowledge, their skills, their demands. Proper democracy takes power away from the offshore bank account and places it on the ballot paper, so workers can have more and chief executives less, and we can tackle the climate crisis with a Green New Deal that unites all of Labour’s heartlands,” she says.Lisa NandyThe MP for Wigan has been the breakout star of the first weeks of the campaign, grabbing attention with her analysis of Labour’s estrangement from its old industrial heartland and holding her own in a 22-minute interview with Andrew Neil on Wednesday.At 40, Nandy has been in Parliament since 2010 and has been a backbencher since 2016 when she resigned from Corbyn’s shadow cabinet where she served as shadow energy secretary. She has won the backing of the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) and is expected to win the support of at least one other union next week, making her place on the ballot paper almost certain.Her father was a Marxist academic from India and her grandfather was a Liberal MP who became a peer. Before entering parliament, Nandy worked for a homelessness charity and as a policy adviser to the Children’s Commission and the Independent Asylum Commission.Although she campaigned against Brexit in the 2016 referendum, Nandy has consistently argued that the vote should be respected. She was one of a number of Labour MPs who flirted with supporting Theresa May’s Brexit deal, negotiating with the prime minister for hours and making agonised speeches in the Commons but never actually voting for the deal.In 2018, she set up the Centre for Towns, a think tank focused on improving life in Britain’s towns, and she argues that Labour’s route back to power runs through the places the party lost last month to the Conservatives and others it lost long before.“The next Labour leader will have to be up for a scrap – willing to run to the places where we are loathed, take the anger on the chin, and make and win the argument,” she wrote in the .Nandy’s best hope of winning the leadership could lie in winning enough second preferences to put her in the running if neither Starmer nor Long-Bailey wins more than 50 per cent of the votes in the first round.Jess PhillipsThe 38-year-old MP for Birmingham Yardley is one of the most high-profile backbenchers in any party at Westminster after appearances on BBC Question Time and Have I Got News for You and some highly effective and unorthodox interventions in the Commons. Phillips’s high profile has helped to make her a target for abuse on social media, including rape threats.Before entering parliament, she worked for Women’s Aid, which supports victims of domestic abuse, and women’s rights remain at the centre of her politics. A critic of Corbyn’s leadership, Phillips has been outspoken in condemning Labour’s handling of allegations of anti-Semitism.Her campaign slogan is “Speak Truth. Win Power”, and Phillips is presenting herself as a straight talker who does not respect the niceties of political discourse but could discombobulate Boris Johnson at the dispatch box. She will probably need the support of 33 constituency parties to get on to the ballot, and as a figure to the right of most Labour members she is a long shot to win the leadership.Emily ThornberryLong regarded as the favourite to succeed Corbyn, the 59-year-old shadow foreign secretary scraped through the first round with the bare minimum of nominations from MPs. Thornberry nominated Corbyn for the leadership in 2015 and remained loyal to him during the shadow cabinet resignations and Owen Smith’s leadership challenge.But some in Corbyn’s inner circle viewed her with suspicion, and she was sidelined over the past two years as she pressed the party to back calls for a second Brexit referendum. An effective performer at the dispatch box, she was last year pushed out of her role as Corbyn’s stand-in at prime minister’s questions.MP for Islington South and Finsbury since 2005, Thornberry is the most experienced of the leadership candidates, but she cannot expect union support and may struggle to win the backing of enough constituency parties to appear on the ballot."},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons january 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178.Belgium revokes hunting licences as hopes rise of first wolf cubs in 100 yearsMacron evacuated from Paris theatre as protesters block exits over pension reformsComment: Will The Masked Singer be a hit?

Stop touching my hair! Why are you frying a banana? These are just some of the phrases we’re not allowed to utter at Sheffield University anymore. They’re “micro-aggressions” (subtly racist remarks), apparently. This Russell Group university is paying 20 students £9.34 an hour to be “race equality champions” and police their peers’ thoughts. They will teach classes that explain how to lead healthy conversations so we are not at risk of saying something that might offend. I began my politics degree at Sheffield hoping to find reasoned debate, and the embrace of opposing views. Instead, I entered an atmosphere rife with woke, intolerant, censorious anti-intellectualism.Vice-chancellor Koen Lamberts and the students’ union leaders behind these “micro-aggressions” classes are too immersed in virtue-signalling to realise their absurdity. I’m not a racist, but because I’m white, on campus I’m told I must need education to counteract my allegedly innate racist tendencies. But of course, by this flawed logic I’m unable ever to encounter racism because only discrimination against BME people is deemed legitimate.Offence is in the eye of the beholder, but Sheffield University sees it as a rule. It is as yet unclear how “micro-aggressors” will be identified or whether such allegations will warrant a disciplinary investigation, or indeed, which department will house the gulag. It’s a clever tactic by the commissars, sorry, university officials, to whip up a false sense of victimhood, then bring in Soviet-esque policies under the cloak of a knowledge hierarchy. The extent to which these students’ unions are really “anti-racist”, as they claim, was revealed when they wailed and protested over the EHRC report including a finding that nine per cent of White British students have experienced racism. That doesn’t fit the script.It is the latest in the march towards a toxic “cancel culture” at Sheffield University. When I unloaded my bags in freshers week three years ago, I sported a Jeremy Corbyn T-shirt. Now, that thought repels me. The campus zealots have put me off the Left for life. Shortly after writing in the  about my lecturers blocking students from crossing picket lines to attend classes in March 2018, I was hauled before senior staff members in my department and shouted at, told I had shamed the department. They later apologised, but it was a foretaste of things to come.My university announced compulsory climate change lectures for all students in September, the same month that bosses brought in gender-neutral toilets on SU club nights, without telling anyone the single-sex toilets had vanished. The students’ union organised meetings to shift from being “simply non-racist to actively anti-racist” in October - and banned white students from attending. I dared to challenge this screeching paradox and the mob pounced on me online. I expect pronoun lectures to pop up on my timetable next week.It’s a culture of compliance on campus where your voice is only permitted if you’re a self-identified minority, or politically correct. Most students can see the madness of the race equality champions and how pathetic this notion of needing a “safe space” really is, but are too afraid to speak out. A teaching assistant confided in me recently that he was being bullied by Marxist lecturers who had complained to senior staff that his views were offensive to them, and had rejected his “Tory” PhD thesis. He said he’s scared here on campus, but would never say so publicly. Our universities may still be revered the world over, but they’ve fallen into the clutches of mob rule. There is a glimmer of hope. Myself and other silenced students nationwide are setting up free speech societies on campus to re-platform the no-platformed the accused “transphobes” and “racists”.I accept my university has cancelled me. But the prospect of the last vestiges of academic freedom crumbling in our seats of learning scares me more than Sheffield’s thought police will ever stifle us.University of SheffieldThe  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Most people have known about child labour in factories for decades. After learning about it, as a small form of personal protest I have refused to own anything Nike since I was a teenager. The factory fire in Bangladesh again brought the horrifying conditions of garment workers to light, however the conditions in factories- as well as our consumer habits - to a large extent, remain unchanged.In terms of the environmental impact of fashion and production, the argument is clear cut: produce less waste less. However, aside from the conditions and pay of workers, I find the ethics a bit more complicated. Businesses provide livelihoods for millions of people around the world, so what impact would a decline have on these communities? I will also try to explore these sorts of contradictions (if that is what they are).I know it will not be easy as I can already anticipate challenges such as buying (and receiving) gifts, socks and underwear, home renovation, cosmetics and many others, but I will try my best.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Great. I mean, it would be nice if they notified me. Forewarned is forearmed. They can do anything now. This could be a deep fake interview for all we know.”Created with Sketch.Marvel films – ranked worst to best Show all 23Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.23. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.21. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.423 Avengers: Age of Ultron20. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.19. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.18. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 723 s of the Galaxy Vol 217. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.16. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.15. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1023 Ant-Man and the Wasp14. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.13. What comes after the end? It’s the question that was hanging over the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since the release of Avengers: Endgame was sold to us as the ultimate, cumulative chapter in a series of 22 interconnected films. And yet, while Far From Home is distinctly mid-level Marvel fare, there’s a lot to be said for the fact it isn’t crushed under the weight of its own ambitions. It feels comfortably like the end of a chapter, the beginning of a new one, an epilogue, and a palate cleanser all at once. It also works perfectly well as a film about Spider-Man.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2223 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.23. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22.

Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.423 Avengers: Age of Ultron20. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.19. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.18. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 723 s of the Galaxy Vol 217. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.16. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.15. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1023 Ant-Man and the Wasp14. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.13. What comes after the end? It’s the question that was hanging over the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since the release of Avengers: Endgame was sold to us as the ultimate, cumulative chapter in a series of 22 interconnected films. And yet, while Far From Home is distinctly mid-level Marvel fare, there’s a lot to be said for the fact it isn’t crushed under the weight of its own ambitions. It feels comfortably like the end of a chapter, the beginning of a new one, an epilogue, and a palate cleanser all at once. It also works perfectly well as a film about Spider-Man.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2223 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.It was recently revealed by Jeff\u0026nbspGoldblum that Downey Jr has provided voice work for an animated version of Iron Man in new Disney+ series What If..?Also starring in Black Widow is\u0026nbspRachel Weisz, who plays Melina Vostokoff, and\u0026nbspStranger Things\u0026nbspactor\u0026nbspDavid Harbour, who plays a character named Red .Florence Pugh, who has been Oscar-nominated for her role in Little Women, plays Black Widow’s sister\u0026nbspYelena Belova.The film will be released in cinemas on 1 May.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

November\u0027s dismal weather will finally change, with drier and colder conditions coming for the start of December, forecasters have saidThere are currently 76 balance transfer deals available, compared to 122 in January 2017, while the longest interest-free period on the market has dropped from 43 months to 29 months. The fees lenders charge to move debt have also increased.“Those consumers who used a credit card to pay for some of the festive season may be looking to acquire a 0 per cent balance transfer card, but if they do then they would be wise to make fixed repayments,” said Rachel Springall, a finance expert at Moneyfacts.“For instance, someone with a £3,000 debt that paid £150 back as a minimum per month would clear the debt in 20 months, but there are cards that can default to a repayment of just 1 per cent plus monthly interest – so their debt would hang overhead for much longer on this basis.”The changes have come partly in response to a crackdown by the Financial Conduct Authority on lenders profiting from customers who are in\u0026nbsppersistent debt and have no plan in place to pay it off.Credit card gambling ban does not go far enough, say campaignersUnder rules announced in 2017, the watchdog required credit card companies\u0026nbspto take steps to help customers repay their balances more quickly and offer further assistance to those who cannot.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailSarah Coles, a personal finance analyst with Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “If you’re a committed ‘rate tart’, regularly shifting balances when the 0 per cent introductory period runs out, you might fall foul of these tightened criteria and struggle to get another deal.“If you apply for cards and get turned down\u0026nbspthis will damage your credit score further, so it’s worth using an online eligibility calculator, which only does a soft search of your credit record so won’t affect your score.\u0026nbsp“If you can’t get a long 0 per cent introductory period, you may want to consider a card that targets borrowers with less impressive scores – which tend to offer less than six months interest-free.\u0026nbsp“However, it pays to take stock more generally. Shifting from one 0 per cent deal to another risks racking up transfer fees, and unless you’re very disciplined it can tempt to you keep building more and more debt. If instead of gradually paying the debt down\u0026nbspyou’re seeing the balances increase, you need to make a change\u0026nbspand reconsider your spending habits so you can start paying it back before your debt becomes a problem.\u0026nbspFather in credit card debt jumps off roof with daughter, wife followsBritish Airways fined £183m for data breachSales surge as shoppers defy Brexit woes but credit card defaults soar“Once you’ve drawn up a budget, you can tinker with the spending figures to free up cash to pay down your debts each month. Don’t rely on being committed to manually making the payments, though – it tends to be much more effective to set up a direct debit to repay it straight after payday so you don’t get a chance to spend it.“While you’re repaying your debts, you should try to pay as little interest on your debts as possible. One option is to find a low-interest loan. This has the advantage of being for a fixed sum, so you’re not tempted to dip in over and over again when you’re meant to be paying it off.”The latest figures come\u0026nbspas the government was urged to tackle a sharp rise in the use of expensive consumer\u0026nbspcredit among lower-income households.The Resolution Foundation thinktank found that low income households have racked up borrowing on loans, credit cards and other consumer debt faster than any other group since the financial crisis, leaving them over-exposed to another economic shock.Much of the rise in consumer credit since the financial crash has been on high interest products including store cards and overdrafts charging rates averaging 20 per cent.There were some signs earlier this month that the boom in consumer lending may be drawing to a close, as separate research by the Bank of England showed that UK borrowers made net repayments on their credit cards for the first time since July 2013. The total amount borrowed on credit cards dropped by £600m to £72.1bn. Overall consumer lending is at £225bn.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

New enquires from potential buyers increased, while the number of sellers putting their homes on the market also rose.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“The signals from the latest survey provide\u0026nbspfurther evidence that the housing market is seeing some benefit from the greater clarity provided by the decisive election outcome,” said Simon Rubinsohn, the chief economist at RICS.But he warned that because affordability remained a key issue in many parts of the country, the shift in “mood music” on prices was a concern, particularly with signs of a revival of optimism in London after a period of falling prices.Created with Sketch.UK Housing Crisis: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Members of ‘generation rent’, as the younger generation is often known, are finding it far more difficult to get on the housing market than previous generationsThen chancellor George Osborne visits a Help to Buy housing development in Lewisham in 2014.

And not a moment too soonThe number of transactions also increased, with 9 per cent more respondents seeing a rise than a fall. While a net balance of 9 per cent also reported an increase in new instructions offering some relief from the price pressure, this was concentrated in London and the south, while the rest of the country was flat.A net balance of 61 per cent said they expected prices to increase over the coming 12 months, almost double the 33 per cent balance a month earlier.The upbeat tone will add to the dilemma the Bank of England faces when it decides on interest rates at the end of the month.Earlier this week,\u0026nbspHalifax said house prices rose sharply in December, increasing by 1.7 per cent from the previous month to push the annual increase to 4 per cent. Official figures released on Wednesday showed that prices rose by 2.2 per cent in the year to November, up from 1.3 per cent in October.However, this has been offset by a slew of downbeat data, including a drop in the annual inflation rate to 1.3 per cent from 1.5 per cent last month, taking it further below the bank’s 2 per cent target. The economy contracted by 0.3 per cent in November to leave annual growth at zero.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

November\u0027s dismal weather will finally change, with drier and colder conditions coming for the start of December, forecasters have saidThere are currently 76 balance transfer deals available, compared to 122 in January 2017, while the longest interest-free period on the market has dropped from 43 months to 29 months. The fees lenders charge to move debt have also increased.“Those consumers who used a credit card to pay for some of the festive season may be looking to acquire a 0 per cent balance transfer card, but if they do then they would be wise to make fixed repayments,” said Rachel Springall, a finance expert at Moneyfacts.“For instance, someone with a £3,000 debt that paid £150 back as a minimum per month would clear the debt in 20 months, but there are cards that can default to a repayment of just 1 per cent plus monthly interest – so their debt would hang overhead for much longer on this basis.”The changes have come partly in response to a crackdown by the Financial Conduct Authority on lenders profiting from customers who are in\u0026nbsppersistent debt and have no plan in place to pay it off.Credit card gambling ban does not go far enough, say campaignersUnder rules announced in 2017, the watchdog required credit card companies\u0026nbspto take steps to help customers repay their balances more quickly and offer further assistance to those who cannot.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailSarah Coles, a personal finance analyst with Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “If you’re a committed ‘rate tart’, regularly shifting balances when the 0 per cent introductory period runs out, you might fall foul of these tightened criteria and struggle to get another deal.“If you apply for cards and get turned down\u0026nbspthis will damage your credit score further, so it’s worth using an online eligibility calculator, which only does a soft search of your credit record so won’t affect your score.\u0026nbsp“If you can’t get a long 0 per cent introductory period, you may want to consider a card that targets borrowers with less impressive scores – which tend to offer less than six months interest-free.\u0026nbsp“However, it pays to take stock more generally. Shifting from one 0 per cent deal to another risks racking up transfer fees, and unless you’re very disciplined it can tempt to you keep building more and more debt. If instead of gradually paying the debt down\u0026nbspyou’re seeing the balances increase, you need to make a change\u0026nbspand reconsider your spending habits so you can start paying it back before your debt becomes a problem.\u0026nbspFather in credit card debt jumps off roof with daughter, wife followsBritish Airways fined £183m for data breachSales surge as shoppers defy Brexit woes but credit card defaults soar“Once you’ve drawn up a budget, you can tinker with the spending figures to free up cash to pay down your debts each month. Don’t rely on being committed to manually making the payments, though – it tends to be much more effective to set up a direct debit to repay it straight after payday so you don’t get a chance to spend it.“While you’re repaying your debts, you should try to pay as little interest on your debts as possible. One option is to find a low-interest loan. This has the advantage of being for a fixed sum, so you’re not tempted to dip in over and over again when you’re meant to be paying it off.”The latest figures come\u0026nbspas the government was urged to tackle a sharp rise in the use of expensive consumer\u0026nbspcredit among lower-income households.The Resolution Foundation thinktank found that low income households have racked up borrowing on loans, credit cards and other consumer debt faster than any other group since the financial crisis, leaving them over-exposed to another economic shock.Much of the rise in consumer credit since the financial crash has been on high interest products including store cards and overdrafts charging rates averaging 20 per cent.There were some signs earlier this month that the boom in consumer lending may be drawing to a close, as separate research by the Bank of England showed that UK borrowers made net repayments on their credit cards for the first time since July 2013. The total amount borrowed on credit cards dropped by £600m to £72.1bn. Overall consumer lending is at £225bn.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Daniel Kaluuya and Jodie Turner-Smith are the unlikely couple thrust together on a go-nowhere blind date, only for tragedy to transform them into folk heroes roaming across the USA searching for shelter. It’s a spellbinding debut. (Adam White) Guaranteed to be one of the major players in next year’s Oscars, Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite works better the less you know about it. What you should know is that it is a devilishly inventive deconstruction of class, brimming with energy, dark humour and nervous tension. (Adam White) Rising from the ashes of the aborted Universal Monsters multiverse, which was due to star Johnny Depp and Tom Cruise, this rebooted Invisible Man uses the iconic branding to tell the smaller and far more intriguing story of a woman on the run from her invisible ex. Elisabeth Moss is the domestic violence survivor convinced that her supposedly dead boyfriend has merely mastered the art of invisibility. Leigh Whannell, who directed 2018’s wonderfully inventive sci-fi thriller Upgrade, is behind the camera. (Adam White) A Quiet Place would surely have been better off as a standalone film, but the financial success of writer-director John Krasinski’s B-movie-style horror tale put paid to that. This isn’t to say there’s no more story to tell. In fact, Krasinski made no secret of the fact he had a whole universe he could one day explore, and sure enough, joining returning stars Emily Blunt, Millicent Thomas and Noah Jupe (so brilliant in Honey Boy) are new additions in the form of Cillian Murphy and Djimon Honsou. (Jacob Stolworthy) 519 No Time to DieWhile Daniel Craig’s Bond tenure has been marked by severe whiplash in terms of quality, there remains something incredibly exciting about the arrival of a new 007 movie. No Time to Die, Craig’s final outing as the super-spy, also boasts an intoxicating array of talent on and off screen, from Cary Fukunaga on directorial duties, to a script co-written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge and cast newcomers including Ana de Armas, Rami Malek and Lashana Lynch. (Adam White) Little is known about the plot for Antebellum, the feature film debut of artists and music video directors Gerard Bush and Christopher Renz. But the thriller\u0027s trailer is a visual feast, with Janelle Monáe appearing to be caught between the present day and the horrors of a 19th century plantation. From producer Jordan Peele, director of Get Out and Us, it also features Jena Malone, Gabourey Sidibe and Kiersey Clemons. (Adam White)719 The Woman in the WindowAn adaptation of the pulpy bestseller (which itself was engulfed in mystery when a New Yorker feature claimed its author, AJ Finn, had extensively lied about his personal life and history), The Woman in the Window puts Amy Adams centre stage for the first time since 2018’s Sharp Objects. She’s an agoraphobic psychologist convinced she has witnessed a murder across the street from her apartment. Julianne Moore, Gary Oldman and Brian Tyree Henry co-star. (Adam White) Watchmen star Yahya Abdul-Mateen III continues his incredible ascent with the starring role in this remake. Produced by the ubiquitous Jordan Peele, the new Candyman revives the hook-handed killer originated in 1992’s genuinely terrifying Bernard Rose film, but with a black and female director and predominantly black cast – which ought to mean the frustratingly ambiguous racial themes of the original can finally be given their due. (Adam White) The sequel to 2017’s mega successful Wonder Woman is a rare thing: a DC film worthy of excitement. The first outing saw Patty Jenkins become the highest-grossing woman director in cinema history, and she’s looking to beat her own record with a follow-up centred on the Amazon princess’s battle against a villain named Cheetah (Kristen Wiig in her superhero film debut). That Jenkins describes it as “a grand tentpole like they use to make in the 1980s” is reason alone to mark its release on your 2020 calendar. (Jacob Stolworthy) Soul is a curious new Pixar film that appears to emulate the philosophical wonder of Inside Out with the lived-in cultural exploration of Coco. Jamie Foxx is a struggling musician who finally gets his big break, only to experience a freak accident that propels him into a mysterious netherworld in which souls are imbued with talents and passions, before being implanted in newborn babies. It looks gorgeous, is potentially insane, and is co-written by Tina Fey. (Adam White) Hours after the first reviews of both Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and Cats took over social media, Warner Bros dropped the trailer for Tenet, Christopher Nolan’s top secret espionage thriller. It’s fair to say plenty of sunshine was stolen – and for good reason. Tenet marks Nolan’s return to the mind-melting thrills of Inception and, while the plot remains unknown, it seems to focus on a team of heroes who must rewind time to prevent the outbreak of war. Sign us up. (Jacob Stolworthy) Tom Cruise is taking a (short) break from carrying out impossible missions in 2020. Instead, he’ll return to the cockpit for a sequel to the daddy of all Eighties films, Top Gun. There’ll surely be an element of “teach new dogs old tricks” in the Joseph Kosinski-directed film as Pete “Maverick” Mitchell mentors a new generation of US Navy fighter pilots. We’re hopeful the result will – wait for it – take our breath away. (Jacob Stolworthy) 1319 Barb and Star Go to Vista Del MarIt’s not the Bridesmaids sequel everyone begged for nearly a decade ago, but Barb and Star is its spiritual follow-up at least. Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumulo, the women behind the 2011 smash, write and star in this new comedy, playing two best friends who venture out of their small Midwestern community for the very first time. They soon get mixed up in a villainous plot to kill an entire town, while Jamie Dornan and Damon Wayans Jr also star. (Adam White) 1419 The Many Saints of NewarkWhether you like it or not, a film prequel based on The Sopranos is being released in 2020. The presence of David Chase, the HBO show’s creator, goes a long way to abate any concerns fans might have, and it’ll at least be a fine chance to explore the mobsters’s family history. The film is expected to focus on Dickie Moltisanti, the father of Christopher, whose memory loomed large over the series. (Jacob Stolworthy) 1519 Last Night in SohoEdgar Wright is adding “psychological horror” to his filmmaking repertoire with Last Night in Soho, a neon-soaked thrill ride starring quite the ensemble (Anya Taylor-Joy, Matt Smith, Diana Rigg). The intriguing plot focuses on a young girl for whom “time falls apart” after she’s somehow transported to the 1960s. It sounds like a cult hit in waiting. (Jacob Stolworthy) The feel-good West End smash is transformed into a feel-good movie, with Richard E Grant, Sarah Lancashire and Sharon Horgan leading the story of a teenage boy who overcomes insecurity by embracing drag. Newcomer Max Harwood portrays the title character. (Adam White) Regardless of whether you’re a keen follower of the Marvel Cinematic Universe or not, The Eternals should pique your interest. Sure, it may be spearheading a brand new phase of Marvel franchises – there really is no end to the studios’ box office stronghold – but it features what has to be one of the most eclectic casts ever seen in a superhero film: Angelina Jolie, Kit Harington, Kumail Nanjiani, Brian Tyree Henry and Salma Hayek. Colour us intrigued. (Jacob Stolworthy) Alberto E. RodriguezGetty Images for DisneyA remake of David Lynch’s Dune would ordinarily cause our eyeballs to rattle around our sockets, but not when Denis Villeneuve’s in the director’s chair. So committed to his vision is Warner Bros that they ignored the fact his breathtaking Blade Runner sequel flopped and handed him the keys to a fresh adaptation of Herbert Ross’ novel. He did direct Prisoners, Enemy and Arrival, after all. Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya head up the cast. (Jacob Stolworthy) Long in the works, Steven Spielberg’s West Side Story looks set to be a festive smash this time next year. Speculated to be closer in spirit to the original Stephen Sondheim musical than the iconic 1961 film, this new version casts Ansel Elgort as Tony and newcomer Rachel Zegler as Maria – the latter, incredibly, beat out more than 30,000 candidates for the role, after submitting an audition video via Twitter.

New enquires from potential buyers increased, while the number of sellers putting their homes on the market also rose.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“The signals from the latest survey provide\u0026nbspfurther evidence that the housing market is seeing some benefit from the greater clarity provided by the decisive election outcome,” said Simon Rubinsohn, the chief economist at RICS.But he warned that because affordability remained a key issue in many parts of the country, the shift in “mood music” on prices was a concern, particularly with signs of a revival of optimism in London after a period of falling prices.Created with Sketch.UK Housing Crisis: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Members of ‘generation rent’, as the younger generation is often known, are finding it far more difficult to get on the housing market than previous generationsThen chancellor George Osborne visits a Help to Buy housing development in Lewisham in 2014.

And not a moment too soonThe number of transactions also increased, with 9 per cent more respondents seeing a rise than a fall. While a net balance of 9 per cent also reported an increase in new instructions offering some relief from the price pressure, this was concentrated in London and the south, while the rest of the country was flat.A net balance of 61 per cent said they expected prices to increase over the coming 12 months, almost double the 33 per cent balance a month earlier.The upbeat tone will add to the dilemma the Bank of England faces when it decides on interest rates at the end of the month.Earlier this week,\u0026nbspHalifax said house prices rose sharply in December, increasing by 1.7 per cent from the previous month to push the annual increase to 4 per cent. Official figures released on Wednesday showed that prices rose by 2.2 per cent in the year to November, up from 1.3 per cent in October.However, this has been offset by a slew of downbeat data, including a drop in the annual inflation rate to 1.3 per cent from 1.5 per cent last month, taking it further below the bank’s 2 per cent target.

The voluntary agreements between different industry players have not yielded the desired results.Future iPhone could have no ports at all, report suggestsInstead, they tasked the European Commission with pushing companies to adopt a common charger that would fit all mobile phones, tablets, e-book readers and other portable devices.In practise, most companies have moved towards the relatively new USB-C standard, which is now used by many Android phones. That solves the issues that were present in previous attempts at a common standard, and has been adopted across the industry.Even Apple now uses USB-C in its iPads and MacBooks. But it has kept the Lightning charger in its phones and related products like the AirPods Pro, ever since it was first released in 2012.Some rumours have suggested that Apple could give up the charging port entirely, instead offering wireless charging.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Admittedly, they didn’t know the exact terms.”Senior EU figures\u0026nbsphave warned that Mr Johnson’s timetable for trade talks is too short, as the prime minister has ruled out\u0026nbspextending the transition period beyond December 2020.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A 2018 regulation means Amazon can no longer sell its own brand products in India\u0026nbspand must instead provide a marketplace for local manufacturers and producers.Jeff Bezos momentarily beaten as richest man in worldJeff Bezos and the farcical philanthropy of the super-richAmazon ‘threatens to fire’ employees for climate change campaigningAmazon driver refuses to deliver sherry to 92-year-old without IDAre warehouse robots causing more harm than good?Mr Bezos said the company was “excited about what lies ahead”\u0026nbspand has been gushing in his praise of India throughout the trip, at one point saying that “the 21st century is going to be an Indian century” and describing cooperation between the US and India as “the most important alliance in the 21st century”.India, it seems, is not so enamoured with him. A Reuters report said Mr Modi had rebuffed repeated requests from Amazon to meet Mr Bezos during his visit for a prime ministerial photo opportunity.On Thursday, while the CEO took part in a chummy interaction with the actor Shah Rukh Khan at a Mumbai event promoting Amazon’s Prime Video, most media focused instead on the scathing comments of India\u0027s trade minister Piyush Goyal at a security conference in Delhi.Dismissing Amazon’s announcement of $1bn investment in India, made at the start of Bezos’s trip, Mr Goyal told the audience that “it’s not as if they are doing a great favour to India”. He said Amazon had been operating at a loss of around that much over the last year, so “if they make a loss of a billion dollars every year then they jolly well have to finance that billion dollars”.On Friday, another senior politician – Vijay Chauthaiwale, the chief of the ruling BJP’s foreign affairs department – took a swipe at Mr Bezos’s Washington Post for its coverage of India, which he called “highly biased and agenda driven”.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Its national secretary, Sumit Agarwal, called Mr Bezos an “economic terrorist”.Created with Sketch.Jeff Bezos\u0027 plan for future space colonies Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An artist rendering of the future space colony that Jeff Bezos envisions as the future home of the human raceAn artist rendering of the future space colony that Jeff Bezos envisions as the future home of the human raceAn artist rendering of the future space colony that Jeff Bezos envisions as the future home of the human raceAn artist rendering of the future space colony that Jeff Bezos envisions as the future home of the human raceAn artist rendering of the future space colony that Jeff Bezos envisions as the future home of the human raceJeff Bezos introducing a life-size model of the Blue Moon, a lunar lander that could move many tons of cargo between earth and the moonAn artist rendering of Blue Moon on the surface of the moonBezos also announced that his company Blue Origin will meet the current Administration\u0027s goal of putting Americans on the Moon by 2024 with the Blue Moon lunar landerThe Blue Moon would be powered by the BE-7 engineBezos also announced that his company Blue Origin will meet the current Administration\u0027s goal of putting Americans on the Moon by 2024 with the Blue Moon lunar landerBezos also announced that his company Blue Origin will meet the current Administration\u0027s goal of putting Americans on the Moon by 2024 with the Blue Moon lunar landerAn artist rendering of the future space colony that Jeff Bezos envisions as the future home of the human raceAn artist rendering of the future space colony that Jeff Bezos envisions as the future home of the human raceAn artist rendering of the future space colony that Jeff Bezos envisions as the future home of the human raceAn artist rendering of the future space colony that Jeff Bezos envisions as the future home of the human raceAn artist rendering of the future space colony that Jeff Bezos envisions as the future home of the human raceJeff Bezos introducing a life-size model of the Blue Moon, a lunar lander that could move many tons of cargo between earth and the moonAn artist rendering of Blue Moon on the surface of the moonBezos also announced that his company Blue Origin will meet the current Administration\u0027s goal of putting Americans on the Moon by 2024 with the Blue Moon lunar landerThe Blue Moon would be powered by the BE-7 engineBezos also announced that his company Blue Origin will meet the current Administration\u0027s goal of putting Americans on the Moon by 2024 with the Blue Moon lunar landerBezos also announced that his company Blue Origin will meet the current Administration\u0027s goal of putting Americans on the Moon by 2024 with the Blue Moon lunar landerAmazon said it was “confident in our compliance” with marketplace regulations and would “welcome the opportunity to address allegations made about Amazon”.India\u0027s shopkeepers have represented a core constituency for the BJP since the early days of the party, and the comments of Mr Goyal and Mr Chauthaiwale have been widely shared by the party’s vociferous supporters online.But industry executives warned that it was a risky manoeuvre that would likely put off international investment, at a time when the country\u0027s economic growth is already projected to fall to a 11-year low this year. One unnamed leader at an American company operating in India told Reuters that Mr Goyal’s remark in particular was “clearly unbecoming, and it will hurt how the world views India as a destination”.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

For how much did they really know about each other before walking down the aisle Prince William apparently advised his more impetuous brother to wait so he could really get to know his American bride first, but Harry took umbrage and didn’t listen.Perhapshe had, he might have worked out in advance that an independent spirit joining such a restrictive institution wasn’t going to end well.Instead, they leapt before they looked and, with the “-month bride” having packed her bags already, have saddled the -year-old Queen with yet another constitutional crisis.Back in , I wrote a piece defending Meghan after she was criticised by old school friend Ninaki Priddy for being “calculated in the way she handled people and relationships” and a “curator of a beautul le”.But following the lavish baby shower, the jet-setting with A-listers and the swt jettisoning of inconveniently outspoken family members, the latter sentiment now rings true.And, of course, becoming a member of the most famous royal family in the world was the cherry on the top of that beautul le.But Meghan soon discovered it was nothing like the membership of her beloved Soho House.The rooms are draughty, the decor chintzy and, instead of reading the morning papers in your cashmere loungewear, you have to rise early, put on a frock and make your way to some rain-lashed outpost to open the new wing of a community centre where “live your best le” sentiments, however well-meaning, aren’t required.Here’s what is required as a member of the British Royal Family: Turn up on time, shake hands, smile, say little more than “have you come far ” Repeat.Not because the royals don’t have anything to say. They do, and air their views in private.But in public, their job is to shine a light on whatever project they’re visiting, not themselves. To show — via action, not virtue-signalling statements — a strong sense of duty.And inthey get to keep their ious mansions, hundreds of staff, personal bodyguards etc without any whf of civil unrest.That’s the deal.But those still in Meghan’s social circle glowingly describe her as organised, focused, and opinionated — very much an independent woman used to having her voice heard.As Prince Harry told courtiers just before their wedding: “What Meghan wants, Meghan gets.”An admirable quality when it comes to breaking through the glass ceiling of corporate le or securing the best table in the best restaurant, perhaps.But the monarchy is an institution steeped in hundreds of years of tradition, and Meghan — who claimed she “didn’t know much” about Harry when they first met — clearly thought she’d mould it to her way of thinking . . . then rapidly discovered that it ain’t for turning.Not that The Queen didn’t try very hard to accommodate the wants and needs of the newly anointed Duke and Duchess of Sussex.Contrary to royal tradition, they were permitted to keep the christening of baby Archie as a private affair and, despite there being a perfectly nice home at Kensington Palace they could have used, a publicly funded, £.million renovation of Frogmore Cottage was authorised.A “cottage” I might add, that used to be five homes but has now been knocked in to one because they managed to dodge the usual ban that prevents such moves because of the UK’s housing crisis.Shortly after, Prince Charles launched his blueprint to try to solve the dilemma faced by millions of young people struggling to find a home of their own. Oh the irony. And after all that, they now want to use it part-time as they flit back and forth across the Atlantic.Meghan is feeling disillusioned and homesick. We get it, and sympathise.But let’s not pretend, as some claim, that she’s been practically pitchforked off this island by racist bigots.This is not a racist country and, besides, the British public initially greeted her engagement and later marriage to Harry with unbridled joy.We love Harry. He’s a thoroughly decent person and deserves particular praise for the work he’s done with the Armed Forces, both while serving and afterwards.No, the disconnect has come from the fact that Meghan is still a Hollywood celebrity at heart and, consequently, never truly settled in her often boring and restrictive new role.She misses the relative freedom of her old le, not to mention her family and friends.Again, we get it. But was it really necessary to flee these shores asescaping for her le Clearly besotted with her, Harry faces the stark decision of giving her what she wants or losing her for ever. Or perhaps he’s genuinely sick of royal le and wants out too.If so, let’s wave goodbye and wish them luck.But. The have-cake-and-eat-it plan to stop being a “senior royal” and just dip in and out of duties that suit them simply isn’t going to work.SussexRoyal — which Harry and Meghan have registered as an official trademark for everything from “emotional support services” to clothing and magazines — is a title and privilege that comes with duties and conditions attached, not a brand, be it charitable or otherwise.The future of the monarchy depends on the goodwill, support and interest level of the public, and a recent survey showed that, while the majority have no issue with their decision to go, they were strongly against any continued taxpayer funding of their lavish lestyle.So— as early indicators go — The Queen allows Harry and Meghan to call the shots while keeping their royal titles, their taxpayer-funded security and an allowance from the Duchy of Cornwall, then one suspects this will be discussed by students for centuries to come as the turning point at which the British monarchy began its steady decline to irrelevance and, ultimately, abolition.MOVIE mega-star Will Smith popped in to the retirement party of a woman he last met  years ago.Anita Scipio was the receptionist at a US radio station when Will arrived for one of his first interviews as a young actor and he’s never forgotten how nice she was to him.“My favorite moments on the road are the ones where I can connect with people like @anitascipio,” -year-old Will told his Instagram followers before he walked in to the station to give her a hug.In the days before social media, someone who worked at his record company Sony told me that whenever he was in town, Will would tour the building, from post room to boardroom, giving time to everyone.He’s that rare creature, a star on screen and off.Some of today’s petulant slebs should watch and learn.FORMER psychiatric nurse Susan Evans is launching a landmark legal case to challenge consent issues around the provision of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones for under-s.She argues that children should be protected from “experimental” and “invasive medical treatment”, not least because “some children are referred despite having autism, being homosexual or suffering some form of trauma or sexual abuse”.Speaking on Radio , she added that children as young as nine were being asked to consent “to a completely experimental treatment for which long-term consequences are not known”.But gender ersity advocates warn that “a loss to trans youth is a loss to all”.Time will tell the outcome of her case but, meanwhile, in unrelated comments, I note that the actor Rupert Everett says he spent most of his early childhood wanting “to be a girl”.He adored his mother, aunt and grandmother, didn’t like men, and adds: “I loved necklaces and bras and all those kinds of things.”Then, when he reached , he “didn’t want to be a girl any more. I really enjoyed being a homosexual”.The case in point, perhaps, for treading very carefully indeed with pre-teens.POLICE officers will be required to have degrees from this year – a move that could remove , recruits from the front line while they complete their studies.Sigh. Really When it comes to tackling crime on our streets, the majority of us want someone on our side who possesses instinct, courage and common sense.Which you either have or don’t regardless of qualications.NATURISTS John and Donna Price have moved from Kent to Lincolnshire for more privacy because they like to barbecue in the nude.“I love a flambeed banana,” says Donna, .Oooer.Aren’t our AEs under enough pressure Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

While I have bought several mobile phones, I have never gone shopping for an entire telecoms network.But surely there must be other potential contractors. Don’t we have a telecoms industry of our own It doesn’t say much for the Government’s privatisation of BTit is not in the running for this sort of work.What about our own Vodafone, which I thought was one of the world leaders in mobile phone technology Evendepriving Huawei of the work meant we had to wait a little longer or pay a little extra to download a movie to our phones, that would surely be a reasonable price to pay for protecting national security.And national security policy really is at stake.Yesterday the US reaffirmed that allowing Huawei to build our G network — even parts of it which are deemed to be low- risk — would be “madness” and could compromise the willingness of the US to share vital intelligence with Britain in future.This didn’t come in one of Donald Trump’s notorious am tweets but from officials working for Matt Pottinger, the US deputy national security adviser, and Robert Blair, special representative for international telecommunications policy.That they took the trouble to visit London to warn of the dangers we could be getting ourselves into ought to be seen as a red flag on Huawei’s involvement in our G network.Surely, the importance of being able to share intelligence with our most important ally should rank above pure considerations of cost.Australia has already blocked the Chinese firm from its G network.Yet here, the head of MI Sir Andrew Parker said he had “no reason” to think Britain’s intelligence partnership with the US would sufferinvolvement from the Chinese firm was given the green light.But Defence Secretary Ben Wallace underlined at the weekend that the US administration has threatened to cut off some intelligenceBritain approves Huawei’s involvement in G.He said: “Those things will be taken into account when the Government collectively decides to make a decision on it.”Our own Government — as it has been doing since Theresa May’s day — insists that only parts of the G contract would be awarded to Huawei.It would not be allowed to work on security-critical areas.But that isn’t good enough. Such is the complexity of modern telecommunications networks that it would be impossible to be sure that systems installed in one part of the network were not enabling data to be obtained from another.Whoever designs and builds a telecommunications system gains the power to interfere with it, or even switch it off, should it feel inclined.Of course, with modern communications a huge amount of damage can be done from afar.Evenwe are confident our broadband network is secure now, we can’t be certain that would remain the case.A company which installs a telecommunications network will necessarily continue to be involved in maintaining and upgrading the network it had designed and installed.We have to be absolutely sure the network is not being used for some underhand purpose.Huawei denies that it is controlled by the Chinese state, and has threatened to sue commentators in France whom it alleges have made that claim.But the precise relationship between Huawei and the Chinese state is hardly the point.What is certain is that China is not a democracy and there is always going to be a security issue when it comes to involving its industrial giants in sensitive work here.We would not allow a Chinese company, say, to build fighter jets for the RAF or to construct our radar defence system.This kind of work is rightly the preserve of contractors on whom we can rely totally, even in times of international conflict.Such is the importance of telecommunications in military and civil defence that we now have to think of mobile networks in the same light.The Government has been warning for years that cyber warfare is the big coming threat.In  it published a Strategic Defence Review which defined cyber attack as a “Tier One” threat alongside terrorism.Last November, the US and Taiwanese held a joint exercise in fending off a major cyber attack on Taiwan.At the time the Taiwanese Cyber Security Agency said it was the subject of an astonishing million cyber attacks every month, half of which came from the Chinese mainland.So why, then, is our own Government even considering commissioning a Chinese company to install a telecommunications network Of course, Boris Johnson is right to make it clear he is not Donald Trump’s poodle.We don’t have to take notice of everything the Americans say, on defence, trade or anything .But when it comes to our closest ally warning us that it might not want to share intelligence with us in futurewe let a Chinese company build our G network, we very much do need to take notice.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He agrees with the broad sentiment which Harry has put forward.It comes just days after the Home Secretary, Priti Patel, said she did not believe the Duchess was a victim of media racism.The Home Secretary said Britain is a “great country full of opportunity” for people whatever their race or background.Ms Patel – Britain’s first female ethnic minority Home Secretary – said she does not think there has been any “racism”.She told BBC Radio  Live: “I am not in that category at all where I believe there has been racism.“I think we live in a great country, a great society, full of opportunity where people of every background can get on in le.”Askedthe media had been racist, she replied: “I don’t think so, no.“I certainly haven’t seen that through any debates or commentary or things of that nature.”Ms Patel, who was born in London to a Ugandan-Indian family, added: “As someone brought up in Britain, as someone from an immigrant background I think Britain is a country of tremendous opportunity.“Everyone has a perception of what they read in the press, but I certainly don’t see that.”"},{"url":null,"title":"harry wake up think what have i done liddle","story":"But that should surely be a fairly simple matter. Harry and Meghan have said they wish to be “independent”. A lot of time has been spent working out how that independence can be achieved.Well, here’s the thing. I have a cunning plan for the Sussexes as to how they might be “independent”.What you need to do is get something called a “job”.If you get one of those they give you money which you can use to buy things — a house, some Pot Noodles, a Hot Wheels car racing set — anything, really, within reason.  Remarkable, isn’t it It probably wouldn’t pay for the £million Canadian mansion Meghan is holed up in right now — but they can always ponce a few freebies off their mega-rich friends.It might not quite cover the legal costs Meghan may incur from her upcoming court case. She’s suing a newspaper and her dad is set to testy AGAINST her.You have to say she has a knack, this lass, of getting on the wrong side of quite a few people.I think it’s fair to guess that the Royal Family are not entirely happy with her right now. So she’s hacked off her new family much as she’s hacked off her own one.It’s no huge surprise they’re both heading off to “Canada” .Meghan seems not to like the UK very much. She doesn’t spend much time in it and my suspicion is that the local people haven’t entirely taken to her.We had a bit of time for Harry, once. He seemed an amiably thick rugger-bugger with a mischievous sense of humour. Not any more, sadly.He seems to spend half of his time crying. And he also seems to have swallowed whole the air-headed, ultra-woke, touchy-feely drivel his we has imported from the United States.Still, we were happy to spend an extortionate sum doing up their “cottage” with the most expensive materials money could buy. And we were delighted to see photographs of young Archie — once we were allowed to by madam.For someone who dislikes the starchy formality of the Royal Family, Meghan displays quite a few airs and graces, doesn’t she Hates being photographed and gets her bullying minders to stop people taking snaps. Loves being photographed when she’s promoting herself or her vacuous ideas.But hey, they love each other and that’s the important thing.Let them move to Canada or LA, where they can jabber to each other about climate change and how everyone who doesn’t like her is racist, until the cows come home.But let them do it entirely independently. No money from the Duchy of Cornwall Estate. No royal stipend. No security staff paid for by the taxpayers, either here or there.Let them be truly independent, which is what they seem to wish for.Maybe they’ll find it liberating. Or maybe in a year or two Prince Harry will wake up and think: Crikey, what have I done.DO you remember when you first had a McDonald’s  I remember very well. I was  and had just come down to London from Middlesbrough.My girlfriend told me about these wonderful things called Big Macs. I tried one – couldn’t believe how delicious it was. So I bought another, and then another.Stood there, stuffing my fat face, eyes wide with delight.As the years go by, the pleasure diminishes a little – there’s nothing better than tasting something delicious for the first time.So lucky, lucky people of Rutland. The UK’s smallest county is to have its first ever McDonald’s.A lot of poncey residents opposed this happening because they said it would “lower the tone” of the county.Now the snobs can find out what they’ve been missing all these years.RIVETED with excitement by the Labour leadership contest  It’s a real humdinger, isn’t it I had rather hoped David Lammy would stand, just to give us all a laugh. Sadly, he’s not going to.Ultra Trot Clive Lewis has pulled out. But Emily Thornberry, above – Lady Nugee to you, you lowly serf – is through to the next round.If she wins it will be the final nail in the coffin of this once-great party.SO, Manchester City’s underperforming stars hired a whole bunch of Instagram “models” to attend a party at some posh place in Cheshire.Flew them over from Italy, shoved them in a hotel, Bob’s yer uncle.The wives and girlfriends of the players were not invited to this party. Lovely bunch, footballers, aren’t they And was all of this sanctioned by the supposedly progressive and right-on manager, Pep Guardiola “That was not what I meant, Senor Aguero, when I said you had to get in the box more often.” HERE is yet another Re-moaner head case for you. Liberal Democrat peer Lord Greaves.He has said he fears Britain will be reminiscent of Nazi Germany when we finally leave the European Union. Yup, that’s a sane and rational judgment, you bearded loon.He added: “People are crying when they go to sleep at night and when they wake up in the morning, and all they get from the unfeeling, hard-headed Tories is moans.“They are feeling a sense of loss which is akin to bereavement, and a grieving process has only just begun.“In these circumstances, triumphalistic behaviour, festivals of Brexit and all the rest will simply make things worse.”Who is crying  What bereavement process  What kind of drugs is Lord Greaves taking Let’s all go round to his gaff on January  with a few cans of Stella and try to cheer him up.A BRITISH mum is leading a fightback against the drive to make our children cretins.The unnamed woman went on Mumsnet to explain that she turns the house wi off at .pm every night.And tells her three kids – the oldest is  – to read a book instead. Good for her. Children seem to use the internet for just three things.Bitching about thots in their school. And sending snap-shots of their genitals to -year-old men who are pretending to be teenagers.THERE was a rather cheering plan to ring out the church bells across the land to mark our escape from the European Union at the end of the month.But a bunch of bishops have said we shouldn’t do that because the bells should only be used to summon the faithful to worship.With the greatest of respect, your reverend, b*****ks. You can tell it’s nothing to do with that by their comments.One said: “Two thirds of the population never voted for Brexit in the first place. It’s deeply isive to ring church bells for something like this.”Yeah, Bish – we have a habit in this country of only counting the votes of people who voted, you mimsy frock-wearing halfwit.Another said: “I think we should be ringing bells on February , not to celebrate Brexit but to call people together to pray for our nation at this critical time.”Ah, go shove your bells up your cassock, you miserable Remoaner God-bothering bores.A UKRAINIAN bloke woke up one morning to discover a large metal nut around his old fella.His we had placed it there during the night to stop him shagging other women. And presumably her.It seems to have worked. He couldn’t get the thing off. So he went to hospital where they removed it with a circular saw which spat out sparks as it tore through the metal.I don’t think his todger will be doing very much at all for the foreseeable future.He should have kept the thing on.

The distinctive peal from its massive, .-ton bell is a part of the soundtrack of our public le.But sadly, it now seems likely that the advent of Brexit will be met by silence from Big Ben.If the parliamentary authorities have their way, no sound will echo from the clock tower on that momentous night.Since , the building has been undergoing a major renovation programme, including the installation of a lt, resurfacing of the dials, and restoration of the clock mechanism.According to the House of Commons Commission, which oversees the Westminster estate, the cost of interrupting this work to enable Big Ben to chime for Brexit would be more than £,.We are told this huge bill arises because of the need to install a temporary floor in the belfry to support the chiming equipment — as well as the impact of delays, for up to four weeks, in the renovation project.In the view of pessimistic officialdom, the whole idea of the Brexit chimes is just too expensive.As Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the new Speaker of the Commons, put it this week, “You are talking about £, a bong.”The arch-Remainers have, predictably, seized on the problem with glee.For them, the entire business is just like Brexit itself — a pointless, costly distraction.That negativity is shared by large parts of the civil service and Westminster establishment.Viewing Brexit with horror, they seek to prevent any inspirational commemoration of the event.So the supposed heavy costs give them the perfect excuse to do nothing, just as they used bureaucratic stalemate to thwart Brexit for years.Indeed, the Big Ben dficulty can be seen as ato Project Fear, once more, where dire financial warnings are deployed to frighten the public into inaction.But the British people did not give in to Project Fear , and they should not be cowered by more alarmism this time.The shrill negative voice of Remainers had dominated for too long.After the decisive General Election last month, that is the noise that should be hushed, not the chimes of Big Ben.Expressions of national pride are a force for benevolence and unity, as we witnessed in the recent cricket World Cup triumph.Despite all the Remainer gloom, there is a tremendous yearning to celebrate British-ness.That spirit can also be seen in the broad popular support for the idea of a new Festival of Britain, in , to extol the values of our nation.Once again, just as with their negativity over Big Ben, the pro-EU brigade sneered at the concept as nothing more than a Festival of Brexit, which could only enshrine entrenched isions.But in reality, just like the successful post-war Festival of Britain in , the  Festival could achieve the very opposite, by enabling us to reconnect with our identity, heritage and future.The same can be true of the Brexit chimes on January . It can be an occasion for joy and openness, not misery and fearfulness.Boris Johnson’s suggestion that the £, bill could be met by an appeal to the public is being scuppered by senior officials.In his usual inimitable style, Boris had asked for crowd-funding citizens to “bung a bob for a Big Ben bong”. There were signs the campaign could be taking off.The passionate Euro-sceptic MP Mark Francois pledged £,, while there was also speculation that millionaires such as Lord Ashcroft and Wetherspoon pub chain boss Tim Martin could make large donations.Officials yesterday said there was “no legal basis” for using public donations. So why shouldn’t the Government chip in  After all, the state is used to bankrolling exceptional national events, often at a far bigger cost.A reported £million went on Meghan and Harry’s wedding in .Most of that was swallowed up by security, but £, alone went on her bridal dress — which is not far off the cost of the Big Ben bongs.Similarly, the bill for the chimes is barely a quarter of the more than £million estimated to be spent on the official London fireworks display on New Year’s Eve.But before any money is handed over by the public or Treasury, the huge potential bill — £, to get the bell to chime, plus the £, cost of delays to the tower’s repair — must be challenged.In all kinds of major projects, because of weak management, contractors and consultants often expand the budgets for their own interests.We have seen that process with the HS rail link, now on course to cost over £billion, while even with the renovation of Big Ben the project’s bill has risen from an original £million to £million.On Tuesday night, one former project manager in Parliament said the estimate for the chimes had been absurdly inflated.“I cannot believe the costs you’re talking about,” he told LBC radio.The can-do, anti-establishment outlook ensured the victory of Brexit. With the same imagination and drive, the campaign for the Big Ben chimes can succeed.In fact, it could be the cue for a string of other celeb-rations across our land on January , like bonfires, fire-work displays or big screen-ings in city squares.But at the centre of it all has to be the Westminster clock tower. As Nigel Farage put it, “If Big Ben doesn’t sound, our country looks like a joke.”The miserabilists and pessimists must not get their way.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We will not dilute our high standards of food safety and animal welfare.“In our forthcoming trade negotiations, this Government will be prepared to walk away from those negotiationsthat is in the national interest.”No added last night: “We have made this commitment a number of times. There will be no reduction in food standards after Brexit”.Meanwhile, Europe’s Trade Commissioner Phil Hogan yesterday tore in to the PM’s hopes of getting a full trade deal with the EU in place by the end of the year, dubbing it “just not possible”.Irish politician Mr Hogan insisted: “Certainly by the end of the year we are not going to get everything that’s in the -page document on the future relationship agreed, because Prime Minister Johnson decided we are going to have everything concluded by the end of the year.”Calling on Mr Johnson to change his mind and agree to extend the transition period for longer talks, he added: “I think we’ve seen that putting ourselves into timelines in the last few years have not been that helpful, especially in the way it played out in the House of Commons”.The skirmish came as German leader Angela Merkel warned Brussels that Brexit is “a wake up call” for the EU.The German Chancellor said she was worried the UK could pose a serious economic threat to the EU, and the bloc has to lt its game to stay relevant.Remainers’ scaremongering over America’s “chlorinated chicken” was a ruse to obstruct Brexit. The left piled in for another chance to attack Trump.But it is simply not a “lower standard” of food, as .million Brits who visit the US each year will attest. US chicken treated with an extremely dilute chlorine solution has a far lower rate of ­salmonella infection than EU chicken.Nor is it credible to complain that the practice disguises unacceptable cruelty in the mass production of poultry, given how blithely we accept our own.Brexit Britain must be open to deals with America and everywhere . That involves importing their produce.Of course consumers must not be exposed to inferior or unsafe grub.But let’s deal in facts, not politically driven hysteria. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There was an almighty crash, it sounded like Armageddon was going on outside.It went very quickly from just normal storm and wind noise to sounding like a freight train was hitting our window.There was a loud crack and the whole house felt like it was buffering.Our bedroom windows have been pushed in, the UPVC support structures are broken and we have fence and roof damage.Well have to pay to for a new fence and we have people from the insurance company coming round later about the other damage.The main thing is that nobody was injured as far as we know but it was really scary while it was going on.Just last month a family feared for their lives as a freak tornado smashed into  homes in Surrey.A spokesman for the Met Office said: We cannot say definitelya tornado formed or not. The weather conditions at this time were conducive to the formation of funnel clouds or tornadoes.Around  tornadoes a year are reported in the UK. These are typically small and short-lived, but can cause structural damagethey pass over built-up areas.The strength of the winds of up to mph shook numerous houses, sending roof tiles smashing to the ground.A ft long brick wall collapsed under the strength of the gusts while fence  were flung through the air.Part of a garden shed that had been picked up by the tornado smashed a hole through the windscreen of a car.Radar images taken at the time suggest the damage was caused by a tornado, and it has been reported to Torro - The UKs leading tornado and storm research group.Among their ranks is weather forecaster Paul Knightley, who works for DTN Weather - the organisation behind the BBCs forecasts.Mr Knightley said: There were big and heavy showers at the time in question and the damage reported does tie up.When damage is in a clear track - as appears to be the case here - it is more often than not the result of a tornado.I would say it is probable there was one here and the the type of damage reported is consistent with weak, low level tornadoes.Its impossible to say what the exact wind speeds were at the time but my guess would be between mph and mph.Annette OFlynn said: Our garden shed was totally demolished in Seaward Avenue. It felt like the whole house moved and it was very scary.Stephen Maskell said: We were woken by something which sounded like an express train thundering past the house and gravel hitting the windows.It bought down our front fence including snapping a concrete post in half, breaking ridge tiles on the roof and dislodging tiles.

Something she felt she couldnt be in the Royal Family confines.“She said she didn’t want Archie picking up on her stress and anxiety. She felt like it was a toxic environment for him because there was too much tension and pent-up frustrations.”Now, the friend says, Meghan feels she can do as she pleases again without following royal protocols and seeking permission.The Duchess “has a lot up her sleeve that she wants to do” once she moves to North America.She plans to campaigning on issues close to her heart — like the two organisations for vulnerable women and children in Vancouver where she made her first post-Megxit visits on Tuesday.Outside the arrivals area at the airport, Meghan chatted animatedly for ten minutes to a royal protection officer before Heather arrived and jumped into the rear seat.She greeted her pal — thought to be one of five friends trusted to brief a magazine on the rt with her father Thomas — with a hug.One onlooker said: “Meghan looked completely relaxed as though she hasn’t a care in the world.There were two other cars in a convoy which pulled up outside arrivals but Meghan was at the wheel — she looks like a woman who likes to be in control.”The pals will spend time relaxing with Meghan and eight-month-old Archie at the £million beachside retreat where they are holed up.Harry is likely to join them early next week after finalising the Megxit deal which will allow them to spend much of their time abroad and be financially independent.Old pal Heather, from San Antonio, Texas, lives in Calornia where she owns six pilates studios and became Meghans instructor before she met future husband Harry.Heather was a regular contributor to Meghans lestyle site, The Tig and featured regularly on her pre-royal le Instagram account.The pair were pictured enjoying playful pilates workouts in panamas on the beach.

It would be perfect for her, Harry and little Archie.“The neighbourhood is known a haven for wealthy people and has a very laid-back atmosphere. I’m sure they would be very happy there, and they would be welcomed with open arms.”A Vancouver-based property source said: “The house is a real gem in Kitsilano - one of the most desirable neighbourhoods in Vancouver.“The area is particularly sought after by super-rich and image conscious young achievers.“It’s close to Kitsilano beach, which is a very cool spot that does stuff like beach yoga in the summer.“But best of all for Harry and Meghan, it’s quiet and locals respect each other and value their privacy.“They’d fit in very well.”The huge -year-old residence is at the heart of a prized billionaire’s row dubbed “Golden Miles”.Its estate agency description boasts “luxurious living on four expansive levels” and “a sensational indoor outdoor lestyle like no other with incredible walk-out view-side terraces.”A private guest suite has been created on the upper level offering more floor-to-ceiling window views across the bay towards Vancouver’s downtown.Harry, , and -year-old Meghan are set to snap up the property for a knockdown price after new tax rules on top-end homes sparked a  per cent drop in value in the area over two years.Their near neighbours would include Canadian billionaire founder of the uber-trendy Lululemon Athletica yoga gear brand, Chip Wilson, whose mansion is worth £ million.Yoga and pilates fan Meg is known to be a fan of the Lululemon brand.Kitsilano - full of rich and famous “movers and shakers” and particularly popular with trendy tech entrepreneurs - is seen as a perfect setting for her new le.The mansion is far cry from sedate, Grade II listed Frogmore Cottage in the grounds of Home Park, Windsor.The Queen is said to be privately furious at the money spent on Frogmore Cottage renovations following Prince Harry and Meghans announcement they are moving abroad.The royal couple have lived there since their publicly-funded £.million wedding.Taxpayers also shelled out another £.million to fully modernise the historic -year-old property installing luxuries including organic gender neutral paint for Archie’s nursery.Sources claim Her Majesty is angry at the amount spent, now that the couple intend to start a new le in Canada.The couple will lose the £million-a-year from the taxpayer-funded Sovereign Grant as they are stepping down from senior roles.But they are set to bring in millions from lucrative commercial deals, which will be added to their already staggering £million fortune.This comes as they said how they wanted to become financially independent.Despite breaking ties with the royals, its believed they will still be entitled to security, paid for by the taxpayer to the tune of around £,.And its thought theyll keep receiving £million-a-year from Prince Charles through his private Duchy of Cornwall estate.Prince Harry is believed to be worth around £.million and Meghan an estimated £.million thanks to her acting career.On their new website, they talk about their new working model and have hinted at setting up a charity.The website said: The Duke and Duchess of Sussex take great pride in their work and are committed to continuing their charitable endeavours as well as establishing new ones.In addition, they value the ability to earn a professional income, which in the current structure they are prohibited from doing.For this reason they have made the choice to become members of the royal family with financial independence.Their Royal Highnesses feel this new approach will enable them to continue to carry out their duties for Her Majesty the Queen, while having the future financial autonomy to work externally.The duchess is reported to have never been happy at the luxurious home where she has spent only around six months since it was painstakingly refurbished to her taste.And she expected never toto it once her longed-for Megxit deal is finalised after The Sun revealed its staff were being axed.Prospective neighbours of the Sussexes offered words of welcome last night.Local Stephanie Carros, , told The Sun: “I’d be good with it! But I think people here are pretty low key about celebrities.”“This street - particularly on this side, looking over the water - is the pièce de resistance of Vancouver.”Another local, John, , said: “This street is very well to do. From this side, you can look right over the water - and it’s a quiet neighbourhood.”“If Harry and Meghan were my next door neighbour, and having lots of parties with their friends, I wouldn’t be too pleased.“The prospect interests but doesn’t excite me as I’m not an enthusiastic royalist.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It seems like such a waste for them to walk away.This week, Harry launched his Invictus Games with suitably stirring music and a passionate voiceover that showed how much he cares about this terric project, which helps wounded servicemen and women from all over the world.It is such a positive and effective way to give these heroes real purpose. Harry has been the driving force since it was little more than an idea on the back of a fag packet.The next day she made a low-key visit to young girls campaigning to combat climate change.Meghan was relaxed, caring and didn’t look for special treatment.Her visits were without pomp and fuss. You can tell it meant the world to everyone she encountered.She could easily have stayed in her mansion on Vancouver Island, closed the curtains and spent her days being pampered.Instead, she got up off her bottom and tried to do a bit of good for causes she cares about.It is admirable — but would the world have been as interestedthey were just plain old Harry and Meghan, without the aura of royalty And will the world’s Press still give such deserving causes the same level of attention this time next yearHarry and Meghan are no longer members of the Firm I’m not so sure. That’s why I would love them to slam on the brakes and reconsider their position.They can always rehire the staff axed from Frogmore House, especially as a move to Canada as “quasi royals” doesn’t look as welcoming as they first thought.Bedazzled PM Justin Trudeau at first promised that the famed Mounties would provide security and protection, but he has had to embarrassingly roll back on his offer and, while the extremely polite Canadians are happy to have Harry and Meghan as guests, they aren’t so keen on footing the bill to have them there permanently.The Queen would be thrilled to have her grandson back and the chance to get to know her great-grandson Archie properly.She would want to buy him his first pony and watch him learn to ride. He could grow up with his cousins George, Charlotte and Louis and be a proper part of the family.There are obviously tensions, hurt feelings and resentments within this clan. But surely the terribly British passive-aggressive arguments and niggles could be ironed out.It can’t really be too late to wipe the slate clean and start afresh.The first thing to be done is for Harry and Meghan to drop that daft court case against a British newspaper which printed a letter she had written to her dad, after he ­voluntarily handed it over.No one is going to come out of that fight with any dignity, and we don’t want to see Thomas Markle forced to give evidence against his daughter in court. They should concentrate their energies instead on trying to salvage their relationship, though I fear that ship has sailed.And brothers William and Harry need to go for a beer and sort out their gripes.Harry also needs to get back in touch with his old pals, who have been fiercely loyal and deeply hurt at being airbrushed out of his le.Surely an agreement can be hammered out which sees Harry and Meghan able to pursue their own causes without being stled by the Palace hierarchy, but also with everyone singing from the same song sheet and not constantly upstaging each other.I know the Queen wants Harry and Meghan’s new roles to be cut and dried as quickly as possible, with minimum fuss. But maybe what is needed is a bit of breathing space. Harry is due to go back to Canada in a couple of days to be reunited with Meghan and their young son.It might be a forlorn hope, but I would dearly like to see them having a rethink about their future and come back in from the Canadian cold.It would be a shamepride and stubbornness on both sides stopped them as I believe they would still get a warm welcome from the vast majority of us. It’s not too late.CAN we all just take a minute to salute the absolute force of nature that is Sun Online columnist and BBC presenter Deborah James Deborah has just been declared cancer-free – three years after a diagnosis of incurable bowel cancer and being given an EIGHT per cent chance of survival.Deborah is a walking miracle who has rewritten the textbooks and is giving hope to others living with the disease.She is also one of the kindest, sunniest, most decent women I know.She co-hosts the unmissable podcast You, Me And The Big C and is a regular on my TV show, where her funny, honest appearances have saved lives.Deborah takes every chance to spell out the symptoms of bowel cancer and encourage people not to be embarrassed about seeing a doctorthey notice any changes in their bowel movements.She has even laughingly nicknamed herself “Bowel Babe” to sht the silly stigma Brits feel about bums.As a result, people have had cancer detected early enough to get effective treatment, extending their lives.Sadly, Deborah’s heady news does not mean she is cured.This disease can rear its ugly head again, as Deborah knows all too well.But I hope she spends this weekend celebrating with friends, family and a large glass of wine, or by buying herself a sassy outfit and handbag.She’s a true inspiration. I’m proud to know her.She lost st after realising she was too heavy and wanted to be healthier for her son.Being overweight subjects you to all kinds of health problems. It is not about fat-shaming.You need to be sensible and take care of yourself.Adele has grafted to provide for her child and now has literally worked her ar*e off to make sure she is around for as long as possible. Good on her.THE new James Bond film is still a long way off, but speculation about who will succeed pouty Daniel Craig as  is reaching fever pitch.It seems that any cute actor to ever wear a tuxedo could be up for the part. My favourites for the role include Britain’s most handsome man Idris Elba, right – obviously – as well as Scotsman Richard Madden and the delectable Andrew Scott.Andrew was a villain in Bond’s previous big-screen outing, ’s Spectre, but let’s not hold that against him.If EastEnders’ Ben Mitchell can have SIX dferent heads over the years, we can surely ignore the slight inconvenience of Andrew’s scheming tech-terrorist trying to bump off all of MI.James Norton is another contender, but I have taken issue with him since catching up with The Trial Of Christine Keeler on BBC.It’s a slightly schlocky take on the infamous Sixties scandal involving the Tory cabinet minister John Profumo, who had a sexual relationship with Christine when she was just  – at the same time that she was “romantically linked” with Russian spy Yevgeny Ivanov.James plays society osteopath Stephen Ward, who acted as a sort of posh pimp and introduced Christine to Profumo in the first place. He is super-creepy in the series, with an intensely irritating habit of calling Christine “little baby” in almost every sentence.If you watch the show and sink a drink every time he utters those annoying words, you will be sloshed about ten minutes into each episode.It has taken the shine off Mr Norton for me, so I’m afraid he has to go to the back of the Bond queue.I AM convinced that when The Masked Singer’s Octopus character takes off its head, it will be revealed as model actress singer Caprice.I have absolutely no insider knowledge and only say this because Caprice actually released a single in the late Nineties.While doing the promotion rounds, on GMTV she very gamely warbled her song on a freezing beach while wearing not very much – in one of that show’s many fabulously surreal segments.If Caprice could cope with all that, then dressing up as a giant, eight-tentacled creature that can squirt black ink from its bottom would be a breeze.HUGH GRANT, who was absolutely brilliant in Paddington , is entitled to his opinion, like everyone . But I take real issue with him perpetuating the myth that tragic Princess Diana was “effectively killed” by British tabloid newspapers.Diana died in an accident because she was being driven by a drunk and didn’t have her seatbelt fastened. She had been stripped of her HRH title, which meant she didn’t have proper security, while the car was being driven too fast in a bid to elude bottom-feeding French paparazzi.To say the British Press were purely to blame is outrageous. And as Hugh Grant’s accusation went unchallenged during his appearance on US TV, most Americans will take it as gospel.They tend to believe posh actors who speak with cut-glass, upper-class accents.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We loved them.And then there was Amazon and Netflix, who realised thatwe were going to give them our money, they’d better bloody well give us some brilliant, intelligent shows in .

Right now,you’re a fan, you must pay BT, Sky and Amazon to stay in touch.That’s expensive, especially as you are also forced to pay your licence fee for a service that offers almost no live football at all. Or decent sport of any kind.To fight back against the onslaught of choice, the BBC has announced that by  . . . ready . . . drum roll . . . two-thirds of its staff will be based outside London.So what  Sure, you can have a technology hub in Newcastle and locate your Sounds app in Salford butall the decisions are still being made in Islington, over a plate of nuclear-free, vegetarian peace kale, it won’t make any dference.The fact is that the BBC is effectively governed by the monoculture that is social media. It’s ­terried of offending Twitter, so it abides by the rules.Far-right politics are bad. Far-left politics are fine. Veganism is good. Donald Trump is not.You get the impression thatthe BBC made The Crown, the Queen would be played by that guy in a wheelchair from Countryfile and Prince Philip by Idris Elba.And all they’d ever talk about, because all anyone ever talks about on any BBC show, is bloody climate change.I know it’s very noble but after a while, it becomes wearing. And I find myself sitting there ­thinking: “Oh for God’s sake, can’t they just have sex ”No. Obviously, no one can have sex on the BBC because a baby might result. And babies need food which, of course, causes global warming.The BBC was set up to “inform, educate and entertain”. Not “lecture, bombard and lecture again”.It’s got to the point now where the only BBC programmes I regularly watch are Pointless and Match Of The Day.I can’t even bring myself to listen to Attenborough any more. In the past, it was: “Look at this amazing fish which can breathe through its anus.”Now, it is: “Look at this amazing fish that can breathe through its anus and which is threatened by climate change.”Soon, it’s entirely possible the licence fee will become voluntary and when it does, the BBC will quickly learn that to ­survive it must make shows people want to watch.That’s people everywhere, not just ­Twitter people in a Shoreditch juice bar.Killing Eve. Fleabag. Earth’s Tropical Islands. More of that.And less of everything .So it’s good to see Meghan’s still working hard on behalf of those with mental-health issues.I’LL be honest. When it seemed likely that Mr Corbyn would win the General Election, I briefly entertained the idea of emigrating.I figured that there’d be no point living in the UKthe Government was going to take all my earnings and savings in tax.I even went so far as to go online and look at properties for sale in Italy. They all looked lovely – old stone farmhouses with pools – and all for less than a one-bedroom flat in Harpenden.But then I started to think: “Hang on. I don’t have any friends or family in Italy, so in about two hours I’d be lonely.”Then, the next day I’d drown my loneliness with a lunchtime drink, and then another.I’d make a rule that there’d be no drinking before , but soon I’d make that am.And within a month, I’d be pouring red wine on my cornflakes. Within a year, I’d be in a hospital trying to say, in Italian, to a doctor: “Please can I have a new liver ”I’m telling you all this because Harry and Meghan probably think le will be peachy by the sea in Canada.But home is where your friends are.And Harry’s friends, at least, are in the UK. He’s going to miss them. A lot. I guarantee it.WE have learned from American news footage that when there’s a small flood or some wind, we must go on the news and wail like stuck pigs about the injustice of it all.It makes me so angry that even my hair starts to itch.So I was delighted this week to see that when some floods came to the area where Jodie Kidd lives, she simply rolled up her trousers and carried on as normal.It does help, mind you, that she’s taller than The Shard.FOR reasons known only to a lunatic, it would cost £, to ring the bell in Big Ben to celebrate our departure from the EU.Hmmm. Seeing as the tower is currently hidden behind a million tons of scaffolding, why doesn’t someone go up there with a CD player and some big speakers We’d never know.THERE was further proof this week that the stock market is mad and everyone involved with it is Wolf Of Wall Street bonkers.Because apparently, City types now give Tesla a higher valuation than Ford and General Motors combined.Even though the electric minnow takes three months to produce what the big boys produce in a week.And is run by a dope enthusiast who calls random strangers “pedos” on social media. And gets away with it.A FRIEND of mine was driving along a dual carriageway this week when his super-green hybrid BMW i decided to have an electric duck fit.The power steering and power brakes both failed and it was only by using Herculean force he was able to coast, eventually, to a halt on the grass verge.He tells me that BMW hopes to have the car back to him very soon.But he’s not sure he wants it.

His approach to Brexit night on January  reflects that.Rather than being out with Nigel Farage and Co in Parliament Square, he will address the nation on this momentous moment from Downing Street.I am told the message will be upbeat but he will also try to reach out and reassure those who voted Remain. It would be tempting for Boris to join in some full New Year’s Eve-style celebration. And there are undoubtedly Leave voters who would love him to do just that.The danger is that this might alienate those who voted Remain but who have now reconciled themselves to the result and want to help the country pull together.What is key is that in the coming weeks, the Government shows it knows what it wants to do to improve voters’ lives. Boris must put meat on the bones of his plan to “level-up” infrastructure and opportunity across the country.He must show he knows not only how to keep the ­economy growing but how to get it out of second gear, which it has been stuck in — along with most of the West — since the financial crisis of .The next few months present a remarkable opportunity for the PM. He has a sizeable ­parliamentary majority and a united government, while both Labour and the Lib Dems are absorbed by their own leadership contests.This is his moment to really crack on.THIS week, the European Union Trade Commissioner Phil Hogan said it is “just not possible” to conclude everything on the UK’s future relationship with the EU by the December  deadline for the end of the transition period.But the UK and the EU both agreed to that timeframe in the political declaration.The EU shouldn’t have signed up to itthey didn’t think it was possible to agree things by that date.Boris Johnson is determined not to extend this transition period.He feels the whole process has gone on too long already. So there needs to be some compromise to keep things moving.What is key is that at the end of this year the UK is no longer sending millions to the EU every day the UK determines its own immigration policy and the role of the European Court of Justice in the UK ends on all matters other than the rights of EU citizens.THE Royal Family is in its worst crisis since the death of Diana.By contrast, Boris Johnson is determined to stay out of the current drama.BORIS JOHNSON’S refusal of Nicola ­Sturgeon’s demands for a second Scottish independence ­referendum was definitive.But it will become very hard to ­continue to refuse those callsthe SNP wins a majority at next year’s Scottish Parliament elections, in a campaign dominated by the ­question of whether or not there should be a second referendum.On a list of things that could derail this Government, Scotland is very high up the list.The best way to stop that happening is for the Tories, along with the other unionist parties, to deny the SNP an absolute majority at Holyrood in .That will require the Government to pay more attention to ­Scotland and be more prepared to call out the SNP on its ­domestic policy failures.THE first public hustings of the Labour leadership contest take place today – and the race looks set to be hard fought.A survey this week putting Shadow ­Business Secretary Rebecca Long Bailey ­narrowly ahead has dented the idea that Shadow Brexit ­Secretary Keir Starmer has it in the bag. It doesn’t look like the contest is going to be a particularly comradely affair.The personal jabs are already coming and the election isn’t over until April. Starmer and Long Bailey are the two front- runners. The Tories believe both candidates provide them with opportunities.Long Bailey wants to continue the Corbyn project. She will not bring Labour back towards the mainstream of British politics. Starmer, though, is the architect of the parliamentary manoeuvring on Brexit and the second ­referendum policy that hurt Labour so badly in those Red Wall constituencies lost in the election.As one Tory grandee puts it: “If they go for Keir, they’re locking in a problem with those Leave-voting seats.”The dark horse is Lisa Nandy. She performed best in the hustings for Labour MPs, put in a far better performance with interviewer Andrew Neil than Jeremy Corbyn did and is picking up some interesting endorsements.The longer this contest goes on, the better she will do. But even Nandy is making missteps and ­providing the Tories with ammunition in the event she becomes leader.This week, she defended free movement. She claimed voters in towns of the North and Midlands weren’t really opposed to it.This flies in the face of the fact that so many of these places voted Leave in , then flipped to the Tories in last month’s “Brexit election”.Nandy won’t pay an immediate price for this misstep, as most Labour members are pro-free movement themselves.But her decision to speak out shows how focused the contest is on Labour’s “selectorate” and not the broader electorate.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Here, we reveal some exclusive extracts.PEOPLE always ask me about the weirdest injuries I’ve seen.Well, I once went out to a man who claimed he had “snapped his k**b”.We whisked him off to hospital. I’m taking his word for it. I wasn’t going to start inspecting it.I’ve also been out to a fair few snapped banjo strings — or, more correctly, frenulums — which are the small tags of skin between the foreskin and the shaft of a penis.One minute someone is making sweet love, the next the sheets are covered in claret.We tell the patient to wrap their old chap in a tea towel and hop on the ambulance.You wouldn’t believe some of the nonsense we get sent to.I’ve heard of someone wanting an ambulance to be sent to resuscitate a dead pigeon, help find someone’s trousers, deal with a hedgehog in a garden, treat someone whose feet were bleeding from wearing new shoes and fix a dislodgedfinger nail.ONE Sunday afternoon, we get a call to a carvery restaurant. Our screen simply said: Male choking.When we swing the doors open, the waft of carvery — old, sweaty veg and cheap lager — almost knocks us backwards.Down his throat I can see a big piece of steak. I pull out my mini-Hoover and suck out the gravy, before pulling out my special forceps and fishing out the offending item.We ventilate the patient and a couple of minutes later he’s sat up talking. As we’re pushing him towards the exit, the whole restaurant erupts into cheering and clapping. I feel like an actor leaving the stage after a triumphant opening night.I COULDN’T tell you how many people I’ve seen dead on a toilet.It wasn’t just Elvis Presley who breathed his last on the throne. It’s so common, we call it the “death poo”.We went to one woman in a care home who died mid-evacuation. The family were on their way, so me and my partner lugged the woman over to the bed and tucked her in, so she looked nice and peaceful.SEEING my first dead body is etched on my mind. I thought people died with their eyes shut, but this guy is staring straight at the ceiling.I’m stood there thinking, “What happens next ”, when my partner does something humbling: He closes the man’s eyes.Back downstairs, my partner breaks the bad news to the dead man’s we: “Your husband has passed away in his sleep. He wouldn’t have known anything about it.”An ambulance person’s job isn’t just to treat the injured and sick. It is also to bring calm and dignity and counsel the bereaved.A MESSAGE comes though: Seven-week-old child, not breathing. cardiac arrest.I switch on the blue lights and floor it. We can only drive an ambulance mph over the limit, and it’s not a rule that’s usually flouted. But this particular job is a case of b******s to the rules.The baby is seven-weeks-old. It is white, floppy and bleeding from the nose.From arriving at the house to arriving at the hospital takes no more than three minutes.The dad had fallen asleep on his bed next to the baby, rolled over and suffocated it. The mum had been out with friends for the first time since her baby was born.After an hour of treatment, the decision is made to cease CPR. The mum screams again, “No! You can’t stop!” But the baby is dead. There is nothing more we can do.In my  years on the frontline, I’ve seen so many lives lost, but so many lives saved.THERE is a superstition in the ambulance service thatanyone says the word “quiet”, the s**t will ­suddenly hit the fan. So we call it “the Q word”, just as actors refer to Macbeth as “the Scottish play”.But there must have been a lot of ambulance workers forgetting ­themselves of late, because the s**t’s hitting the fan every day.Suffice to say that the state of the ambulance service scares me.When that ambulance arrives, I guarantee you will get the best treatment possible.But will it arrive too late  When I started there was a snooker table in the ambulance ­station.Now the calls wait for us and we don’t have time to go to the toilet, let alone make sure our ambulances are ship-shape.It’s not uncommon to be on a job, open a bag and discover something is missing.A JOB comes on our screen: Child fallen over in shower. Unconscious. I try the door and it’s locked. Suddenly, we hear the thud, thud, thud of big feet thundering down stairs. The door swings open to reveal a burly lad with a limp child in his arms.He says, “There you go, mate”, and shoves the child into my chest, asshe is nothing more precious than a pile of dirty washing. I can tell immediately that the girl, who is about two-years-old, has horrendous injuries.Her face is black and blue, as are her legs. Her eyes are half-closed, her pupils dilated and her breathing is noisy and slow. I hand the patient to my crewmate Paul, who can feel her body clicking, which suggests she also has broken bones. We both know something is seriously amiss, but we can’t say that.The doctors agree with us that the girl’s injuries are non-accidental. A short while later, the man is arrested. At home, I can’t shake the image of the little girl in my arms, covered in bruises, wheezing and gasping for breath. Several days later I heard that the girl had died and the man had been charged with murder.This pushed me further towards breaking point. I became more withdrawn at work. I stopped playing with my kids. I started drinking heavily to combat my anxiety and help me sleep. My doctor was so understanding and supportive. She signed me off work and referred me for counselling.The man changed his plea to guilty of manslaughter. The Crown Prosecution Service accepted he’d lost his temper and violently shaken her. He was sentenced to nine years in prison. It felt like this guy had got away with murder.IT wasn’t until I was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder PTSD that I realised I was vulnerable — and that everyone was. I wrote and posted the first of many blogs, detailing my crash and subsequent road to recovery.I’d been back on the job for a few weeks when my blogs went viral, which was a bit embarrassing. But those blogs, and the responses to them, changed my le forever.Ambulance workers from all over the country sent me emails, thanking me for sharing my story.A COUPLE of months after ing to work, I’m in the ambulance with Paul and a job appears on our screen: Female Bleeding PV .Sprawled in the bath is a woman. There is blood everywhere. My initial thought is that it could be a ruptured ectopic pregnancy. Or maybe it’s a miscarriage.But when I ask the guythere was a risk of pregnancy, he replies that there wasn’t. During his examination, the consultant has discovered a severed umbilical cord and delivered a nearly full-term placenta.Later, I learn that the police did find a baby, in a plastic bag in the hallway. Sadly, it was already dead. I didn’t really discuss the job with Paul.He seemed happy just plodding along and I took that to mean he was a stronger person than me. One evening I received a phone call from my manager.The whole time I’d been pouring my heart and soul into raising awareness of mental illness in the ambulance service, my mate had been sinking into an abyss.I’M tremendously proud to say I work for the service and I have a deep love for the job. It might not be the sexiest occupation, but it’s one of the most rewarding.How many people can say they arrived home late from work or missed their child’s sports day because they were saving someone’s le It’s a tough gig, but someone has to do it. And I’m glad it’s me. I feel like the luckiest man in the world.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I can tell when I meet somebodytheyre a smoker.As soon as somebody walks in you can usually smell [it] on their clothes.I hate when people come into my premises stinking of smoke.Angela was wading into a row about whether non-smokers should be given extra time off to make up for colleagues cigarette breaks at the time.Posting on Facebook on Tuesday, she added: I dont really associate with any smokers and Ive no close friends that [...] are smokers because I just dont feel comfortable with people that smoke.I dont have any smokers working at the guest house and never have.As an employer,I had two equally matched candidates for a job but one was a smoker and the other not, I would give the job to the non-smoker.According to UK law, it is only illegal to discriminate against someone based on certain protected characteristics.These include age, sex, marital status, pregnancy, disability, race, religion, and sexual orientation - and not lestyle choices such as smoking or drinking.However Angela, who has owned Heather Glen Guest House for  years, has faced a discrimination backlash since her smoking rant on social media.Susan Davies said: Thats called discrimination, your a silly fool.And Nicola Evans wrote: Surely its then down to personality and whether you gel with the person Hitting back at critics, ex-lecturer Angela said: Everything is discrimination.

Hundreds gave the left-wing leadership hopeful a raucous welcome as she launched her campaign at the Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester - where she was first taken  years ago as a child. The Corbyn ally joked “guys, we’re going to have to think of a new song” after activists chanted “Oh, Becky Long-Bailey” to the tune of White Stripes hit Seven Nation Army. Surrounded by dozens of bright-lit screens bearing her name, she pledged to “unite, rebuild and win” after Labour ’s worst election defeat since . The Shadow Business Secretary said: “If someone had told me  years ago when I first came here that I’d be back in , standing on a podium telling you all I was going to be leader of the party and the next Prime Minister, I’d have thought I’d stumbled out of the Hacienda having taken something.” Ms Long-Bailey confirmed details of a key policy - scrapping the House of Lords. In its place would be an elected Senate, based outside London and voted in through proportional representation. Ms Long-Bailey was introduced by new MP Zarah Sultana, who this week described the last  years as “Thatcherism” and once said she would celebrate the death of Tony Blair . But Ms Long-Bailey praised Tony Blair’s election win in , saying on that day “you could literally see people with a spring in their step, with hope for the future again.” She vowed to fight for a string of policies from Labour’s failed election manesto - from “modern democratic public ownership” to a Green New Deal. But she attempted to shrug off claims she is the “Corbyn continuity candidate” - admitting the party needs “a new professionalism” after losing the trust of Jewish voters over anti-Semitism.  “We need to look like a government in waiting,” she admitted. She said members in Salford were faced with people on the doorstep who wouldn’t vote Labour due to the “crisis”. “They didn’t believe in us enough and we’ve got a lot of work to do to rebuild trust,” she said. A YouGov poll of members tonight put Ms Long-Bailey far behind rival Keir Starmer - on % to his % in the final round. Even ardent Corbyn supporter Ricky Tomlinson, the Royle Family star, swung behind Sir Keir. Asked why voters should back her instead of Sir Keir, Ms Long-Bailey said she could reunite communities that didn’t vote Labour despite suffering years of de-industrialisation. She added: “I’m not from Westminster. Not from the London bubble.”  Ms Long-Bailey said a lot of success was down to luck. “A lucky birth, a lucky break at work, a gamble that pays off.” And she said Labour should not wait until winning power to get change on the climate crisis. “We have to use our power as a movement to demand change.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailPolitics is actually quite simple – the problem is politicians complicate it. So let me be as clear as I can be. The case for committing the next Labour government to putting UK manufacturing and domestic steel first, couldn’t be clearer. It will create the decent jobs across the whole of the UK we desperately need. It will revitalise our communities which have seen manufacturing jobs lost and communities destroyed. It’s virtuous too – a thriving local economy contributes to an expanding UK economy. The more vibrant our economy the more money we will have to invest. At the moment, too many of the advantages of placing orders in the UK are ignored, including the taxation ed to the Treasury that is lost when contracts go overseas. If I am Labouraposs next PM we will tear up the UKaposs timid procurement rulebook, and we will buy British steel rebuilding our economy and public services while working within our international obligations. This will take the commitment to deliver what you believe and doing what’s right for UK jobs and UK manufacturing. What sort of message does it send about the value of our world-class steel industry when the Government only purchases half of its steel from UK steelmakers  How is it that industrial energy prices for UK steelmakers are double that of their French counterparts, and % higher than in Germany   The absence of political and corporate leadership has forced hard-working steelworkers to compete with one hand behind their backs, for a generation. Thousands of jobs have been lost - despite the best efforts of our unions, consecutive Tory governments have failed to find solutions and starved steel of investment for decades. Take a look at an active government contract, the building of the three support ships to the Royal Navy worth up to £. billion. According to research, awarding the contract to build these ships in the UK would generate over , UK jobs – jobs in steel manufacturing, jobs in mechanical engineering, jobs in electronics, jobs in shipbuilding. If I win the trust of the British people and become Prime Minister I will make sure that where we can build with British steel, we will. What could be more obvious, what could be more logical, what could be better for the UK and the manufacturing sector than these ships being built with British steel   Under my Government, they would be. By failing to have faith in our world-class industries, the Government are failing to be ambitious for our country. It’s also vital that our steel industry has the information and the time to deliver. For years now Conservative governments have been failing to share information about the big public projects that are coming on stream, and they then have no choice but to buy foreign steel because UK producers aren’t set up to make what is needed. As PM I will demand that this dialogue happens, right across Whitehall. Many of the areas that made up my party’s so-called red wall were from a proud steel-making tradition.  Not even the incredible work of incumbent Labour MPs could hold back the tide. For too long, too many in these small cities and towns felt disconnected from power and decision making. The industry they relied on too often cast aside by politicians in Westminster as an industry of the past by those who simply don’t understand its foundational importance to our economy.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailBrexit could bring doom and gloom to some British businesses, the Chancellor of the Exchequer has warned. Sajid Javid has also confirmed that there will be no EU alignment with regulations after Brexit .The Chancellor has warned businesses of the negative impacts on some businesses as the UK erges from EU rules. He urged businesses to adjust to the new reality after Brexit day on January  and said that while some will benefit, others will not. Speaking in an interview with the Financial Times, the Chancellor said the Treasury would not lend support to manufacturers that favour EU rules as the sector has had three years to prepare for Britainaposs transition. He told the newspaper: There will not be alignment, we will not be a ruletaker, we will not be in the single market and we will not be in the customs union - and we will do this by the end of the year. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the comments showed right-wing ideology was overriding common sense. He said: Tory promises of frictionless trade post Brexit prior to the election have now been exposed as not being worth the paper they were written on. There are now real fears about food price increases and threats to jobs in the motor industry and manufacturing. This is right wing ideology overriding common sense.  The Food and Drink Federation said it sounded like the death knell for frictionless trade. Chief operating officer Tim Rycroft told BBC aposs The Today Show: Food and drink manufacturers will be deeply concerned by the Chancellor’s suggestion that there will not be regulatory alignment with the EU post-Brexit. “This represents the death knell for frictionless trade. “It will mean businesses will have to adjust to costly new checks, processes and procedures, that will act as a barrier to frictionless trade with the EU and may well result in price rises.”  The automotive, food and drink and pharmaceutical industries all warned the government last year that moving away from key EU rules would be damaging. But Mr Javid told the paper maintains some business will benefit and some wonapost. He said Japanaposs car industry was an example of a manufacturing sector which found success without following EU rules. The Chancellor claimed the impact on industries was predictable because the UK had voted to exit the EU more than three and a half years ago. He added: Weaposre also talking about companies that have known since  that we are leaving the EU. Admittedly, they didnapost know the exact terms. But Confederation of British Industry director-general Dame Carolyn Fairbairn warned the Chancellor of being too hardline with his approach. She said: Business welcomes the Chancelloraposs ambitious vision for the economy and recognises there are areas where the UK can benefit from its future right to erge from EU regulation. However we urge Government not to treat this right as an obligation to erge. For some firms, ergence brings value, but for many others, alignment supports jobs and competitiveness - particularly in some of the most deprived regions of the UK.  The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders chief executive Mike Hawes said early sight of the deal would help business evaluate their future. Mr Hawes said: Both sides want a thriving sector and we want to work with Government to help reach a mutually beneficial arrangement on regulation that safeguards UK manufacturing and consumer choice by allowing vehicles built in the UK to be sold in the EU and vice versa without additional requirements that would add billions to the cost of development. It is important, therefore, that we have early sight of the details of the Governmentaposs ambitions so we can evaluate any impact on our competitiveness and the future of volume manufacturing in the UK.

However, when including the partial data ed by some forces, figures suggest it could be much higher, with at least , adults informed someone close to their child has a history of sexual offences since .  Applications under Sarahaposs Law can be made by anyone, but the police will only inform the person who is able to protect the child. So, for example, a grandparent may enquire about their daughteraposs new partner, but the police would then inform the mother, not the grandparent,the partner was found to have a history of sexual offences. From the year the law was introduced to the last financial year, , applications were made by members of the public based on  police forces who supplied comparable data. However, incomplete data from other forces suggests the total number of applications from across this period was at least as high as ,. The proportion of applications that resulted in disclosure remained the same, at %, in both   and  .  forces ed comparable figures for the last three financial years, which show a % increase in applications over this period and a % increase in disclosures. Donald Findlater, director of child abuse helpline Stop It Now!, said it was reassuring to see the figures growing.  Mr Findlater, who sat on the  consulting with the government before the scheme became law, told PA: I think the rise is demonstrating a level of interest in safeguarding children and seeking information greater than we have had historically.I would like to see this trend continue because it is demonstrating awareness and vigilance. One in  children experience sexual abuse and one of the biggest problems is people are blind to the reality of it and think, aposit wonapost happen around hereapos. The fact that people are making the applications demonstrates to me that people are aware that the children they love and care about may be vulnerable to abuse. Evenan application does not result in a disclosure, those who enquired are given a pack with information about where to turnthey suspect abuse.

Jacob Young, , raped and strangled his victim, , in her own home until she was almost unconscious, Ipswich Crown Court heard. Young followed his victim and boyfriend home after the couple had been on a night out and struck after seeing the man leave the flat to go to work. The judge said Young had an extreme form of sexual curiosity or unhealthy fantasy, BBC reports. Young stalked vulnerable young women and took photographs of them on October  last year, when he saw his victim being mistreated by her boyfriend. His defence said Young had intended on helping the woman get home safely but the jury found he executed a apospremeditated planapos to steal her handbag thenit appearing as a hero. The victim hinted that Young enjoyed the violence and she only escaped after she promised him he could do whatever to mehe let her go to the bathroom. Youngaposs family appeared on Supernanny in , where the parents were told the boys had no respect. Judge Levett added: Your mother said appearing on that TV programme led to a campaign of mockery and abuse from the public and peers and school friends. His mother wrote a letter to the court, describing him as someone with good character and said her children had been subjected to a campaign of mockery from the public and peers after featuring on the show.  She went on to say that her son was protective of women ever since a fire that happened in their family home in , which was allegedly started by Youngaposs younger brother. Although she said her son was of good character, the judge dismissed her letter as aposembellishmentapos. Young was sentenced to  years with an extended licence period of five years. His sentence will be served in a Young Offenderaposs Institute. Investigating officer Sgt Rory Prior from the Safeguarding Unit said: I am extremely pleased to see Young behind bars after being handed this sentence.

After putting in a number years on the cruise ship circuit as a production show singer and company manager, she moved to Las Vegas, Nevada. It was here Elly would discover that a tiny white patch on her tongue, one sheaposd had since high school, was in fact Lichen Planus. At the time her dentist wasnapost too worried as it was fairly common but he decided to monitor things. She joined the spectacular stage show aposJubilee!apos, donning the quintessential rhinestones and feather headdress, and she lit up the stage as a glamorous Vegas showgirl. She also loved the red carpet hustle, working freelance jobs as a model, actress, and on-camera host in Las Vegas and Los Angeles, saving up for the future.Her passion for music saw her join the successful acappella group The Sound Collage which she called her aposdream jobapos, and she had a movie coming out aposAlien Domicileapos.I was at the absolute height of my career as a freelance performer, and I saw no end in sight. Elly continued to have her Lichen Planus checked roughly every two years, and in February of  her dentist spotted something, a lump on her tounge. Elly told : My oral surgeon said “Ooooh. I don’t like the look of that”. Not something you want to hear. He tested it, and sure enough, it was oral cancer on the back of my tongue.  They did a surgery to remove the lump, without any further treatment. It gave me a very, very slight speech impediment, but I was able to go back to work about two months later. That year, Elly worked as normally as she could, but by autumn of , her pain was becoming unbearable. She was discharged by her ENT specialist, and told her scan was clear and that she should simply take pain medication. But three more months went by and Elly said she was taking Tylenol and Advil like candy every  hours holding a water bottle to her head at night just in order to fall asleep. I went back to him and demanded a biopsy, and sure enough, the cancer had ed aggressively-stage three squamous cell carcinoma.  She opted to go for surgery at UCLA medical, but she was forced to make a dficult decision her le or the voice she relied on for her career. He performed a hemi-glossectomy , and replaced the bit of jaw bone that was in the margins of the tumour with bone from my right leg. said Elly. In place of her missing tongue, doctors built a flap from muscle and skin taken from her her leg, which gave her aposnew tongueapos itaposs own blood supply.  In order to do all of this work, they left scars on my neck , my belly , my legand a big, long guillotine scar from the center of my lower lip running down around my jaw to my ear. Doctors also removed all of the lymph nodes on Ellyaposs left sidejust as a precaution. In addition to having to wear a feeding tube for  months, the surgery left Ellyaposs face seriously swollen, making it dficult for her to drink and talk easily. Elly underwent thirty rounds of radiation and two rounds of chemotherapy , to attack the aggressive cancer, at first she required a wheelchair but she was able to eventually walk. The scars I will have for le. They pulled four of my back-left teeth in order to reach the tumor, so I can only chew on my right side--which further inhibits my ability to eat and gain weight.  The doctors rarely tell people every aspect of what is going to happen to them on one singular day, because they can’t— they told people everything at once, many would be so upset they’d simply avoid the surgery. But that surgery saved my le. I would have been dead by Christmas of  without it. I’m so grateful for my doctors and the way that they helped me through it at a pace I could handle. The physical changes have changed the nature of my work exponentially. My voice lowered a bit and lost a lot of stamina after radiation, something that is unlikely to get better, even over time.  Also, I have a very noticeable speech impediment - my diction simply isn’t mainstream enough to continue in voiceover work and corporate on -camera hosting. That work requires perfect diction, because those microphones pick up everything. I like to say “I’m too special for those jobs now”, haha. And though I’m joking in a way, it’s absolutely true. After the surgery, she stopped performing for about nine months to aid her recovery, leading many of her followers to ask where she had gone.  Recovery has been very slow, but every day I got a little bit better. Most of the work got done in the first year - speech and swallowing therapy, physical therapy to get my leg back in shape, and allowing the swelling to recede naturally, which takes time when they remove all of the lymph nodes . I exercise as a regular part of my routine to keep my leg strong and get plenty of cancer-killing oxygen into my body. Over the course of those months, the swelling subsided enough that I could be understood in person and on the phone, and when it got well enough to be understood without subtitles, I began playing around with shooting videos. She decided to make a triumphantto social media as a blonde bombshell in , telling her fans she now had aposa leg tongueapos. But it was here Elly would find a dferent kind of voice and stage presence, one that could truly help inspire survivors like her, and spread awareness.  Elly talks about a range of topics, but she also talks about the importance of getting regular check ups at the dentist, and how to cope with cancer.Now, so much of my personality and my offering as a host is directly related to what happened to me. YouTube and Facebook are perfect s for me to create specic content for the audience that knows me for what I’ve been though, and wants to connect on a very personal, very authentic level.Before, I was a faceless, random, pretty host. Now, my work speaks to those who understand, and can relate to physical challenges, trauma, cancer, and le after loss. One of Ellyaposs videos that has received over . million views on Facebook is simply called aposGirl with half a tounge auditions for a Broadway showapos. The video shows Elly dancing and singing to the classic hit show Chicago, nailing every song and dance move, effortlessly, but she initially doesnapost tell fans sheaposll be singing.  When asked about the physical changes since treatment Elly said: My body was put to the test in every way—physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually. When something like that happens, time stops. There is nothing  to do that is more important than getting better, and I became immediately aware of all of the help I was getting from God and the Universe - never once did I feel lost, forsaken, or alone. On the contrary! It was asGod said, “Ok, we have to do this thing…but we are going to do it together, and you’ll come out even better on the other side”. I said ‘yes’ right away, and I haven’t looked back. Getting to know my body and watching it rise to the challenge gave me gratitude deeper than anything I’d ever felt in my le. Ellyaposs belief was further tested, when in a shock to her and her family, she was diagnosed with breast cancer. My doctor told me I had breast cancer over the phone, on the day that I said goodbye to my dad. He died in April  of pancreatic cancer, and I had just come from viewing his body when she called to give me the news. Hearing I had cancer for the third time, after having my oral cancer come back so aggressively, was just awful. But by then, I’d already experienced the feeling that perhaps everything being thrown at me was designed for my benefit. I was willing to go along for the ride, so I just gave thanks, trusted God, and got the heck out of His way! After a lot of back and forth regarding treatment centers and dferent options, I had a lumpectomy this past August of . When the pathology came back after my procedure, I was shocked to hear that they found no cancer left in that lump. It appeared that the biopsy had cleared out all of the calcications they’d originally found. So many people had been praying with me, and it was an indescribable feeling of relief.  Elly often silences the voice inside her making her doubt: We all have dual personalities living in our subconscious mind, and there was certainly a voice telling me I might never sing, dance, act, use my voice, be heard, be understood, be beautul, etc…. But every single time, I felt this other, bigger voice, this presence - so much stronger than me, saying, “Hey, don’t worry about that now—the next thing will be even better. In fact, you’ll be healthy, you’ll be strong, you’ll be beautul, and your le will be even more meaningful than before”. I chose to trust that voice - it sounded a lot more fun than trusting the other guy. That other guy was a punk! Elly has faced the negative side of social media in her endeavours, saying: Internet trolls are irrelevant to me. I’ve been called every bad name in the book, been harassed, and even experienced what I consider to be visual assault .

They splashed out for an £-an-hour photographer after she was recommended by one of the other companies they were dealing with for their celebrations. After seeing what the photographer claimed were examples of her work on social media, the Plymouth couple couldnapost wait to see snaps of them saying aposI Doapos. But they were heartbroken when they saw the diabolical pictures, claiming their six-year-old grandson could have done a better job, reports Plymouth Live. Lin, , said: The more you look at them, the more mistakes you see. It’s ruined the memory of us exchanging our vows. Brendan, , added: Most of the pictures were out of focus. They are diabolical. We couldn’t believe that they were that bad. After being sent their photos, the couple pleaded for the photographer to send over the originals in the hope that they could find someone who could salvage some. But with most of them being out of focus, not much could be done. The couple claim the photographer blocked and deleted them on social media, meaning they struggled to contact her.  Lin and Brendan, who have been together for  years, said they were left with no choice but to arrange to recreate their wedding day - and plan to do it all again next month. Their reception has agreed to have them back, but theyaposve had to fork out another £ on another photographer. Lin said: The Duke of Cornwall have been kind enough to let us use the venue again. Luckily enough it was a small wedding. “Obviously we cannot use the registry office again.  “It’s horrendous. My six-year-old grandson would have done a better job. The couple have now sent a warning to other couples, urging them to check theyaposre not being ripped off.

Many of us will remember the daunting feeling of waiting for the examiner to reveal your fate as they counted the tally marks on your test report. In the UK,  per cent of people fail their driving test on the first attempt and more than a million people don’t pass until the sixth try. Where you take your driving test is usually down to where you live but according to new data provided by car company Peter Vardy, anyone taking their driving test in London, Manchester, Liverpool or Birmingham face slim odds of passing. Using the pass rate of each test centre, the study reports that learner drivers trying their chances at winning their license at the Erith Test Centre in London face the worst odds in the country and have just a . per cent chance of passing.  This means that one in seven hopeful drivers fail according to statistics.  Erith is closely followed by test centres in other areas such as Sutton Coldfield, Rochdale, Speke, South Yardley and Wanstead which all have less than an  per cent pass rate for drivers desperate to ditch their L-plates.  Those taking their tests in more rural areas of the UK fare much better and experts suggest that it might be due to the likelihood of driving on quieter roads than the ones found in larger metropolitan areas. Anyone struggling to pass in London or Manchester should perhaps try their fate in Yeovil in Somerset where the local test centre boasts a pass rate of . per cent.  Test centres in Ipswich, Dundee, Ashfield and Durham all have high pass rates too, with each passing well over half of test takers.  Why drivers fail their practical tests is down to a number of dferent factors which y from nerves, to lack of practice, lack of confidence and lack of skill. In a report published by the DVSA, the most popular reason for failing a test is poor observation at junctions and unsatisfactory use of mirrors.  This led , learner drivers to fail between December  and December .  Peter Vardy found that . per cent of Brits found parallel parking the most dficult element of the practical test and this was confirmed by the DVSA who have revealed that the failure to complete a parallel park is one of the top  reasons why learners fail.  The practical exam is not the only element of learning to drive though the theory test is just as important as the practical but unfortunately, . million of us needed three attempts to pass."},{"url":null,"title":"emmanuel macron evacuated theatre after","story":"NewsEmmanuel Macron evacuated from theatre after mob of protesters try to break inOne political activist was believed to have been arrested after calling for anti-government protesters to rush into the Bouffes du Nord theatre in ParisShareCommentsByPeter AllenTfany Lo:,  JAN NewsFrench president Emmanuel Macron was seen inside the Bouffes du Nord theatre\" to FREE daily email alerts from Mirror - politicsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Gathering around the pitul corpse of the magnicent black bear they have just slaughtered, the bloodthirsty group smile triumphantly asproud of their pointless kill.However, such sickening scenes are not unusual on Vancouver Island in Canada – where Prince Harry is to join we Meghan and son Archie to start their new le outside the royal fold.Hunting operators encourage youngsters to take up the vile hobby. One of many firms on the island even touts hunting trips for  to -year-olds to encourage “a future generation of hunters”. The company, Canadian Guide Outfitters, displays disturbing images on its website of a number of youngsters posing with the bodies of the huge bears they have killed. One even shows a boy who looks no older than  holding up a dead bear’s paw in triumph. It will horry animal-lover Meghan, , who has made no secret of her distaste for hunting. On her first Christmas with the royals in , Prince Harry missed the family’s annual Boxing Day hunt at Balmoral, with a royal source saying: “Meghan is a keen animal rights campaigner and doesn’t like hunting in any form.” But sadly it is a fact of le on the beautul island that she has adopted as her temporary new home. Hunters from all over the world travel to Vancouver Island to shoot its fearsome black bears, making Canada the “global capital” of the trophy-hunting industry. One company, Diana Hunting tours, offers a five-day trip for £, and boasts on its website: “In this hunting district you will have a great chance to shoot the bear of your dreams. “It is not unusual to shoot a black bear of over seven feet in height and weighing over kg [st lb]. On springtime hunts you can expect to see between five to  bears on an average day hunting. The autumn hunts coincide with the annual salmon run in the island’s rivers. “At this time the bears are extremely active, feeding to put on weight before their winter hibernation.  “Extremely nutritious food sources such as salmon help the bears to grow very large.” Bloodthirsty customers can shoot the bears with ease from boats when the animals go to the river for food. A review on the website of one operator, North Island Guide Outfitters, said: “We are happy hunters. What great bears we all three shot. We have had a big smile on our face for a week now. We all had a great time.” Campaigners have blasted hunting companies for revelling in the slaughter of black bears, which is not illegal because they are not endangered. The Mirror is campaigning to outlaw the vile hobby and to ban hunters from bringing their sick souvenirs back to Britain. Eduardo Goncalves of the Campaign to Ban Trophy Hunting said: “The conservation status of a fun-hunted species is irrelevant – trophy hunting is wrong, pure and simple. Andblack bears aren’t endangered now, they soon will betrophy hunting continues. “Trophy hunters always like to go after the biggest male bears.  “This skewing of the gender ratio of adult populations has been found in polar bears to seriously affect the numbers of cubs born. “You’re also taking the best genes out of the gene pool. This means the species is more prone to diseases and being affected by environmental conditions such as climate change. “It’s happened to polar bears and looks to be happening to brown bears too. It’s only a matter of time before the same happens to black bears.” It is estimated that between , and , black bears were shot for sport over the past decade and bear-hunting is the most popular form of trophy hunting on the planet. Almost , trophies of bears were taken home by hunters in  alone, according to the latest available figures from the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. Mr Goncalves added: “Thanks to the huge numbers of black bears hunted every year, Canada is actually the global capital of the trophy hunting industry.  “More hunting trophies are exported from Canada than any other country, even South Africa. “In some cases, bears are being hunted supposedly for trophies but in reality for their gall bladders, which often find their way into Asian markets. Here they are turned into pseudo-medicinal products. “There is a huge push by the trophy-hunting industry to get young children involved. The average age of the trophy hunting community is going up as its social acceptability falls.  “So the industry is desperately trying to recruit youngsters in order to keep itself going.” British Columbia banned the hunting of grizzly bears in  but the hunting of black bears is not prohibited. According to a  assessment by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, black bear numbers are increasing and, thanks to this, Canada is the world’s biggest exporter of hunting trophies.  While US citizens are still the biggest customer, a fast-growing number of Chinese hunters are travelling to North America to shoot black bears. In , % of all black bear trophies ended up in China and Hong Kong. Mr Goncalves added: “There is evidence to suggest trophy hunting is acting as a front for illicit trade in gall bladders, which are popular with the Asian traditional medicine market. “CITES records show that almost , galls and gall bladders were traded under the guise of bear trophies in recent years. “Most were from black bears, but some were from brown and even polar bears. Some of these ‘trophies’ made their way directly to known gall ‘medicine’ markets including Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, as well as Hong Kong. The biggest shipment – a single consignment of , galls – went from Russia to Lithuania.” "},{"url":null,"title":"worlds shortest mobile man khagendra","story":"NewsWorlds shortest man who can walk Khagendra Thapa Magar dies aged just Khagendra Thapa Magar, from Nepal, gained worldwide fame and became the face of tourism for his homeland when he became the worlds shortest man who could walk when he turned  in ShareCommentsByChris Kitching:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video worlds-shortest-man-ft-in-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news world-news worlds-shortest-mobile-man-khagendra-\"\" to FREE daily email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Khagendra had been struggling recently with heart problems, asthma and pneumonia, and he died in hospital in Nepal at pm local time on Friday, a day after he was admitted, the Guinness World Records reported, citing the manaposs friends. His brother told AFP that he died following a battle with pneumonia. Khagendra, a former Nepalese Goodwill Ambassador for Tourism, was first spotted by a travelling salesman when he was . He was put on display at local fairs and children paid to be photographed with him. He was just cm taller than the worldaposs shortest man, Junrey Balawing, who measures .cm .  Junrey is unable to walk or stand unaided due to a medical condition called osteogenesis imperfecta. He is listed as the worldaposs shortest non-mobile man. Craig Glenday, Guinness World Recordsapos Editor-in-Chief, paid tribute to Khagendra, whom he met during a visit to Italy in . Mr Glenday said: We’re terribly sad to hear the news from Nepal that Khagendra is no longer with us. His bright smile was so infectious that he melted the hearts of anyone who met him.  As many people of short stature experience, le can be challenging when you weigh just kg and you don’t fit into world built for the average person. But Khagendra certainly didn’t let his small size stop him from getting the most out of le. It’s been an honour to know him and his family, and a privilege to share his story with the world.  Khagendra first came to the organisationaposs attention when he was measured on an Italian TV programme and confirmed to be the shortest teenage boy on the planet. When he turned  he became the worldaposs shortest living man who could walk, taking the title from Edward Niño Hernandez, from Colombia.

The blaze was described in council reports as #catastrophic# with #around % of teaching rooms signicantly damaged#.Mr Alexander said: #There is a real need for improvement in the east of the city.#We have spent £m since  and invested in new schools and that is not including the £m spent on existing schools.#But we cannot afford to build two brand new schools.#The plan,we get agreement for a full consultation, is to merge Craigie and Braeview Academy.#We are looking at what happened in Fe after a fire when there was a merger with a college. We see this as the way and Dundee and Angus College would be involved in taking this forward, with enhanced provision.#Both these schools are grade C in terms of quality and both need upgrading but looking at the financial elements we cannot afford it.#The priority is in the east and we cannot have Braeview Academy people sitting in portable cabins.#Mr Alexander, a former pupil of St Saviour#s High School, outlined how #vocational partnerships# between Braeview and Michelin would be continued at the new campus at Drumgeith Road.He added that a joint project between Dundee City Council and Dundee and Angus College would be launched to accommodate people with additional support needs.Mr Alexander said: #I spoke with three executives from Michelin and we are really focused on making things work.#The consultation,approved by committee on Monday, would start on February  and run until the end of March. We have to be honest with the public and we want the feedback from parents.#This is the very start of the process. And as a parent your focus is absolutely on what is in the best interests of your children.#Part of the consultation process will be looking at proposals for Craigiebarns to be part of the catchment area for Grove.

city","story":"A historic granite stone in Aberdeen could be lit up in the dark under new plans to attract more visitors into the city centre.The Lang Stane sits by itself in an alcove at the south-east corner of  Langstane Place.A mysterious attraction, it is thought to have been situated in the same location since the s and be linked to the many stone circles across the north-east.Now it could form part of Aberdeen Inspired’s city centre rejuvenation plans.The organisation has been given £, from the Scottish Government’s Town Centre Fund which would also be spent on suspended signs to identy streets and build public installations called parklets.A public consultation was held yesterday where Aberdeen Inspired showcased plans to install  suspended signs and light up the Lang Stane.They will also be constructing parklets in two locations in the city, on Huntly Street and St James Church.The site on Huntly Street is currently a layby with bins which could be turned into outdoor seating to let people spend some time there.Each suspended sign will direct visitors and locals in the city centre and make it easier for them to find their way round.Geoff Cooper, who is project manager for this part of the scheme, insisted the signs will encourage tourists to visit streets they might not normally go down.He said: “Large signs will be constructed at the entranceway to streets that are important and signicant to encourage people to walk down them.“Particularly coming from the train station, through the Merchant Quarter and up onto Union Street, along with Ship Row and Belmont Street – all these quirky little places people don’t normally go to.“The other quirky thing we want to do as part of this project is light up the Lang Stane which is a signicant stone in the town centre with origins back to the stone circles.“It’s been on the maps in Aberdeen since the s so we want to place some subtle lighting behind it to give it signicance.”It is hoped that construction on this project will begin towards the end of the year."},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2020/01/SNS-19782981-ABE-140x84.jpg class=attachment-small

future.Aberdeen City Council launched its Active Travel Plan consultation last week, which aims to secure views from members of the public across the city on how they travel and what kind of improvements they would like to see to walking and cycling facilities in the area.Information gained from responses to the survey will be used to create an updated - Active Travel Plan, which will then be brought to a future committee.The updates are necessary due to the opening of the Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route , which has changed traffic patterns.The Aberdeen Cycle Forum campaigns for better cycling infrastructure in the city and hopes to see segregated bike paths created to encourage more people to travel sustainably.Rachel Martin, campaigns and communications secretary at Aberdeen Cycle Forum, said: “We absolutely support the renewal of active travel in the city. I am glad they are taking into consideration the AWPR.“We support lots of segregated cycle paths. The city needs a network not just here and there, but connecting areas such as Duthie Park, the beach, the train station and the two universities.“That’s what we will be campaigning for – a good cycle network. We also support a mph speed limit in the city centre.”Rachel added the group has noted a step in the right direction by Aberdeen City Council after the word “segregated” was used in its literature and a drawing completed by the group was included in its Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan last year.She added: “It will open up cycling for a lot of new people and it’s great for people who do cycle.”It is hopedmore sustainable and safer means of travel are included in future plans, lesser represented groups such as children and women may be encouraged to use the city’s cycling network.A number of corridor studies are already planned to take place on main roads to the AWPR, including the A, A, A, A, A and A. Responses to the survey are hoping to look at other areas in the city to ensure they are equally considered.City council transport spokeswoman Councillor Sandra Macdonald said: “We are continually looking to improve our road and pavement infrastructure to make it easier and therefore encourage more people to walk and cycle around the city.“This Active Travel Action Plan is one of several policies and strategies we’re undertaking for this eventual outcome and I’d encourage people who do walk or cycle – or would like to walk or cycle more – to take part in the survey.”To get involved, fill in the survey at https:bit.ly RgykaIt will be open until February ."},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2020/01/EE-CJS-080120-1-12-789x564.jpg ","title":"refurbished statue is back in rightful place in north east town centre","story":"A refurbished statue which looks out across a north-east town centre has been painstakingly ed home.The repaired effigy of Alexander Fraser, the th Lord Saltoun, sat above the door of the council chambers on Fraserburgh’s Saltoun Square since .But the harsh weather took its toll and left the statue without a face. vw, px\"  As part of a near-£ million regeneration scheme in Fraserburgh the figurine was removed, and for the last few months, stone conservator Karolina Allan has been trying to give him a new look.With the work complete, the statue has been hoisted back into its original home, which will now be known as the Faithlie Centre.The former council chamber will be an enterprise centre to help start-up businesses as part of a £.m revamp.Specialist teams were in Fraserburgh yesterday to supervise the heavy stone statue being lted into place.Banff and Buchan area committee vice-chairman Mike Roy said it was “exciting” the effiguy had been ed to its “rightful place”.He added: “Karolina’s excellent work has transformed the statue and is a great symbol of the detailed work and traditional skills being used bring this historic building back into use.“We are all very much looking forward to the Faithlie Centre becoming a hub of local activity once again.” vw, px\"  Brian Topping, chairman of the Fraserburgh Regeneration Development Partnership, said he was pleased to see progress on part of the major project for the town was moving forward.He said: “Bringing the Faithlie Centre back into use is a major part of the regeneration work currently taking place in Fraserburgh, and I am sure everybody will pleased to see Lord Saltoun overlooking the square once again.“The investment in the town will bring new and improved opportunities for Aberdeenshire Council, our partners and the public and this marks a great start for the year ahead.”Alexander Fraser was known as the “Waterloo Saltoun” after fighting in the Napoleonic Wars.The statue was created by London-based sculptor Edward Stephen and arrived in , six years after Lord Saltoun died."},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/11/5dd8e643900437.65040426-e1574501300686.jpg ","title":"manager derek confirms dons in it to win it","story":"Boss Derek McInnes today challenged the Dons to end  years of Scottish Cup pain – and believes they can deliver.McInnes accepts lting the national trophy for the first time since  would boost the club’s coffers.However, cash is secondary to the manager – the glory of securing the silverware is what matters most.The first step on the road to that target begins today when hosting lower-league Dumbarton in the fourth round.McInnes said: “The Scottish Cup is such an important piece of silverware and hopefully one we can win.“We feel we are one of the teams who can win the Scottish Cup and we have had a pattern of doing relatively well in it the last few years.“That can stimulate the support and boost the club financially.“That aside, it is all about trying to win the trophy and we feel we are one of the teams that have that capability.“We are one of the few clubs who go into the Scottish Cup who set out to win it.

Three events all within a stones throw of Mid Argyll.Jamie Miller was the only local to enter this event, starting his Scottish Tarmac Rally Championshipcampaign for the year in the rapid  Citroen CR. Paul Hunter, swapping his pacenotes for spanners, was on hand to assist Jamie throughout the season. Conditions were said to have been tricky as Knockhill has its own micro-climate, which consists purely of rain, wind, snow, ice, wind and wind. Sadly it wasn#t to be at Knockhill for the team with mechanical failure ending their day after stage two.The first closed road event to take place in England, after the approval of closed road rallying for the UK, was the first event for the famousGTi. Unfortunately for Kirsty Mochrie her licence can only be upgraded to stage events from single venue use when she turns , so it was theof the pairing of Innes Mochrie and Paul Hunter to represent Mid Argyll south of the border. The pair, finding the conditions tricky in the narrow lanes after the top seed cars had been pulling mud from verges and ditches, managed to bounce the wee metro over the first loop of four stages until the gearbox had enough on the fth test.Following the cancelling of Inverness# Snowman Rally earlier in the year, this was now first round of the Scottish Rally Championshipfor Dougie Watt and Ian Parker, and it was interesting to say the least. A glance outside in the morning to see about four inches of snow lying on the roof of the MK Escort was a surprise for a start. A very wet and muddy day saw the pair make it to the finish in one piece which is more than can be said for the clutch cable that snapped about one mile into the final stage, however clinching their first class win of the season was the best start to the championship.With Kirsty #Wee Mo# Mochrie in the co-drivers seat in the rapid Corsa of Steven Hay , a fair pace was set by the pair throughout the day sitting as high as th until they unfortunately had to take a split early to save damaging the car. Back out the next stage and still setting a blistering top  pace in the Corsa, including some hang time on both the jumps.Jamie, back out in the fit C, had bad luck once again. This time an overshoot on a square right and a struggle to get the car started again after a stall sadly earned him a stage max on stage two. Still setting top  times on the day he ended nd which was a fair effort when you include a stage maximum time.Ian was out this time with Fraser #Flat oot Fraz# Smithafter winning an entry to the rally at the STRC Awards in January. Flying out the gates and onto their second lap on the first stage then pop, driveshaft burst. Towed in and sorted, both covered in CV Grease, they made it back out for a skid around and on a mission to tear up some old tarmac tyres.The Granite Stages, now held at RAF Leuchars would see Eoghan Anderson make ato the passenger seat for a hurl in the immaculate MK Escort of Martin Murray. Smiling ear to ear all day, with Bill eagerly awaiting histo the service area for the stage report, they finished th overall.Ian was out with Greg Inglisin his fluorescent Orange Lotus Exige and it was eyes on the prize for STRC points for Greg. A clean day saw Greg really getting to grips with the car on some surprisingly fast stages including a tickle of the limiter in fth saw the pair finish third overall.Back together and with the small repairs from the Speyside done it was time for the Furnace MK toto the woods. A steady run over the opening two stages, Dougie and Ian found their feet after the #off# at the Speyside sent them into service lying th. From seeing their overall position they knew they had to get back into it on the next stage, however on the road section to start stage three there was issues selecting gear and the pair decided to call it a day # damage limitation was the right call, as the input shaft was on its last legs.Jamie was back on the pace for this one, setting a th fastest stage time on the opening test. Sitting th overall heading into stage five was impressive given the competition on the day. Bad luck unfortunately, however, was to .Eoghan was again out with Martin in the MK for a blast. Sadly it was an early bath, retired after stage two but again, as always, enjoying every minute while it lasted.The Argyll rally had been known to have rough and challenging stages the previous two years. Not this time. Ian and Dougie couldn#t believe how good the stages were in comparison to previous years, an absolute joy of an event with the Escort not missing a beat all day on its #shakedown# for the big one. Valuable class points added to the scorecard too, with them ending the event nd overall. The rally had struggled with entries this year and will now run in  as a closed road rally, run by Mull Car Club.Team Mochrie were back together for this one in the Mightyagain and Innes was cutting some questionable shapes in the garage, performing his annual Mach rain dance. Taking chunks of time from his first passes of the stages would see them ring the #s neck and clinch th.Jamie#s luck had finally turned, the C singing all weekend and netting him a topper of th overall and th fastest over the final stage too.Duncan Maclean was back in the driving seat with Ian alongside, giving himself and the car a shakedown before Mull. The freshly rebuilt #blue bullet# was looking superb and managed to finish looking just as sweet. A couple of small teething problems were sorted on the day and the new main focus was to have power steering fitted before Mull # poor Dochy lost about a stone over two days with the effort needed to swing the wee pug around the #s and chicanes.In August Dougie and Ian competed on the Vetomies Rally. A national grade event run alongside the WRC Rally Finland event. Three other crews from Scotland also headed over to sample #the fastest rally in the world#. The stages were unbelievable. Fast, cresty, wide, flowing with a brilliantly smooth surface. The whole event was just surreal. The duo finished the event th overall and more importantly the fastest Scottish crew.Once the car had ed from Finland it was quickly jacked up, checked and loaded onto the trailer the same day for the journey north. Due to two DNFson the Speyside and Scottish, Dougie and Ian had to make the trip to be in with any chance of regaining their class lead in the SRC. Ending the day first in the class meant they were heading into the final round with the lead.Jamie was back out for another counting round of the STRC. Enjoying his day and pushing the wee C on in the blistering heat netted Jamie and co-driver Ian Mccullochrd overall. He must have been relaxed in the heat as in between stages he was off with the overalls and on with the baby lotion, topping up the tan.Ian was back out with Greg in the Lotus. Another fantastic drive from Greg, finishing ninth with the championship title race firmly the primary goal.The final round for the MK and an important one # a DNF here could see Dougie and Ian losing the class lead in the championship. A battle with their rival who they had been chasing all season, Paddy Munro, would come down to the last stage, as the pair were six seconds down on Paddy heading into the final test. Probably one of the duo#s best stages all year, the final push to claim the class honours came down to the finish of the last stage on the last rally of the year. One second! They had taken the class win and the championship.The first event this year for Craig Callander and son Ross would see them prepare Craig#s gravel spec Subaru Impreza at the last minute to take on their favourite event. The #Japanese Tractor# was a fair handful, a light steering alignment issue and a boost problem gave the pair some trouble although finishing th overall made up for the hassle. A fair result given Craig#s absence from tarmac for four years.Returning from the shed with his freshly painted Sunbeam was Alister Macarthur, this time with Claire Tilleyalongside. The freshly fettled #beam was looking and sounding good # crossing the finish th overall after two years out of the seat.Dochy and Ian were back out in the #blue bullet.# All was going well until they had a spin coming over a crest into a square left, losing the bumper and damaging the gear linkage. They managed to get the car back to the end of the Saturday afternoon leg to repair the gear linkage and almost stole the yellow bumper from the recce car until some legends appeared with the duo#s bumper in the back of their Land Rover. Back out onto the  mile #long one# on Saturday night and they had an issue # after a heavy landing over a crest the rear shocker bolt broke, making the car a handful to keep in a straight line. They had to finish another two stages before they could make it back to service, so a finish was all they wanted at this point # th overall and Dochys fourth finish in a row on Mull.Without doubt the driver to watch was Innes and his newly acquired co-driver Lewis Grfiths . The Mightywas spotted airborne at any chance, with the hydro can suspension screaming for a break at each service halt. It was almost all over as the nearside cv joint sheared and the car took a wild turn to the left # both Innes and Lewis thought they would end up IN the Belachroy pub. They managed to make it over the Lochs to the end of the final stage, claiming st overall.Eoghan was back out with Martin to settle the score from the DNF at the summer stages. Sadly a stage maximum time on stage two scuppered their chances of the overall result they were hoping for, however they did set some impressive times, clocking a th fastest time on the final stage.Jamie, back out for the final round of the STRC, was looking to continue his good run from the Pendragon and set a seventh fastest time on stage three in the extremely wet and tricky conditions. Trying to get his money#s worth from his entry fee Jamie, however, decided to take an extra couple of miles on the penultimate stage. Still, the C ran well all day and the conditions suited the car perfectly.Ian was back out with Greg and this time he was aiming to become the Scottish Tarmac Rally Champion for . They set off with five cars in the same class and they had to win the class to get Greg the honours. Setting the pace early they were leading throughout the event. Finishing the event first in their class and third overall meant the job was done # Greg claimed the championship win.The last event of the year saw Kirsty back in the co-drivers seat, gaining even more experience on her path to upgrading her licence. Some typical Knockhill weather was in store as Kirsty had her first taste of RWD rallying in the Mazda MX of Paul Sheard. Kirsty guided Paul around the very wet stages to claim th overall and some valuable points on the board for Paul#s Motorsport News Championship campaign.Special thanks to Alasdair MacConnell who has travelled many miles to don an orange bib and stand in the rain, wind and heat, all to show his support and play a vital part in any event.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community. More of the same meritorious awards for the ordinary people of Scotland please.Credit to all editors and staff for their outstanding journalism given over the years in all of Scotlands progressive, thriving local papers.Stephen Jones, Oban"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 3 2020 2","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThis week#s photograph whas been submitted by Tom Cullen of Ardfern.The serene scene was taken overlooking the Crinan estuary at about .am on Friday January ."},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead bowls into 2020","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Bowling Club launched into the new year with the first of its indoor singles competitions.Some  members played for the Argyll Arms Ardrishaig trophy on Saturday January  and after some great matches throughout the afternoon it was Alan Guy and Neil Ward that progressed to the final.In a closely fought final, Neil Ward edged the victory in the last end, winning -."},{"url":null,"title":"storm brendan the movie","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowA compilation of clips from ious points on the Mid Argyll coastline showing the impact of Storm Brendan on Monday January , .Even with less-than-Hollywood editing it#s pretty dramatic stuff."},{"url":null,"title":"tarberts senior citizens party the night away","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWet and windy weather failed to dampen the spirits of Tarbert’s seniors as they gathered in the village hall for the senior citizens# Christmas dinner.A large number of willing volunteers had organised a sumptuous meal and decked the hall with multi-coloured fairy lights and balloons to provide a warm welcome for their guests.The familiar venue quickly came alive with smiles, hugs and the happy chatter of friends gathering for this much-loved annual event which has been going for more than  years.Elma McGougan and Jean Johnston, who had served on the original organising committee, reminisced about their experiences, explaining they ran fund-raising events and that many in the village donated money and goods so the dinner could be provided free of charge.The event, held this year on Friday January , is still organised by a committee and continues to be generously supported by businesses and iniduals in the village and surrounding area.Elma said: #In the s, the women on the committee made soup and brought it along.

Scotlandrsquos train operator, Abellio, has posted losses for a third consecutive year. Prior to Christmas, I made it clear in Holyrood that delays and cancellations on the Borders Railway were unacceptable and I questioned the Scottish Governmentrsquos decision to terminate Abellio ScotRailrsquos contract early in .I believe the move will cause disruption to passengers and puts into question job security for current employees. Even Dominic Booth, Abellio UKrsquos managing director, said: lsquoScotlandrsquos railway needs stability, not the upheaval a change in the franchise would bring aboutrsquo. I completely agree, and I hope that investment in our railway isnrsquot halted as a result.More fuel to the fire came over Christmas, when it was revealed that Abellio ScotRail said it had ended the past financial year pound million in the red, owing pound million to its owner, the nationalised railway of the Netherlands. It now seems that Dutch taxpayers are subsidising our failing train services. This is on top of the Scottish Government subsidies, which make up about half of its pound billion revenues.We need a viable solution to ScotRailrsquos woes, and terminating franchises early or nationalisation is not the answer. We need better accountability and long-term planning to ensure we see the fortunes of ScotRail turn around.The Borders tourism can offer a more peaceful alternative to bustling CapitalI was not surprised to see that Edinburgh was revealed as having the fourth highest ratio of tourists to locals in the world. This is after Miami, Las Vegas and Dubai, and it sits well above th placed London. Statistics show there are nearly  tourists for every  residents in Edinburgh, and it begs the question, are we really managing the impact of tourism well Annually our Capital city is influxed with tourists for the Hogmanay celebrations and the Fringe. Whilst it great to see tourism booming in Edinburgh, we need to see more affirmative action to encourage tourists to see more of Scotland, including the Borders. We are located only an hour south of Edinburgh, yet we see very little of the footfall.We need to see incentives and drivers for visitors to explore outside of Edinburgh. Encouraging rural tourism is at the top of my list, and I believe the Scottish Government need to make it a priority to ensure that our overcrowded capital does not suffer, when rural areas have a more peaceful and less stressful visitor experience on offer."},{"url":null,"title":"polar-bear-expert-deliver-talk-galashiels","story":"THE Arctic is ground-zero for climate change, and polar bears are on the front line.Yet, therersquos still a whole lot to learn about these magnicent animals.

fire that destroyed a large part of the building last year.The replacement secondary, though, will take at least three years to build.But according to Scottish Borders Councilrsquos Chief Executive Tracey Logan, it is the only way forward for Peebles High.Although it is yet to be officially endorsed by the local authority, Ms Logan says her view is that apart from the Sports Complex and Millennium Wing, the entire school will be demolished and rebuilt.And that Peebles High will jump to the head of the queue in the rebuilding programme of schools - ahead of Galashiels, Hawick and Selkirk.But the Chief Executive told the towns Community Council she thinks Peebles should now be first on the priority list for a new school.Ms Logan explained: ldquoAt the moment my view is, and this is only my view, this has not even endorsed by the Council as yet, is that given the constraints that we have around what will be available financially, the Scottish Government have been really helpful in that they are offering their full support and we will make a bid late spring for funding through the schools programme.ldquoThere will obviously be a financial settlement from the insurance.\"But we need to find the best way forward, so my expectation is that we will retain the Sports Complex because it is undamaged and pretty new, we will also retain the Millennium Wing because again itrsquos not that old and is entirely usable.ldquoI would imagine that we will probably end up taking away everything  and replace it with something new.\"What that will look like, I have no idea. But what it will be is something that is modular that we can add ontowe need to for capacity and we will want to talk to the community about what  we might want to put into that site.A consultation will take place asking for local feedback on community space and the possible provision of health and social care.She added: ldquoSome people have said to me that they want to knock all of the school down including the fairly new bits, realistically that wonrsquot happen and itrsquos not the right thing to do. I think itrsquos important that we make sure people understand the parameters within which we are working so we can have some sensible conversations and that we try and accommodate as much as we can in there.Meanwhile, a major operation is underway to get the students back to their classrooms at the beginning of February.The Chief Executive said: ldquoWe put in arrangements for  plus pupils to be accommodated at locations in Peebles, Galashiels Academy and the Langlee complex.ldquoThat has been generally very successfully and the feedback from that has been positive. I absolutely acknowledge that itrsquos not perfect but it has done the job we needed it do to.Senior students are currently sitting prelim exams in the Sports Complex and this will continue until the end of January.Temporary classroom units are being erected within the school grounds and pupils are to be accommodated in unaffected areas of the building.ldquoThere are still huge amounts of work going on and we will go right up to the wire but Irsquom confident we will achieve it, added Ms Logan.The Council has decided on a phased approach with S to S students starting on Monday, February  and S to S working from home and ing the following day.Ms Logan said that there has been ldquocompromises in the education offer over the last few weeks but is assuring parents that from the beginning of February it will be ldquobusiness as usual.Demolition work on the damaged building has been completed and restricted access has been implemented.The council boss has assured parents that children will only be able to access safe routes throughout the school building.Ms Logan added: ldquoOne of the things we did lose in the fire was the vast majority of pupil toilets so what wersquove now got on site is the long term temporary arrangements supplemented over the course of January.To ensure pupil safety, traffic will enter the site from a new access via Craigerne Road located at the back of the school.Ms Logan is meeting with insurers this week to discuss a settlement figure which will help form the direction of the future of Peebles High School.She added: ldquoAll of what we are doing is going to be sustainable for whatever we do in terms of the proper rebuild.\"What Irsquom trying to reassure you is that wersquore not doing things that are very temporary, whatever we do, we will be looking to the future.Community councillor Graham Mackie commended the local authority on doing a ldquoremarkable job and said any criticism of the Council during this trying time was unnecessary.He said: ldquoIt has been thought for several years that we needed a completely new high school but possibly therersquos a silver lining here in that we can end up with a high school that will meet the needs of the current population.\"But the council chief told members that ldquoessentially this is the replacement.She explained: ldquoWhen it comes to looking at high schools and replacement we would always look to retain what is still workable.\"In the case of the bits we are talking about in terms of Peebles High site they are really not that old. The Millennium Wing meets the standards that would be required in a new building. There would be very little point in wasting money knocking down something that works really well.

This is a fascinating and picturesque structure from the th century, which lies semi-hidden amongst the trees that cling onto the steep sides of the slope.Dunglass is such a beautul area, and the ancient Dunglass Collegiate Church, dating from the th century, is one of its architectural jewels. Itrsquos open to the elements now, but well preserved and a popular place for weddings.The castle that once stood nearby is long gone. A more modern house sits on the spot where a mansion once stood, and before that the castle. Being on the main route south, the castle inevitably saw action during the ious times of war with England, being burned and damaged on a number of occasions in the s.But in August , the castle was effectively blown up in a huge explosion, and a version of events emerged which placed the blame on a vengeful servant called Edward Paris.It was a time of war and religious rage. Thomas the nd Earl of Haddington was leading a Covenanting force charged with defending this important route from the south, as the Covenanting army had entered England a few days earlier. He had established his force at Dunglass Castle, an obvious strategic location, to defend the armyrsquos rear.On that fateful day, August , , he was said to be in conversation with some fellow nobles when a huge explosion erupted from the vaults, instantly demolishing the central part of the castle which became little more than a pile of debris.Thomas and many others were killed, their bodies pulled from the rubble. They had been crushed by the collapse of the walls in the explosion.History has repeatedly recorded the names of the nobles killed on that day, but there were many others, as the castle was busy and full of people. Fty-four unnamed lsquocommon servantsrsquo were killed, and more than  other people badly injured, some later dying of their injuries.Edward Paris was Thomasrsquos servant and he has been blamed for this tragedy. The th-century writer Andrew Stevenson claimed Edward had the keys to the vault in which huge amounts of gunpowder had been stored, and he had been ldquoseduced by the enemies of the covenant to commit this act. He was an Englishman and another account says he was incensed at derogatory remarks made by Thomas about his countrymen.Irsquove always thought this explanation never really had the ring of truth. It was initially deemed an accident, and the story of Edwardrsquos role emerged later, instigated by a writer called William Lithgow, a man who had certain axes to grind. In one account, Edward is said to have thrust a hot poker into the gunpowder or set fire to it. The detail of this is suspect in itself, for who survived as a witness to this act  I suspect that a dreadful accident, possibly caused by incompetence and carelessness, was turned into a deliberate act of vengeance as it made a more useful explanation.Of course, it is very possible that Edward was offended or annoyed at things said by his master, and perhaps he mentioned this at some stage, later to be used as evidence of his guilt. But in truth, most servants will have seen or heard things which will have offended them, it was a part of their job.Imagineservants had been able to write and publish the things they had overheard and seen, what dferent historical narratives we would have!Motives for wanting to interpret the cause of the explosion in this way can be guessed at. It was a time of atrocity and massacre, with religious, political and national hatreds. Who was responsible for the dangerous stockpiling of the gunpowder in such a manner  It seems just too easy to blame a disgruntled servant. Even later, when writing up this period, religious and political loyalties influenced interpretation.If Edward Paris really did venture down to the vaults of Dunglass Castle on that fateful day, with the intention of committing suicide in order to kill his master, along with dozens of others, then he must have been infected with a deep hatred, as well as a total disregard for the lives of his fellow servants and his own.The truth is we will never know what really happened. But Edward Paris is a servant whose name we know. Countless numbers of so-called lsquocommon servantsrsquo whose lives and fates are deemed unimportant by history remain unrecorded just as the things they witnessed remain absent from our history books.Irsquove often thought it would be fascinating to meet Edwardrsquos ghost and ask him what really happened on that day.Silly idea, of course, but you never know."},{"url":null,"title":"public-exhibition-held-plans-revive-dunbars-east-beach","story":"Dunbarrsquos East Beach, which hosts the townrsquos annual Loony Dook, was once a magnet for tourists but the disappearance of its golden sands over the years due to coastal erosion has led to fewer visitors.East Lothian Council has already been given permission for the first phase of work on the beach, which it is hoped will help sandwhile also protecting the shore.A public exhibition detailing plans for a second phase of work ndash and the project overall ndash takes place in Dunbarrsquos Bleachingfield Centre on Monday afternoon.Pippa Swan, chairwoman of the townrsquos community council, explained the desire to see the beach restored to how it was previously.She said: ldquoIt has been a long-held ambition.ldquoPeople reminisce about how wonderful the beach was and there has been a lot of disappointment that it has been so rocky for so long.Dave Northcott, East Lothian Council structural engineer and project leader, visited the community council shortly before Christmas to outline the plans.Consent is already in place for the construction of a breakwater at the southern end of East Beach.Refurbishment of the existing groyne at the same end of the beach has also been approved, alongside the placement of rock armour at the toe of the seawall.

He was said to have been martyred at sea with an anchor round his neck and was therefore regarded as the patron saint of sailors. The cult of Clement spread to Scandinavia in about the th century and then to Britain.ldquoSt Clements Wells were probably named by Scandinavians living in the Tranent area.ldquoWe know they were here because of the presence of a powerful landholder of likely Scandinavian descent, Thor of Tranent, son of Swain, who is mentioned in many th-century charters. He held extensive lands in the area and granted the church of Tranent to Holyrood Abbey.Mr Hadden said: ldquoI am sure the new stone sculptures will add another piece of culture to our area when in place to the east and west sides of Wallyford alongside those we have already.ldquoThese include the mining memorial stone and coal hutches located at St Clements Housing estate just off Salters Road, the  mining stones at the Wallyford Bing, a community woodland depicting dferent mining scenes, and also the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh memorial at the west side of Wallyford.The shapes and patterns proposed relate to the themes of the wells, water, ripples, distilling, agriculture and the sense of space and open skies of the site as it is now.

Ms Phillips dismisses Scottish nationalism with a contempt that would be entirely absent were she talking about Irish nationalism.:Labour leadership: Emily Thornberry edges over line as Clive Lewis pulls out of raceYet identity is the paramount issue in politics following Brexit. Labour is all for multiculturalism, but finds it hard in practice, even with racial identity. As the Labour leadership candidates lined up in all their glory yesterday, I was tempted to say, as Jon Snow of Channel  News said of that Brexit march last year: ldquoIrsquove never seen so many white faces.Only Lisa Nandy can legitimately claim ethnic descent from her father. Such a visual contrast to all those United Colours of Corbyn photo ops during the election.A party which has made a religion of ersity seems set to hand the leadership to Sir Keir Starmer, a wealthy North London barrister, who looks the very image of ldquowhite male privilege that Labour supporters on Twitter love to loathe.For a party that lectures the media, business and academia on gender, the leadership is turning into an intersectional embarrassment. Labour has never had a woman leader, and doesnrsquot seem likely to get one this time. Four out of the five candidates to replace Jeremy Corbyn are female, but the straight white guy is ahead by a mile.Mind you, Mr Starmer, as he would like us to call him, has been given a free pass by some feminists on the grounds that he is the ldquohot ticket. According to commentators like Zoe Williams in the , Sir Keir bears a striking resemblance to Marc Drsquoarcy, the austere-but-sexy human rights lawyer played by Colin Firth in the Bridget Jonesrsquos Diary film franchise.In the salons of North London, this apparently makes the Labour MP less pale, male and stale, and more pale, male and phooar. Mind you, I donrsquot think his looks will set many hearts a-throbbing in the pubs and clubs of Workington and Bolsover.As Shadow Brexit Secretary, Sir Keir was largely responsible for turning Labour into the Remain Party before the General Election. He made clear he would never support even a Labour Brexit. That convinced tens of thousands of le-long Labour voters to turn to Mr Johnson on the grounds that only the Tories were listening to them.But thatrsquos all water under the bridge now. Itrsquos time to ldquomove on. Forget Brexit. After all, Labour won the argument, didnrsquot they Aware of the Islington millionaire tag, Sir Keir has been trying to burnish his working class image. He is of relatively humble origins, stood on Wapping picket lines and has advised the National Union of Mineworkers.

Labour should be choosing the candidate best able to lead the party to victory, on merit, rather than someone who fits a hackneyed image of proletarian virtue. Race should be irrelevant in a party that believes in equality.But of course in the Labour Party of today it so obviously does matter. Labour has been hypnotised by identity politics and sees everything through racial and gender eyeglasses. It requires of other organisations that ious minority and gender boxes are ticked. But when it comes to their own leader, well, itrsquos complicated. And when it comes to Scotland, itrsquos more complicated still.Ms Phillips is essentially standing as the only leadership candidate who speaks the language of the working class. ldquoI love the people I grew up among, she says, ldquoand I think that they can tell.

These mean the world to me.ldquoAnd my reputation was brought into questionhellip I am delighted the tribunal has vindicated me.A findings of fact statement from the tribunal said that TLG understood that he had started to step away from the day-to-day running of the business after the sale while he remained in an ambassadorial role of chairman and founder.The statement said Mr Munro was not initially expected to work full time or for a set number of hours but would be paid pound per hour for anything he did outside his \"special projects\" role for TLG in the UK. It was anticipated he would receive no more than pound, per year in the role which was to look at opportunities for growth but TLG did not want him directly involved in Barrhead Travel work.But the tribunal heard that TLG chief executive Ninan Chacko had become \"alarmed\" that Mr Munro was averaging seven hours per day which \"exceeded what had been expected\" and had focussed \"almost entirely\" on Barrhead Travel activities.Barrhead Travel TV advert from By May, , Mr Munro was given a -hours-a-month contract was offered with maximum pay of pound a month and his responsibilities were for projects directed by TLGs global head of supply relationships, Andrew Winterton.Mr Munro said he had \"quite a lump in my throat\" when the contract stated there would be no period of continuous employment.The findings of fact document said Mr Munro felt he was being asked to \"effectively forego\" the last  years of continuous service in exchange for a fresh start under the new arrangement.The following month, TLG told Mr Munro of Mr Chackos preliminary view that there was no longer a need for a chairman and that during a consultation process he would be informed of any alternative roles that may be on offer to avoid making him redundant.:Boss of firm who bought Barrhead Travel planned to sack founderBy July he had been made redundant as chairman of Barrhead Travel, and received a payment of pound, while being offered work on special projects on a consultancy basis.Mr Munro appealed saying he found it impossible to continue with special projects while at home, and argued he still had something to contribute to Barrhead Travel. The tribunal findings of fact said that after a discussion, Mr Chacko referred to Mr Munro as having been \"disruptive\" and the appeal was rejected.\"Mr Chacko did not consider reinstatement was an option for the claimant because his role no longer existed,\" the tribunal was told. \"The claimantrsquos previous actings had been disruptive and detrimental to the business .\"TLG had paid for the whole Barrhead business with a management team, and the claimantrsquos reinstatement would be at odds with the ability of the management team to be successful. \"According to the tribunal papers, Barrhead Travel argued that the removal of the role of chairman was a \"legitimate and rational business decision\" and acted \"reasonably\" in offering Mr Munro a new role.The firm argued thatMr Munro had accepted the consultancy agreement, he would have suffered no harm financially because he had already received a full statutory redundancy payment.But Mr Munros representatives argued to the tribunal that his ambassadorial role had not been made redundant and the outcome of dismissal had been predetermined.Ms Wiseman said it was \"clear\" that Mr Munro found it \"very dficult\" to step away from Barrhead Travel.She could not accept that his dismissal was predetermined but said that the offer of alternative employment was \"unreasonable\" because it omitted continuity of service.And she said there was a \"flaw\" in the appeal procedure in which an executive had \"accepted at face value\" what Mr Chacko had told him about Mr Munro being disruptive and allowed this to influence his decision.But she felt that the reason for Mr Munro not accepting the new contract was he had lost trust in Mr Chacko and others in the organisation.And she believed thata fair procedure had been followed, there was a % chance Mr Munro would still have been dismissed.Barrhead Travel declined to comment."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgows-cop26-might-cost-us-cant-afford-parochial","story":"It was dficult to tease out a more expansive answer from the group of Europeans ndash Danish, German and Swedish ndash because they clearly felt the UK was suffering enough and didnt want to rub it in.Yesterday the Scottish Parliament announced it would no longer fly the European flag above Holyrood as the Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom said she had bunged pound towards a crowdfunder to have Big Ben bong when the UK leaves the EU at pm on January .Its all getting frighteningly real.When the country is iously viewed as a laughing stock and to be pitied, it surely can only help that we have a major event coming up, giving Scotland the chance to shine on the world stage.And not just any event ndash one of the most signicant the UK has seen. Large enough to knock the Olympics and the Commonwealth Games into a cocked hat.Yet the backlash against COP , the United Nations Climate Change Summit, has already begun.It was revealed on Wednesday that the event, to be held in Glasgow at the SEC Campus on the banks of the River Clyde, is expected to cost hundreds of millions of pounds in policing costs. It was a wonder that anyone was surprised.Glasgow will host up to  world leaders and , delegates.Its due to be the largest policing operation the UK has seen - this sort of thing doesnt come cheap.Calum Steele, the General Secretary of the Scottish Police Federation, spoke positively about the event on BBC Radio Scotland on Wednesday morning, saying there had been nothing like it in Scotland or even the UK before.Mr Steele described it asmore signicant than the Olympic Games or Commonwealth Games and would require the largest mass mobilisation of UK police the country has seen.The G summits, he said, \"will pale into insignicance.\"He went into further details. Police Scotland will be unable to manage the event alone. The country will host leaders from the US, Russia, China and Israel, all of whom will demand their own safety and security considerations.Alongside leaders, delegates and guests, the police service has to accommodate hundreds of protestors. Economic opportunities must be leapt on, he added. Scotland will be in the \"spotlight of the world for those two weeks.\"He pointed to the very clear potential economic benefits for Glasgow and for Scotland.Yet even Mr Steele, after these positive sentiments, yesterday on Twitter shared a video of buckets collecting water pouring through the roof of Paisley Police Office. \"Itrsquos not unreasonable to ask,\" he posted alongside the image, \"If we canrsquot even fix a roof how the hell will [COP] be paid for \"Nicola Sturgeon has called for Westminster to honour a pledge made to fund the event, given the UK is the host.Conversely, GMB Scotland called for Glasgow to reject the chance to host the summit. Its secretary, Gary Smith, said the costs would \"sicken frontline council staff and struggling local communities.\"\"The best thing government could do for Glasgow,\" he said, \"Is to ditch hosting the COP and instead invest the money in dealing with the state of the city.\"Its hardly the London Garden Bridge project, which, in case weve forgotten, saw poundm wasted, including pound, on a gala for the abandoned scheme. If nothing , it all served to show the strength of positive feeling towards Joanna Lumley, a vocal campaigner for this extraordinary white elephant, as she should surely have lost her national treasure status over the shameful incident.There is a string of other grossly wasteful examples of public funds. In  it emerged the frequently delayed NHS  new telecommunication and patient information system was going to cost poundm more than originally forecast.The HS railway plans have been described as at risk of becoming \"a bottomless pit for taxpayersrsquo money\". Finance Secretary Derek Mackay told MSPs last year that taxpayers were picking a bill of an poundm for two CalMac ferries, which look likely to be delivered four years late, due to \"disastrous\" previous management at Ferguson Marine in Port Glasgow.There was much back and forth over whether the legacy of Glasgows Commonwealth Games was all it was cracked up to be. The taxpayer spent pound. million on Glasgow  and all anyone remembers is the dancing teacake, it goes.There lies part of the problem. The public is used to politicians chucking its money away - whether on good faith projects such as the Games or ludicrous Boris Johnson vanity projects.Its important that the spending of taxpayers money is carefully scrutinised and those responsible for the mismanagement of publicly funded projects held to account.The public is protective of its taxes, people work hard and want afor their investment, and they do not automatically trust politicians to use their money wisely. Hence the almighty stooshie over Glasgows Lord Provost spending her civic allowance on shoes.Hence repeated grumbles when politicians head off on so-called junkets abroad. Last year the First Minister received pelters after travelling to Paris and straight on to North America.This was at the same time Lib Dem MP Angela Smith referred to people of a \"funny tinge\". My personal preference is for outward-looking politicians who want to make strong global links... not those who blurt out racist epithets without a second thought.Climate change is the most important issue of the day and this is an extraordinary chance for Glasgow, Scotland and the UK to be seen to be leading the way.Squabbling over the costs of policing an event with myriad economic opportunities for the city is such an insular, short sighted way of thinking.This is an international event and we must think internationally. It may be costly but the one thing we cannot afford is to be parochial when all eyes are on us, finally, for something of global importance."},{"url":null,"title":"parades-orange-walks-republic-marches-rose-20-last-year","story":"Iain Livingstone, Chief Constable of Police Scotland, said around , such events took place last year, rising from ,.It came as he outlined the challenges facing officers across Scotland as the police struggle to deal with a funding shortfall.Mr Livingstone said Police Scotlandrsquos capital budget is ldquoderisory, while savings of pound million have been made every year since the creation of the single force in .And he insisted ldquoacute operational demand will continue over  due to Brexit and events such as COP, a major climate change summit to be hosted in Glasgow in November.Mr Livingstone said early assessments indicate the policing costs of COP could potentially exceed pound million.He said it will be ldquoone of the biggest events ever hosted in the UK, with a signicant number of heads of state expected to attend, as well as tens of thousands of delegates over a two-week period.Policing requirements would be ldquofar more signicant than past events, including the G summit at Gleneagles in .At a board meeting of the Scottish Police Authority, Mr Livingstone said accommodation for officers alone could cost ldquotens of millions.He added: ldquoCandidly, it is my professional opinion that any suggestion that the climate change conference will not impact on the wider community of Scotland is fancul.An estimated , people, including around  world leaders, will attend the UNrsquos COP summit over  days in November.For the duration of this, the conference site at the Scottish Events Campus in Finnieston will become international territory.Elsewhere, Mr Livingstone pointed to the rise in parades and marches, which also put pressure on police officers.He said: ldquoIn , by way of example, the number of parades ndash Orange walks, republican marches and such like ndash which Police Scotland were notied of increased by almost %, from around , to ,, often resulting in a large policing response necessary to maintain order and protect the public.Deputy Chief Constable Will Kerr warned this years parades season could once again be \"challenging\".He said there had been \"signicant tension\" around some marches in , with a number of events requiring a police presence of more than .He said he feared that could continue to be the case this year.Mr Kerr, who spent almost three decades as a police officer in Belfast, said his \"intuition\" tells him it is \"going to be a challenging year around the parading season\".The force had to call in riot police, mounted officers, a police helicopter and dog units to deal with \"signicant disorder\" at a march in Govan at the end of August last year when \"disruptive\" counter-protesters met a planned Irish Unity march.Another march saw a policeman injured when he was struck by a pyrotechnic thrown by a protester.Auditors previously suggested Police Scotland will need an additional pound million over the next two years to avoid slashing officer numbers.There have been warnings that up to  officers will need to be cut to balance the books.However, Mr Livingstone said it was not appropriate to begin reducing officer numbers in March, as he had planned, due to the upcoming events and pressures.David Crichton, vice chair of the Scottish Police Authority, said there is a ldquostructural deficit in the policing budget.He said: ldquoItrsquos simple arithmetic, itrsquos not complicated mathematics.ldquoWith almost % of the budget allocated to officer and staff costs it does mean that dficult choices are going to have to be made over the next weeks and months.

She has even suffered from disturbing hallucinations - including seeing her GP \"melt\" in front of her - as a result of side effects from tranquilisers prescribed to calm her.However,Maria wants to continue taking the hemp suppositories she will face a pound a month bill for the  packs she needs.The mother-of-three said: \"Why should I be paying the bill when I didnt cause the problem  This was inflicted on me by the NHS so the NHS should be paying for it.\"Its been recommended by the very specialist they sent me to - that I had to fight to be sent to - and now theyre ignoring his advice.\"The condition has calmed down a lot. My own GP says shes never seen me looking better in the past two years than I do now. Theyre the only thing thats worked. For me, its amazing not to have feeling down there.\"The Herald first revealed Marias story in July last year when she spoke of how PGAD meant simple activities such as driving over a pothole or using an escalator could trigger embarrassing orgasms.The condition and the memory of the initial injury have been so debilitating that Dr Goldmeier also recommended a course of eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing , a form of psychotherapy more commonly prescribed to alleviate trauma in people who have suffered abuse or served in warzones.: New fathers shouldnt be made to feel like a waste of space on the maternity wardThere is a two-year waiting list on the NHS, however, so Maria is paying for it privately through her health insurance.The same is not possible for the suppositories, however, as current UK guidelines on medicinal cannabis state that it should only be considered where there is \"clear published evidence of benefit\".Currently, that only applies to rare forms of epilepsy in children and young adults, chemotherapy-induced nausea, and muscle spasms in multiple sclerosis.However, when Marias case was raised with Jeane Freeman in December by her then-MP, Jo Swinson, the Scottish Health Secretary said that exceptions could be made for so-called unlicensed products on a \"named patient basis\" where \"there is a clinical need which cannot be met by a licensed medicine and where established treatment options have been exhausted\".Maria has now written back to Ms Freeman begging for her help \"as a woman\" with the health board after her request to be granted the suppositories on this basis was refused.She wrote: \"I have been prescribed an unending list of medication since December , with insufferable side effects.

The creation of Holyrood in  wasnrsquot just an organic, grassroots response to Thatcherism aimed at reviving Scotlandrsquos lost democratic structures, he argues. It was the product of a much grubbier process of institutional horse-trading, whereby British politicians mdash mostly associated with the Labour Party mdash ldquomanaged demands for Scottish autonomy in order to shore up the UK constitution and ward off a growing electoral threat from the SNP.Hames builds his argument around two distinct but routinely conflated concepts: ldquoThe Dream and ldquoThe Grind. The former, he says, represents the commonly accepted biography of Scottish self-government: ldquoA story of cultural vanguardism in which writers and artists play the starring role in the recuperation of [Scottish] national identity, cultural confidence, and democratic agency.The Grind is much more prosaic. It explains ldquothe longer, thinner history of devolution as a shrewd saga of electoral expediency and legislative manoeuvring, starting with Harold Wilsonrsquos  Royal Commission on the Constitution and ending with the  Scotland Act.Hames charts the interplay between Scottish literary culture and the national movement in the last century, from Hugh MacDiarmidrsquos ldquoneurotic self-construction in the s and s through to James Kelmanrsquos experiments with ldquoauthentic Scottish vernacular in the s and s.The key moment of convergence occurred at the height of Thatcherrsquos reign, he argues, when Scots voted consistently against the Tories but remained powerless to block her sweeping social and economic reforms. In the absence of effective political leadership, the responsibility for articulating a distinctive democratic landscape, liberated from Conservative rule at Westminster, fell to writers and artists like Alasdair Gray, William McIlvanney, and Liz Lochhead, all of whom were influential supporters of devolution in .Hames thinks this is how and why The Dream took root and The Grind mdash the thankless procedural slog that ultimately made Holyrood possible mdash drted from public view. Indeed, the idea that constitutional change was driven exclusively by cultural factors, and not by the less glamorous reality of Westminster machine politics, became the core foundational myth of devolution mdash a myth that is quite literally embedded in the north-facing wall of the Edinburgh parliament building, in the form of  decorative  bearing quotes from Burns, Scott, MacDiarmid, Gray, and other Scottish literary greats.Intriguingly, according to Hames, this myth was cultivated by a small group of left-nationalist thinkers centred around Radical Scotland magazine in the late s and early s. Through their writing and activism, journalists and academics like Chris Harvie and James Robertson sought to promote the belief that Scottish culture was inherently anti-Conservative, with the aim of permanently dislocating Scottish opinion from the Anglo-British right.Their efforts paid off. The Radical Scotland strategy was ldquohighly effective in prying Scottish politics away from Westminster and [constructing] a political space in which Tories would have no choice but to concede devolution or be seen to lsquorepressrsquo Scottishness, Hames writes. ldquoThis went as far as openly ldquoothering Toryism as incompatible with the authentic national desire for self-determination.By the end of the s, the ldquolanguage of class politics had elided with a more traditional, nationalist emphasis on cultural dferentiation and the image of a supposedly ldquoproletarianised Scotland hellip dispossessed by Thatcherism now central to the Home Rule cause.This book does two things extremely well. It demonstrates how close the relationship between Scottish nationalism and Scottish literary culture has been since at least . Writing shortly before the  independence referendum, the novelist Alan Warner even suggested a No vote would signal ldquothe death knell for the whole Scottish literature lsquoprojectrsquo mdash a crushing denial of an identity that writers have been meticulously accumulating for decades.And, against the romanticising tendencies of the Scottish left, it convincingly argues that Holyrood is in many respects a deeply conservative institution, built to regulate Scotlandrsquos democratic instincts rather than unleash them. ldquoIt was the densely networked and overlapping professional circles of lsquoCivic Scotlandrsquo who were directly empowered by devolution, Hames concludes.Those circles might be good at ldquoextracting political rent from the parliamentrsquos ldquocollective symbolic capital, but theyrsquove never run it radically or imaginatively.On the downside, Hamesrsquo analysis is frustratingly incomplete. He doesnrsquot offer a detailed picture of Scottish society beyond Scotlandrsquos political classes or cultural elite, nor does he place the campaign for devolution in a clear economic context.The combined influence of the trade union movement, the voluntary sector, the Church of Scotland and wider Scottish public opinion itself in sustaining calls for a Scottish parliament over three decades, in the face of prolonged Westminster neglect, is thus largely overlooked.Moreover, the strategic debates that took place during the s over how best to achieve Home Rule are almost completely orced from the dramatic economic trends mdash rising unemployment, rampant inflation, and rapid deindustrialisation mdash that characterised the decade and, arguably, made such debates necessary in the first place. This feels like a serious omission, not least because Literary Politics is billed as a major new critical account of Scotlandrsquos devolutionary history.Hames also overstates his otherwise persuasive critique of the post- ldquoScottish consensus. Hersquos right to say that Scotlandrsquos current political leadership has ldquosuccessfully turned a rhetoric of mongrel resistance to [British] non-democracy into a ldquocorporatist governing ethic at Holyrood, based on vacuous ldquoTeam Scotland sloganeering. But that slightly misses the point.A standoff between Nicola Sturgeon and Boris Johnson is brewing and another independence referendum is on the way. Politically speaking, Scotland is more unsettled today than it was before Holyrood was established two decades ago: devolution has undermined, not reinforced, the long-term stability of the British state.But none of that should detract too much from what Hames ndash a Canadian ndash has achieved. The Literary Politics Of Scottish Devolution is one of the most original and arresting studies of our political culture written for  years.It is a powerful deconstruction of the political myths that made modern Scotland and a compelling reassessment of Holyroodrsquos mdash frequently miscast mdash institutional origins.Hames challenges the mainstream chronology of Home Rule just as the Edinburgh parliament enters its third decade. The book is disillusioning, but in a good way. No doubt Alasdair Gray would have approved.The Literary Politics Of Scottish Devolution: Voice, Class, Nation, by Scott Hames, Edinburgh University Press, pound."},{"url":null,"title":"communities urged to take the plunge to celebrate year of coasts and waters","story":"A new #, fund has been launched to help community groups celebrate Scotland#s Year of Coasts and Waters .Scottish Natural Heritageis marking the year with the launch of ‘Plunge In!

If I get to  that will be it. “ButI still have my health, I might just carry on for another few years...”It’s clear that leaving the SSPCA would be a huge wrench for Sharon so I wouldn’t put bets on her leaving in three years!During her time with the society, Sharon and David have had two boys, Ronnieand Greg . They also have a grandson, Ronnie jnr who is now .But Sharon also brought her work home with her and the couple are now also “mum and dad” to three dogs, two of which Sharon hand-reared, and three cats.“There’s always one or two that pull at your heart-strings,” she said, by way of explanation for their very own menagerie!However, there’s one dog which she didn’t adopt which also brings a tear to her eye.“A wee puppy came in with PAVO virus whom we called Paddy,” she recalled.“He was a wee black and white lurcher type who was at death’s door.“I stayed in the kennels with him for three or four nights and, at one point, he did actually die.“We resuscitated him though and after about eight weeks we got him back on his feet and rehomed.“Seven years later, I was doing my shopping in Dundee when I heard this commotion.“This dog squeezed itself out of a passenger window, ran across the road and jumped right into my arms.“It was Paddy the police officer who rehomed him was on the opposite side of the street from me but the dog saw me, remembered me and was determined to come and say hello.“It was amazing that he remembered me after all that time – they don’t forget the kindness you show them.“A lot of the animals we care for are more than happy to come back for visits with us. They realise its a sanctuary for them so they are more than happy to come back and say hello.“I’ll always remember that day with Paddy though in . He’s now long gone but I’ll never forget him.”Sharon has witnessed many changes over the years and longs for the day when people finally stop being cruel to their animals.However, she knows that, until that day, the SSPCA will be there to help them.She added: “Behind every animal, there’s a human story too.“The biggest problem, other than cruelty cases, that we see is people with mental health issues.“They love their animals but maybe start with a pregnant cat, keep all the kittens and then end up with  or  in their home.“They can’t bear to be parted with them and end up in a dficult situation.“It’s heart-breaking to hear some of those human stories but, at the end of the day, we are here to look after the animals.“Over the years, I’ve seen thousands and thousands of animals who have been nursed back to good health and rehomed.“I’m really, really lucky. Not many people can say they’ve worked in their dream job for  years but I still wake up every day and feel blessed.”SSPCA could not operate without generosity of the publicToday, the SSPCA has nine animal rescue and rehoming centres and a world-leading wildle rescue centre at Fishcross in Clackmannanshire.The charity receives no government funding and relies on donations and grants to continue its work. The public funds the SSPCA’s £ million budget annually.That covers the cost of  employees, including  inspectors,  ambulance drivers and the -strong team at its centres across Scotland and its wildle sanctuary. The SSPCA is the only animal charity in the UK able to report animal cruelty cases to the Crown, with reports sent to the Procurator Fiscal Service.In , it found homes for  rescued animals, helped more than  wildle casualties and spoke to more than , children through its educational programmes.For every pound it receives, p is spent on animal welfare, p on fundraising and promotion and p on administration.So you can rest assured that the bulk of any donation you make will make a huge dference to the animals in the SSPCA’s care.Last year, its animal helpline received almost a quarter of a million calls, the inspectorate attended more than , incidents and more than , animals were cared for across its nine rescue and rehoming centres and at the national wildle rescue centre.To find out more or donate, visit www.scottishspca.org."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish charity worker surpasses his 50 000 running home target","story":"Even Mark Calder wasn#t surehe#d be able to pull off his mammoth  challenge. In January last year, we featured his incredible aim to run  ultramarathons along some of Scotland’s ancient pilgrim routes.The Running Home  challenge combined his two passions – running and his work with charity Embrace the Middle East, for which he is regional manager for Scotland and the north of England.He hoped to raise £, to rebuild war-torn areas of Iraq while covering the  miles, gathering support and funds along the way.While there were times when Mark didn’t think he’d see the finish line, he successfully completed the challenge.He also surpassed his fundraising tally – with £, currently banked.And he’s hopeful that even more funds will be amassed before he travels to Iraq this spring to see it put to good use.Marksaid: “There were occasions when I wanted to go home.“I knew,I was to quit, I was going home to a nice, comfortable house. The people I was running for don’t have that option.“That was a monumental reason to keep going.”Mark had extraordinary support along the way, not least from his crew – Gareth Brocklebank and Andrew Clarke – who followed him in a camper van, which also acted as shelter in areas where overnight BB stays were not an option.Mark’s we Karen and his two daughters also cheered him every step of the way as did many strangers.“People welcomed me into their churches and communities and generously donated large sums of money,” he said.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fetoday webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Zimeng with piano teacher Sister Avril and trustee Maggie Picken.\"  Fe charity marks  years helping blind people viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"FFPL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"FFPL | Article Teaser\"“I was invited to speak in venues I would never have been able to reach in my day job, Iona Abbey being one.“It was a fantastic way to spread the word about Embrace the Middle East.“I look back on it not with a sense of pride, but rather relief – and gratitude for the people and places I encountered along the way.”Divine inspiration also came from a meeting with Father Emanuel Youkhana, a Christian minister who works in Dohuk in Iraq to bring Christians, Muslims and Yazidis together.Mark said: “To see his energy and enthusiasm for what we were doing was a massive inspiration.“That was at the end of Run , the St Ninian run, when I was at my most tired.“To have that intervention made a really big dference.”That particular run had loomed large in Mark’s mind it was the equivalent of running three marathons each day for seven days.Remarkably, though, he only lost one day to ill-health throughout the year.“I’ve learned that your body can adapt to whatever is thrown at it,” said Mark.“I wasn’t sureI’d be able to make it to the end of that run but when I hobbled over the finish line, that’s when I knew I could do it.”The darkest day of the challenge was undoubtedly in June during the St Columba run from Inchcolm Abbey to Iona Abbey.“It was one of the most interesting runs in terms of scenery, with just about every landscape Scotland has to offer,” he said.“There was a long, unsupported section just north of Oban. I was feeling great but, within ten minutes, a niggle turned into barely being able to walk.“I had to find a couple of sticks from the woods to use as shin splints.”However, it was an earlier, shorter run – St Cuthbert’s in March – which cost Mark a full day and also taught him a very valuable lesson.“I wanted to run from Melrose to Lindisfarne, where I planned to stay overnight, but I had to be there for a certain time due to the tide restrictions.“I got lost early on and was chasing my tail for the rest of the day. I started pushing really hard and ended up lost in the hills for  minutes, with no water, torchlight or phone charge.“I rushed checkpoints and didn’t take the time to check my kit properly.“I was dehydrated, didn’t stay on Lindisfarne and lost a whole day because of it.“It taught me a very good lesson – that I couldn’t do it alone and that these runs were pilgrimages, not races.“I had my tail between my legs the next couple of days but the reception at Durham Cathedral reminded me of what I was doing and why.”Mark enjoyed a similar reception at the Forth Bridges, where supporters and family joined forces to cheer him on before he reached the finish line in St Andrews on November .The following day, he addressed parishioners in St Leonard’s Church.It was the perfect place to end Running Home as St Andrews was once such a centre of pilgrimage.Mark took a breather to enjoy Christmas and New Year but has a busy  planned.He added: “I’m heading to Iraq in the spring to see how the money is being spent.“I also plan to revisit some of the places and people I met this year, by car though!“I passed through a lot of villages that were torched in the Highland Clearances.“People were forced out of their homes, and in some cases country, so there’s a sense of solidarity there with today’s refugees.“I was conscious of not being able to spend much time in places where I got a great deal of support.“So I’m hoping to revisit some of those communities, combining storytelling and traditional folk music to consolidate the friendships I made this year.”Karen is not keen for Mark to pull his running shoes back on too soon, but he will be taking on the York Marathon in October.

With this technology being unmanned, the union representing staff, Prospect, has said  jobs could be at risk.HIAL#s plans, which it says will be phased in, would see control centralised to a #Combined Surveillance Centre# at New Century House in InvernessHIAL has said the changes, which come as part of the latest phase of its controversial air traffic management programme, are aimed at ensuring the long-term sustainability of its operations in Scotland. HIAL has also said there are no planned reductions in staff numbers as a result of the project.The union representing staff at the airports, Prospect, says the proposals are #poorly thought-through, have not been consulted on, and will put the long-term future of vital services at risk.The union has said the plans could take £.m of direct employment away from rural and island economies.Further proposals would also see a review of air traffic services at At Benbecula and Wick John O’Groats, with a new system put in place there, which Prospect says would likely result in a further ten redundancies.HIAL managing director Inglis Lyon, said: “The strategic programme decisions made by the Board will move us into the implementation phase of the project and allow detailed operational decisions to be made. “The acquisition of a base for the new Combined Surveillance Centre marks a signicant next step in the project.“It will allow us to move forward with planning and procurement of the relevant systems to safely deliver a state of the art air traffic control management system and give additional clarity to colleagues and stakeholders as we deliver this complex and challenging programme.“Our focus continues to be on aviation service delivery and providing a safe, modern and efficient means of handling aircraft for the regions and the islands in the future.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Orkney has the highest incidence of MS anywhere in Scotland and indeed worldwide.Commenting on the announcement, Mr McArthur said: “MS is a devastating condition that can cause serious pain and discomfort to those affected, seriously impacting upon their lives and those around them.“This decision by the Scottish Medicines Consortium to allow Ocrelizumab to be used in the treatment of early primary progressive MS is therefore excellent news. It is something I know that many constituents, as well as the MS Society, have been calling for over many month. Hopefully, it will help improve treatment and provide a signicant step forward in the fight against this debilitating condition.“Scotland is currently home to world class research that is looking into more ways that people can manage the symptoms of MS, with a view to eventually finding a cure. By sanctioning the use of Ocrelizumab, the SMC is helping encourage further breakthroughs in this research.“Meantime, organisations such as MS Society Orkney do extraordinary work to support those with MS and their families. I would encourage anyone affected by MS to contact them and find out how they can benefit from their invaluable services and support.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Nine miles I tell you – that’s a Sunday School trip with juice and crisps in your packed lunch box before you even think about running along the West Sands to the strains of Vangelis.: General election: Why I’m scunnered with politics these days – Kevan Christie: After  years, I can finally say it: I hate golf – Kevan ChristieThis carry-on, which is straying into ‘a piece of nonsense’ territory, came to the picturesque Fe mining village of Crossgates where I live the other day.No sooner had I left the grounds of the estate in the Toyota Auris,  plate, than I ran into three sets of temporary traffic lightsthat had turned Main Street into a scene reminiscent of the final hours of the Battle of Stalingrad.Humbug Park, Divito’s and Crystal CornerPanic-stricken white van drivers had abandoned their vehicles in the middle of the road as they rushed to the takeaway to get their daily fix of Lorne sausage on a roll.Squads of workers in high-vis jackets crowded round a small transistor radio eagerly waiting to hear what song Ken Bruce had chosen to kick-off his .am Radio  show with before gathering again to listen to the PopMaster quiz at half-ten. Doing anything but working as they let their young hearts run free.Motorists had time to run into the chemist and pick up a prescription in the time it took for the TTLs to change colour. Utter carnage.The cause of all this consternation was the arrival of a fleet, well two... OK one, articulated lorry dropping off building materials at a new development called Crossgates, Dunfermline.This got the old tether up as, to my knowledge, Crossgates has never been in Dunfermline – although I’m sure some parish boundary pedant will be digging out the ancient scrolls in an attempt to justy the unjustiable.We’re a self-proclaimed People’s Republic in ‘The Gates’ with our own shop selling crystals – Crystal Corner – and we’re also home to The Crystal Bar, a target shooting shop, a hairdresser called Kutz for U and the best ice-cream shop in the world – Divito’s.Our football team are Crossgates Primrose who play at the beautully named Humbug Park where Scotland legend Jim Baxter first graced the turf.So you can keep Dunfermline with their Pars, fancy Abbey, Robert the Bruce and his Spiders from Mars.I may add that none of the above have paid me in cash for the shameless plugs and the four boxes of Caramel Wafers I received are on the cusp of their sell-by date, give or take a day or two,No plug for property developersBut the property developers – who shall remain nameless – have felt compelled to attach the name of the nearest big toon to the new houses in the hope this attracts the aspirational . children brigade and their funny wee yappy dugs. “Be gone with your toonie ways – there’ll be no avocado on toast in my backyard.”The area around Dunfermline has doubled in the last few years with no end of new builds springing up in the Duloch Park suburb – which is handyyou’re looking for next-day deliveries from the Amazon warehouse just off the M and a manageable commute to Edinburgh. They also have their own giant Tesco for the milk and maltesers. “Come to Duloch, where dreams are made.”It sometimes takes a while for things like medical practices and schools to catch up when developers decide to create a small town in a field in the middle of nowhere but residents will be spoiled for choice when the inevitable fast-food outlets arrive ahead of the game.All of these shenanigans remind me of a friend from the old country over there in Embra, where this kind of stuff really matters, who told everyone he was from posh Ravelston as he shared the same EH postcode as them.The fact that he lived a stone’s throw from his local The Doo’Cot Pub in sunny Drylaw mattered not a jot as he fancied a better class of pigeon that hung around the “bought hooses” up the road.Upper DuddingstonMy friend and I also like to tell people “we’re old Academy boys” and enjoy watching the confused look on their faces as they try to work out how you can talk like that after going to Edinburgh Academy when we really mean the Leith version.Duddingston and Corstorphine are just two of many ‘desirable’ areas of the Capital that are rapidly expanding with estate agents quick to crowbar anywhere within a five-mile radius into their listings.So, the perfectly decent housing estate of Magdalene becomes Upper Duddingston and similarly Clermiston is incorporated into Corstorphine in the minds of the deluded to whom these things matter.I recently heard the Bellevue area described as North New Town which is a bit of a leap in terms of increasing property values.We can all laugh at this status anxiety and I’m sure everyone can name an area from their part of the country where this exists – a network of spam valleys.Conversely, hipster types look to the more edgy parts of town like Leith in the hope of gaining a bit of street cred and I’m starting a campaign to make Piershill trendy.My last bit of advice folks is to keep your eyes peeled for this type of shenanigans andyou see a sign for new builds that’s been vandalised with marker pen changing “near” to “nowhere near”, it wisnae me.

We believe all MSPs should be able to have their say on this issue and we are now looking at how this might be brought to a vote of the full Parliament.”The European flag, with its gold stars on a blue background, was designed to stand for the “ideals of unity, solidarity and harmony among the peoples of Europe”.It was first developed by the Council of Europein the s and also adopted the EU some  years later.The UK Government recently underlined its committment to the CoE after Brexit was completed.Speaking last week, the UK Attorney General Geoffrey Cox, said: “As we leave the European Union, the country and the world should know that this nation stands for liberty, freedom and human rights. “One mark of our standing for those values will be our continued vigorous participation in the Council of Europe and our subscription to the convention on human rights.”In his letter to MSPs, Mr Macintosh said the SPCB had agreed that after Brexit, the Scottish Parliament “will no longer fly the EU flag on a daily basis”.He added Holyrood will still fly the Council of Europe flag on Europe Day “as a mark of our continued ties with that body”, adding the Parliament’s flag policy will now be “amended to reflect these decisions”.A Scottish Parliament spokesman said: “The decision taken reflects the legal position that the UK will no longer be a member of the EU from  January.”©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"scotland weather temperatures could plunge as low as 6c this weekend","story":"Plunging temperatures are expected across the country this weekend with the mercury predicted to dip as low as -C .Forecasters said most areas will remain dry and bright with temperatures between Cand Cduring the day on Saturday and Sunday.But things are looking much colder as the night draws in.Met Office forecaster Mark Wilson said: \"Temperatures could drop to around -Cto -in the evenings on Saturday and Sunday.\"Beyond the weekend things will become \"increasingly cloudy and milder from the North West\", he added.Public Health services are urging people to prepare for cold weather conditions and look out for those most at risk.Dr Owen Landeg, an environmental public health scientist, said: \"Below  degrees, changes to the body mean that the risk of strokes, heart attacks and chest infections increase so heating homes to this temperature is particularly important to stay well.\"Mr Wilson said that northern and western Scotland will see brief showers on Saturday morning before sunnier conditions on Monday morning with temperatures of around C .The cold snap comes after Storm Brendan swept across parts of the UK last weekend causing road closures and rail disruption, as well as gales of up to mph.It also marks a change from last month when meteorologists confirmed that a new UK maximum temperature record for late December was set in the Highlands.

While it is widely accepted that modernisation of air traffic control infrastructure is needed across the region, Ms Wishart says Hial’s own consultants have acknowledged that the ‘remote tower’ model was the most ‘costly’ and ‘risky’ of the options available.The Liberal Democrat MSP has now lodged a motion in parliament that will see a debate on the issue take place later this month.“It now appears clear that Hial’s management is intent on pressing ahead with their plans to centralise air traffic control services.#This is deeply worrying given the serious questions that still hang over these proposals and the level of concern amongst ATC staff.“Hial has been intent on pursuing this option from the outset, despite its own consultants identying the ‘remote tower’ model as the most costly and risky option. Since then, there has been a desperate attempt to get the evidence to fit the desired outcome.“That is simply not acceptable, particularly given the leline nature of these air services. No-one disputes the need to modernise and invest in the current infrastructure. However, this must be balanced with the safety of passengers, reliability of services and the benefits of sustaining high-skilled jobs in our island communities.“To date, the Scottish government has been happy to wave through Hial’s proposals with little evidence of robust scrutiny. I hope this debate will force the Transport Minister to think again and begin asking serious questions about these latest centralisation plans.”Highlands and Islands MSP Jamie Halcro Johnston has added his voice to calls for a debate in Parliament on HIAL’s plans to centralise air traffic control in the region.Mr Halcro Johnston, an Orkney resident and regular user of Hial services, said: “I share the concern of many people over Hial’s plans to centralise air traffic control services in Inverness.“There is real concern amongst Hial employees that they don’t feel that they have been properly consulted, particularly amongst those living in the islands. Hial should reflect on the feedback they are receiving and review their options before they commit to the approach they are advocating.“I am yet to be convinced that these proposals from Hial aren’t more about saving money than providing a better service. Given how important our vital leline air-links are, that would focusing on the wrong priority from Hial. “I would welcome the opportunity to see the issue debated at Holyrood and, with Hial entirely owned by the Scottish government, to hear the Minister’s justication for Hial’s plans.# It is understood that Hial is planning to update staff and stakeholders on the air traffic controllers issue later this week. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"man handed payback order and told to pay compensation ","story":"A man was ordered to carry out  hours of unpaid work and told to pay £ in compensation after he admitted taking a backpack from a pub which did not belong to him.Richard Oswald Layfield, , of Horseshoe Close, Virkie, was in the Douglas Arms pub in December  when he took the pack, believing it to belong to a friend he was with at the time.But when he got outside he realised the bag, in fact, belonged to somebody .Instead of putting it back, however, he held onto it – and its contents, which included a £ i-phone, £ in cash and a set of car keys.Layfield admitted a charge of reset when he appeared in the dock before Sherf Ian Cruickshank yesterday.Procurator fiscal Duncan MacKenzie said it would have been simple for Layfield to have rectied his mistake.“It was not the case that he was in a drunken state.

I am still weak but you can imagine what it is going to do for me when I fully recover.“I want to thank so many people, including my amazing CF team at Belfast City Hospital who pushed behind the scenes without me knowing, and the amazing staff on Level  South Transplant Ward who have become my second family.

As British citizens living in the United Kingdom, we have a complex and multi-layered identity which in many areas is wider than simply Ulster-Scots. We remain unconvinced that the cultural traditions and identity of the Orange family will be meaningfully promoted or safeguarded by these proposal.#Earlier Conradh na Gaeilge had branded the proposals an #historic advancement# for the Irish language but ones which fell #far short# of previous government commitments by the Irish and British governments.The deal includes a number of provisions for the language including the appointment of a Irish Language Commissioner.Dr Niall Comer, President of Conradh na Gaeilge, said that deal was #undoubtedly historic#, however, the organisation highlighted the absence of an Irish Language Act as promised in the  St Andrew#s Agreement. #This legislation is undoubtedly an historic advancement for our community, and for those who wish to use the language, by providing historic official status, legal protection and an Irish language Commissioner for the first time in the history of the state,# Dr Comer said.#This has only come about as the result of a tireless, inspirational and bottom up campaign which has transformed how people here now view the language and ultimately how the state will interact with our community and shared language moving forward.#Ciarán Mac Giolla Bhéin of Conradh na Gaeilge added: #This protection comes in the form of an Irish language Bill being pasted into the GFA, independent from the other language legislation, as new, separate parts of that agreement. If passed, we will hold any new power-sharing executive fully to account on the full implementation of these proposals and will tirelessly test and expose the weaknesses and glaring omissions in the coming days, weeks and months. #There are some huge question marks here. These proposals fall far short of the commitments made in the  St Andrew’s Agreement, which promised an Irish language Act based on the Welsh legislation and does not contain provisions that are made for language in Wales or in the south, as was explicitly committed to by both Governments. #The complete omission of visibility and signage is hugely frustrating and will undoubtedly be a source of tension and will expose major fault-lines on contested cases of signage in the coming period. However, the possibility of the delivery of signage through language standards will be rigorously and immediately tested by our community. #The role and remit of the commissioner being left to the sign-off of OFMDFM leaves us at the whim of a veto being used against core components of the legislation and drafting and delivery of services. The use of any veto to limit, obstruct or frustrate delivery of services and rights would undoubtedly erode trust and could be potentially catastrophic for any incoming Executive.#We welcome the adoption of recommendations included in our consultation document for the centuries long overdue repeal of the final remaining  Penal Law, that will now facilitate the use of Irish in Courts the new central translations hub the right to use Irish in the Assembly, where it was previously sneered at and belittled, which includes a provision for simultaneous translation. Finally, the commitment to an Irish language Strategy has the potential to transform our community in the coming years. #We will now work diligently towards testing the glaring gaps in the legislation that prevent us from playing a fair and equal role in our society. Legal advice is being sought on several of the provisions, including the ‘official status’ provision. The devil is not only in the detail of the legislation, but in the implementation of that legislation.#"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"o theanga leipreachain go dti acht ghaeilge","story":"I , caitheadh amach as mo chéad chruinniú den Chomhairle i mBéal Feirste mé as Gaeilge a labhairt.Nó “teanga leipreacháin” mar bhaist Sammy Wilson uirthi.Mhuscail mé inniu agus Acht Ghaeilge ar an táirseach againn.Moill ró-fhada ach d’éirigh linn mar phobal Gaeilge ó Thuaidh tabhairt ar na húdaráis an tAcht a bhí geallta ó  a ghéillstin.Tá na heilimintí tábhachtacha atá de dhíth in aon Acht ansin:Stádas oigiúil.Coimisinéir Teanga.Caighdeáin seachas scéimeanna.Agus ar ndóighe tá ríméad ar leith orm go bhfuil aistriúchán comhuaineach le bheith curtha ar fáil sa Tionól féin agus comhaltaí ag caint Gaeilge.

It was tough on a St Louis team who brought so much to the table, notched some fine scores and had a stoppage time goal ruled out before the game went to extra-time. Throw-in was delayed  minutes, such was the attendance. After playing second fiddle to a dominant but wasteful St Louis for much of the first-half, Maghera were still in touch and only trailed - to - at the break. googletag.cmd.push Ballymena had their exceptional goalkeeper Orlagh Convery to thank for some vital first-half interventions including a breath-taking reflex save to deny Aimee Lennon after Clare Gunnings rasper came off the bar. Caitlin Crawford extended the St Louis lead from a free but with Ceaacutet McEldowney and Bronagh McCullagh grabbing the game by the scruff of the neck, Maghera began to dominate. A fine Caoimhe Molloy point on the break looked like it would inspire St Louis but when Maghera substitute Niamh McCullaghs shot went all the way to the net to open a - to - lead, the game changed. Molloy, like her younger sister Katie, excelled for St Louis. Her thundering nd minute shot to the roof of the Maghera net put them ahead. googletag.cmd.push - POLL Who was player of the match  Vote here... It looked to have captured a first title for the Ballymena school in  years but there was still more drama to follow. First, Clare Gunning leveled the game before yet another twist. Caoimhe Molloy raced goalwards before dispatching a shot that dipped into the top corner with virtually the last puck of the game, but it was ruled out by referee ONeill for too many steps. For much of the second-half, players from both teams went down with cramp. However, following an agreement between both schools earlier in the day, extra-time was played. The games hammer blow was delivered by Clare Gunning, who sank St Louis with her goal in the first attack. It was followed by a third Maghera goal from Blathnaid McLaughlin at the start of the second period of extra-time. Magheras defence, in which Aimee Lennon played a pivotal role in extra-time, kept St Louis to a Molloy point and the cup was on its way back to Maghera.

It was tough on a St Louis team who brought so much to the table, notched some fine scores and had a stoppage time goal ruled out before the game went to extra-time. Throw-in was delayed  minutes, such was the attendance. After playing second fiddle to a dominant but wasteful St Louis for much of the first-half, Maghera were still in touch and only trailed - to - at the break. googletag.cmd.push Ballymena had their exceptional goalkeeper Orlagh Convery to thank for some vital first-half interventions including a breath-taking reflex save to deny Aimee Lennon after Clare Gunnings rasper came off the bar. Caitlin Crawford extended the St Louis lead from a free but with Ceaacutet McEldowney and Bronagh McCullagh grabbing the game by the scruff of the neck, Maghera began to dominate. A fine Caoimhe Molloy point on the break looked like it would inspire St Louis but when Maghera substitute Niamh McCullaghs shot went all the way to the net to open a - to - lead, the game changed. Molloy, like her younger sister Katie, excelled for St Louis. Her thundering nd minute shot to the roof of the Maghera net put them ahead. googletag.cmd.push - POLL Who was player of the match  Vote here... It looked to have captured a first title for the Ballymena school in  years but there was still more drama to follow. First, Clare Gunning leveled the game before yet another twist. Caoimhe Molloy raced goalwards before dispatching a shot that dipped into the top corner with virtually the last puck of the game, but it was ruled out by referee ONeill for too many steps. For much of the second-half, players from both teams went down with cramp. However, following an agreement between both schools earlier in the day, extra-time was played. The games hammer blow was delivered by Clare Gunning, who sank St Louis with her goal in the first attack. It was followed by a third Maghera goal from Blathnaid McLaughlin at the start of the second period of extra-time. Magheras defence, in which Aimee Lennon played a pivotal role in extra-time, kept St Louis to a Molloy point and the cup was on its way back to Maghera.

John Dallats introduction to politics came quite by chance.An invitation to join a new branch of the SDLP was sent to his brother, but John went instead and almost got selected to run for council.He declined, pleading that he was living and teaching in Donegal.Four years later, after ing to Kilrea to take up a teaching post at St Paul’s College, he was chosen to run and so began a letime of council work which culminated in John becoming the first ever nationalist mayor in Coleraine.This period also represented his involvement in rejuvenating the local Credit Union which was in danger of closingA new Conference of Saint Vincent de Paulwas also being set up in Kilrea which would do amazing things for people.Around the same time, the man who was about to become one of Ulsters most hated sectarian killers, was placed by the Probation Service in the very town John lived, and worked in.Just before committing the Castlerock and Greysteel atrocities, UFF murdererTorrens Knight was placed on a local community employment scheme in Kilrea.He left without completing the year of work he was ordered to do by the courts.“The rest is, of course history,” said John. “He and his cronies murdered my friend Gerry Dalrymple, who was in my house the night before the Castlerock murder of four workmen.“His last advice to me was to pull my curtains.“The following morning, he was dead and so too were three of his workmates.“These were dark and dangerous times with armed cops sitting outside the council chamber.“In the beginning I thought they were protecting unionists but when I complained that they could be better used other places I was told by the Divisional Commander it was me they were looking after because I had no control over my mouth!“Yes, Ulster Resistance had brought in guns which were ided among the UDA and UVF and in the future innocent people would die at Castlerock, Greysteel and where.“Among those in the security forces to die was Bertie Gilmore who lived in the same lane as me.“We played together, grew up together and Bertie joined the UDR and I the SDLP. googletag.cmd.push  John Dallat ready for the road in his beloved Morris Minor car. Photo: Mary K Burke “He had retired three years and was recovering from a severe heart attack when he and his we were riddled with gunfire beside the retirement site he was going to build.“Today his daughter is among those who have helped me in challenging times.”Johnwas born and bred in Rasharkin, Co Antrim.“On reflectionI was asked to be born into a dferent house in a dferent place I would turn it down.“I was happy growing up by a Tilley Lamp, carrying water from the well and waking up in the morning with ice on the inside of the windows.“Later on I loved the ‘put-put’ of our ‘Start-o-matic’ generator and Peeke my pet pigeon was never from my side.“She had fallen out of the nest and my mother nursed her back to le while she grew the most beautul brown and white feathers.“An amazing creature of God. I knew why we couldn’t get a council house and I know it was more than just because we were Catholics. “Poor Protestants didn’t get council houses either because they might also be unable to pay the council rent.“Anyway, we kept a goat for the milk which was good for my wee brother Gerard who was special needs both physically and mentally.“He died when he was  and part of my mother and father died too.”John said that being the “underdog” was second nature to him growing up.And it was something he carried with him into his politics career.“It just seemed right and at times didn’t go down well, especially when I sided with the travellers when they came to town but the travellers were good people and attitudes changed,” he said.“When a young girl from a dferent part of the world suffered horric le-changing injuries after losing her job and was left homeless, it seemed right to have her for Christmas in our home and it was one of our best and happiest times ever.“Today she and her family are our best friends and we love them to bits.“When an African student was going to be deported because her visa ran out and her sponsor died suddenly it seemed only right to bring her home and set about stopping her going back to a country where she had only a blind grandmother and no one .“Luck had it I met the head of the Border Agency in Stormont on the corridor and he extended her stay for two years.“In the meantime, she met an amazing husband, married and is among our best friends.“Brian Kennedy played at the wedding and we dressed up in African traditional dress!There is one battle, not yet won, which has had the most impact on John in his role as a public representative.He said: “Perhaps the one story which doesn’t have a good ending just yet is the dreadful murder of Inga-Maria Hauser whose mutilated body was found in Ballypatrick Forest  days after her neck was broken in an attempted rape.“Early next year I will meet her only sister Frederika at a special conference in Queen’s University.“That will be an amazing occasion and hopefully the prelude to her murderer being brought before the courts for one of the most brutal killings I have ever read about.”At the heart of it all has been one thing, John’s family.“Politics had its mixed blessings. I got to see places in the world that I could never have been but it also brought its problems – searching under the car for booby traps, bullet-proof windows and doors and a gun that I know I would never have used.“But politics also gave me the most incredible family.“My poor we Anne was parachuted into the north at the height of the Troubles to a small town which was bombed from one end to the other.“Our daughter, Helena, now a councillor, became the youngest detainee when we were arrested by the British army in Derry shortly after crossing the border.“She was ten days old and our mission was simply showing her off to her Donegal grandparents.“Sixteen years later as a member of the Foyle Harp School she played for President Bill Clinton when he first made that history-making appearance in Mackey’s Foundry.“Later, she would entertain other leaders including President Robinson and McAleese as well as John Major and member of the Royal Family.“I felt honoured when she was invited to play in the Russian Embassy in Washington on Saint Patrick’s Day.“Today the same harp is never out of sight but not played in public anymore.”John added: “Our two sons, Ronan and Diarmuid have been amazing and in one dficult and dangerous year we were on the Aran Islands three times for our safety.“For  years Inishmore, the largest of the three Aran Islands has been our refuge, our safety valve and our friend.“Two weeks ago when I was in hospital after breaking my arm while canvassing, Vincent Mc Carron, one of our friends, left the island during a storm, drove to Kilrea to collect Anne, go to Derry to collect me from hospital and bring me home. He stayed for several days helping with my recovery.”In , one week after his mother sadly passed away, John became Deputy Speaker, a post he held for ten years.“I found it a strange place and certainly not reflecting my background where the term ’Mister’ was hardly order of the day.“In time I persuaded the doorkeepers and others to call me by my first name and I felt comfortable about that.“I felt I was dismantling a bit of the old Stormont that was in danger of being rejuvenated!“All these people were my friends by simply showing them a bit of respect, nothing more and I have missed them dearly over the last three years when I see little of them anymore.”Reflecting on challenges and achievements in his political career, Mr Dallat spoke about stopping the closure or the Belfast-Derry railway north of Ballymena.”The twenty-year project nearly went off the rails several times,” he said.“The Civil Service had a plan to save money by closing the railway north of Ballymena and use the savings to make a start on the A roadway though Toome.“Today the Belfast-Derry railway carries many more passengers than the Belfast-Dublin Enterprise service, but still needs connected to the Irish Rail network and that is a priority for me.John added: “Stopping the closure of the Irish Coastguard Radio Station at Malin Head, announced by Leo Varadkar when he was Minister for Transport.“I gave evidence to a Dail committee with two of my councillors and told the TD’s this was one of the best examples of cross-border bodies, seamless, transcending partition and two world wars, costing very little and actually working! Varadkar had to back down.”As vice-chair of the Public Accounts Committee I exposed wanton waste of public money and brought about important changes which the civil service didn’t like.“Effort to cover up who was responsible for bad mistakes and neglect were strenuously resisted.“Later I was invited to Georgia and Armenia to share my experiences and I felt so honoured and privileged.“I just couldn’t believe that a boy that grew up in a house with no electricity, no running water could be involved in helping democracy grow in two of Russia’s former territories.”With the Assembly back up and running, John says he has great hope for the future.“I have been through the best and the worst of times and see an amazing future for this part of Ireland.“I see wonderful people all around me in both communities and I want to be part of that community for the sake of future generations that will create a new Ireland and one we can all celebrate.“I would encourage every young person to do likewise.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

BumpAlongtheWay premiered at the stGalway Film Fleadh last July, where it won the award for Best First Irish Feature, and had its international premiere at the prestigious Toronto International Film Festival. Speaking at the Derry premiere last October Bronagh said it was very much a Derry womans story. googletag.cmd.push Its about a woman in her s who goes on a night out and gets pregnant, much to the disgust of her -year-old daughter.She thought she couldnt have anymore kids and she finds herself about to have another one. Its a bitter sweet comedy because its about serious subject matters that women have to deal with like fertility, menstruation, endometriosis and menopause.They are heavy subject matters that can impact peoples lives and cause a lot of unhappiness. But theres also humour and a lot of jokes about down below so I think we got the balance right anditsvery much a Derry womans story. googletag.cmd.push Bronagh says it was a pleasure to work with her sister Louise and shehopes to do so again in the future. Wevedone a couple of bits and piecestogether but this is the first major feature film together. Im so proud of her because she is so professional and she really, really cares for the people she is working with.Im also very proud that we made the film in Derry and I look forward to working with the next young generation of film makershere in the city because there is so much talent and the sky is the limit.

The Bangor attacker played in Kurtis Bell, who slotted the ball into the inside side-netting after Saintfield were dispossessed at the edge of their own box.Saintfield raised it a few gears and struck three times in the  minutes before half-time.The first came from Andrew Clarke after James Sofley was played down the line. After beating two defenders, James played in Andrew, who passed the ball into the bottom right-hand corner past the lsquokeeper.It took less than five minutes for left back Oliver Duff to score Saintfieldrsquos third. A long ball found Adam Childs on the left wing.He played it back to the edge of the box for Duff. He took one touch to set himself before striking a powerful left-footed shot into the bottom right corner.The Saints scored one more goal before the break with Andrew Clarke playing the ball across the face of goal for Tony Liken to finish at the back post. Saintfield went into half-time in the driving seat and - up.The second half started much like the first ended with Saintfield scoring an early goal.Ryan Sofley was the supplier of an own goal after bombing into the box and fizzing a cross into the near post which ricocheted off the Bangor defender into the net.At - up, the Saints took their foot off the gas and conceded just over five minutes after scoring.Bangor gained possession from a loose ball in midfield and played it into Matty Hall, who turned well to beat the Saintfield defender before striking the ball low and hard into the bottom corner.The Saints were again quick to respond with Andrew Clarke getting his hat-trick with half an hour still to go.Clarke started the move in midfield and finished it expertly after James Sofleyrsquos effort was parried by the lsquokeeper.Saintfield had a penalty and rebound saved less than two minutes later after James Sofley was brought down in the box.However, the Saints werenrsquot finished yet and Clarke had one more goal left in them with  minutes left to go. Possibly the best goal of the game, as he showed real determination and skill to score his fourth. Another counter-attacking goal from the Saints as they broke fast from a Bangor corner.Clarke received the ball just inside the Bangor half and stood tall after several attempts to bring him down. He beat three defenders before slotting home a cool finish into the bottom corner.This goal also signalled the end of the goalkeeperrsquos game after he strongly disagreed with the refereersquos decision to allow the goal to stand. Bangor had one more chance before the end of the game when they were also awarded a penalty, but David Harper kept the Saintsrsquo five-goal lead intact and made it a penalty saved for both teams.A great performance for Saintfield who progress to the next round of the cup and a fantastic performance from  year-old Andrew Clarke who relished his role as an attacking midfielder.Saintfield United Bangor Young Men CLARENCE CUP ND ROUND.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th January 2020 Call.jpg","title":"Call to begin work on Ballynahinch bypass  ","story":"THE re-establishment of the Stormont Executive has led to fresh calls for work to start on Ballynahinchrsquos proposed multi-million pound bypass.Newly appointed Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon is being urged to signal the start of construction work on the scheme which is estimated to cost in excess of poundm.South Down MP Chris Hazzard mdash a former roads minister in a previous Executive who signed off the eagerly-awaited bypass in December  mdash has written to Ms Mallon seeking an assurance that the Ballynahinch scheme remains a priority for her department and that construction work will start as soon as possible.In addition, Rowallane councillor Billy Walker is tabling a notice of motion at the February meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council seeking across-the-board political support to seek an urgent meeting with Ms Mallon discuss the next step in the construction of the bypass.He also confirmed that Strangford MP, Jim Shannon, has written to Ms Mallon on the issue and is seeking a meeting with her to discuss the issue.There has been major progress on work on the near two-mile scheme to link the Newcastle and Saintfield roads, with work already completed on a major archaeological investigation along parts of the route.Work was due to complete on the schemersquos economic appraisal before the end of last year, with roads engineers confirming recently that in order to advance the bypass schemersquos state of readiness, preparatory work on contract documents was ongoing to ldquominimise the time required to initiate a procurement competition, should funding become available for construction.The by-pass, which would be the single biggest road scheme ever constructed in the district, is expected to take in excess of  months to build, with roads officials insisting that it will greatly benefit both strategic and local road users by reducing journey times and improving road safety.They are also confident that the schemersquos economic assessment demonstrates the by-pass would provide a good economic .The scheme is designed to alleviate chronic town centre congestion in Ballynahinch and along the main approach roads to the town.Major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road, with a new bridge constructed over the Moss Road.It is also proposed that a section of the bypass will pass under part of the Crossgar Road with a  metre long bridge constructed to take traffic over Ballynahinch River.Overtaking lanes stretching almost  metres are proposed at either end of the bypass where major new roundabouts are to be constructed, with the scheme also including a shared footpath and cycle lane.Mr Hazzard said that following his decision to formally sign off the scheme at the end of , the government department had been working through ious legal stages to ensure the scheme could commence as soon as possible.ldquoA programme of geotechnical investigation works on lands along theof the scheme was completed in  with advanced archeological investigation works completed last year, he confirmed.ldquoThis allowed the Department to move ahead with the final stage of preparing contract documentation in readiness of funding becoming available to construct the scheme.Mr Hazzard added: ldquoWith an Infrastructure Minister now in place following the restoration of Stormont this week, funding should now be signed off and construction allowed to commence as soon as possible.Cllr Walker said it was the view of many, including senior roads engineers, that the multi-million pound scheme was vital to the survival of Ballynahinch town centre and will play a signicant role in helping boost the wider South Down economy.He said given that the project is shovel ready, it is essential that the cash is earmarked to allow construction work to start this year is forthcoming.ldquoMoving forward what is now required is the finance to build this scheme, continued Cllr Walker.ldquoIt is clear to me that when you look at other parts of Northern Ireland that Down District has consistently missed out on major roads funding. That must change and the cash needed to build Ballynahinchrsquos new bypass must be made available.The Rowallane councillor said that the bypass can help kick-start the economic regeneration of Ballynahinch town centre and act as a catalyst to encourage new investment.Cllr Walker added: ldquoThe eagerly-awaited scheme can address town centre gridlock and along the main approach roads.

Lidl, which currently employs  staff, claims its proposal will create  new jobs.In late November, the local council confirmed that outline permission granted in March for the multi-million pound development was to be quashed as a result of a judicial review brought by developer Don Holdings Ltd.However, days later, the agenda for the December meeting of the Planning Committee included a plannersrsquo recommendation to approve the new store proposal. The recommendation was subsequently withdrawn, but features on the agenda for todayrsquos meeting with a recommendation to approve.The Newcastle development proposal includes plans for almost  parking spaces, eight of which are reserved for mountain rescue team members.A new pedestrian crossing at the Bryansford Road junction with Shimna Road forms part of the proposal, with planners receiving  objections. Five five letters in support of the new rescue team base proposal have also been lodged.Lidl has consistently argued that its current base at Railway Street in Newcastle is too small to allow the store to carry the companyrsquos full range of goods, highlighting issues with narrow aisles and inadequate parking provision.It says the Railway Street base was only supposed to be a temporary home until a larger unit could be found.Lidl says it has been looking for an alternative town centre site for over decade without success until the Shanslieve Drive site became available, with the planned mountain rescue team centre providing the volunteers with a permanent base.Objectors to the new store proposal claim that there are ldquoserious errors in the transport assessment submitted in conjunction with the planning application, inaccurate land ownership information, unachievable visibility spays and out-of-season traffic surveys.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokeswoman confirmed yesterday that the Lidl planning application was deferred to allow further consideration of a number of submissions received by the local authority.She added: ldquoThe Council is endeavouring to bring this application back to the Planning Committee in Februarypossible..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th January 2020 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C January 15%2C 1980  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH mdash Police believe that a professional gang were behind the drugs raid on a Ballynahinch chemist shop at the weekend.The thieves smashed their way into Hannawinrsquos Medical Hall in Main Street through a skylight and forced open a door to get to the shop. They used a crowbar to prise the steel cabinet containing a store of dangerous drugs out of the wall. The cabinet was later found along the side of the Carrickmannon Road, near Ballygowan.The drugs taken included heroin and cocaine, both of which are dangerous even in small doses. They are types of hard drug in big demand on the black market. Additives like glucose are used by drug pushers to multiply the volume and increase profits. Other drugs, including morphine and strychnine, were also taken.The raid was the latest in a spate across the province and police fear that the addiction problem could be more serious than previously realised.Police chiefs have backed chemists pressing for an urgent review of the Home Office regulations about the keeping of prescribed drugs in steel cabinets.The present procedure is making things too easy for the thieves. It has meant that the hard drugs are all kept in the same place and the professional thief knows that.Before  regulations, chemists had better safeguards, evenit meant hiding the hard drugs on the general drugs shelves. It meant that thieves could not go straight to the security cabinet and other break it open or take it with them.The head of the RUCrsquos drugs squad, Chief Inspective George McBride, said he agreed that there was an urgent need to re-examine safety procedures for storage of dangerous drugs.DOWNPATRICK mdash Compensation for the destruction of St Patrickrsquos Hall in Downpatrick has been agreed mdash almost six years after it was destroyed by fire.The trustees of St Patrickrsquos Parish were awarded pound, at Downpatrick Crown Court last Friday after a two-hour hearing.The award was made in four parts, the bulkbeing attributable to physical damage and the remainder split between loss of profits , contentsand site value pound,.The claim had been before the court for over a year and was held up after the Northern Ireland Office disputed the amount of the parishrsquos claim for loss of profits.On Friday counsel for the Northern Ireland Office argued that the hall trustees had not made a big enough effort to reduce lost profits. But this was strongly refuted by counsel for the hall trustees.In a -minute summing up, the judge looked at the ious points of the case. He said he felt the church had not acted unreasonably and that the trustees had done everything required of them under law.STRANGFORD mdash A Strangford schoolboy will pack his bags later this year to take up a scholarship at a new college at Cambridge mdash with the long term prospects of becoming a Cambridge don.He is  year-old Andrew McDowell, who is an A Level student at Down High School, and he learned this week that he was won an open exhibition to the famed university.In academic terms he has won the equivalent of a junior scholarship and he will be among the first major intake at the new Robinson College.Andrew already has nine O Levels and he sat the examination in November along with several thousand others.In October he will pack his bags to concentrate on Mathematics at the college, with the scholarship being renewable after two years.

The Ballynahinch venture was unique in having a large amount of surviving documentation.Mr Reid says it is clear from these papers that the scheme organised by the First Presbyterian Church was sophisticated, comprehensive, self-funded, and cradle-to-grave in scope. It included widowsrsquo and old age pensions, end of le and burial grants, and support for orphans.Finance allocated to the project was known as lsquoThe Poorrsquos Moneyrsquo. The scheme operated late in the reign of William III and was continued into the time of Queen Anne, George I and George II.Nowadays benefit claimants unable to work through illness or injury, are paid Employment Support Allowance, .In  a similar scheme was obviously operating in Ballynahinch. The church carpenter at that time was John Gough, and that year he suffered a signicant injury, perhaps a broken arm or leg. He was unable to work or to earn a living for over a year.John had been married six years earlier in , in his home congregation by Rev James McAlpine. His we was Elizabeth, neacutee Ferguson. Their children soon followed mdash Christine, who was five in  Rebecca, who was four, and their twin boys, George and James, who were just one year and one month.With four young children and no income, John and Elizabeth were soon struggling financially. But in April the church stepped in immediately, with payments for an initial three-month period, at six shillings per instalment. In August John tried to resume work, but couldnrsquot. The church continued payments, but now at a reduced rate of d. Another attempt at work in October  failed again, and again payments resumed.John eventually recovered and ed to work permanently in August , having received a total of  support payments from First Presbyterian. He resumed his valuable role in maintenance of the fabric, receiving church contracts in ,  and .The problem of unwed mothers and absent fathers is one that troubles every age and every generation. Back in the early s, the Ballynahinch Session took a stern approach to fire-and-forget fatherhood.Their starting point was an interview with the expectant mother to ascertain the identity of her co-responsible male partner. If she proved uncompliant, exclusion from church attendance was then threatened. Faced with resultant near-total social ostracism, the mother-to-be soon cooperated.The next stage involved the errant couple appearing some Sunday morning before the entire congregation, kneeling on the Stool of Repentance and confessing their extramarital transgression. After that they were received back into the congregation. Their child was baptised and recognised as a church member.In a -year period the Ballynahinch Session dealt with  such cases. In six, they identied both parents. In six other cases only the mother was identied in seven, only the father. In one case the origins and surname of a lsquofoundlingrsquo child were known, but neither parent actually came forward.By st century standards, these church procedures sound draconian. But they had the purpose of protecting the rights of the child and of offering an opportunity to the parents for their reputations to be salvaged,possible.The alternatives were a lot worse. It was common in the s for the sexton at Magheradroll Parish Church to discover live newborns abandoned overnight on his church doorstep, ordead through neglect or infanticide, to find their bodies surreptitiously concealed in adjacent graves.In Ireland such surviving infants were sent in large numbers to the Foundling Hospital in Dublin, which who received between ,-, orphans annually. The hospitalrsquos mortality rate was some %.In Ballynahinch, under Presbyterian auspices, some such infants were spared this grisly fate. The lives of a number of potential orphans were actively protected by the church in their home town.Under the Welfare Reform Act of , Disabled Living Allowance was controversially replaced with Personal Independence Payment. DLA payments were made to claimants who often had long term medical conditions. The amount of the award ied according to the degree of disability.Interestingly, in Ballynahinch in the early s, First Presbyterian made a number of long-term DLA-type awards to some lsquosupplicantsrsquo.Ms Grissel Foreman was on such a benefit from -. Some financial records of the Poorrsquos Money still exist. But all its other documentation is lost, so we donrsquot know what Grisselrsquos ailment actually was. It was obviously slow and progressive, perhaps something like tuberculosis, or multiple sclerosis, or Parkinsonrsquos.As her condition deteriorated, the church increased its amount of financial support. In  she received seven payments totalling s d. By  this had escalated to  payments totalling pound s d.She died in  and was buried at church expense. Over  years, amounts paid to her totalled pound s d. This was an enormous sum, considering the church ministerrsquos annual stipend at the time was pound.These and many other such stories will be outlined on Monday night at Down Museum.

We must go out there and grab them by selling what the district has to offer.Cllr Curran said given that the Newry, Mourne and Down area is the third largest of the provincersquos  district councils, it should be an ldquoattractive proposition for potential investors.ldquoThe focus moving forward must be on new job creation in both the public and private sector. It is important that we sell what the area has to offer.In relation to public sector job opportunities, Cllr Curran said available space at the Downshire Civic Centre could be utilised by a number of government departments keen to decentralise their operations from the greater Belfast area.He continued: ldquoNew investment will not happen out of the blue. We all have a duty to work together to secure it. I believe we need new hotels and there is a need for such a facility in the Downpatrick area and hope see progress on this issue in the near future.Cllr Curran is particularly keen to see the proposed commercial development at the site of the former Irish Street police station in Downpatrick and a number of adjacent derelict buildings progressed this year.ldquoThis exciting proposal has the potential to restore Downpatrickrsquos economic heart, create jobs and, most importantly, provide a boost for existing businesses via increased footfall, he said.Cllr Curran also warned that while attracting new investment is crucial, cracking Downpatrickrsquos traffic congestion problem is also essential.ldquoGridlock continues to stle town centre investment and we need to act quickly. While expensive schemes have been proposed in the past, nothing has happened. We must see progress in  and ensure roads officials deliver.ldquoWork was completed recently on a major upgrade of the Collinsrsquo Corner junction and while welcome, I and others remain to be convinced that it will address congestion problems in the heart of the town.Cllr Curran said roads officials also deserve praise for the improvement scheme in Fountain Street and hopes that in  efforts will be made by the Department for Infrastructure to improve Edward Street.He added: ldquoThis is a real problem area which has not been addressed. The presence of a busy primary school should ensure that roads officials redouble their efforts to improve driver and pedestrian safety.

Rail chiefs, who had been hoping for investment after the railways had proved so crucial to the war effort a few years earlier and that the buses would be barred from competing with the trains and instead provide a feeder service to stations, were devastated at the outcome.ldquoThe recommendation, accepted by Stormont, was that the entire Belfast and County Down Railway main line from Belfast to Newcastle, including the branches to Donaghadee, Ballynahinch and Ardglass, should be closed.The only route to be saved was the Belfast to Bangor connection, which continues operating successfully to this day.Mr Gardiner continued: ldquoThe attitude of Stormont was that it would be cheaper to move everything to the roads than to invest in railways that had been run down during the Second World War. People would use the buses instead. They developed huge road building schemes mdash most were never completed mdash but closed the railways first before these were even started. It seems incredible today.ldquoThe most puzzling element of the decision was the axing of the Belfast to Newtownards line, which served the east of the city mdash Dundonald, Knock and Comber areas in which the suburbs were developing and likely to provide increased commuter traffic had they been spared.ldquoIndeed, there were more than enough new diesel trains ordered to operate both the Bangor and Newtownards lines mdash and evidence suggests that the Transport Tribunal expected Stormont to spare the Comber line as a compromise option and as late as , before the tracks were lted, they were calling on the minister responsible to reverse the decision and trial these new diesel trains on this section of track mdash a call that fell on deaf ears.The  closures were the first steps in a plan which was to see the reduction of the Northern Irelandrsquos railway network from  miles to  miles mdash a decrease of  per cent.A decade later, the Great Northern Railway was ided between the UTA and its counterpart in the Republic, CIE, and further closures to lines to Armagh, Dungannon, Omagh and Strabane occurred.Willie Watterson and James Magill, who were porters and ticket clerks at Newcastle and Tullymurry stations, recalled their memories of the last train in an interview recorded for the BBC documentary lsquoRaising Steamrsquo in ldquoThe last train was a Sunday night. It was a cold winter night, January , , said Willie. There was twelve coaches, and two engines and two guards. She was packed. Packed to the doors. So I lit all the lamps, and put detonators on the line to give her a send-off.James added: ldquoI think every station did the same thing, so when the train came in there was a salute of bangs. I felt terrible about it, terribly terribly sad. I still felt it couldnrsquot happen. Still felt theyrsquoll come back, theyrsquoll run again. I couldnrsquot believe therersquod be no more railways, after working on them so hard.Adam Hamilton, who was a fireman mdash the person who stoked the fire on the steam locomotives mdash said: ldquoIt broke my heart, because the railways were in my blood. I still hear the sound of the steam still running on a clear night puffing away.Today, the Downpatrick and County Down Railway keeps the memory alive through its reconstruction of two miles of the former main line, as well as restored carriages rescued from their fate as hen houses.As part of its commemorations of the BCDRrsquos demise, it is keen to make contact with anyone who had any connection with the network, including former employees or their families, or people in possession of railway memorabilia such as photographs, tickets, timetables or even carriages.Mr Gardiner added: ldquoOne thing we would love for the museum is a BCDR unorm or tunic. So far we have been unable to track one down. Perhaps you have something in your loft And what of the future of the line  In November  the section of the BCDRrsquos former main line from Holywood Arches to Comber was opened as the Comber Greenway, whilst other sections have been used for roads as well as the section around Downpatrick being used by the DCDR.In the early s Northern Ireland Railways prepared a feasibility study into reopening the line to Newtownards, but this was not taken further by the Direct Rule administration.In May , the Department for Regional Development published its Railway Investment Prioritisation Strategy, which promised feasibility studies into the reopening of closed railway routes to Armagh, Dungannon and Castledawson by , but not including the Comber Newtownards route.However, maybe  years after the first railway closure in Northern Ireland, the new Minister for Infrastructure in the restored Stormont Government might see the first of those historic mistakes rectied.The Downpatrick Railway Museum can be contacted via email at info@downrail or message at www.facebook downrail..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th January 2020 Mickey.jpg","title":"Mickey ‘magic’ to help Magpies lift cup  ","story":"KILCOOrsquoS tearaways may hold the key to success in Sundayrsquos All-Ireland Club SFC final at Croke Park.The ability of their six forwards to win dirty ball and turnovers could dismantle the perceived invincibility of Corofinrsquos much-vaunted defensive system.Corofin, described in many quarters as the best club team ever, have an enviable set of defenders who squeeze the le out of the opposition.However, they have never encountered a team like Kilcoo before that has  attackers and  defenders.Conor Laverty, the three Johnston brothers mdash Ryan, Jerome and Shealan mdash Paul Devlin and Ryan McEvoy fight tooth and nail for every ball.They are the clubrsquos first line of defence and are not afraid to go where angels fear to tread, but can then turn into a snatch squad with the blink of an eye.Kilcoo will have to be at their bestthey are to cause an upset as the Galway and Connacht champions are sizzling hot favourites at   to win the Andy Merrigan Cup for an unprecedented third year in a row and the fourth time in six years.Certainly, Kilcoo have it all to do, but they fear no side.Manager Mickey Moran has twice taken Slaughtneil to All-Ireland finals day and few would begrudge the Derry man a first title with Kilcoo.He has transformed the Magpies into a ruthless, disciplined machine in a quiet, unobtrusive way and has won many admirers for his style of play.He started out in management in  when he took over the reins at Derry, the first of three separate spells in charge of the county team.

While pay parity and safe services are key issues for us, the key thing is that there are enough recurrent resources in place to deliver this now and in the future.Irene said the RCN is about putting patients first, describing the scale of the hospital waiting list issue as ldquounacceptable.She added: ldquoEmploying more nurses can help bring waiting lists down. This is not a new phenomena. It is tough to work as a nurse and it is not an easy job. But we currently have a situation where some nurses are taking on extra shts to earn more money, but that is just an unacceptable way to live.Alison Megarry said patients are nursesrsquo primary concern and at the heart of what they do, highlighting the need to keep staff working in Northern Ireland to ensure they donrsquot go across the water and donrsquot come back.She revealed that she was talking to a nursing sister last week who was working on international recruitment for nurses in Mumbai to work in Northern Ireland.ldquoThe nurses in India said why would they come here when the pay is less than it is in England, Scotland and Wales. I believe thatwe can keep our nurses here, it will help to tackle the waiting list issue, she said. ldquoThe big issue we have is that the population is ageing and people are living longer which therefore impacts on waiting lists.Nurse Sonia McCoubrey said that while pay parity is one issue, additional nurses are also required. She said many newly qualied nurses are choosing to go to England, Scotland or Wales because the money is better.She also said she worries about the safety of newly qualied nurses managing dficult situations and the patients they are caring for.ldquoYou have trolley waits and people lying in corridors. There is no privacy, no dignity and the situation is appalling. You go home at night after a sht burnt out and worried about what you have seen, the nurse added.Nurse Donna Boyd also expressed concern about waiting lists and said she fears that the situation is going to get worse, forcing many people to go private.ldquoIf more money is put into the system nurses are quite happy to do even more to help reduce waiting lists. All nurses go and above what is required of them when they are working, often staying after their scheduled quitting time which is unpaid work, she said.ldquoWith more people going private because of y waiting lists, a lot of the doctors and consultants are taking on private lists which then impacts on the NHS list. I have friends who were nurses who have left the profession to work in supermarkets because they have burnt themselves out.

Across the resort,  street lights are not working.The figures are available on the NI Direct website under the reporting fault problems menu with other districthot-spots including Ballynahinch where  street lights are currently out of order.Elsewhere,  faults have been reported in Killyleagh, with  brought to the government departmentrsquos attention in Castlewellan and Crossgar. In Saintfield,  faults have been reported.In Ballygowan,  street lights are currently out of order with  and  faults reported in Ardglass and Killough respectively.Sixteen street lights are out of order in Dundrum with  faults reported in Drumaness. The figures for the Spa and Clough are  and nine respectively.Last month, the Department for Infrastructure confirmed that its current budget for street lighting repairs was approximately poundm, explaining that the figure was much lower than the pound.m needed to provide a full street lighting repair service.It also revealed that repairs are now generally limited to those that can be carried out by the departmentrsquos internal street lighting workforce which only consists of five full and three part time electricians.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran described the number of reported street light faults across large parts of East Down as ldquoalarming and hopes that the money to expedite much-needed repairs will be earmarked by the new Stormont Executive.He said broken street lights in many areas represent a health and safety issue, explaining that an examination of every town and village across the district will reveal a signicant number of faults.Cllr Curran described faulty street lights as a ldquohot topic with politicians being contacted about the issue on all almost daily basis. He said the legacy of underfunding the roads department has experienced is now clear for all to see.The politician said many will be concerned that the Department for Infrastructure does not have the money it requires to carry out much-needed repairs.ldquoWhile I understand the decision to prioritise emergency repairs, there is no doubt that the alarming figure of almost  faulty street lights across East Down is simply going to increase. Clearly the issue is going to get a lot worse before it gets better, he said.ldquoStreet lights which are not working in areas where elderly people and indeed young families live poses a major problem. A fully working street lighting system provides residents with a sense of security and helps deter would-be criminals.Cllr Curran said that while the new Stormont Executive will inevitably face calls for investment in many key areas including health and education, the Department of Infrastructure also required an injection of funding.He added: ldquoWhile the focus for some will be on major new roads schemes which is understandable, it is clear that the creaking infrastructure the government department is responsible for, including street lighting, requires major cash injection.ldquoThe street lighting issues requires immediate attention. We are still in the grip of winter and several months away from the clearer evenings. Now that we have a local minister in place, I hope to meet her on this issue and other matters of local importance.A spokeswoman for the Department for Infrastructure said that in common with many other parts of the public service, the Department continued to face budget challenges and resources were currently not available to provide for a full street lighting repair service.She added: ldquoDue to this restricted service, outages are taking longer than usual to be repaired. However, priority will be given to hazardous electrical defects and group outages..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th January 2020 Tributes.jpg","title":"Tributes to lawyer who was ‘a real gentleman’  ","story":"TRIBUTES have been paid to a lawyer who died last week.Mr Paul McAlinden, who was a barrister, died peacefully in Belfast City Hospital last Wednesday.

It is understood that several councils have already received registrations.While the Mid and East Antrim council meeting was held in private, the News Letter understands that some members were strongly opposed to accepting a policy which would compel staff to carry out same sex marriages against their wishes.Alderman Paul Reid, pictured, who is also a church minister in Larne, said: “I can’t go into the specics of the meeting or the discussions that took place in closed council.“However, speaking generally this is an issue affecting the whole of Northern Ireland and each of our  council areas. This has everything to do with same-sex marriage, and at the same time nothing to do with same-sex marriage.“This is an issue of conscience. Just because legal advice says something is ok, doesn’t mean it is right for councils to enforce on staff. Religious beliefs don’t come into it.“While the General Registrars’ Office believes there to be no issue legally, it is absolutely wrong to force people to carry out duties which are at odds with their conscience.”Because couples have to indicate their intention to marry  days before doing so, the first same sex weddings are expected to be held next month.Last year MPs backed amendments which required the government to extend same-sex marriage here.Sam McBride: Ignoring an elegant solution, petition of concern reform undermines Belfast Agreement Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingPassengers were sobbing and making calls to loved ones - Aer Lingus pilot hailed miraculous after landing plane during Storm BrendanStorm Brendan NI BLOG: Widespread disruption, roads closed, coastal flooding and power outagesWill it snow in February   Northern Ireland weather forecast as widespread frost and cooler temperatures expectedBelfast Celtic defend Jay Donnelly signingThis time its tears of happiness - Cate Conway shares hilarious Stephen Clements prank video involving leopard print leggings        v.. -  applyImgSrcs\" i sb  for   sb* sb u  o.dataset.srcu  u.replaceo.setAttributeo.setAttributedocumentwindowapplyImgSrcs JP  JP  JP  \"NA-BELFNEWS-\"JP  \"Politics\"      Follow Us On       Explore News Sport Irish League Football Whats On Lestyle   Farming Le   More from the Belfast News Letter  Announcements Buy a Photo  Directory Jobs Homes Cars Local Guide  Public Notices  Reader Shop Must Read Read This Events   Useful Links Contact Us   Place your Ad Advertise a Job Subscribe  Readers Charter        ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"traffic and travel","story":" getRequiredClientIdforjpiconsole.log requiredClientIdcatch]EV.Core.updateUserProfile]EV.Core.updateUserProfile....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Publishing Ltd#s standard Terms and Conditions.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This year, she will celebrate her ninety second birthday and she discusses a letime of activism across Europe.Veganuary is an annual event which encourages people to go vegan for a month. In last yearrsquos campaign, a quarter of a million people pledged to try a vegan diet.More NewsVale school pals brave the shave for animal charityPenarth father of four is recognised in New Year Honour list for services to cricketHouse prices increased in the Vale of Glamorgan, latest figures showOnce a fringe movement, veganism is quickly gaining a vast appeal, especially amongst the young, as the environmental benefits of a plant-based diet become clearer.According to a study by the Vegan Society, , people in the UK were vegan in  ndash  and a half times higher than in . Almost half of these were people aged below .Veganism has brought with it a lucrative trade in plant-based produce as businesses move to accommodate the concerns of their customers and promote ethical alternatives to meat.Long before veganism became a dietary and commercial trendsetter, however, June Holder, a -year-old woman from Penarth, had her eyes opened to the costly effects of meat consumption. After eating a vegan breakfast at a local cafeacute, she settled down to tell me her story.ldquoIrsquove been vegan for  years, she said. ldquoMy daughter had a stall at Camden Market, and she used to collect masses of money for animal rights there. It was her who first introduced me to the cause.ldquoLater on, I organized a charity coffee morning and sent the money I raised to Compassion in World Farming. In , they sent me a magazine which showed what happened to the animals. Well, I sat down that morning and read what theyrsquod sent me ndash and I was vegan!Whilst the public has become more receptive to veganism, June still encounters hostility: ldquoPeoplersquos reactions y when I tell them Irsquom vegan. They become hostile because theyrsquore guilty, I suppose.ldquoI remember that a vegan group had a stall in the market a few years ago. They were advertising parts of Alsatians to eat. People were horried. So, when they were angry, I had a chance to talk to them. lsquoYou accept that any animal can be treated like this except when it comes to your dogsrsquo, I told them. Well, they had to accept it. How could they not Originally from Penarth, June moved to Dinas Powys from Barry after her husband, Derrick, passed away  years ago.Derrick was the owner of Holders Menswear, a menrsquos fashion store which was once renowned throughout the Vale of Glamorgan and beyond.Junersquos decision to become vegan sparked  years of dedication to activism. She joined the Animal Welfare Party, and, in her sixties and seventies, she travelled across the UK and Europe to campaign for animal rights.ldquoI demonstrated in many places. I went to Brussels twice to protest against the exportation of live animals. The International Fund for Animal Welfare took us in a coach.ldquoI was in the front row of the crowd, up against these spikes and razor wire. If they had started to push from the back, I dread to think what would have happened.ldquoThe night before the protest I had this thought: lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo. I wrote it on a little board.ldquoPeople kept tapping me on the shoulder and passing the board around the crowd and eventually it made its way back to me.What does the message mean ldquoIt means that it is more dangerous not to protest against these injustices that are happening.June still has a copy of the placard. Later, at her home, she retrieved it from a trove of scattered paraphernalia accumulated after years of protest.She has written prolically throughout her le about events which have provoked and enthused her.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Diverging substantiallywill bring in the requirement for inspections at the border for customs. “That hasn’t been agreed formally. That is quite a lot for UK and NI operators to deal with – haulage and freight movers, to get to grips with that. There are major operational challenges.“Northern Ireland also leave the customs union with GB, but there will be a customs border will between GB and NI to continue to essentially allow freight and good to travel.”Since Boris Johnson’s deal was floated, it’s understood the shipping industry is now drawing up plans for EU border checks in Britain for trade bound for Northern Ireland.According to the BBC, freight could be erted through ports with space for inspections at areas such as Liverpool and Stranraer.Richard says checks are likely to be carried out at the ports. The issue  He says backlogs, queues and congestion. “ to queueing back on to ferries and ships, which may miss or mess up timetables,” he says. He says while “many wouldn’t welcome new formalities”, a lot of cargo – such as dry bulk, fuel, aggregates and containerised products –  will find it reasonably easy to deal with. The main concern is around ‘roll on, roll off’, where the containers or lorries are driven on board a ship.“Those modes are where it could be the most problematic, as it’s based on a fluid process,” he says.“I think there is a definite concern from ports and shipping industries that businesses may be impacted negatively, and may reassess business operations.“I wouldn’t say it’s a doomsday scenario but it’s a real challenge for the sector to overcome. Politicians will have to make sure that with any kind of arrangements, there will be a good solution. This is a new proposal, so we are unsure what the details will be.”Brexit aside, Richard says the industry as a whole is that while the largely commercial and independent ports aren’t in need of ‘hand outs’ from the public sector, areas such as connectivity, roads and planning are key to their success.“It’s about making sure the planning system works, and is swt, and responsive,” he said. “They can be agile, for example, building a new shed, terminal or quay, or new developments in the water.“Where there are environmental sensitivities it can sometimes slow down the planning regimes so we are keen to see them not slow down. We welcome environmental policies but we want a scheme that will work and doesn’t have unintended consequences.“Shipping, although not perfect, is one of the most clean and efficient methods of transport. It’s a balance between environmental protection, but enabling ports and regions to grow.“If there are schemes, ports can find there are investors willing to come in, but they do rely on government – local or national – to finance road and rail connectivity.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/year1.jpg","title":"yearbook a look back at ","story":"Posted on Thursday January  by Ulster Business It was another year shaped by political turmoil and the loss of some giants of industry, but it was also a period which saw great opportunity and growth.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/234234343334.jpg","title":"stormont deal business back new assembly","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by John Mulgrew Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Julian Smith and Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney. Pic Kelvin Boyes Northern Ireland’s business community has given its support for a deal which has seen the Assembly up-and-running after a three year stasis. The Northern Ireland Assembly couldon Fridaypolitical parties back a deal tabled by the UK and Irish Governments. DUP leader Arlene Foster has indicated that her party will back the deal, while Sinn Fein said its leadership will meet to discuss it on Friday. The UUP has said they will consider the deal, but are willing to attend the Assemblyit sits. In a joint statement urging politicians to accept the ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal, NI Chamber president John Healy, vice president Ian Henry, and chief executive Ann McGregor, said: “After three years of paralysis, we now have a workable deal that will allow an Executive to start addressing the problems within our health service and education system. They will also be able to take action to grow our economy and support the community and voluntary sector. “We therefore encourage the five main political parties to progress it urgently. Business, health and education cannot wait any longer - failure is not an option. “Now is the time for our politicians to show mature leadership and help navigate a path to the future by accepting this deal.” Secretary of State Julian Smith and Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney published the New Decade, New Approach deal on Thursday evening and urged parties to back it andto Stormont on Friday. Reacting to the news, Trade NI – the alliance of Retail NI, Manufacturing NI and Hospitality Ulster – said: “We welcome the draft deal published by the British and Irish Governments in the final round of talks to restore devolution. We strongly encourage all the main parties of Northern Ireland to sign the deal today and get the Assembly back up and running.” “As our three organisations represent the majority of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland, we are cautiously hopeful that the deal and aof the Assembly will see the development of policies and legislation at devolved level and the kick start that our economy desperately needs. The clear prioritisation of the Northern Ireland economy highlights the many challenges that businesses have faced over the past three years and our message to the parties is that we support you in your endeavours to secure this deal.” “While this is a good start, improvements are still needed to drive the economy forward and support the growth of business across Northern Ireland. As stated in our Vision  document, Northern Ireland’s potential is signicant but reform and growth is needed to create the modern economy we are capable of and deserve.” FSB NI policy chair, Tina McKenzie, said: “Businesses will welcome the agreement published last night as a step forward towards restoring devolved government, something for which FSB has been calling since the collapse of the institutions three years ago. “The draft agreement contains some positive commitments to bolster the local economy, on issues like skills, infrastructure and Brexit. However, theof devolution is by no means a panacea it just means that at long last we have elected representatives in place to tackle a very dficult task. “The next Executive must move quickly to deliver on the myriad issues which have been left unaddressed for far too long. While the health service will be high on the agenda, we must not lose sight of the need to bolster our SME economy, which is the absolute bedrock on which the first-class public services to which we all aspire are built. “Ministers must move swtly to support our economy at one of the most turbulent times for many decades, starting by lowering the rates burden on small businesses, whilst also moving forward rapidly with key infrastructure projects which have stalled and ensuring that our schools, colleges, and universities are providing students with the skills they need for the jobs of the future. “In order to begin to address these issues, the parties must put pragmatism first and get back round the Executive table.” Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster, said: “We encourage all parties to seize this opportunity and sign up to the deal published late last night to get the Assembly and Executive back as quickly as possible.” “This is the best chance to bring the devolved government back to le. Our message to the party leaders is clear, we support you in your endeavours and encourage you to get the New Decade, New Approach agreement over the line today. Redmond McFadden, president of the Londonderry Chamber of Commerce said: “The Londonderry Chamber as well as other representatives of business, education, health, trade unions and civic organisations, held a meeting with the five main political parties at Stormont last night. “At that meeting we pressed the urgent need for the parties to agree the draft deal which was published by the British and Irish Governments. Three years without Ministers making local decisions has had an enormous impact on our economy and wider society. A lack of effective and meaningful representation here is curtailing investment in our region, stling job creation and driving our young people away. Simon Hamilton, chief executive of Belfast Chamber, said: “Belfast Chamber welcomes progress towards the restoration of the Northern Ireland Executive and encourages the local political parties to reach agreement. For the last three years, our members have seen how an absence of decision making has stunted growth and stled investment. The proposed priorities for the Executive contain some issues which Belfast Chamber has been supportive of for some time. “Other policies which could boost our economy are noticeably missing but we look forward to joining with our colleagues across the business community to ensure that the new Executive pursues an agenda that grows jobs and boosts our economy.” Northern Ireland Local Government Association chief executive, Derek McCallan said: “I am very pleased that the British and Irish governments have tabled a draft deal on restoring the NI Executive. I hope that an agreement can be reached quickly to get the Stormont institutions back up and running immediately. For three years, our eleven local councils have been the only ing form of democratically elected government in Northern Ireland. Local government has been a vital democratic anchor during this period and ensured the provision of crucial public services for local citizens. “It’s time to bridge the democratic deficit and unlock the potential of local government in Northern Ireland by investing in our local councils. An Executive commitment to a devolution bill and greater financial powers and resources will drive a transformation in Northern Ireland’s democratic governance and help create a more sustainable democracy, environment and economy for Northern Ireland.” Kirsty McManus, national director, IoD NI, said: “The ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal is to be welcomed, filled with ambition that,fulfilled, can deliver real improvements for the people and businesses of Northern Ireland. “We would therefore urge all parties to get behind the deal to enable the speedy restoration of the Executive. “Commitments from the British and Irish governments for some crucial pieces of infrastructure such as the York Street Interchange, upgrades to the A and A road and Northern Ireland’s wastewater network are particularly pleasing. “The expansion of university provision at the Magee campus in Derry meanwhile will go some way to rebalancing the regional economy. “Plans for multi-year budgets and increased civic engagement will also improve overall governance. “From a business perspective however, we would have liked to have seen more around a new skills agenda, which urgently require focus alongside a renewed look at the Apprenticeship Levy which is not included in this deal. “On behalf of our members, we will also monitor closely commitments to bring forward legislation that will allow unfettered access to the Great Britain market for local business following Brexit.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_Abacus-Grand-Central-1--1-.jpg","title":"belfastforlife expo bringing together ni diaspora","story":"Posted on Monday  January  by Ulster Business A new event will bring together the Northern Ireland diaspora and business community in a bid to promote and develop the region.
