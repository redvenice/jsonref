You\u0027re such a puritan.\u0027The conversation \u0027descended into a screaming match\u0027 before Andrew said: \u0027Leave me alone. Jeffrey\u0027s my friend. Being loyal to your friends is a virtue. And I\u0027m going to be loyal to him,\u0027 it was claimed.           The woman who stayed at Balmoral spent almost a year in Epstein\u0027s orbit, joining him on about a dozen trips. Epstein (above) gave her a place to live in New York, rent-free, and later paid for her to go to collegeMiss Roberts first landed her claim that she was a schoolgirl \u0027sex slave\u0027 in a US court in 2014. She claims she was forced to submit to abuse by rich and powerful men, all of whom deny wrongdoing.Last night Buckingham Palace said: \u0027This relates to proceedings in the United States, to which The Duke of York is not a party. Any suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue. It is emphatically denied that The Duke of York had any form of sexual contact or relationship with Virginia Roberts. Any claim to the contrary is false and without foundation.\u0027Miss Roberts claims she had been groomed for abuse since 15 by billionaire Epstein – said to be \u0027addicted\u0027 to molesting children – and his \u0027madame\u0027 Ghislaine Maxwell, the daughter of disgraced tycoon Robert Maxwell. Legal papers filed in Palm Beach, Florida, alleged that an underage Miss Roberts \u0027was forced to have sexual relations\u0027 with Andrew \u0027in three separate geographical locations: in London (at Ghislaine Maxwell\u0027s apartment), in New York, and on Epstein\u0027s private island in the US Virgin Islands.\u0027There has been no claim that Andrew was aware that Miss Roberts was acting under duress and he denies any such incidents happened at all. The flight logs for Epstein\u0027s luxury black Gulfstream jet are not publicly available \u0027at the request of the owner\u0027, but the Mail has obtained entries for March and April 2001, showing Miss Roberts being flown on a six-day whirlwind tour from Palm Beach to Canada, Paris, Grenada in Spain, Tangier in Morocco, and finally touching down at London\u0027s Luton airport on March 9.

A month later, on Monday April 9, the duke began an official visit to the US in his capacity as chairman of the trustees of the Outward Bound Trust.That day\u0027s Court Circular states he departed \u0027this morning\u0027 from London\u0027s Heathrow Airport, arriving in New York later that day. As it was an official trip, the flight was funded by British taxpayers.The same day, Miss Roberts also flew to New York. She and Epstein left his £8million mansion in Palm Beach, Florida, and the flight log shows they flew aboard his 22-seat Gulfstream –with its personalised licence code ending \u0027JE\u0027 – to New York via Atlantic City.Although Miss Roberts and the duke were both in New York, there is no information to suggest whether they met, and the Palace has declined to comment, beyond denying they had any \u0027relationship\u0027.The next morning, a Tuesday, the Duke flew to Boston for a series of royal engagements. According to Miss Roberts\u0027 claims in newspaper interviews, it was around this time – Easter – that she was ordered to Epstein\u0027s mansion in New York and met Andrew again. Yesterday the Palace was specifically asked if he met Miss Roberts at this time, and it declined to answer, other than to say he denies any sexual encounters with her.The next meeting she recounts was in the Caribbean. The flight logs show that Miss Roberts and Epstein left New York on April 11 aboard the jet for St Thomas, in the US Virgin Islands, for a boat transfer to Epstein\u0027s private island next door.The Court Circular does not state the duke\u0027s whereabouts for the next few days, but it appears he too flew south – because by Easter Sunday, April 15, he was reportedly \u0027in the Bahamas\u0027. He had been absent from the Queen\u0027s Easter service at Windsor Castle, and a royal courtier explained to the Daily Telegraph, which published the titbit, that he was on holiday in the Bahamas with ex-wife Sarah Ferguson and their daughters.It is unknown when the duke arrived in the Bahamas – about a two-hour flight from Epstein\u0027s island – or when he left. Yesterday the Mail asked Buckingham Palace whether Andrew stopped at Epstein\u0027s island en-route to the Bahamas. A spokesman again declined to confirm or deny the suggestion.According to Miss Roberts\u0027 claims, the duke was there for one night. She claimed she flew to the island with Epstein and Miss Maxwell – which is confirmed by the flight logs. The Mail asked the palace a series of questions about Prince Andrew\u0027s movements that week but none of them were answered.Miss Maxwell has strongly denied the allegations against her as salacious, spurious and untrue. Epstein, 66, hanged himself in his cell earlier this month."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/08/19/23/17462592-0-image-a-14_1566255054902.jpg","title":"MAX HASTINGS reveals hidden story Dambusters","story":"Share this article   Albert Speer, Hitler’s armaments supremo, was initially shocked by the havoc wreaked by ‘a mere 19 bombers’ but within days recovered his nerve and performed one of his accustomed feats of management and improvisation, to restore production and start upon repair of the dams.Just 18 weeks later, the Möhne was once more sealed, in time to catch the autumn rains — though at a cost that has been estimated as equivalent to £6 billion in modern money.For weeks after the flooding, affected areas reported disruption of production caused by water shortages at shaft mines, coking plants, smelting works, power stations and armament factories. Coal production fell. Workers also had to be erted from other key projects, such as fortifying Hitler’s Atlantic Wall, to repair the broken dams.But six weeks after the raid, the Ministry of Economic Warfare in London reported that, though the destruction was serious and would involve a large amount of repair work, ‘the Möhne damage did not touch the main industrial centres’. Decrypts by codebreakers at Bletchley Park showed the emergency was quickly controlled.Professor Sir Michael Howard dismissed Chastise in his official history of British Grand Strategy as ‘a spectacular feat of skill and courage, but one whose effect on the German war effort was, unfortunately, slight’.As for Barnes Wallis’s ‘bouncing bomb’, for all its wizardry, it was never used in action again. It proved to be a technological cul-de-sac, costly in lives and unusable in any other circumstances.There were other gains, however. Millions of Germans were obliged to confront the vulnerability of the Reich and the emptiness of repeated promises about their security made to them by Hitler, Goering, Goebbels.While the strategic air offensive failed to break the spirit of Hitler’s people, such a night’s work as that of 617 Squadron imposed a trauma which it seems foolish to understate.Britons, by contrast, were elated when the news broke. That spring of 1943, after nearly four years of austerity, unpalatable food, family separations and spasmodic terrors, the British people were weary.Chastise lifted their spirits and revived flagging confidence in their own nation’s powers, as had few events since the desert victory at El Alamein six months earlier. The marriage of technological brilliance with human courage and airmanship awed and thrilled them.As for the aircrew who executed it, whatever the moral ambiguities thrown up by the Dambusters raid, they will continue to deserve the admiration of their descendants.EXTRACTED from Chastise: The Dambusters Story 1943 by Max Hastings, to be published by William Collins on September 5 at £25. © Max Hastings 2019.

Let\u0027s show our children that it\u0027s cool to be kind.\u0027 US chat show host Ellen DeGeneres also defended the couple, posting on Instagram: \u0027Portia and I met Prince Harry and Meghan in England to talk about their work on wildlife conservation. \u0027They were the most down-to-earth, compassionate people. Imagine being attacked for everything you do, when all you\u0027re trying to do is make the world better. "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74a2bc8b54875828a3503646cdaeac802ed2be56/0_229_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e6cacef3c197fc951dda27cfcf199d01","title":"from sun to sun the photo series livening up new york city bus shelters","story":"Elle Pérez has used 100 bus stops in the city to showcase their experience growing up as a non-binary Puerto Rican New YorkerThe punk community in the Bronx has a secret handshake called the Flight. It involves a fist bump, a finger point and a chest pat. Most of us will never understand it, but we will see it.A photograph of the handshake is now on view in various bus stops across all five boroughs of New York City until 24 November. It’s part of a new series of images by the Bronx-born artist Elle Pérez called From Sun to Sun, which puts 16 photos on more than 100 bus stops in 13 neighborhoods in the city, from Harlem to Williamsburg.“There’s figures, portraits, the hands and environments like street scenes, fake flowers and bicycles,” said the Public Art Fund exhibition curator Katerina Stathopoulou. “Elle wanted to combine figurative work and street scenes to create a rhythm of daily life.”The photos detail Pérez’s experience growing up as a non-binary Puerto Rican in the Bronx, from flags to special meals, community leaders and pensive moments with city architecture.“It’s a decentered exhibit outside of a gallery or museum,” said Stathopoulou. “There’s something so powerful about Elle’s portraits and environments that is so engaging, which is apparent in their work.”The photo of the handshake credits its co-creators, Jay P Fury and Bryan Keith, friends of Pérez. “It’s a handshake specific to the Bronx,” said Stathopoulou. “The fist pump and the chest touch. It’s created in the punk scene, which Elle was involved with as a teenager. Elle incorporated images specific to their experience.”“Elle asked: ‘What is the daily rhythm of New York, what is the cyclical nature of life in New York?’” said Stathopoulou. “There’s a familiarity but also an abstraction in terms of the details of the city it has the presence and absence of people in New York. It’s meant to be a meditation on daily life in New York City.”The bus shelters are strategically placed in neighborhoods that are important to the artist – from the Bronx to East Harlem, East Williamsburg and Queens. “It’s not meant to represent New York as a whole but it’s Elle’s personal story of New York,” said Stathopoulou. “It’s to portray their experiences of growing up in New York, born in the Bronx and living in Brooklyn – the familiar people, the places they frequent and the experiences that Elle has daily.”The artist, who has previously documented the queer and Latinx communities of New York, told Art21 that their artwork has always been made collaboratively, “because my work has a raw, visceral relationship to emotional authenticity”, said Pérez. “People haven often recommended that I go into documentary, but I could never figure out the ethics of it.”Pérez’s photos look like they’re casually taken but they’re staged. One photo shows a woman and child gardening at school. The woman is Pérez’s sister, who is an outdoor educator in the Bronx, planting raspberries and evergreen shrubs with a student.There’s also a photo of an East Harlem middle school teacher named Brendan, seated wearing a tie. “As an educator at the school, he shaped the curriculum of what students learn, one of the reasons Elle wanted to include him in the series,” said Stathopoulou. “Education is another theme.”Another photo depicts a Dominican street food dish that Pérez has found in their Brooklyn neighborhood. “The people eating the dish in the photo are all close friends,” Stathopoulou said. “Elle wanted to capture this daily activity, this routine moment of sharing a meal among friends. Brooklyn and the Bronx are both important to Elle, personally and photographically.”One of the most poignant images is a portrait of a man with the Puerto Rican flag tattooed on his arm. It says “Mi orgullo”, which reads, in Spanish, “my pride”.“Elle wanted to shoot it in black and white as an opposition against the US government’s oversight of Puerto Rico and the control they have over their economy,” said Stathopoulou. “This is Elle’s way of showing solidarity to support Puerto Rico. It ties into Elle’s experience in now, in present day New York.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb1e06f96d84f5f5b6845c3c54fe3361581051ee/0_0_6570_4380/master/6570.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=4719fd480bc7045b850f8ac88fb32eb2","title":"home post apartheid south africa thabiso sekgala in pictures","story":"Thabiso Sekgala’s solo show features work taken by the late South African photographer offering nuanced, alternative narratives about life in contemporary Africa.

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.Let’s begin with a tribute to Ronald Blythe’s Akenfield by PatLux:I just spoke to my 88 year-old mother who is reading Akenfield, which is reminding her of her own rural childhood and the stories told to her by her parents. I had discovered it in a charity shop in Edinburgh and brought it back to Luxembourg to read and enjoy. I then passed it on to my sister in Spain who devoured it and discussed with me scenes that resonated with her. She then gave it to my mother in northern England and when she has finished it we will donate it to the bookstall in our family’s village church for someone else to discover. I wonder where it will go next and I trust that it will give as much joy to the next reader as it has done to three of us. Many thanks to whoever it was on Tips, Links and Suggestions who inspired me to add this title to the list which I take with me to charity shops.MereMortal has “finally got round to starting” Howard Zinn’s “legendary” The People’s History of the United States:I’ve known about it for a decade or more and have owned it for about three years. He’s the most marvellous and sympathetic writer and he brings out of obscurity a wealth of highly character-driven stories of African slaves, American Indians, indentured white European servants, and women. People he considers were always omitted by the founding fathers when they declaimed “we the people”.I’m loving it. Zinn was that rare thing, an American socialist and a superb academic and this book was a massive hit as a history book and has been widely translated around the world.LLCoolJ is in need of lighter reading after finishing one of this year’s Booker nominations, Lost Children Archive by Valeria Luiselli:Here we have a “No names, please” family of four – Ma, Pa, boy, girl – driving from NYC to Arizona. The parents are documentariansdocumentarists (definitions and distinctions provided) who worked together on a sound-recording project that among other things recorded the over 800 languages spoken in NYC (I had no idea there are that many). Ma is now focused on a project about the “lost children” and detained migrants from Central America, and Pa is working on a project related to the Apaches. The marriage, it is announced early on, is ending, and it is projected that the parents will separate at the end of the trip, each taking one of the children.The first half of the book is narrated by ‘Ma’, and I was pulled in right away by the style of the writing. Much of it is muted, internal, Ma’s ruminations about her children and her marriage and her project ... I didn’t participate in the last two RG books because I didn’t feel I had the strength to take on Levi or Steinbeck. This book turned out to be just as harrowing. I expect it will haunt me for a long time, and I feel the need for something frothy next. So … Nina Stibbe, here I come.GELBuck has “just finished” The Frayed Atlantic Edge by David Gange:His series of kayak journeys down the Atlantic coasts of Scotland, Ireland and bits of Wales and England is the thread linking history, culture, geography and nature. A different perspective on our history and a book that makes me want to retire immediately and spend my time reading and kayaking on a west coast somewhere!Ubik by Phillip K Dick has been keeping Bacon78 guessing:The question of what is reality is explored here with a fun plot that keeps you guessing, and the philosophy never gets in the way of a good story. How do I know what I am experiencing is reality? How do I know that I’m not a simulation in an advanced computer, or that my reality is a product of my own imagination, and I’m actually in a coma somewhere on life support? Well, I don’t and neither do the characters in Ubik!!Richard Flanagan’s The Sound of One Hand Clapping has moved paulburns:A heart-wrenching story of a father-daughter relationship, set against the background of WW@ refugees living and working in Tasmania from 1954 to 1990. There are so many twists and turns in the story, most of them unexpected, that it would be unfair to other readers to give too many details. Suffice to say Flanagan writes with lyricism and passion of his beloved island, with his usual deep and sensitive understanding of the human condition.Finally, a eulogy in honour of Sebastian Barry from JayZed:Crikey, Sebastian Barry‘s a splendid writer, isn’t he? I was blown away a few weeks ago by Days Without End, and I’ve now been moved by The Secret Scripture. If I didn’t rate it quite as highly as Days Without End, that’s mostly because I loved DWE so much.A lot of similarities between the two books, despite the contrasting plots. In both Barry is masterful in creating compelling and distinctive narrative voices and both books are ultimately stories which celebrate love and humanity within a context of brutal cruelty.He can certainly write them.If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

If power cuts can happen when just two power generators drop off, then something fundamental has gone wrong.”National Grid had only 1,000MW in reserve as backup supply when the outages took place. The combined power capacity lost in the twin outages was more than 1,300MW.In addition, the strike may have also triggered outages at a string of “embedded” generators – such as small-scale renewables and diesel farms – totalling an estimated 500MW.These off-grid generators are not visible to National Grid, which can only estimate the amount of electricity they add by noting a fall in demand for on-grid electricity when they run and a rise in demand when they shut off.The energy regulator has responded by launching an investigation into whether National Grid’s statutory requirements, which are set by Ofgem, require it to hold enough reserve electricity supplies to stabilise the grid following outages. revealed National Grid had suffered three blackout “near misses” in as many months after similar-sized outages in May, June and July, which were all greater than 1,000MW.Ofgem will also investigate whether the energy generators and regional energy networks responded correctly to the sudden loss in frequency caused by the power plants’ trips.Jonathan Brearley, a senior executive at Ofgem, said the regulator had received the report and believed there were still areas that needed to be investigated.“This will ensure the industry learns the relevant lessons and clearly establish whether any firm breached their obligations to deliver secure power supplies to consumers,” he said.“The power cuts of Friday 9 August caused interruptions to consumers’ energy and significant disruption to commuters. It’s important that the industry takes all possible steps to prevent this happening again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8381c38496bb83951999baaea421cbb5624d0540/0_371_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=809fdbf91f5b49b952453452e389418e","title":"colin kaepernick open letter jay z silence","story":"Your protest started a conversation and inspired an entire generation of athlete activists to find their voices, but the time for silence is over. We need to hear directly from youMy son Malcolm and I are big fans of yours. I remember the day when Malcolm, who was around 11 at the time, said that he wanted to write a poem about you for my book, We Matter: Athletes And Activism. I told him OK, but he was going to have to take the time and do the proper research. If he put in the work, I’d let him perform it at events on my book tour.And so Malcolm, inspired by your decision to kneel during the national anthem to draw attention to the extrajudicial killings of unarmed black men in America, did just that and wrote a poem entitled Kaepernick, which he’s since recited to crowds at book fairs, poetry venues and colleges across the country – including at my alma mater Syracuse University last year – often proudly wearing his red and white jersey with your name across the back.But last week Malcolm came to me confused. He’d listened as I devoted nearly an hour of my weekly radio show to discussing Jay-Z’s announcement of a business partnership with the NFL to offer advice and strategy for major events like the Super Bowl and to “nurture and strengthen community through football and music”, a marriage that’s felt like at best a mixed message and at worst a betrayal.Malcolm asked me in a serious tone: Should we still be boycotting the NFL?I remember hearing him adamantly defend you to adults who would recite the “football reasons” for your exclusion that you’ve probably heard a thousand times: that if you were an elite-level quarterback … that if you were a better fit for a pro-style offense … that if your completion percentage relative to other NFL starters were just a little bit higher …When it came to you, Malcolm always had the answers. But since last week, he’s only had questions.Why haven’t we heard anything directly from Kaepernick?Why are we only hearing from people close to him, like his girlfriend Nessa or brother-in-arms Eric Reid, but never from him?If he filed a grievance against the NFL’s owners for collusion and they settled out of court, why did he tweet that he was working out and wanted to get back in the league?Why is Jay-Z partnering with the NFL after wearing Kaepernick’s jersey on stage and shaming other rappers for even considering performing at the Super Bowl?Why was the only time we heard Kaepernick say anything outside of his Nike commercial was when he first explained the reasons for his protest more than three years ago?Why doesn’t he say anything?I wish I knew what to tell him.When I spoke on a panel at last year’s AEJMC Conference in Washington, I defended your right to remain silent to a room full of reporters who were criticizing you for not speaking up. I didn’t back down from a pointed exchange with Jerry Brewer of the Washington Post: “What else did you want him to say? He specifically told you the reasons why he was taking a knee: to protest political corruption, systemic racism and police brutality, and y’all allowed the narrative to be switched to being disrespectful to the country and the military.”I accused those reporters of lazy journalism for letting your message be hijacked in the absence of your voice. Let’s just say I didn’t receive a standing ovation for my position.But as I’ve contemplated Malcolm’s questions over the last week, I have to admit my son has a point. Why haven’t we heard directly from you? We know you signed a non-disclosure clause as part of your settlement with the NFL but – and correct me if I’m wrong – that’s only pertains to the specifics of the grievance. It doesn’t mean you can no longer speak publicly about anything.You have an entire generation of people out here who want to back you.You mobilized an army of supporters who caused Nike’s share price not to plummet, as countless Fox News commentators gleefully predicted amid their breathless calls for boycotts, but reach an all-time high shortly after you became the face of a campaign for the 30th anniversary of the sneaker company’s “Just Do It” motto in September.You have people ready to cancel the greatest rapper ever – at least top three – because they question his motivations in partnering with the NFL, regardless of all the positive he’s quietly done in the community, like raising money for the families of Sean Bell and Trayvon Martin, donating funds for activists in Ferguson and Baltimore and lobbying New York governor Andrew Cuomo to appoint a special prosecutor in the Eric Garner murder case. Nobody is unclear about the NFL’s motivation in partnering with Jay-Z. Nobody is under the illusion that the league really cares about social justice. Everyone knows that as long as the owners can keep their players relatively silent – at least to the extent that won’t anger the aging, right-wing, Trump-supporting conservatives that comprise at least half their fan base – and keep their young urban demographic watching, the league could care less about black lives. And the only reason NFL commissioner Roger Goodell is even pretending to care is because of you.By taking a knee, you shouted to the masses that America was at one time the land of the free and the home of the enslaved. A light bulb flashed on for many colorless people who realized that for those whose skin happens to be darker than theirs, the flag is not representative of liberty and justice for all, but rather a symbol of injustice for many and liberty only for a privileged majority. As a result, you created million of allies of all colors and races.And nobody, not even the person who occupies the White House, could silence the reverberating power of your protest. Not even by deliberately contorting and twisting your message. Not even by publicly urging the NFL to fire you. That’s power! What you did thrust you into the upper echelon of athlete activists. Years down the road, they will mention your name alongside Muhammad Ali, John Carlos, Tommie Smith, Bill Russell, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf, Craig Hodges and Dr Harry Edwards.Did your taking a knee end the disproportionate killings of unarmed black men and women at the hands of the police across America? No.Did it create a system in which police are held accountable and we no longer have – to borrow your words – “bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder”? No.Do we now have a country that no longer oppresses black and brown people? No. In fact, we now have a man in the White House who derives his power from white nationalism and white supremacy.But what you did was force people to discuss it and deny them the option of looking the other way.That’s why so many took objection to Jay-Z saying “we’re past kneeling” while seated next to Goodell during last week’s joint announcement at Roc Nation headquarters – even as we patiently waited to see if Daniel Panteleo would face any consequences for choking Eric Garner to death in broad daylight five years ago. As we see gunmen responsible for mass shootings get taken alive while unarmed black men and women are gunned on the suspicion of possessing a weapon. As we watch one police officer after another – from Betty Shelby in Tulsa (Terence Crutcher), to Darren Wilson in Ferguson (Mike Brown), to Blane Salamoni in Baton Rouge (Alton Sterling), to Jeronimo Yanez in Minnesota (Philando Castile) – not being held accountable in any way, shape or form.So many people like Malcolm are ready to support you, but you’ve kept silent. Imagine if Dr King inspired a movement for people to march, to have sit-ins and protests that put their careers and lives on the line for the cause, but never directly addressed them afterward. You’ve had waves of athletes from all backgrounds taking a knee in solidarity ever since you started. Not just professionals like World Cup hero Megan Rapinoe or Olympic fencer Race Imboden (who both specifically cited you as inspiration), but entire high school football and basketball teams. Young people not just blindly following the latest trend, but articulating their reasons for taking a knee and engaging in essential conversations about systemic injustice.People all over America and around the world believe in your cause. They support you. And they need to hear directly from the man who inspired an entire generation of athletes to find their voice and use their platforms and follow in your footsteps.We know we have a long way to go. We are definitely not “past kneeling”. You’ve inspired millions, but now the people are ready for your voice."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4aab86a65b4561dc6d55fe87821f25922dd46290/312_0_2688_1613/master/2688.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5297209f0c1d0ca861e47af4e3f55a0e","title":"summer job blockbuster inner peace boredom","story":"In between teenage japes, a tedious job gave me time to process life-changing events, both happy and sadThis is a long shot, but did you by any chance rent Titanic on VHS around September 1998? Yes? Was it from a branch of Blockbuster somewhere in suburban north Kent? Yes? Amazing! We have so much in common. Because I spent several weeks of that summer folding and packing the display cases for those videotapes, and shoving them in the back of a lorry.Just to walk you through the process, I would start with the flattened display case (Kate and Leo facing upwards), pop it on the cardboard housing, fold-fold, big Sellotape, flip, big Sellotape, shove it in the lorry. It actually wasn’t unlike burying someone at sea. In exchange for this task I was paid more than £4 an hour – a princely sum in pre-minimum wage Britain, especially for a teenager with a chronic CD habit.There were however two major drawbacks. First, the paper cuts. Or should I say, cardboard cuts – the cousin of paper cuts that burned like a bee sting. To this day I can’t look at Kate or Leo’s face without experiencing the dull smart of an old wound.The second, and main, drawback was the boredom. And not just the boredom, but how to deal with it in a way that didn’t land you in trouble. There we were, a bunch of schoolmates earning a bit of summer cash, but just over there were the full-timers, the warehouse alphas who would still be there when we disappeared in September. We couldn’t exactly muck about or moan. It was a matter of respect. Plus, we played football against them at lunchtimes, so it was a matter of fear, too.Still, the tedium was real. While the warehouse alphas yanked levers on heavy machinery and bezzed about on forklifts, all we could do was fold. In hindsight, it was a lesson not just in patience, but resourcefulness. We would find ways to get up to teenage japes, often involving those industrial glue-guns where the glue is near boiling point. We’d invent games on the sly. We had conversations – I know, young men actually talking – for hours on end. Half of it was on the level of “How much to lick a can of Coke off the floor?”, but at least we were talking. I remember having one conversation about how much we would pay to get someone killed, when an ex-convict who had joined us for the week came down the line and gave us an actual quote.So as you can see, we made the best of the situation, which is a serious life skill if ever there was one. But all of the above relied on being paired with, or near, your schoolmates on the production line. If you were shunted down the other end for the week, and you and your fellow folder did not click, then it was just you and the cardboard. This is another level of boredom entirely. We’re talking the existential stuff here. But even then – unexpected benefits. You could do a lot of mental filing on those more isolated shifts. I had quite a lot to get through, too.In the months running up to that summer I’d done my A-levels, passed my driving test, got my first girlfriend and lost a parent. My world was both opening up and shutting down. Having seemingly endless time to process what the hell was happening wasn’t all bad. On some occasions I remember slipping into a kind of zen state. Not so much mindfulness as gormlessness. Whatever you call it, I’d come out of those shifts more calm than when I went in. To this day I put a great value on finding time to do absolutely nothing. I didn’t know it at the time, but I think we can call my first paid role a job that left its mark in more ways than one.• Paul Fleckney is a  subeditor and writer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c019c73ff01288932578ba9a6a7cd7f4c895daf0/188_225_4896_2937/master/4896.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b6758db9ef3af1a08d5a5dab31659f7a","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of appetite","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘appetite’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘appetite’.Share your photos of what appetite means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 21 August at 10am.

But these are young people wanting to make their way out into the world and you feel really pivotal to their next move. If they don’t get the results they want, it just breaks your heart and you can’t help but feel quite personally accountable.I never sleep the night before the results. As teachers, we’re judged on our performance, so part of my anxiety is my own sense of professional accountability, questioning whether I’ve delivered what my headteacher expects me to. But, most of all, there’s this feeling of so desperately wanting my students, who I’ve prepped and taught and supported for two years, to just nail it.My happiest memory is of a dyslexic young man who did just that. When he found out his result, he picked me up in his arms and twirled me around in front of everyone, saying: “Oh my God, I couldn’t have done it without you, Miss.”It’s such a nerve-racking and anxiety-inducing day. One minute, I’ll be shrieking and jumping up and down with celebrating students. The next, I’ll be in a quiet corner, comforting a devastated child who feels like nothing will be OK ever again.I am always rooting for the students who have a difficult home life or don’t find academic work easy. When they do well, it’s exhilarating. You know you’ve helped to shape that young person’s life. That’s why most of us go into teaching. It’s the best moment of your career.I’ll sleep badly for weeks before results day, especially if I know Ofsted will visit us within the next academic year and our results will be heavily scrutinised. In the past, it has made me quite ill. I’ll sit up thinking about different scenarios, wondering how my results will be treated publicly and the impact they will have on the school in general. Also, I still teach maths and the inidual results of that class are really important to my sense of self-worth, both as a teacher and as a head. If I’m telling other people what to do, I want them to know I can do it too.Once I get the actual results, my concerns become much more about the children again – which is obviously what I should have been thinking about all the time. I get angry with myself for worrying about anything else.Every year there will be certain kids you really want to see get their results. Usually it’s the ones who have battled against the odds. Out of the corner of your eye, you watch them get their brown envelope. You try not to stare but you look for their reaction.There are times kids work flat-out and still don’t get what they need. They’re the heartbreakers.One boy I taught a few years ago needed to pass maths to do electrical engineering at college. His predictions meant it would be an outside chance, but he and I both did all we could. In the end, he was a few marks off a C grade. He was devastated. He cried, and I cried. I told him to come up to my office. I wrote him a letter for his college, saying how hard he’d worked and that his maths was good enough for the course, and to please put him on it. I even phoned the principal and said: “He was so close, can you give him a go?” And she agreed. We sent off his exam for remarking but they let him start anyway.At the end of results day, I might crack open a cold beer. I’m still thinking about the children, wondering: what can I do to help them? There’s always a bit of leftover anxiety, hoping that the results they’ve got are what they need to take their next step in life. Then eventually I’ll disappear off home to fall asleep on the sofa.I privately broke down with happiness one year when I saw one of my students had got the results he needed to study marine biology. In our first lesson together, four years previously, he had told me it was his dream. I was excited to see him so happy on results day. He came to see me afterwards to thank me for helping him on his journey. I found that whole experience so validating.On results day, I see the transformative effect my school and the teachers can have on kids from disadvantaged backgrounds, and that really motivates me. One young man from a deprived area had spent most of his GCSE years in a pupil referral unit. He came to our school and absolutely thrived. He left with two A*s and an A and went on to a top university. When children do well, it makes you feel proud. I can’t wait to see the faces of those children and speak to their parents.The night before – I never sleep. I ruminate on the difficult decisions I’ve made throughout the year. As a senior leader, I invest a lot of my time making sure these children get good results. I have lots of difficult conversations with parents, children and teachers about why people are not progressing. It’s really important to me that, if I’m doing all the correct things, it’s reflected in the results.It’s rewarding to see the sheer joy and disbelief on children’s faces on results day. The hardest thing for me is when phenomenal students are a few marks off the top grades they need to get into a prestigious university. Some universities will keep them hanging for a few days and then refuse to let them in, which I think is really cruel. Those are the saddest cases for me. These students may be awarded a higher grade if they choose to get their paper remarked, but by then the university place they wanted may have gone. That feels really unfair. But there’s nothing I can say. The decision is totally out of my hands.On one memorable results day, I was pregnant. I had promised to email two boys their results – this was in the days everything was sent by post – and I went into labour prematurely at 6am. So I got my phone out on the way to the hospital and messaged the boys their results. My husband was like: what are you doing? But I was determined to let those kids know how well they had done. My daughter was born an hour later.• Interviews by Donna Ferguson"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/064b7b6aa2d279b557f9765810e756051c5a458c/0_1431_3984_2388/master/3984.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=96aa215027037b27e1a960e68597f142","title":"i dont blame any teacher for not coming out as gay","story":"I’d been a teacher for over 10 years before I felt comfortable enough to just be myself. I had settled into a rhythm. I wanted to be a great maths teacher – why did I have to face the burden of being a role model for LGBTQ students too?Some colleagues knew about my sexuality. If someone asked about my “husband”, I’d casually tell them the situation. And it was working OK. Then one day the stakes suddenly got bigger.I had an interview for an assistant headship in a comprehensive in a semi-rural area. I was the only candidate invited back for a second interview. My potential future boss spoke warmly about the ethos of the school and the importance of his Catholic faith. As a member of the senior team, I’d be working closely with this man. I suddenly thought: if he turns out to be a homophobe, this will be a problem. It seemed an important moment – for my future, and for his.That day, we’d moved house. I’d had to wiggle out of my jeans and into my interview dress in the car a couple of roads away from the school. I was a little flustered as well as having the usual interview nerves. I mentioned that I’d come straight from collecting the keys.“Oh, why the move?” he asked.“We need a bigger house now we have twins,” I said.He looked at me. I clearly didn’t look like somebody who had given birth to twins a month ago.“My partner had them – she’s at home with them now,” I said.And there, I had come out in my interview.There was a brief silence. “Oh, yes we have another teacher like you – she and her partner are going through IVF right now,” he said. And that was it.I know a handful of teachers and school leaders who are not out as LGBTQ at work in any way. The majority of the teachers I’ve known who were LGBTQ were out to staff but not to students. I can’t blame anybody in either group. For some it’s because they are not yet fully out in their personal lives. Others are from visible minority groups and don’t want to add something else that they feel will count against them in interviews or for promotions.Their fears are justified. Stonewall reports that LGBTQ staff across all workplaces who are BAME are more likely to lose their jobs than white LGBTQ colleagues. And for teachers who are single or currently in a heterosexual-looking relationship, being honest about their sexuality can feel like too much of a statement. Bisexual people are less likely than gay men or lesbians to be out.One school leader described her inner conflict to me: “I look at others, the confidence they have, the sense of complete ease and comfort, and I want to be involved. Then, days like today when I’m feeling overwhelmed and I’m not OK with it all, I certainly can’t be the ‘role model’. Where does that come from? Self-preservation? Protection? Shame?”In my lifetime, I’ve seen the advent of civil partnerships and same-sex marriages IVF rules have changed. In the wider commonwealth, homosexuality has been decriminalised – in India and Trinidad. But in England in 2019 there is transphobic hate crime and we’ve seen lesbian couples being assaulted on public transport in our capital city. Hundreds of parents have withdrawn their children from schools in Birmingham and protested because they didn’t want them to be taught about equality for LGBTQ people.In such a climate, I would not pass judgment on any teacher or school leader who decides not to come out. Sometimes they simply feel unsafe. How do people know they will be supported – by colleagues, by school leaders, by the government?In my own case, I had lingering memories of hearing that homosexuality was wrong and recurring thoughts of hell and damnation after a childhood of church on Sundays. And having been educated in the 80s and 90s, with the impact of section 28, which barred “promoting” homosexuality, added to my internalised homophobia. People my age, and especially those who are now teachers, are still living with the fallout from this.My journey to being open was a long one. Before I became a teacher I was a fleet engineer for a train operating company. None of my colleagues then knew about my sexuality. This was an almost entirely male environment. I split my time between the office and the train depot where pictures of page 3 pin-ups were standard. I didn’t fancy being the subject of banter.Deciding engineering wasn’t for me, in 2004 I enrolled in Teach First, the teacher training organisation. By now, fed up of being vague about my life outside work, I decided I would be out to my colleagues. It helped that I liked everyone and felt generally supported.In my early teaching jobs, my policy was to be out to other staff but not to students. This felt safe for me. I was teaching in a faith school. My colleagues were respectful, but I had nagging doubts: would the school leadership support me in the face of any comments from parents or students? I didn’t want it tested.As I became more comfortable with my sexuality in my private life – my family were mostly on my side – the same became true at work. It was easier when I went to work in a school where there were other openly gay teachers. One, a close friend, was also out to pupils and things were fine.Eventually, once I was an assistant headteacher, I came out to a Year 9 class I knew well, correcting them when they assumed I had a “husband”. They hadn’t expected me to be gay and asked a bit about if I’d always known, but the lesson carried on as normal. I thought it would be all around the school by the end of the day. But it wasn’t. I had taught for over 10 years by then. I’d been on a journey – through different schools and on a personal journey of my own acceptance.Being out has been hard at times. I’ve suffered homophobic abuse in public for nothing more than sitting next to my partner on a train or walking our dogs together. Being out is not an event, it’s an ongoing process. It’s daunting but it gets easier. For me, the journey has been worth it for my own mental health and wellbeing. But I don’t blame anyone for taking their time.The real onus should be on schools to create an environment that makes staff and students feel safe enough to be honest about their sexuality. I felt able to come out at my interview because the school had a Stonewall schools champion logo on its website. These gestures may seem small but LGBTQ people notice them and they matter.• Safety and health first. Look after yourself and don’t feel guilty if you aren’t ready to be a role model for others.• Find teachers in your school or wider network who you can be yourself with.• Coming out is a series of steps – don’t worry if you can’t take them all at once.• Get the support of your headteacher or, if you are a head, chair of governors before coming out to pupils.• If you don’t feel supported or valued as a teacher who is also LGBTQ, move to another school – check out their websites to get a feel for how they are with gender issues.• Coming out doesn’t have to be a big announcement in assembly or class.

Not that my dad, a keen amateur wine lover, ever put it that way. As far as we knew, we were just going camping in various parts of France, Italy or Germany. It was only years later, as I caught the wine bug myself, that I realised how many of the campsites my parents picked – from Burgundy to the Rheingau – just happened to be in some of Europe’s most famous wine places.Luckily for my incurious teenage self, wine tourism in Europe in the 1980s didn’t amount to much. For many producers, especially in France, members of the public were about as welcome as a tax inspector. I remember a trip to somewhere in, I think, the Loire where we saw a wobbly VHS film of vines in sunlight with a grandiose voiceover going on incomprehensibly about “nature’s handmaidens and Bacchus and patrimony”. But that was pretty much it. My dad was mostly just happy to be near some famous vineyards, drinking the absurdly cheap wines in almost-always-beautiful situ.That would still be my favoured style of wine holiday: one of afternoons spent lazing around in a pool among the vines in, say, Portugal’s Douro valley, still for me the most beautiful wine country in the world. And of evenings getting to understand, in detail, how the local wines combine with the local food (autumnal Piedmont or Tuscany would win on this score).Wine tourism is no longer the ramshackle affair it was. All over the world, wine companies have realised there’s money to be made and, equally importantly, valuable PR to be communicated to attract visitors in increasingly slick and varied ways.Just how far along the path from farm to tourist attraction some wineries have come can be seen in the inaugural list, announced earlier this month, of the world’s 50 best vineyards. A spin-off of the 50 best restaurants jamboree, it attempts to identify the best wine-tourism destinations. It’s a list that leans towards the spectacular larger producer: a combination of starchitect-designed cellar and fine-dining restaurant is the formula taken by most of the winners, including the number one, Zuccardi, at the foot of the Andes in the Uco valley in Argentina.These places can be fun to visit, in a Grand Designsadult theme park kind of way. But they’re not enough to sustain a wine holiday itinerary on their own. To really get under the skin of a wine region you need a cluster of small, welcoming producers offering free tastings, a range of accommodation, restaurants, bars and other (non-vinous) cultural attractions, and good, easily available local information and maps.The best places for this that I’ve come across are California (preferably in a Saab convertible, Sideways-style) Alsace (France’s best-developed wine route is perfect for cyclists) or the Alpine-vine gorgeousness of Switzerland’s Valais (the one for walkers). In their different ways, they are all easy pleasures to tour, no matter how serious your interest in wine, even if you have truculent kids in tow.Zuccardi Serie A Bonarda, Mendoza Argentina 2017 (from £13.99, cambridgewine henningswine oxfordwine)The recently named world’s best vineyard has a stunning, site-sensitive piece of architecture at its heart, some 1,100 metres above sea level in the Uco valley.

Not only is it directed by Fallout creators Tim Cain and Leonard Boyarsky, it shares a lot of DNA with Obsidian’s Fallout: New Vegas – a spin-off with a reputation as the best in the series. New Vegas earned particular praise for its dialogue, and a world-building background that makes it feel like more than a thin justification for firing mini-nukes at super-mutants.New Vegas was Obsidian’s first and last game set in the Fallout universe, but The Outer Worlds places similar importance on freedom of choice in dialogue and gameplay. In this world, where mega corporations are starting to take over alien planets, you can act like a hero, an opportunistic mercenary, or a total idiot. The writing is sharp, snappy and funny, the world exciting and vibrant, and there’s a classic New Vegas interplay between factions of characters, any of whom the player can help or hinder.The genre of choice-based, do-what-you-like narrative game that The Outer Worlds inhabits – sometimes called “immersive sims” – is one I love. But it has ossified so much that a 2019 game can build on the legacy of one from 2010 without needing to change much.This year’s E3 games expo was a stark reminder of how formulaic games in this mould have become. Showing off The Outer Worlds for the first time, Obsidian had the player arriving on a new planet and heading off obediently to infiltrate a facility on the ask of a quest-giver. Depending on whether the player’s character is created for intelligence, stealth, strength or whatever else, they can go in guns blazing sneak around without being noticed or use a combination of charm, intimidation, persuasion and hacking to waltz in as if they own the place. But on meeting the head of the facility, there’s a twist: they offer to double your fee if you go back and kill the person who sent you.When I went to see the near-future action-RPG Cyberpunk 2077, Polish developer CD Projekt showed the player arriving in a new part of the game world, heading off to meet a quest-giver and being told to infiltrate a facility. You can take three broad approaches, we’re told: go in guns blazing sneak around or chat your way inside. But once again, on meeting the head of the facility, they offer to double the fee if you go back and kill the person who sent you there in the first place.In tone and style, Cyberpunk 2077 and The Outer Worlds are different: one is a gritty, violent, urban affair, the other colourful sci-fi. But the fundamental skeleton the games are built on is so constricting that, given an hour to show off everything they could be, both developers independently converged on a near-identical script.Genre conventions like this have their advantages. Film has embraced the three-act structure for years pop songs have settled on a rhythm of verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-chorus. They provide creators with structure and familiarity on top of which innovation can occur without fear of alienating audiences.But every now and again, a game comes along which shows that innovation can happen without putting people off and revives a genre in the process. The Ubisoft model was once to open-world games what the Fallout model is to first-person RPGs. The blueprint: climb towers to unlock new areas, sprinkle a map with icons representing mini goals to reach, make progress at your leisure. It underpinned Ubisoft’s Assassins Creed, Far Cry and Watch Dogs series, Warner Bros’ Batman and Middle Earth franchises, and many others.Then came The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, in 2017. It’s got the towers, the open-world, and the plethora of smaller activities to distract you from the main noble quest. But it quietly revolutionised that stale old structure. Nothing in Breath of the Wild is gated. If you wanted (and you were extremely skilled) you could simply walk to the final boss and finish the game, though you would be far more likely to be lasered to death by  robots on the way up to the castle. The icon-filled map is almost entirely gone: only fast-travel points and the occasional quest-line show up. The rest is there for you to discover with your eyes and ears, rather than following objective markers like an orienteering enthusiast.I’m looking forward to The Outer Worlds and Cyberpunk 2077. But their genre needs its Breath of the Wild moment: an outsider to toss out the conventions, and build something beautiful from what is left. Surely choosing between shooting, stealthing or sweet talking can’t be the only options that the next generation of virtual worlds have to offer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8ff2612b0ff08fc57bc6141da81e2c192249aaa/0_306_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9fac2efa93114c7c56508c26ee8b8c72","title":"spectrum colour yoga and meditation like being stuck inside a traffic light","story":"The effect of being immersed in deep colours is striking, but I am not sure it is the best way to relax, especially when the lights stop working properly‘I am not good at yoga” is the main thought I have in any yoga class. I am definitely thinking it today. My warrior II would have been discharged from military service. My eagle pose looks like a cheese plait. It is not even clear I can lie on the floor properly. Sweating, shaking, constantly on the verge of toppling over, at least here I can partially blame the fact that the room keeps changing hue.That is because I am trying a 90-minute Spectrum yoga and meditation session, conducted in a special colour-shifting studio in Whitechapel, east London (available via a MoveGB membership, £19.99 a week). On the wall at the front of the class are panels of large bulbs, emitting bright light. It is very Sunday Night at the London Palladium. I feel as if I am dying, but at least I am in good company.This variety of yoga was created by Mandy Jhamat, my tutor today, who developed the concept with Pierre Van Obberghen, a “colour expert”. The class is based on vinyasa flow, incorporating salutations, standing poses and balances – or, in my case, a blancmange of all three.We start with the room full of white light (which contains all the colours of the spectrum) before moving into aquarium turquoise, buttery yellow and breakdown-at-the-nuclear-plant red.The flicker-free, deep-colour immersion is striking: it is as if I am in a music video or a Tate Modern installation. It is pretty cool – or would be if I could remove my knees from my ears. I am not sure the colours are aiding me, but I am too all over the place to be sensitive to it.The connection between colour and energy is plausible, though. Colour has a biochemical, psychological, emotional effect on us. Think about food, or art, or the eyes of your beloved. The inside of McDonald’s isn’t bright red and yellow because it was designed by a clown it is because those colours make us feel hungry and eat quickly, encouraging a high turnaround. (Actually, the seating these days is soft green and lower-lit. Nudging our minds to believe they are in Starbucks, perhaps? Why are you so stupid, mind?)After the yoga, there is a 25-minute guided meditation, in which we lie on the floor. This will, I think, be a better way for me to experience the vibrational potentialities of colour and focus on Jhamat’s concept. We are offered the option of a blanket or a weighted eye mask, the latter of which surely defeats the point of bathing yourself in a colour field. Jhamat leads us through a guided meditation exploring our chakras, each of which – according to tantra – has a corresponding colour. We start bathed in red, the root chakra, before the bulbs soften into the orange of the sacral chakra and lighten into the yellow of the solar plexus chakra, the best chakra. “Team Plexus for the win!” I chuckle inside my head, because I have difficulty controlling my stupid thoughts.Meanwhile, Jhamat is having trouble controlling the lights. They are meant to move through the spectrum, but are stuck on the green of the heart chakra. She is talking about the blue of the throat, the purple of the crown, but it doesn’t match the mossy light filling the room. It is like being inside a faulty traffic light. Imagine if all traffic lights were stuck on green, I think, struggling to focus on “the indigo of my third eye”. That would be the same as having no traffic lights. I see cars piling up on one another twisted metal. This is not the class’s intended effect.I peek to see Jhamat fiddling with the control box, then turning one of the light panels off and on, then giving up. I feel for her. She continues to talk to the class in a measured way, as if nothing is wrong. Behind me, someone is snoring. It has been an excellent yoga class, followed by a strange meditation experience with some gorgeous nu-rave colours. But I am not sure how much can be said for Spectrum, at least when the equipment isn’t working properly. I am not convinced. Perhaps someone greenlit this too soon.Studies have indicated that if we got rid of traffic lights, there would be fewer accidents.Yellow? Is it me you’re looking for?

For instance, even if a graduate paid off their loan in November, automatic payments could continue to be deducted from their salary for the rest of the tax year.The biggest annual amount not refunded was from 2015-16, with £6.3m of overpayments not yet paid back. From 2016-17, £5.9m of overpayments were still outstanding, the BBC reported.A government spokesman said steps had been taken to help avoid overpayments in the future. “This included changing the law in April to allow weekly data sharing between HMRC and the Student Loans Company, which will help to prevent graduates repaying too much,” he said. “If a borrower believes there has been an over-repayment, they should contact the SLC to seek a refund.”Last year, the SLC was accused of spying on vulnerable students’ social media accounts during an anti-fraud campaign which caused some people to lose funding and drop out of university despite having done nothing wrong."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99c47a423bfe1385096770f4b114b4549d98920a/0_37_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=932d48132ebf875cbd343fa5aa0001a1","title":"all female music festival lineups native loud women fest boudica hearher","story":"Major music festivals such as Reading and Leeds continue to feature mostly male artists, but a number of events are fighting back by removing men from the billing altogetherIn 2015, music blog Crack in the Road tweeted a doctored image of the poster for the Reading and Leeds festival, erasing all acts that didn’t include a female performer. Only 10 groups remained. It started a conversation about gender inequality at music festivals – an issue that, despite the outcry, persists in 2019. This weekend’s edition of Reading and Leeds features only one female performer, Billie Eilish, among the festival’s 11 top-billed acts. Scotland’s TRNSMT and metal festival Download each had only one act featuring women across their nine lead acts, while there are no female headliners at indie festivals Green Man and End of the Road.At this year’s Glastonbury, despite the presence of Janet Jackson, Kylie, Lauryn Hill and Miley Cyrus lower down the bill, the Pyramid stage headliners were all male. “The pool isn’t big enough,” said organiser Emily Eavis. “It’s time to nurture female talent. Everyone wants it, everyone’s hungry for women, but they’re just not there.”This year, a number of festival organisers are attempting to redress the issue by having only women on stage. Those with all-female lineups include Native festival in Kent, Loud Women Fest in north London, and Boudica festival in Coventry. KT Tunstall has launched a festival called HearHer, which will feature a programme comprising female solo artists or women-fronted bands and women will run the behind-the-scenes production. On the west coast of the US, there’s California Women’s Music and Women Sound Off meanwhile, Brandi Carlile, the Americana star who won three Grammys this year, will bring back her Girls Just Wanna Weekend to Mexico in January 2020.Angela Martin – co-founder of Cro Cro Land, a female-organised festival in south London where the lineup and crew have a 5050 gender balance – puts the boom in such festivals down to “unrest among women in music”. This, she says, leads to an increase in female promoters creating their own events.She cites the PRS Foundation’s Keychange initiative as a catalyst in raising awareness about gender inequality at festivals. The campaign encourages festivals to have a 5050 gender split among performers by 2022. More than 150 events worldwide have pledged to hit this target, including the Proms, Bluedot and Standon Calling.The mastermind behind Keychange, Vanessa Reed, said the rise in all-female lineups this year was a necessary phase to help redress the balance. “People are feeling frustrated by festival lineups being male-dominated. Until Keychange there was no big debate about this or positive action. Some places, as an act of defiance, are saying: we are going to book loads of female talent in our city.”Others put the rise down to politics, including the #MeToo movement that took off in the wake of sexual assault and rape allegations made against the Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein. Reed mentions Statement festival in Sweden, which had an all-female lineup and an all-female audience, too. (It was later successfully sued for discrimination.) “That was set up for a different reason, specifically in response to incidents of sexual harassment – they wanted to make a statement.”Victoria Boyington founded California Women’s Music festival in 2014 because promoters were not booking enough women. In the last year, she says there has been an “insurgence of feminism and the feminist movement”. She believes the trend may have peaked, and that it is a sign of change when bigger corporations jump on the bandwagon. She points to US radio conglomerate iHeartRadio and its all-female Women Who Rock concert for International Women’s Day, which featured artists including St Vincent and Karen O. “The future won’t necessarily be all-female lineups, but more inclusive festival lineups for major festivals.”However, Boyington says some bookers lack integrity, booking women simply as a marketing ploy. “I am not sure they have the same focus as our organisation, which is more grassroots and founded by women for women.”Reed says the next step is to establish gender equality more deeply through the festival industry. “There are still so many male promoters and bookers and established networks that have traditionally booked more men than women. All those things mean it’s harder to instigate change. But I have been inspired by the fact that lots of younger men in the music industry are as keen as women are for programmes to be more balanced. So I hope to some degree it’s about generational change.”Change is certainly happening – Barcelona’s Primavera festival, one of the biggest music festivals in Europe, offered a 5050 gender split in its 2019 lineup. “With loads of great music made by women, the paradigm of what we understood as ‘headliners’ until now is changing,” organiser Marta Pallarès wrote in Loud and Quiet magazine. “Music shouldn’t be the ‘pale, male and stale’ playground any more.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e39d4d8d46b8e15c29411da9981b47f4b30d2217/69_117_3381_2028/master/3381.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e9571686bb46745cecaaa4ee2872bcfc","title":"the monster to slay before domestic policies is brexit readers on corbyns speech","story":"You have been reacting in the comments to Jeremy Corbyn’s speech on Labour’s vision to rebuild BritainYes Jeremy, I agree. You are absolutely right. The problems of the UK run far deeper than Brexit. The thing is, the country did vote for Brexit. Millions of people who will suffer the consequences of Brexit voted for it. People whose prospects are so poor that they voted for Brexit on the assumption that things can’t get any worse. But he also has to acknowledge the fact that we cannot go on to do that with the threat of Brexit hanging above our heads. It will make everything so much worse, and take away our ability to address the issues that are causing so much misery and poverty. Brexit will not lead to any short term or mid term increase in job or wealth creation. It will have the opposite effect for most ordinary people. Corbyn’s priority must be to stop any possibility of a no-deal Brexit – then to stop any form of Brexit. Even a soft Brexit with a deal will leave us worse off. He must be prepared to stand aside to allow someone else who can command a majority to become caretaker PM. It will only be a temporary position until Brexit is resolved and a general election is called. Then he can come back as Labour leader and fight that election. pocclondonAs a Labour member, its excruciating (and embarrassing) to watch Corbyn flail about like this. I’m entirely on board with our domestic policy program under Corbyn but he is never ever going to win a general election. His main appeal was the honesty and consistency which marked him out as different. Now he doesn’t even have that after pretending to campaign for Remain (i.e. disappearing) when everyone knows he loathes the EU. We’re heading for a no deal Brexit and it will be Labour’s fault. Mark ForresterSadly Corbyn is still pushing for a GE as the solution rather than a people’s vote. It looks as if he is walking straight into Johnson’s trap as the latter will be able to set the election date in his own favour. Brexit for the Tories will be more than enough to wipe out Labour. It’ll happen before the country has woken to the chaos of Brexit. Corbyn should never give Johnson what he wants – a GE, before it’s obvious to the country that his Government is sunk in Brexit chaos and exuding incompetence from every pore. FogintheChannelGreat rhetoric Corbyn. But surely the monster to tackle right now, right here, is Brexit. That is the monster to slay before domestic policies. Brexit has to be lanced first. Or can you tell us how your Brexit is going to benefit anyone? solitarybeehiveSo it seems few people understand what this position means. Labour being neutral means it will not force one position or another on their MPs who will be free to campaign and vote as they see fit. Despite what most people here seem to think, the country is still split and the only way forward is to have an open and honest conversation about it. Labour is a broad church, its voters are split over this and acting like that isn’t the case is not helpful. Taking a neutral stance allows the party to debate this on its own merits (or none) and then for everyone to vote with their own conscience. It is the only party that can and has tried to actually unite the country. KingInTheNorthPissing into the wind on Brexit again Jezza. I voted for you. I support fully the economic and social approach you and McDonnell have taken. But you have to fight the enemy in front of you. And that enemy is Brexit. You missed the point and consigned us to right wing extremist hell. Thanks. SequinnerSound strategy to remain neutral at the next referendum. The great thing is that Labour doesn’t need to come off the fence to win at the next GE and gain the remain vote. All Labour needs to do is offer a second referendum in its general election manifesto with the option to remain included in it. Anyone slightly remain inclined who is thinking rationally and wants to stop Brexit, would still vote for Labour if they offered a second referendum in it’s GE manifesto, regardless of whether Labour comes out fully in support of Remain as a party.Given all the above, and given the serious damage of a split in the Labour vote by backing remain unequivocally, it’s very hard to see how Labour will suffer from continuing on with constructive ambiguity while throwing its weight behind a second referendum vacuousCorbyn is right to note that the problems faced by the UK run much deeper than Brexit which is, after all, a symptom of those problems. Having said that, any form of Brexit that removes citizenship and rights from millions of people without their consent will compound the problems we face, not cure any of them. DJT1MillionCorbyn and the Labour leadership just don’t seem to understand that until Brexit is resolved one way or another, everything else is on the back burner. They can’t simply sit this out and hope it goes away – rightly or wrongly, it’s currently the number one issue and it needs decisive leadership to get past it. Adrianh2017Corbyn is correct - not spectacular, not catchy, not quotable, just correct. The general public are being excluded from the wealth flowing to a small fraction of the population. A step change is needed to address this. So much is wrong and so much has been deliberately broken over the last 40 years that there is no guarantee a new direction exists that will lead to prosperity for all. But unless you try nothing will change. WallyGnatSpot on Jez. Britain’s problems do lie far deeper than Brexit. The disconnected mentality of people who rail against Corbyn while not comprehending why Brexit happened is incredible. They’ll vote against Labour because red Ed ate his sandwich in a funny way and because they can’t trust the government with more taxes and then blink dumbfoundedly with an uncomprehending gaze when things continue to get worse and fall apart around them. vacuousGot to be honest, not a massive Corbyn fan, but he’s right on this one. It’s not about remain vs leave, we need to reunite the country and end the austerity that got us here in the first place. saxonwhittle"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d19df985060b01b2aa77af69e64d0686de3432ab/0_52_5166_3100/master/5166.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c4c61a12dddafe4eb697a446fdf0307b","title":"helping nine year old eating disorder recovery podcast","story":"We hear about the importance of early intervention in rare cases of pre-teen eating disorders.

Marnus Labuschagne came into the XI and, while he too was struck on the grille by Archer second ball, a resolute 59 from the right-hander helped deny England victory on the final afternoon.Smith, whose twin centuries at Edgbaston the week before had helped set up a 1-0 lead for the tourists, admitted on Sunday that he would need to have cleared all tests and be training two days out from the third Test to stand any chance of being selected.But on Tuesday he was a bystander at practice before Justin Langer, the head coach, confirmed he would not be ready in time.Meanwhile Britain’s sports minister, Nigel Adams, has condemned England cricket fans who have been booing Smith, calling their behaviour “distasteful” and saying it is time for the jeering to stop.Smith and his teammates David Warner and Cameron Bancroft have been roundly heckled during the current Ashes series for their involvement in the ball-tampering scandal in South Africa last year, for which Smith and Warner received 12-month bans and Bancroft a nine-month suspension.Adams on Monday joined a chorus of condemnation aimed in particular at England fans who booed Smith when he returned to the crease to resume batting at Lord’s on Saturday.“The vast majority of the Lord’s crowd were on their feet applauding Steve Smith after his innings but a small amount of booing from a tiny element of the crowd has made the news,” Adams told the Sydney Morning Herald.“It’s distasteful and we have to remember that the Aussie players who got themselves into trouble have been punished and done the time. “Smith, in particular, is a brilliant batsman and whilst of course, I don’t want him getting too many runs while he’s over here, he’s mesmerising to watch and as genuine sports fans we should be applauding him, not jeering.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f9b11b35d34b5b7566bb1727f459cd2c330c4d3/0_323_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=84f34721e85dccdb98dbd830c172f71f","title":"talking horses how remorex won the palio di siena without his jockey","story":"Remorex, a descendant of British racehorses, prevailed in the Palio di Siena on Friday, even though his rider fell off at halfwayFor reasons of equine welfare, I imagine that many of you will share my reservations about the Palio di Siena, the medieval race which is still held twice a year around that city’s main square. But I bring Friday’s race to your attention because of one extraordinary aspect, that it was won by a loose horse.Remorex is the horse in question, ridden for the first half of the race by Giovanni Atzeni, a cousin to Andrea, who we know well. Alas, they parted when ambitiously trying to take the edge off one of the corners. In fairness to Atzeni, no saddles are used in the Palio. Frankly, it’s a miracle that some of the jockeys stay aboard throughout.Anyway, bonny Remorex, with his white stripe down his face, galloped on undeterred, fighting his way among three horses that still had their jockeys and hitting the front on the line. It was enough to confuse at least one TV commentator, who initially called the (mounted) runner-up as the winner.The amazing thing about Remorex is that he has now won the Palio twice from three attempts, finishing riderless both times. I gather that he is not a thoroughbred but he was sired by a not-very-exalted horse who ran in Britain years ago, Dankeston. Trained by Michael Bell, Dankeston’s big win came in a conditions race at Redcar, though he was also fourth in the Prince of Wales’s Stakes of 1996.Dankeston was a son of Elmaamul, one of my favourite horses from my early days of following racing, and Remorex even looks a bit like him. I feel oddly proud on behalf of the old horse that one of his grandkids has shown such bravery.The Palio might be the only race in the world where a riderless horse is still allowed to keep the win if he passes the post first. I’m pretty sure I’d have been richer if we had such a rule in British jump racing. On the other hand, Red Rum would only have been third in the 1977 Grand National and few of us would want to rewrite that particular piece of form.To Brighton, where hopefully Georgia Dobie will remain firmly atop Tin Hat (2.40) in the sprint handicap for which they are being underestimated at 6-1. Trained by Eve Johnson Houghton, Tin Hat has responded well to the fitting of cheekpieces and made it two out of two at this track 11 days ago.The winning margin was only a neck but they were nicely clear of a veteran course specialist in third and Tin Hat is still 12lb below the mark he had at this time last year. I think the chestnut will go well again.There’s also 6-1 about Harlequin Rose (4.40) in the apprentice race at the end of the card. She got her second win at this idiosyncratic track last month, when today’s rider, the promising William Carver, was aboard. Dropped a furlong, she met a lot of trouble in running here a fortnight ago and I’m putting a line through that.Lady Mascara (4.10) should make up into a decent animal and her Sandown third is the best form on offer in a maiden handicap. If you can bear to bet on such a race, the 2-1 looks fair.There’s been an early move for Doctor Look Here (7.05), now 9-4 from 4-1 for a handicap hurdle at Newton Abbot. A Sue and Lucy Gardner production, he dropped 12lb for three runs over too short a trip before winning tidily here last month and can probably do it again.I napped Magical Rhythms at Kempton on the basis of the promise she showed last time but she seems worryingly weak in the market for this novice contest."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d78c9820f7887e5906f7ee020bc9b7c0626b915/357_90_2648_1589/master/2648.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=19e7cb6a536122df55d4bbb302eb51be","title":"when chase is on his computer he feels like any other nine year old","story":"Nikki Hunter-Pike explains how accessibility technology has opened up the online world to her son, who has cerebral palsyIt’s Saturday morning at Nikki Hunter-Pike’s home. While she prepares breakfast, and her husband Daniel plays with their daughters Brooke and Harper, her son Chase is engrossed in sending an email to his beloved stepgrandfather, “Pops”, his face a study in intense concentration.Nine-year-old Chase, who has the neurological condition cerebral palsy, cannot walk, talk, feed himself or pick up a pen. Yet, thanks to technology that’s widely available, he can communicate, learn and explore the online world from his family’s home in Northfleet, Kent.On his computer, “Chase uses the on-screen keyboard (OSK) tool, because he doesn’t have the fine motor skills to type on a keyboard,” says Nikki. Running on Windows 10, “it displays a visual keyboard with all the standard keys. Using a joystick that he can control with just his thumb, once he switches on the OSK, he can do everything from browse the internet to search for videos on YouTube and write emails. We introduced him to it when he was six and it really has been life-changing for him.“Because he can’t speak or type messages on a phone, being able to write emails to his friends and close family is so important to him – it helps him feel connected.“The keyboard also has a text prediction function, which suggests words for him as he types. It makes it quicker for him, and, because he has learning difficulties too, it helps him with his spelling.“When I see him on his computer, and how its technology empowers him, it fills me with confidence that as he grows up he’ll be able to lead a fulfilling, independent life. That is all I’ve ever wanted for him.”Nikki’s hopes for her son are mirrored by Microsoft’s mission to empower every person through building inclusivity into technology, such as the Windows 10 operating system, which supports the OSK and its Office 365 suite.After a normal, healthy pregnancy, Nikki says she was devastated when Chase was born with brain damage, having been deprived of oxygen during her labour.“The hardest part was the uncertainty. No one knew how severe his level of disability would be, and for the first few years of his life it felt like I was living in limbo watching and waiting to see what milestones he would reach, or not,” says Nikki.“He was diagnosed with cerebral palsy when he was nine months old, but it wasn’t until he was around three that the full extent of his disability was clear. He’s never spoken, he can’t stand unaided, and he suffers from almost constant involuntary movements of his limbs. His reading ability is closer to that of a five-year-old. He’s also incredibly loving, with a wonderful sense of humour and a very determined personality.”While Chase uses an electric wheelchair and requires round-the-clock care, Nikki says technology gives him the independence he craves.“He’s well aware his siblings and other children don’t need the same help he does. But when he’s on his computer, he feels like any other nine-year-old, because he’s in control and he doesn’t need any assistance,” says Nikki. “That means so much to him and it’s vital for his self-confidence.“I see how he puffs up with pride when he shows his little sisters, who are five and three, something he’s discovered online – his current obsession is looking at locations around the world on Google Maps. It gives him the chance to be the big brother and take the lead.”A keen gamer too, Chase uses his Microsoft adaptive controller to access his Xbox console.“We all game together as a family. It can be stressful going out because of the challenges Chase can face with poor disability access and toilet facilities. Sometimes it’s just nice to stay at home and have a relaxed afternoon gaming and cuddling up on the sofa.”Summing up how much the technology means to her son, Nikki says: “It’s no exaggeration to say Chase’s computer is his window to the world. I can’t imagine his life without it and I’m thankful he was born at a time when technology like this exists.“It’s so important to him and, thanks to its emphasis on inclusivity, it’s the one part of his life in which he can be completely independent.”Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device, or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops whatever your need.

The main draw is its programme of spoken-word performances, most of which take place in its 100-seat basement theatre. The storytelling doesn’t just happen on stage, though. The ground floor has a large, airy room used for exhibitions, workshops and open-mic events, as well as a monthly story session for tots (Tiny Tales for one- to three-year-olds). Pre-show, my kids had a fun 20-minutes opening lots of wee doors and peering through lots of wee windows that form part of the room’s interactive story wall.Animal names in Scots (one of the three official languages in Scotland) sound as though they were invented just for enlivening stories. My favourites include forty-fittit Janet (centipede), spinnie jenny (daddy-longlegs) and pis(h)-minnie (ant).The live performances. We caught the 4pm showing of The Man Who Planted Trees (on until 26 August). An adaptation of the 1953 allegorical work of French writer Jean Giono, the tale centres on the efforts of a local shepherd to reforest a windswept corner of Provence. Presented as a comediannarrator double act, the hour-long play exemplified performative storytelling at its best: poignant, honest and packed with giggles. Check the events listing for other upcoming kids’ shows. The centre will also host the Scottish International Storytelling Festival (18-31 October)There’s a cafe on the ground floor with a lengthy list of sandwiches, panini, filled croissants and salads. Soups and lunchtime specials (£7.50) change on a daily basis. Get there before 12.30pm and you can try The Storyteller’s Breakfast (£10.50), which adds lorne sausages (they’re square), a tattie scone and a slice of black haggis to a regulation fry-up. A children’s no-haggis version is also available (£8.50).No gift shop! Better than that, the centre boasts an independent bookshop, which specialises in fables, myths and folk stories. Many are classics passed down from generation to generation, although contemporary material also abounds. Kids’ books are plentiful. Contemporary highlights include Lari Don’s Serpents and Werewolves and Janis Mackay’s The Selkie Girl. Also worth a look is Animals, Beasties and Monsters of Scotland by Lea Taylor, which forms part of History Press’s superb compilation of regional Scottish folk stories. For budding linguists, there are Scots’ versions of Harry Potter, as well as Roald Dahl’s The Twits (“Eejits”).The centre is in the middle of Edinburgh’s Old Town, at the eastern end of the Royal Mile. It’s a five-minute walk from Waverley railway station. Driving in the city centre is to be avoided the nearest bus stops are on the High Street and North Bridge. For more information visit Lothian Buses.Reasonable. Entry to the ground-floor space is free, although all the theatre performances are ticketed. Prices for shows vary, with the average around £8 for adults and £6 for children. Café Voices, the centre’s monthly storytelling night, is £5.10am-6pm Monday-Saturday Sunday (July and August only). Last entry: 5.30pm.1010. This joyful, noisy, energy-filled space brims with a love of live storytelling and its power to make us think and imagine.

There’s a tent full of passionate home bakers, and week by week their will to live will be slowly eroded by impossible challenges that ask them to explain the quantum concept of particle-wave duality via the medium of biscuits.The new series of Bake Off begins next week, and it will be identical to every other series of Bake Off, and the only variation will be the influx of new contestants, so let’s rank them in terms of potential from worst to best.There’s a very good chance that Dan is a lovely person. However, between his deep-V shirt, his unguarded beard and his manbun, I am terrified of how much he’s going to shed into his food. Prue Leith is pushing 80, for crying out loud. A clump of hair in a Victoria sponge might finish her off.Although Rosie routinely performs life-saving surgery on sick animals, something about her demeanour here suggests she deals badly with stress. My guess is that she’ll be escorted from the tent after a fortnight for flinging a pan of boiling sugar at Sandi Toksvig’s head.Jamie looks a bit like a young Joaquin Phoenix. But ask yourself this: what would you do if Joaquin Phoenix gave you a cake? That’s right, you’d throw the cake away and set fire to the bin. It only seems sensible to do this with any cake given to you by this man too.No. No. Absolutely not. Let’s just study this picture for a moment. Not only is Michael’s apron absolutely filthy, but he’s also pulling the most terrified facial expression I have ever seen. This man is a complete danger. He has no discipline. He’s going to kill someone.In the press kit that accompanied the images of the new contestants, Phil is asked about his happiest Bake Off experiences. He replies “Being minibussed into the site”. That’s his happiest experience. A minibus. The man is the walking manifestation of the concept of doom.Henry is appearing on the Great British Bake Off because he was a Great British Bake Off superfan as a child. The Great British Bake Off is now creating its own contestants, and this means that Henry is the GBBO equivalent of Big Brother’s Brian Belo, and this means he is not to be trusted.I don’t trust Steph either. In her contestant photo she has made a towering multi-tiered sponge, which seems impressive. But look closer. Those tiers are not tidy at all. She looks like she’s just dustpan-and-brushed a pile of crumbs together. She’s fooling nobody. You’re fooling nobody, Steph.Why are you making so many notes, Helena? WHY ARE YOU MAKING SO MANY NOTES? Are you collecting data on us? Are you going to sell our secrets to the Russians, Helena? Oh, you’re not actually making notes, you’re just painting some icing with a brush that looks like a pen. Still, I’ve got my eye on you.Michelle didn’t have a wedding cake. She’s a Great British Bake Off contestant and yet, on a day when tradition demands cake, she chose to shun cake. Michelle is clearly some sort of arch cake dissident, and my honest belief is that her one true aim is to destroy Bake Off from the inside out. In which case, I can only applaud her.Alice is so beautiful and wholesome that the BBC used a giant photograph of her when it ran a story about the new contestants. This means her progress will inevitably be derailed as bored viewers use social media to concoct a story about how she’s probably having an affair with Paul Hollywood. Same as it ever was.David has a very precise look, which quite frankly Dan could learn a thing or two about. He also invented a type of cake that villages in Malawi could steam over an open fire, which means he is already well-versed in international cake outreach. He is the closest thing to a Terminator this year’s batch of contestants can offer.In her contestant profile, Priya is asked who would be most surprised to learn that she had entered Bake Off. She replies “I have kept in touch with people from work,” which means that she’s left work. Why did she leave work? Because she won Bake Off, that’s why. My logic is watertight, and you may all congratulate me when this series ends."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a66bddd86fa1fab79dd1fcd82428efff998a389/0_133_2046_1228/master/2046.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2182fe14bd8b48eb1efacaf1569eea2f","title":"tv tonight meet the real life mavericks of the rafs flight school","story":"Tom Cruise is returning in a Top Gun sequel next year, but until then, here are the British versions.

Omar called Israel’s decision to block the planned official visit “nothing less than an attempt by an ally of the United States to suppress our ability to do our jobs as elected officials” and questioned the billions of dollars in US aid to the country.“As legislators we have an obligation to see the reality there for ourselves,” Omar told reporters during a press conference at the Minnesota state house in St Paul on Monday. “So I would encourage my colleagues to visit. Meet with the people we were going to meet with, see the things we were going to see, hear the stories we were going to hear.”Omar said Israel’s decision was “not consistent with democracy” and not reflective of actions taken by an ally of the US.Israel is the top recipient of US foreign aid and the country has long enjoyed bipartisan support. But Israel’s decision to bar the congresswomen entry threatens to undermine those ties, especially at a time when Democrats are increasingly critical of Netanyahu and his close alliance with Trump.Tlaib likened the decision to a ban imposed on a member of Congress seeking entry to South Africa during apartheid in 1972.“History does have a habit of repeating itself,” Tlaib said. Omar later added that the difference between then and now was that the US government was promoting the ban as opposed to actively working to lift it.She added: “We must be asking, as Israel’s ally, that Netanyahu stop the expansion of settlements on Palestinian land and ensure full rights for Palestinians if we are to give them aid.”At the urging of Trump, Netanyahu denied entry to Omar and Tlaib, the first two Muslim women elected to Congress, over their support for the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement (BDS) for Palestinian rights.Israel later relented and said the Detroit-born Tlaib could visit her 90-year-old grandmother, who lives in the occupied West Bank, if she did not promote the international boycott of Israel. Tlaib initially agreed but, facing criticism from some Palestinian activists, she changed her mind and announced that she would not travel to the country under “these oppressive conditions meant to humiliate me”.Trump has tried to make Omar, Tlaib and the other half of the foursome known as “the Squad” – all popular progressive congresswomen of color – the face of the Democratic party.In a series of racist tweets, Trump told the lawmakers to “go back” to their home countries. All are US citizens, and only Omar was not born in the US.At the press conference, Tlaib tearfully described her decision not to make the trip after a late-night phone call with her family.“I think my grandmother said it beautifully when she said I’m her asfour. Asfour in Arabic means her bird. She said I’m her dream manifested. I am her free bird. So why would I come back and be caged and bow down when my election rose her head up high?” Tlaib said, her voice cracking. She added: “We all decided as a family that I could not go until I was a free, American, United States congresswoman.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38ee20d3292115e62639a965ce92598656e8314e/0_168_5691_3415/master/5691.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ec76190d18b2a3950ebc3fc0c72c96f","title":"nevada casino workers unions owners","story":"Despite winning six union elections, the opposition continues through legal appeals and stalled contractsIt has been a long struggle. But it is still not over. The billionaire Trump allies who own the casino – and others like it – have embarked on a campaign of stalling recognition, delaying contract negotiations and intimidation and poor working conditions, casino workers say.Since UNITE HERE Culinary Workers Union 226 and Bartenders Union Local 165 began union-organizing drives at Station Casinos in 2011, workers have successfully voted to form a union at six of the company’s properties in Nevada.But, despite winning six union elections, the anti-union opposition from the third largest private employer in the Las Vegas area, Station Casinos, continues through legal appeals, none of which have been successful, and stalled contract negotiations.Station Casinos executives and spokespersons have repeatedly affirmed they would respect union election results. In 2016, Station Casinos president Richard Haskins told the Las Vegas Review: “We have said all along that if a fair and lawful election is held we will abide by the results.”The company is owned by billionaires Frank and Lorenzo Fertitta. The Fertittas have donated $2m to Trump’s America’s First Action PAC, over $1.5m to Trump’s Victory Fund, and more than $3m to the Republican National Committee and other Republican candidates since Trump’s election.Several casino workers have alleged wrongful terminations for engaging in union activity at Station Casino properties, and current workers report that the company continues to fire workers without just cause as Nevada is an employment “at will” state, which grants employers the right to terminate employment at anytime for any reason.“The management hasn’t recognized the union because they do whatever they want to workers and with the union, they won’t be able to do that anymore,” said Paola Felix, a guest room attendant at Green Valley Ranch Resort. “Without a union contract to protect you, you don’t get a chance to defend yourself, they just terminate you for no reason.”When the first Station Casinos property voted to unionize in September 2016, company management sent out memos to all its employees that health benefits would be increased for all employees except those who had unionized. As part of an NLRB settlement in March 2017, Station Casinos agreed to recognize the union at Palace Station Casino and reimburse the workers at Boulder Station for lower healthcare premiums they were denied.“They’ve filed legal challenge after legal challenge,” said Gunaydin Milli, a uniform room attendant at Palms Resort \u0026amp Casino since 2008, where around 900 workers voted to unionize in April 2018. In May 2019, the NLRB ruled the resort was violating federal labor law by refusing to bargain with the union, but a union contract has still yet to be negotiated as Station Casinos is appealing the ruling in federal court.“They’ve refused to negotiate with us and they’re breaking the law. The hard work we do everyday makes the company successful. We deserve to have something to show for it too,” said Milli.Casino workers have held numerous protests and rallies calling on Station Casinos to negotiate with the unions and to cease union busting at properties where union organizing drives are ongoing.“The company has been fighting these workers for a long time,” said Geoconda Argüello-Kline, secretary-treasurer for the Culinary Workers Union, Local 226. “What the company has been doing is sending a message to workers they do not respect the democratic way these workers voted ‘yes’ to be represented by the Culinary Union.”2020 Democratic presidential candidate Julian Castro has recently called on Station Casinos to negotiate with the six unions. Senator Bernie Sanders has also publicly called on the Trump-supporting casino owners to negotiate.The struggle is expected to gain more attention as Democratic presidential candidates compete for support from the Culinary Union ahead of the Nevada Democratic Caucuses in February 2020.A spokesperson for Red Rock Resorts, the parent company of Station Casinos, Michael Britt told the  in an email: “With respect to both Palms and Green Valley Ranch, although the union would clearly prefer that we not exercise our legal right to challenge the National Labor Review Board’s (NLRB) decisions regarding those properties in the United States federal courts – we have every right to do so and our challenges are both legal and appropriate.”They declined to clarify the reasons behind those challenges.In Red Rock Resort’s most recent annual report, the company claimed, “Union organization activities could disrupt our business by discouraging patrons from visiting our properties, causing labor disputes or work stoppages, and, if successful, could significantly increase our labor costs.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5386335edb9c5b74f3dc3ba92b2241e1cc57be29/0_238_3084_1850/master/3084.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e3f25e7c517b090819783e92c2913d10","title":"french tourists in hot water in sardinia over sand souvenir","story":"Couple in hot water as Italian authorities get tough on issue blighting island for yearsA pair of French tourists could face up to six years in jail after allegedly stealing 40kg (6st 3lbs) of sand from one of Sardinia’s pristine beaches.Border police found the white sand, taken from Chia beach in the south of the Italian island, stashed into 14 large plastic bottles in the boot of the couple’s car. The pair were about to board a ferry for Toulon, in southern France, from Porto Torres.They told police they took the sand as a souvenir and did not realise they had committed an offence.But they now face between one and six years in prison as Sardinian authorities get tough on an issue that has blighted the island for years.Police said there had been a “boom” this summer in the quantity of sand, shells and other beach objects found in people’s luggage at the island’s airports, with 10 tonnes seized at Olbia, close to the Costa Smeralda, in recent weeks alone.People also risk fines of up to €3,000 (£2,700), but police struggle to apply the penalties due to most culprits being visitors.“When those responsible for these episodes are foreigners, it is difficult to collect the fines,” Antonio Casula, the chief of Sardinia’s forest rangers, told La Stampa, adding that the incidents were becoming more frequent.Vigilantes patrol the beaches and signposts clearly warn it is forbidden to take sand. But unaware of the seriousness of the offence, many tourists find the sand an irresistible keepsake.The sand is usually placed in plastic bottles or bags and labelled with the name of the beach from which it was taken. Although the practice is seemingly harmless, it is not only an offence but is detrimental to the island’s environment.Some sand thieves do repent, however. A man from Rome recently returned a bottle of sand he had stolen as a child to the mayor of Cabras.In 2016, a woman who took sand from Budelli, an island off Sardinia that is famous for its pink sand beach, returned it after 29 years.The woman sent the sand back with an apology, writing: “I read in some newspapers and heard on the TV what this sand is and how it is made. I understood how unique Sardinia is. I felt guilty.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c208eaabb211863fef64e56fd610b22df756afb/71_0_722_433/master/722.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5688a2f830e1f9d5601886e758ef474e","title":"employee at uk consulate in hong kong detained in china","story":"Detention comes amid more than two months of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong An employee at the UK’s consulate in Hong Kong has been detained by mainland Chinese authorities on his way back to the city, his girlfriend has said.Simon Cheng, 28, was returning from a trip in Shenzhen to his native Hong Kong on 8 August when his girlfriend, Li, stopped receiving communications from him.A spokesman for the UK’s Foreign and Commonwealth Office said: “We are extremely concerned by reports that a member of our team has been detained returning to Hong Kong from Shenzhen … We are providing support to his family and seeking further information from authorities in Guangdong province and Hong Kong.”Li said Cheng had messaged her just before he went silent. “Ready to pass through the border … pray for me,” he had written.More than 10 days later, Li and Cheng’s family have not been able to get in touch with him. Li said Hong Kong immigration authorities told her Cheng had been placed under “administrative detention” in mainland China in an unknown location and for unknown reasons.The detention of Cheng, who works in the British consulate as a trade and investment officer for Scottish Development International, comes amid more than two months of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong that have threatened Beijing’s authority over the city.Hong Kong immigration officials said in an emailed statement that they have contacted the city’s liaison office in Guangdong province as well as the Hong Kong government “to understand the situation” and provide further assistance to the family.Hong Kong has been rocked by mass protests triggered by a bill that would allow the extradition of suspects to mainland China. Cheng’s case further underlines fears of a lack of transparency and fairness in the mainland Chinese judicial system and the possibility that Hongkongers may be detained for political reasons.The protests were triggered by a controversial bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the Communist party controls the courts, but have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement.Public anger – fuelled by the aggressive tactics used by the police against demonstrators – has collided with years of frustration over worsening inequality and the cost of living in one of the world\u0027s most expensive, densely populated cities.The protest movement was given fresh impetus on 21 July when gangs of men attacked protesters and commuters at a mass transit station – while authorities seemingly did little to intervene.\u0026nbspUnderlying the movement is a push for full democracy in the city, whose leader is chosen by a committee dominated by a pro-Beijing establishment rather than by direct elections.Protesters have vowed to keep their movement going until their core demands are met, such as the resignation of the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, an independent inquiry into police tactics, an amnesty for those arrested and a permanent withdrawal of the bill.Beijing’s influence over Hong Kong has grown in recent years, as activists have been jailed and pro-democracy lawmakers disqualified from running or holding office. Independent booksellers have disappeared from the city, before reappearing in mainland China facing charges.Under the terms of the agreement by which the former British colony was returned to Chinese control in 1997, the semi-autonomous region was meant to maintain a “high degree of autonomy” through an independent judiciary, a free press and an open market economy, a framework known as “one country, two systems”.The extradition bill was seen as an attempt to undermine this and to give Beijing the ability to try pro-democracy activists under the judicial system of the mainland.Lam has shown no sign of backing down beyond agreeing to suspend the extradition bill, while Beijing has issued increasingly shrill condemnations but has left it to the city\u0027s semi-autonomous government to deal with the situation. Meanwhile police have violently clashed directly with protesters, repeatedly firing teargas and rubber bullets.Beijing has ramped up its accusations that foreign countries are “fanning the fire” of unrest in the city. China’s top diplomat Yang Jiechi has ordered the US to “immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any form”.Lily Kuo and Verna Yu in Hong KongUnder administrative detention, usually used for cases involving national security, Cheng can be held for up to 15 days without any charges. Human rights advocates say torture and other forms of ill treatment are common under this type of detention.According to Li, Cheng had not participated in the protests or expressed his position on the movement in any public forums. “As far as I know, he did not attend any of the protests, even the 1 million march. I am just worried about him,” she said.Li, who met Cheng while he was studying in Taiwan – where she is from – has been calling and writing to British, Chinese, and Hong Kong officials for help.“He grew up to be a very caring, diligent and hardworking person,” Li said. “Now, he is missing and detained for no reason. This is deeply distressing for his family and friends.”Li said she and Cheng had discussed marriage, and possibly moving back to Taiwan, but Cheng wanted to remain in Hong Kong. “He said he loves Hong Kong and wanted to sacrifice all he has for his motherland.”News of Cheng’s detention comes after more than a million Hong Kong residents defied a police ban and poured into the streets on Sunday in a peaceful march, calling for the withdrawal of the extradition bill and other demands.Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, said on Tuesday she would set up “a platform for dialogue” to tackle complaints against the police, the government’s first attempt at conciliation in weeks.A rally in Cheng’s name has been called for outside the British consulate on Wednesday.In recent weeks, Beijing has taken an increasingly hard line against the protests, which it has described as an attempt to start a “colour revolution”. Twitter blocked almost 1,000 accounts associated with the Chinese government on Monday while Facebook also removed seven pages, three groups and five accounts that originated in China.China has repeatedly warned Britain – the former colonial ruler of Hong Kong – against “interference”. China has appeared irked by Britain’s public rebukes of the Hong Kong authorities’ handling of the demonstrations.Chinese immigration officials have increased checks at the border between mainland China and Hong Kong, detaining people and checking their phones and other devices.Police in Hong Kong are also adopting a harder line, and have arrested more than 700 people in relation to the protests.

The row erupted after Conte refused to sign an order banning the Open Arms migrant rescue ship from docking in the island of Lampedusa.Salvini, who serves as deputy prime minister and interior minister, was hoping his drastic move on 8 August would immediately collapse the government and bring about snap elections.His strategy could be thwarted if the M5S and PD formed an alternative majority to guide Italy through the delicate budget period in the autumn.Salvini he has also signalled the possibility of patching things up with M5S in order to avoid their tie-up with the PD.

According to the official festival website, “the ‘savage’, chained and agitated, testifies to the taste for the exotic of the 19th century”.In a letter to Unesco, an anti-racist group, the Brussels Panthers, said the character was “adorned with all the humiliating signs that our racist societies have projected on to black people throughout history”.The letter, co-signed by 13 other anti-racism groups, as well as dozens of activists and academics across Europe, describes blackface at Ath and other folkloric events as “acts of symbolic violence towards the black communities of Belgium – acts that are mirrored by the acts of real physical violence and material discrimination that the same communities also encounter”.Mouhad Reghif, spokesman for the Brussels Panthers, told the  that blackface had very serious consequences on the daily lives of black people in Belgium and elsewhere in Europe.Reghif, who has received dozens of threatening messages since launching the campaign, said blackface helped preserve discrimination and racist attitudes.The “savage” character appears on one of 22 floats that process through the small town of Ath on the last Sunday of August. The carnival also usually includes a blackface devil character, dressed in black cloak with red horns.Less controversial figures include David and Goliath, and a giant horse, carried by 16 people.The centuries-old festival traces its roots to a late medieval parade to consecrate a church, but the savage character did not appear until 1873. The event was listed as part of the “intangible cultural heritage of humanity” by Unesco, the UN’s cultural agency, in 2005, along with other folklore parades involving dragons and giants in Belgium and France.Laurent Dubuisson, a historian who runs Ath’s House of Giants museum, which houses models and costumes, rejected the charge of racism.“The whole town, they have been a little surprised by the polemic, because this personage, the savage, is the most popular. This character is a real star of the Ath festival.”In an interview he said there was “huge affection” for the savage character, who typically embraces festival-goers, leaving black marks on their faces.The blackface characters, he said, were unchanged since the Ath festival was inscribed on the Unesco heritage list in 2005. “The devil and the savage are part of the heritage, in the same way that in a Catholic church, or a museum, you can see works of art of art created 200, 300 or 500 years ago that are shocking for our current mentality.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3991056.1566236182!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"parking blackspots worst places for clamping in dublin are revealed","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLast year, Dublin City Council  recorded revenue of €27.9 million from parking fees and a further €3.2 million in clamp release fees. Photograph: Alan BetsonThe  Almost 130 motorists on average are having their vehicles clamped each day in Dublin city.Figures provided by Dublin City Council show a total of 23,383 vehicles were clamped for illegal parking in the first six months of 2019 – a daily average of 129.The number of clamping fees imposed on motorists is virtually unchanged over the same period last year, but is down 19 per cent on the corresponding figures for 2017.However, the latest figures indicate a reduction in illegal parking rates as the decrease in the number of vehicles clamped last year was partially linked to long periods of bad weather associated with Storm Emma in the first half of 2018.A spokesperson for Dublin City Council said it believed the downward trend was linked to “greater education and compliance”.Mespil Road remains the top blackspot for illegal parking in Dublin city, with 416 vehicles clamped at the location between January and June.The figures show that Ranelagh has emerged as a new location for large numbers of vehicles to be clamped – 320 in the first half of this year compared to just 35 over the same period in 2018.Most of the offending vehicles were clamped for parking on a clearway.Local Green Party councillor Hazel Chu welcomed the increased enforcement levels and stressed that there were enough parking spaces in the area to facilitate customers of businesses in Ranelagh.“Parking in the clearway also affects the cycle lane, which makes cycling more dangerous. At the same time, there needs to be clarity with signs to inform motorists when they are allowed to park on the main road through Ranelagh,” Ms Chu said.Valid paid parkingThe most common reason why vehicles were clamped in the first half of 2019 was a failure to have valid paid parking, which accounted for a third of all offences.Almost 4,000 motorists had their vehicle clamped because the time on their parking fee had elapsed, including the 10-minute “grace period”.Almost 2,000 vehicles were clamped for parking on a clearway, while more than 1,400 were detected parking on a footpath and a further 1,000 for parking a non-goods vehicle in a loading bay.A total of 815 vehicles were clamped for parking in a bus lane and another 213 for parking in a disabled parking space without a valid permit. Another 39 vehicles were clamped for parking in spaces reserved for electric vehicles.Despite a high-profile campaign by a number of cycling groups to highlight the extent of illegal parking on cycle lanes, the latest figures show that less than one vehicle is being clamped per day for such an offence.In the first six months of the year, a total of 125 vehicles were clamped for parking on a cycle lane, although the figure is up on 49 for the same period in 2018.The council spokesperson said there had been no change of policy in terms of targeting any particular form of parking infringement.“Dublin City Council continues to enforce illegal parking throughout the city to ensure maximum use of spaces in the city,” she added.Last year, the council recorded revenue of €27.9 million from parking fees and a further €3.2 million in clamp release fees.New contractEarlier this month, the council awarded Dublin Street Parking Services a new contract to continue to provide parking enforcement services for a further five-year period.The standard clamp release fee is €80. Vehicles which are not removed within 24 hours are towed away and impounded, leaving their owners to face a release fee of €160 and a daily storage charge of €35 to have them returned.It is estimated that approximately 0.2 per cent of vehicles which are parked in Dublin city are clamped. Around 13 million parking tickets or payments are recorded each year.The local authority operates more than 1,000 pay-and-display meters around the city for almost 30,000 on-street parking spaces.Since 2017 motorists are entitled to a “grace period” of 10 minutes from the expiry of their parking ticket before their vehicle can be clamped.Parking officials are now also statutorily obliged to remove clamps within two hours of a release fee being paid."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Men held in connection with discovery of bomb under car in Shandon Park, Belfast in JuneProperty registry body says number of scams targeting students rises at this time of yearPSNI appeals for witnesses after incident described as \u0026lsquotruly appalling\u0026rsquo by councillorIndustry groups seek logistical options as fears of no-deal Brexit and port delays growCabinet documents investigate ideas in relation to future funding of broadcastingPhonecall with Taoiseach reveals Johnson sticking to stance on withdrawal agreementSenior officer says dissident republicans were behind the assault close to the BorderOireachtas committee to consider ownership issues and costbenefit of proposed rolloutBritish PM had proposed alternative guarantees for the Border in lieu of backstopForce asserts checks are not needed as presence of children at certain sites is \u0026lsquoincidental\u0026rsquoSome 129 vehicles are clamped in Dublin every day, with Mespil Road among worst areasAttorney General and Minister for Justice had already raised concerns about the plansPolice and a British army bomb disposal team enticed to the area with a hoax deviceDaft.ie report author says lowering rents, increasing supply must be Government goalsSEAI says it does not have enough funding for all applicants, but Bruton disputes claimLarge group show solidarity for Paddy Hansard (75) at inner city gatheringSaving will be ploughed back into provision of day training places, says Simon HarrisStudy examined sub cell units in extinct animal fossils"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3991754.1566296147!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"n%C3%B3ra quoirin search for evidence near malaysian resort stood down","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe search for evidence in the area where the body of Franco-Irish teenager Nóra Quoirin (right) was found is over, according to local media reports in Malaysia. Photograph: Family handoutAFPGetty Images.The search for evidence in the area where the body of Franco-Irish teenager Nóra Quoirin was found is over, according to local media reports in Malaysia. Police are reported to have left the area around the Dusun resort near Seremban, and to be only planning to return if further information comes to light that necessitates their doing so.Malaysia’s Star newspaper quoted Negeri Sembilan police chief Mohamad Mat Yusop as saying the search for forensic clues in the Malaysian rainforest had been stood down. It said local police, as well as investigators from Ireland and France, had left the area where the 15-year-old’s body was found last week.As speculation continued on social media about Nóra’s disappearance and death, Mr Mohamad told the Malaysian Insight: “I hope everyone will stop speculating and move on. I do not wish to comment on baseless reports published by certain media.” “In 10 days, we deployed hundreds of rescuers, including several from our elite forces, K9 dogs, drones and helicopters. That was not all, a special team was assembled from the serious crimes unit and anti-vice unit,” he said. “We searched homes, looked into the background of criminals and took dozens of fingerprints from people close to the case. No foul play was found.” The Lucie Blackman Trust, which is supporting the Quoirin family, has also urged an end to speculation on the case.Local media also reported that a man had pleaded not guilty at a Kuala Lumpur court to intending to provoke a breach of the peace over a Twitter post alleging that Nóra was raped by indigenous Orang Asli.Nóra, who had special needs, was found to be missing from the Dusun resort on Sunday, August 4th, the day after her family checked in for a holiday.Hilly areaHer body was discovered last Tuesday by a group of hikers who had joined the search effort. She was found unclothed, near a stream, in a hard-to-access hilly area that had already been covered by the search-and-rescue operation. The Quoirin family thanked the authorities in Malaysia for their help in investigating her disappearance and said they were “struggling to understand” the events surrounding her death.“The initial postmortem results have given some information that help us to understand Nóra’s cause of death,” the family said in a statement. “But our beautiful innocent girl died in extremely complex circumstances and we are hoping that soon we will have more answers to our many questions.”On Thursday police announced the results of a postmortem on Nóra’s body which they said established that “the cause of death was upper-gastrointestinal bleeding due to a duodenal ulcer complicated with perforation”. They said there was no evidence that Nóra had been abducted or raped.The bleeding in Nóra’s intestine could have been caused by prolonged hunger and stress, Mr Mohamad said. Neither the results of tests on forensic samples taken during the postmortem nor the results of the analysis of fingerprints found on an open downstairs window at the guest house from which Nóra went missing have been announced.The family has not confirmed whether they have left Malaysia."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3991161.1566242789!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"british pm to meet varadkar in dublin in september","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar says the withdrawal agreement will not be reopened   British prime minister Boris Johnson says it will not pass the House of Commons.British prime minister Boris Johnson is to visit Dublin in early September after he and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar spoke for almost an hour by telephone on Monday night. Government Buildings said the two men had “shared perspectives on the withdrawal agreement” but sources in Dublin said that both men had restated their existing positions.The sharp isions on the backstop are reflected in the agreed statement released after the call. Mr Johnson said the withdrawal agreement “in its current form” would not pass the House of Commons, while Mr Varadkar said the withdrawal agreement would not be reopened.However, the two men said that their teams would be in close contact over the coming weeks. The statement also acknowledges that discussions on Brexit can only take place between EU and the UK, and it is understood that there are no talks scheduled with the British government on how to avoid border checks in the event of a no-deal.Food and animalsMr Varadkar has suggested that checks on food and animals, which officials say are necessary to protect the EU’s single market when the UK leaves, could take place on imports from Britain at Northern Ireland’s ports in order to avoid checks on the Border. This would require agreement with the British government, but no talks are currently scheduled, sources say.High-level government sources in Dublin say that there are ongoing contacts between officials and some senior politicians, while a number of Ministers, including Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe and Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy have travelled to London to meet their counterparts. But there have been no discussions on preparing for a no-deal, and one Brussels source says that no-deal preparations will be unilateral, and there will not be negotiations on preparing for a no-deal. Despite last night’s call between Mr Varadkar and Mr Johnson, senior sources in Dublin said the Irish Government – and the EU – would most likely await developments in London before considering any change in their approach. Merkel and MacronMr Johnson is also expected to meet German chancellor Angela Merkel and French president Emmanuel Macron this week before travelling to a G7 meeting in France where he will meet other world leaders. Irish sources say they will expect a read-out on Mr Johnson’s position from their EU counterparts after Mr Johnson’s meetings.However, they also say there is likely to be little if any serious engagement with the British government until challenges to Mr Johnson from MPs opposed to a no-deal Brexit are resolved when the House of Commons meets again in September.Mr Johnson on Monday rebuffed a call from UK Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to recall parliament, and also dismissed leaked warnings from his own officials about the potentially dire consequences of a no-deal Brexit on October 31st. Mr Johnson also reassured Mr Varadkar, the Common Travel Area between Britain and Ireland will not be affected by the ending of freedom of movement between the UK and EU after Brexit.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph:  Niall CarsonPAPressure is building on the Government to advance plans for alternative shipping routes bypassing Britain to avoid severe delays at English Channel ports stemming from a possible no-deal Brexit. Potential risks to the key “landbridge” transit route for Irish traders through the UK to Europe have escalated in light of the UK government’s no-deal plans which show severe disruptions at British ports.Operation Yellowhammer, the secret UK planning dossier leaked over the weekend, warns of significant interruptions at UK ports that could last up to three months after Brexit.The report says up to 85 per cent of lorries travelling across the Channel may not be ready for French customs, creating delays of two days and a severe bottleneck for Irish hauliers bound for Europe. About 150,000 haulage units use the landbridge every year, leading to concerns among Irish businesses that there is insufficient capacity on direct shipping routes to Europe to offer an alternative for this traffic.Fresh foodIndustry groups have warned delays at English ports could affect the transport of fresh food and time-sensitive produce, and have criticised the Government for not developing detailed alternative plans.“What are the Government’s contingency plans for this? All I have heard from the Government is there is increased capacity for Dublin to Cherbourg but that is not a viable alternative to the scale and type of goods using the landbridge,” said Aidan Flynn, general manager of Freight Transport Association Ireland. “This is where the Government are letting themselves down. There hasn’t been enough joined-up thinking amongst the various stakeholders around the table. Planning has been ad hoc and focused on customs and tariffs but it is the movement and access to market that are the most important things.Irish Ferries sails from Dublin to Cherbourg three times a week, while Stena Line also sails three times a week from Rosslare to Cherbourg but on different days. This could lead to a potential demand for daily sailings from each port should a no-deal Brexit at the next deadline of October 31st disrupt landbridge traffic. Ferry companiesThe Government has said there is sufficient capacity on existing direct ferry routes to France to meet current market demand. Should that change, commercial operators will respond where necessary. Hauliers warn of a potential shortage of capacity on the longer sea routes to the European ports of Zeebrugge and Rotterdam that would be required to put traders closer to their markets.Several sources conceded that the direct routes to Europe, last between 20 and 40 hours, would be too long for Irish importers and exporters transporting fresh food and time-sensitive produce. The ferry companies servicing the Irish ports are said to be looking at alternative arrangements in the event of English ports being severely affected by congestion in the event of a no-deal Brexit scenario. “Irish Ferries will respond to the market demands whatever they are at whatever stage,” said the ferry company’s parent, Irish Continental Group, in response to queries.European shipping companies could add vessels and routes on direct services between Ireland and Europe, depending on the level of demand and disruption to cross-channel transit from a crash-out Brexit. Importers and exporters were urged to look at using alternative ports on the English east coast to avoid Dover, the busiest UK port on the channel, to avoid the inevitable no-deal Brexit delays. “Businesses will have to actively export using other east-coast ports,” said Neil McDonnell, chief executive of Isme, the representative body for the country’s small and mid-sized businesses.“Operation Yellowhammer has shown that they could be facing three months of torture.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Daniel Lead OlivasAFPGetty Images. People opposing the Brexit backstop without coming up with a realistic alternative support the return of an Irish Border, European Council president Donald Tusk has said. In a Twitter post which followed UK prime minister Boris Johnson calling for the removal of the backstop from the withdrawl reached between British and EU negotiators, Mr Tusk said: “The backstop is an insurance to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland unless and until an alternative is found. “Those against the backstop and not proposing realistic alternatives in fact support re-establishing a border. Even if they do not admit it.”Mr Johnson on Monday told Ireland and the EU that alternative guarantees to avoid Border checks could be inserted into the withdrawal agreement but the backstop must be removed.However, Dublin was cool on the proposals last night. While the Government issued no formal response, two senior sources played down the significance of the British initiatives and said that the position had not changed, that the Brexit withdrawal agreement could not be renegotiated.James Cleverly, chairman of the Conservative Party, on Tuesday said the EU needs to show flexibility over the backstop because the issue of whether Britain leaves the bloc with or without a deal is now mainly up to Brussels. He said the EU’s insistence on the backstop was the main sticking point in reaching a deal.Mr Cleverly told the BBC that “negotiations only work if people are willing to move and be adaptable” and that what Mr Johnson is asking the EU to do “is look at reality”.‘Sticking point’“The withdrawal agreement, because of the backstop, has been rejected by the House of Commons three times and it’s been very very clear that that is the sticking point, but without that there is a good chance of getting a deal through the House and that’s what the prime minister has said he wants to do.”He added: “We’re making it very very clear we want a deal, but if that is not possible, if the EU are unable or unwilling to make a concession like this then we are going to leave on 31st October that has got to be what happens, that’s what we’ve committed to, that’s what we are going to do.”Mr Johnson spoke to Taoiseach Leo Varadkar on the telephone for almost an hour last night and later released a letter he had sent Mr Tusk, who heads the group of EU leaders.Senior sources in Dublin pointed to the lack of any detail in Mr Johnson’s letter about how a hard border could be avoided, or what the nature of any alternative guarantees could be.Mr Johnson reiterated British opposition to the backstop, the legal guarantee that the North will continue to follow EU rules and standards if no new trade deal is agreed in order to avoid a hard border.‘Reckless’Independent MP Luciana Berger, who co-ordinated a letter calling for MPs’ recall to parliament to block a no-deal Brexit, branded Mr Johnson’s plans as “incredibly reckless”.She told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “It’s very clear that the prime minister is taking us down a path which is reckless.“Every day something else comes out and in fact the letter that you refer to was put together before the project Yellowhammer report was leaked and so there’s even more reason now that parliament should reconvene in order that we can hold the prime minister and his government to account on all the plans that they are pursuing which are incredibly reckless.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Simon DawsonEPABoris Johnson’s government is to launch a major public information campaign to reassure Britons about a potential no-deal Brexit, as the prime minister said he was “confident” the EU would change its position on the Irish border backstop.Downing Street declined to comment on the leaked document about Operation Yellowhammer, its planning for a no-deal Brexit. But officials said the document was “out of date” and did not reflect the government’s state of preparedness. Whitehall insiders said the media campaign, with a budget of £100 million, would begin in the next couple of weeks to explain in a “user-friendly way” what iniduals needed to do ahead of Brexit day on October 31st. In an effort to rebut the stark warnings in a leaked contingency planning paper, the emphasis will be on consumers.Those with knowledge of the preparations said the campaign would be run on TV, radio and social media. The government is working to ensure that its official website is ready for a significant increase in traffic once the campaign launches. It will include details of what consumers need to do to be prepared for travel abroad.A Number 10 spokesperson said “further information will be published in the coming weeks” on government preparations for leaving the EU with or without a deal, noting that Mr Johnson had “significantly stepped up planning” for no-deal. Downing Street insisted it had been “engaging widely” with businesses, despite lobby groups expressing concern that smaller firms were underprepared.Mr Johnson insists he still wants to strike a deal with Brussels. But during a visit to a hospital in Cornwall, he said it was “very much up to our friends” to change their stance on the withdrawal agreement, admitting that other European nations were “showing a little bit of reluctance”.“They have seen that the UK parliament has three times rejected the withdrawal agreement, the backstop just doesn’t work, it’s not democratic and I hope that they will see fit to compromise but in the meantime we get ready to come out on October 31st,” he told Sky News.“That’s fine, I’m confident that they will. But in the meantime we have to get ready for a no-deal outcome. I want a deal. We’re ready to work with our friends and partners to get a deal. But if you want a good deal for the UK, you must simultaneously get ready to come out without one.”Widespread disruptionResponding to the leaked Yellowhammer document, Mr Johnson added that he was “very confident” that the government would be ready for departure on October 31st, with or without a deal. “I’m not pretending that there won’t be bumps on the road. There will be, I said that on the steps of Downing Street, but if everybody puts their minds to it I have absolutely no doubt that we can get ready.”The Yellowhammer document said the consequences of a no-deal exit could be widespread disruption - possibly for months - to trade, food and medicine distribution, fishing, and fuel supplies, and civil unrest.Parliament will have a chance to scrutinise no-deal planning in early September. Michael Gove, the minister in charge of no-deal preparations, will update MPs on the government’s preparatory work for Brexit when it returns on September 3rd, according to officials.This will be the first of what will become weekly updates to the House of Commons on preparations for leaving the EU and Mr Gove is expected to cover the activities of the daily and weekly committees working on deal preparations.Downing Street has rejected a call from 110 MPs to recall parliament early from its summer recess to allow further scrutiny of its Brexit plans.“The House of Commons agreed the date it would rise for summer recess, as well as its return on September 3rd and this was passed by a majority of close to 200 MPs,” a spokesperson said.Only the government has the power to recall parliament early.No-confidence motionIn a keynote speech in Corby, Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn said he would table a vote of no confidence in the Johnson government when parliament returns next month.However, Mr Corbyn did not spell out whether this would be tabled immediately after parliament returns on September 3rd or at some later date.“I will bring a vote of no confidence in the government, and if we’re successful, I would seek to form a time-limited caretaker administration to avert no deal, and call an immediate general election so the people can decide our country’s future,” he said.Mr Corbyn ruled out suggestions by some MPs that a caretaker government could only be formed by a figure commanding wider support across the Commons.Mr Corbyn said the “constitutional precedent” was for the leader of the opposition to “take over” if a government falls from power. He said MPs determined to block a no-deal had to understand that it “falls to the leader of the opposition to make sure no deal does not happen”. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2019Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Two consecutive quarters of contraction are typically defined as a recession.The contraction between April and June was mostly driven by sinking demand from abroad, the Bundesbank said. Exports “were down substantially”, it noted, as pre-Brexit preparations ahead of the UK’s initial exit date at the end of March prompted companies to build up stocks in the first quarter.“As things currently stand, it is unclear whether exports and, by extension, industry will regain their footing before the domestic economy becomes more severely affected,” the Bundesbank said.Appetite for German cars and other goods has also waned in China as growth in the world’s second-largest economy is cooling, partly due to the year-long trade war with the US.Up until a week ago, economists surveyed by Bloomberg were predicting\u0026nbspthat Germany’s economy will grow by 0.2 per cent in the current quarter.But since then big-name institutions including Deutsche Bank have lowered their expectations. The concern for many analysts is that continuing global trade tensions will prolong the downturn in German manufacturing and eventually feed through to the still-strong services sector.The central bank’s forecast follows weeks of disappointing economic data and news of meagre earnings at German companies.

PRESS ASSOCIATION Photo. Picture date: Saturday June 29, 2019Figures from the Gambling Commission estimate that 55,000 children in the UK could have a gambling problem.Fruit machines remain the most common way for children to first encounter gambling but bookmakers and online casinos have come under increasing pressure over the proliferation of adverts for betting, particularly in places where children are likely to see it such as during football matches and on social media.The available evidence indicates that exposure to gambling at a young age increases the risk that a person will become addicted in later life.Twitter has become an important platform for the both traditional and e-sports companies to advertise to potential customers.

Although it was higher than a year ago, the 1.2 per cent annual rise still lagged behind inflation, which is running at 2.1 per cent, according to the latest official data.“There is little doubt that the market continues to face its inevitable challenges,” said Glynis Frew, chief executive of Hunters, an estate agency with over 200 branches across Britain.Official data showed last week that the average price at which homes are sold grew only 0.9 per cent in the year to June, while in London it tumbled by 2.7 per cent. The average British home cost £230,292 in June, down from a peak of £232,000 in August 2018.Buyers have been biding their time as it remains unclear whether the UK will leave the EU with or without a deal. In the latter case, house prices could plunge by almost 6 per cent in 2020 and another 3 per cent in 2021, according to forecasts by the government’s spending watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility.However, the more confident buyers are now abandoning the ‘wait and see’ approach and taking advantage of improved housing affordability as the Brexit deadline nears, Ms Frew said, commenting on Rightmove’s findings.For its latest report, Rightmove measured 130,435 asking prices, covering around 90 per cent of the UK market. The properties were put on sale by estate agents between 7 July to 10 August and advertised on rightmove.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The predicament of the young prince, Segismundo, calls to mind the Chinese sage\u0027s story of the man who dreams he is a butterfly and wakes to wonder whether he is actually a butterfly dreaming he is a man. This youth is at the mercy of political fluctuation: he\u0027s been imprisoned in a dark tower from birth because of a horoscope that predicted he would usurp the throne. Then, when there are anxieties about the succession, his father has him drugged, brought to the Palace, and bafflingly treated like a prince. A poetic piece that tackles deep metaphysical, political matters in a dazzlingly theatrical way. PTA play of astonishing breakthroughs. There had been plenty of soliloquies in Elizabethan drama beforehand. But no-one had ever talked to an audience like Hamlet. He doesn\u0027t just let you into his confidence, he lets you into his consciousness the best portrayals make you feel that you are soul-to-soul with this figure. It\u0027s his capacity for searching introspection that gets in the way and disqualifies Hamlet as a revenge hero: he\u0027s rather wonderfully miscast. Hamlet is brilliantly self-reflexive, constantly probing its own theatricality. The conscience of Claudius is tested by a play-within-a play Hamlet tries to fool the court by assuming an “antic disposition” that may at times waver into authentic madness. The piece is like a painful meditation on the contradicting meanings of the verb to “act” – to feign and to intervene. Inexhaustible. PTFeminism and expressionism collide in US playwright Sophie Treadwell\u0027s extraordinary vision of a mechanised, dehumanising metropolis. We feel the nerve-shredding racket of modern existence – described as “this purgatory of noise” – assaulting the Everywoman character at every stage as she makes her descent to doom. She\u0027s a stenographer, a sensitive cog in the machine who is blackmailed by her mother into marriage with a boss who revolts her, and ends up condemned to the electric chair for murdering him. Treadwell\u0027s nagging dialogue, with its jangly staccato and syncopated telegraphese, uncannily anticipates Harold Pinter and David Mamet. Her cry against institutionalised misogyny – “I will not submit” – resounds down the ages. PTIn Gogol\u0027s great phantasmagoric farce, an impecunious clerk newly arrived from St Petersburg is mistakenly assumed to be the eponymous inspector by the corrupt mayor and officials of this provincial town. Panic drives these paranoid locals to project a false identity onto this stranger. That would have been a good enough joke. Gogol, though, gives it an inspired, twist. His penniless nonenity turns out to be driven by an equivalent dread of being recognised as one of life\u0027s losers. So when he twigs to their exploitable mistake, he treats their absurd respect (not to mention their bribes) as long-overdue recognition of his true worth and becomes airborne with grandiosity. It\u0027s the interlocking lunacies that generate the comic delirium in this Russian masterpiece. PTOne of Pinter\u0027s most haunting and unnerving pieces. A married couple, Kate and Deeley, play games of power and possessiveness with the wife\u0027s former flatmate, Anna, who comes to visit for the first time in 20 years. The piece is horribly preoccupied with the use people make of selective – and conceivably invented – memories as weapon or way of gaining the upper hand. We mint memories, in this understanding of it, in response to the psychological needs of the moment: “There are things I remember which may never have happened, but as I recall them.” Deeley is threatened by Anna\u0027s youthful relationship to his wife and strongly attracted to the newcomer. There’s a wonderful evocation of rackety London when the girls lived as secretaries, but the uneasy comedy of all this turns lethal. PTThe best Jacobean tragedy outside Shakespeare, The Changeling also seems to anticipate film noir. The heroine hires a shady type to bump off her fiance. This villain has a facial disfigurement, but the piece is alert to how perversely attracted we are to what repels us. The assassin demands her virginity as his blood-money and the slide into shadowy corruption becomes inexorable. There is a subplot in a madhouse that is designed as a distorted mirror of the main action in its obsession with disguise, lunacy, and sex. PTThis Pulitzer-winning American playwright explores the history of her great-grandmother in early 20th century New York. Esther is a black seamstress – unmarried and illiterate – who sews ravishingly beautiful garments for other women to wear on their wedding nights. She gets what could be a last chance of happiness but it\u0027s destroyed in circumstances that are never sentimentalised. The sensual feel of fine fabric (her means of supporting and expressing herself) is conveyed with gorgeous descriptive power. Intimate Apparel manages to be uplifting without ever losing its irreverent humour. PTSophocles\u0027s play is still the most powerful ever written about the conflict between our obligations to the state and our duty to the ties of kinship. Antigone defies her uncle Kreon, the new ruler of Thebes, by burying her brother Polyneikes. He had brought an army against his native city and Kreon, in these politically volatile times, wants his corpse left for the dogs as an exemplary desecration. The philosopher Hegel saw this as the quintessence of true tragedy: not a conflict between good and evil, but between right and right. In fact, productions nowadays tend to come down in favour of Antigone and her self-sacrificing intransigence. PTRichard Bean had the inspired idea of transposing Goldoni\u0027s 18th century commedia dell\u0027arte romp from Venice to Brighton in 1963. Our jack-the-lad hero – frantically trying to hold down a pair of jobs, unbeknownst to either boss – is a failed skiffle player. The complications are deliciously warped. One character does a bunk to Brighton disguised as her psychotic twin brother who has been bumped off by her posh twit of a boyfriend in a gangland brawl. Still with me? The dialogue is naughty and knowing, but there\u0027s a terrific innocent joy to the physical clowning which peaks in the delirious sequence where our hero has to dish up lunch to the two masters at the same time. PTA supreme example of how a writer can make a play by putting together a triptych of miniatures. Holman was brought up in the pacifist tradition and Making Noise Quietly looks at the long-range effects of war in three chance encounters. In the first, set in a Kent field in 1943, a northern Quaker and an uninhibited London aesthete discuss their reasons for not fighting. In the second, a naval officer arrives to tell a mother of her son’s death in the Falklands War. The third is set in the Black Forest in 1986. An English private, gone AWOL with his disturbed eight-year-old stepson, come into testing collision with a rich German businesswoman who survived the Holocaust. There\u0027s a stunning scene in which she draws the little boy out of his dogmatic mutism by her repeated, stern insistence that he says “thank you” it\u0027s uplifing in the end but it\u0027s not pretty. Writing of rare sensitivity and cumulative power. PTThough he described it as “the lightest of light comedies”, Private Lives is the Noel Coward play that one would undoubtedly preserve for posterity. He wrote it as a vehicle for himself and Gertrude Lawrence, with indecent speed. The play centres on two orcees who, five years after their split, bump into each other on adjacent hotel balconies while on the first night of honeymoons with their new spouses. An elegantly contrived coincidence followed by a pattern of cheekily reversed expectations: most comedies end in marriage this one begins with nobbled nuptials as the couple unceremoniously ditch their second partners and abscond to Paris together. Elyot and Amanda are the kind of flighty egotistical couple that can neither live together nor apart. Anti-romantic comedy soaked in sex (and romance): “Don\u0027t quibble Sybil.” PT1240 Angels in America (1990-93), Tony KushnerSubtitled “A Gay Fantasia on National Themes”, Tony Kushner\u0027s astonishing two-part play is set in the AIDS crisis of the mid-1980s during the right wing administration of Ronald Reagan. The word AIDS was never mentioned by the President, and the struggle to find a cure was hampered by a lack of government recognition. Kushner retaliated by putting gay men centre stage in an epic that shows them fighting to forge their private and public destinies. This is, however, very far from a conventional “issue” play in its glorious ambition. The piece rages from Antarctica and the damaged ozone layer to a baroque heaven that god has abandoned. Prophetic angels crash through ceilings. There are “mutual dream” sequences where people wander in and out of each other\u0027 fantasies. The presiding demon of the piece is one of drama\u0027s greatest monsters: the incorrigible and shameless Roy Cohn was a real-life Republican fixer (and mentor to the young Donald Trump). PTA middle-aged woman is buried in a mound of earth first up to the waist then, after the interval, up to the neck. It is a sight that has never lost its capacity to startle. Beckett\u0027s Winnie prattles away dogged with optimism (“This will have been another happy day”) in a loquacious attempt to stave off hysteria and despair at her encroaching fate. Partly irritating, partly heroic, she brings forth a dotty lyrical monologue that\u0027s threaded with genteel half-remembered wisps from the “immortal” classics. Peter Hall, who directed Peggy Ashcroft in the part, rightly pointed out that “Beckett\u0027s theatre is as much about mime and physical precision as it is about words”. Except that his texts are great and this one is superb beyond belief. To quote Winnie: “What is that unforgettable line?” PT1440  Long Day’s Journey into Night (1940), Eugene O NeillWhen O\u0027Neill described Long Day\u0027s Journey as a “play of old sorrow, written in blood and tears”, he was barely exaggerating. This enormous autobiographical drama is so raw and unremitting in its revelations about his dysfunctional Irish-Catholic family that the author left instructions – mercifully disobeyed by his widow – that the play was not to be performed until 25 years after his death. You can understand the trepidation. Long Day\u0027s Journey plunges deep into the tortured heart of the Tyrones – James, the acclaimed actor who sold out to commercial success, his wife Mary who has recently relapsed into morphine addiction, and their two sons. When the play is under the baton of the right director, it\u0027s the like listening to the recapitulations in a great piece of music. You emerge drained but in a state of elating catharsis. PTHector wants to teach boys knowledge that will last them a lifetime. But the headmaster has become obsessed with government league tables and has hired Irwin to teach them glib, exam-passing techniques. That\u0027s the clash at the heart of Alan Bennett\u0027s hugely popular hit. It\u0027s set at a Yorkshire grammar amongst a group of clever sixth-formers. As with a lot of Bennett\u0027s work you can discern a revue-like structure in the play\u0027s glorious string of skits, gags, songs and sheer elating silliness. But it\u0027s also a brilliant portrait of a maverick teacher. The scene in which the doomed Hector analyses the Hardy poem “Drummer Hodge” with his pupil Posner is unsurpassed in drama as an example of humane teaching. Gay, unhappy Posner also has the play\u0027s best joke: “I\u0027m a Jew. I\u0027m small. I\u0027m homosexual. And I live in Sheffield. I\u0027m fucked.” PTFrank Hardy, an itinerant Irish faith healer, his wife, and his manager tell four monologues that contradict each other, leaving the audience to question truth and memory, lies and storytelling. Frank struggles to understand his own “gift”, and how his ability to cure comes and goes Faith Healer is also a parable about the artist and his inspiration. The play foundered when it opened on Broadway, but has since been recognised as a modern classic: in a good production, there’s a trembling sort of power to it. Friel’s writing can be rhythmical, incantatory, but it’s also gorgeously subtle. Although Friel throughout maintains a – crucial – ambivalence, the play attains a sort of transcendent grace of its own. HWPlays by this American writer tend to be long, slow – and strangely riveting. It’s hard to pin down what exactly makes John so bewitching. It is set in a kitschy, tat-filled Gettysburg guesthouse, where a fighting young couple interact with the dotty landlady and her blind but visionary friend. The house seems haunted: creepy dolls and pianos start playing themselves. But it’s also haunted by history (it was a civil war hospital), and by the older women’s memories of love, ghosts, and their own mystical experiences. All of this is a little spooky, but also rather emotionally stirring. Baker is also super sharp on the millennial couple’s dying relationship, which opens out into a look at how it’s often women who have to prop up men’s myths, to feed their needy hunger. HWFrom “I have always depended on the kindness of strangers” to “Stellaaaaaa”, Williams’s play has entered the popular consciousness. As well it might: there’s something eternal in its themes of loss, ageing, and the lies we live by. Fear and lust rub up against each other, sweatily few other writers have captured the heat of the South like Williams, and this is the playwright at his most atmospheric. Blanche DuBois – the deluded southern belle who shacks up with her sister and her macho, abusive husband – is a summit part for an actress, and everyone from Vivien Leigh to Tallulah Bankhead, Cate Blanchett to Gillian Anderson have had a go. HWThe only surviving full trilogy of Greek tragedies, through Agamemnon, The Libation Bearers, and The Eumenides Aeschylus traces the impact of violence and revenge down a Royal family, throwing questions of justice and duty into sharp relief. To win the Trojan war, Agamemnon sacrificed his daughter the trilogy opens with a play in which his wife Clytemnestra kills him to avenge her daughter’s death. In Libation Bearers, Clytemnestra’s son Orestes murders her in retaliation (if Antigone is a tragedy because it’s a conflict between right and right, this is perhaps a clash between wrong and wrong). The cycle is broken in Eumenides, where the gods form a court in which to try Orestes. It’s juicy, meaty, high-octane stuff – and has been given era-defining productions both in Peter Hall masked version at the National in 1981, and in Robert Icke’s crisp modern adaptation in 2015. HWPart of the playwright’s cycle exploring the African-American experience in 20th century American –  a play for each decade – this chapter is set in a Chicago recording studio in 1927. Ma Rainey, the “mother of the blues”, is slow to show up to record some tunes. Instead, we watch her band kill time and spar with one another. Although it all lands light as a butterfly, the script is stinging on subjects such as ambition and race relations. Ma Rainey, when she arrives, proves worth waiting for: an immense, haughty presence. There’s a twist towards the end, giving the play punch – plus the tunes are great, of course. HWIbsen wrote great women: we could have gone for Hedda Gabler. But A Doll’s House is one of those plays with a wide significance: written in 1879, it’s a proto-feminist text. When our troubled heroine Nora slams the door at the end of the play, it’s not just on her patronising husband, but on the whole of The Patriarchy. The play shocked some in its portrayal of a woman made so desperate by her suffocating domestic situation that she abandons her children as well as her husband, choosing freedom and self-actualistion over the prison of the home. Of course, things have changed for women since, but this exceptionally controlled play still unfolds perfectly – and that slam still resonates. HWYou could make a case for any of Chekhov’s plays really (we nearly went for his early, entertaining Platonov, just to be different) but the lucidity of The Seagull wins out. It’s got more plot, a sliver less ennui, than some of his others: a young man, Konstantin, longs to be a playwright his narcissistic mother Arkadina – an actress – is wrapped up in her new boyfriend, Trigorin, a successful novelist. He in turn romances Nina, Konstantin’s girlfriend and an aspiring actress. It’s not much of a spoiler to say none of their dreams exactly come true, life proving endlessly, exquisitely disappointing. The Seagull is a mordant comedy – scenes skewering both Arkadina’s monstrous ego and her son’s attempts at avant garde art are some of the best bits of theatre-about-theatre ever. But there’s also an unbearable tenderness to the play’s portrayal of young love, hope, and idealism. HW2340  Mother Courage and Her Children (1939), Bertolt Brecht Few, if any, playwrights of the 20th century had as much of an impact on theatre as Brecht: he wanted art to be a political tool rather than escapist entertainment, but also revolutionised theatrical form and style, doing away with naturalism. But it can mean his “epic theatre” is still associated with didacticism, rather than drama. Not so Mother Courage, though, which is epic in both senses: written after Hitler invaded Poland, but set during the Thirty-Years\u0027 War, it is a potent story of one mother’s attempts to profit from conflict, and the huge cost war always takes in the end. HWBased on the Greek myth where Medea kills her children in order to get revenge on her unfaithful husband, this tragedy has lost none of its force – or power to shock. But the text allows more sympathetic readings Medea too, as a woman fighting for justice in an unjust world. With a monumental lead part, and a chorus who react and comment on the action, the play has always been one of the most popular of the Greek tragedies. Taut and tense, you see the horror coming but feel desperately compelled to look. HWThe mother of a murdered child. Her imprisoned paedophile killer. A criminal psychologist attempting to understand what drove him to do it. Through first monologues, and then dialogue, this modem classic has much to say about the extremes of human anguish, but also our capacity for change, and for forgiveness. It’s a dark and thorny work, but a deeply humane one too, by a prolific British writer at her best. HW2640 The Importance of Being Earnest (1895), Oscar Wilde Has there every been such a reliably delightful comedy? The improbable plot of tangled engagements, lost handbags, invented wicked relatives, and real monstrous aunts runs like clockwork. There are innumerable blissful one-liners, the characters are delicious upper-class twits, and at every turn Wilde has a fine old time pricking societal niceties. It’s frothy fun, and funny froth, and always invites larger-than-life performances. Being so very bankable has led to Wilde’s play certainly being over-staged and it now feels thoroughly un-urgent – and then it makes you laugh all over again. HWSherman’s harrowing play pulls the rug from under you. You invest in the relationship between Max and Rudy, a decadent gay couple in Berlin in 1934 – but after the Night of the Long Knives they flee, before being caught and sent to Dachau. On the way, Max’s desire to survive produces sickening betrayal. He pretends to be Jewish rather than gay, but in the camp meets Horst, a man who reveals the honour in being true to one’s self. There’s an astonishing scene where – forbidden to touch – they have sex purely through words. Ian McKellen originally played Max, but Richard Gere and Alan Cummings have also taken on the role in what is now seen as seminal gay text – one that proves truth and love may flower in the most horrific, hopeless circumstances. HWAh, the transformative power of theatre… This familiar idea is irresistibly proven by Wertenbaker’s oft-revived play, based on a true story about a group of convicts in an Australian penal colony who put on a production of George Farquhar’s The Recruiting Officer. It has fun sending up the pretensions of theatre, but ultimately uses it as means for talking about empathy, communication, and understanding, as relations between the reviled prisoners and the cruel officers thaw. A direct piece of storytelling with a huge heart. HWLucy Prebble made her name with ENRON, charting the hubris of the financial giant, but while it may be less flashy, The Effect is still dazzlingly good. It has, at its heart, a question we’d all like to know the answer to: what is love? The play follows two volunteers in a clinical trial for a new anti-depressant when they fall for each other, they wonder whether their love is “real”, or a by-product. And given all interactions in the brain are just chemical, does it even matter? The idea of what’s really real and what’s really romantic, what happiness is and what function unhappiness might have, are turned over by Prebble’s own very sharp mind. Her characters are fun to spend time with, her dialogue is snappy, but she digs deep too, into both scientific theories and human emotions, taking us from the grey lows of depression to the technicolour highs of new love. HWIt can be hard to separate this play from an animating original performance by the great Mark Rylance, who played Johnny “Rooster” Byron – a wild misfit who lives in a caravan in the woods in rural England, gathering local young people to him like some kind of drink-and-drug-fuelled pied piper. Such a summary might sound tawdry, yet set on St George’s Day and ripe with Rooster’s storytelling, it has a mythic, mystical quality. A state-of-the-nation show powered by anti-establishment brio, it also precisely captures a contemporary rural community (very sweary, and very funny). Jerusalem became a ridiculously big hit, with audiences camping out round the theatre for tickets. But a recent revival suggests the play can still crow, whoever plays Rooster. HWWhat makes a great play? A lot of critics, academics, and playwrights themselves will point to form matching content. On this, Tim Crouch’s glitteringly clever play really delivers – while also being extremely moving. A stage hypnotist encounters the father of a girl he killed in a car accident. The father truly believes his daughter has been transformed into oak tree. At every performance, the father is played by an actor who’s never seen or read the play before they are given a script or fed lines by – yes – the hypnotist (played initially by Crouch himself, also acknowledging his “real” role as the playwright). The actor is transformed before us we accept that they are now the father. An Oak Tree has a radical honesty which has made it hugely influential among younger generation. We always know theatre isn’t “real” – by playfully acknowledging that, the emotional impact is actually heightened. It’s a magic trick where understanding the trickery only makes the magic more real. HWAthol Fugard came to see that the righteous anger of didactic anti-apartheid drama was not as effective as the subversive laughter of the black townships when it came to getting across the harshness of the conditions there. Certainly, there is nothing moralising or solemn about this piece which was developed by Fugard from improvisations with the great John Kani and Winston Ntosha who first performed it. A mischievous shaggy dog story, it pulls the audience into an atmosphere of good-humoured sociability. Sizwe is a work-seeker in Port Elizabeth who can\u0027t get a job because he doesn\u0027t have a permit. It turns out that he has found a dead man\u0027s pass book and has substituted his own photo, killing off Sizwe Bansi. A deceptively light and humane play that outlasts the apartheid era. PT3340 Purgatory in Ingolstadt (1924)  Pioneers in Ingolstadt (1928), Marieluise FleisserMarieluise Fleisser, the author of these sorely neglected plays, was the lover, protégée, and victim of Bertolt Brecht, and her subject was the lower Bavarian city of her birth. The plays use a bold collage technique instead of linear narrative, and she had penetrating insights into its vicious pack mentality and conformist claustrophobia. In Purgatory, she evokes a stifling Catholic ethos: we see two very different rebels (one girl seeks in vain for an abortion) who suffer the humiliation of having to crawl back to the pack. Brecht effectively hijacked her second play Pioneers (about the contact between the inhabitants and a visiting squad of bridge-builders). He imposed overt anti-militarism and sensationalising sex, and Fleisser was denounced as a traitor to German womanhood. Stephen Daldry and Annie Castledine directed a superb version of these plays at the tiny Gate Theatre in 1991. Since when, nothing. It\u0027s high time Fleisser was given her due. PTTempting as it is to include Michael Frayn’s sublimely funny backstage farce, Noises Off, the more serious Copenhagen just pips it. It imagines a real meeting between nuclear physicists, the Dane Niels Bohr and German Werner Heisenberg, in Copenhagen in 1941, to discuss developments that will lead to the atomic bomb. Then he reimagines the meeting, and reimagines it again – after all, no-one really knows what happened. Was Heisenberg warning his old friend of the Nazis’ advances in nuclear weapons? Hoping for a mutual pact to prevent the atomic bomb? Seeking absolution? Looking at the unreliability of memory, the structure of Frayn’s play is cleverly animated by the scientific ideas his characters discuss: Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle is the basis for its dramatic form. A big hit when it opened at the National, it went to the West End, Broadway – and wound up on TV, starring Daniel Craig. HWThis play was a theatrical explosion. Sarah Kane’s debut, written while she was a student, features a nasty tabloid journalist holed up in a Leeds hotel with a much younger woman, whom he sexually abuses. The world of the play – and its conventional theatrical form – is then blasted apart becoming a war zone: a soldier bursts in, explosions go off, and short scenes of grim horror unfold (stage directions include “he eats the baby”). Famously described as a “disgusting feast of filth”, Blasted was seen by critics as a puerile attempt to shock, and anointed as the classic example of provocative, Nineties in-yer-face theatre. But it’s since become canonical. It doesn’t seem to grow old: Kane’s writing has a horribly vivid energy, and the atrocities it depicts, depressingly, take on fresh resonance for each generation that discovers it. HWWho committed the first infidelity? Was it a man, or was it a woman? (You can bet it was a man who first thought of this prurient question.) The court in Marivaux\u0027s dark comedy thinks it has created the right laboratory conditions for finding out the answer. Four teenagers have been brought up in complete solitude and then are released into each other\u0027s company where their encounters will furnish “a most original entertainment” for the unseen Prince and his fiancée. The play incisively shows how easy it is to turn a stage into an experimental blank slate. But it feels a bit pervy – the Enlightenment\u0027s idea of reality television. Marivaux is elegantly conscious of the objections. There are razor blades secreted in the rococo décor of his works. PTIt\u0027s easy to make Pirandello sound like a forbiddingly cerebral writer. All his life he played tricksy games with philosophical problems such as the deceptiveness of identity. But his aim was to “to convert intellect into passion” and his best works succeed in doing so. Henry IV is about madness, the appearance of madness, and the consequence of deciding to become trapped within the appearance of madness. The protagonist is an Italian nobleman who falls from his horse at a pageant and comes round, convinced that he\u0027s the medieval German Emperor. For 20 years, he has been allowed to live this illusion, attended by flunkies in period-costume. But now comes an embassy bent on “shocking” him from this idee fixe. Richard Harris and Ian McDiarmid were the last pair to play Henry in the West End and they relished the chance to interweave the quizzicality and raw pain that the part requires. The predicament of the central character feels more tragicomically stimulating than far-fetched. PT3840 A Raisin in the Sun (1959), Lorraine HansberryThis play made history: the first on Broadway written by a black woman (shamefully, Britain wouldn’t have its equivalent – a play in the West End by a black British woman – until last year, with Natasha Gordon’s Nine Night). A Raisin in the Sun looks at the Youngers, an African-American family living in poverty in Chicago, dreaming of a better life – and fearing that their dreams will shrivel up like “a raisin in the sun”. Hansberry’s aching drama exhibits the same forceful tug as an Arthur Miller play, laying out how circumstances can crush hope. Its discussion of black identity, however, still crackles today – and the emotional punch that Hansberry’s script carries has drawn big names down the decade: Sidney Poitier starred in the premiere, and everyone from Denzel Washington to P Diddy has also had a crack. Hansberry died at only 34 one can’t help but wonder what other plays she might have had on this list. HWCaryl Churchill has been called the Picasso of modern playwrights. Today, at the age of 80, the British playwright continues startlingly to reinvent herself. Far Away is a twisted fairy tale that demonstrates her matchless gift for merging the apocalyptic and the fantastical. It unfolds in three episodes that shelve steeply. In the first, Joan is quizzing her aunt about what she has just accidentally witnessed. It sounds as if she has espied a bloody act of ethnic cleansing. Then the play escalates into a blackly hilarious vision of cosmic warfare. Partisan brutality has now spread from humans to the animal and mineral world. “The cats have come in on the side of the French,” someone says earnestly. The “natural goodness of deer has come through” says someone else. This is characteristic of Churchill, finding a brilliantly absurdist way of attacking the pernicious myth that there is a simple ide between virtue and evil, “them” and “us”. A sliver of genius. PTTom Stoppard sometimes gets accused of being all head and no heart – but this play proves otherwise. Yes, it’s a mind-achingly clever look at both science and art, pitting the rational against the romantic, while giving you mini lessons in chaos theory, the second law of thermodynamics and the life and shaggings of Lord Byron. But there’s a love story and a tragedy here, that in a well-calibrated production can be very moving. Two stories, set in the same country house, in 1809 and the present day, intersect and eventually overlap beautifully. The mathematic theorising forecasts hope as well as disaster for the universe, and the story offers the same for its characters. HWCalderon\u0027s play is one of the masterpieces of the Spanish Golden Age. The predicament of the young prince, Segismundo, calls to mind the Chinese sage\u0027s story of the man who dreams he is a butterfly and wakes to wonder whether he is actually a butterfly dreaming he is a man. This youth is at the mercy of political fluctuation: he\u0027s been imprisoned in a dark tower from birth because of a horoscope that predicted he would usurp the throne. Then, when there are anxieties about the succession, his father has him drugged, brought to the Palace, and bafflingly treated like a prince. A poetic piece that tackles deep metaphysical, political matters in a dazzlingly theatrical way. PTA play of astonishing breakthroughs. There had been plenty of soliloquies in Elizabethan drama beforehand. But no-one had ever talked to an audience like Hamlet. He doesn\u0027t just let you into his confidence, he lets you into his consciousness the best portrayals make you feel that you are soul-to-soul with this figure. It\u0027s his capacity for searching introspection that gets in the way and disqualifies Hamlet as a revenge hero: he\u0027s rather wonderfully miscast. Hamlet is brilliantly self-reflexive, constantly probing its own theatricality. The conscience of Claudius is tested by a play-within-a play Hamlet tries to fool the court by assuming an “antic disposition” that may at times waver into authentic madness. The piece is like a painful meditation on the contradicting meanings of the verb to “act” – to feign and to intervene. Inexhaustible. PTFeminism and expressionism collide in US playwright Sophie Treadwell\u0027s extraordinary vision of a mechanised, dehumanising metropolis. We feel the nerve-shredding racket of modern existence – described as “this purgatory of noise” – assaulting the Everywoman character at every stage as she makes her descent to doom. She\u0027s a stenographer, a sensitive cog in the machine who is blackmailed by her mother into marriage with a boss who revolts her, and ends up condemned to the electric chair for murdering him. Treadwell\u0027s nagging dialogue, with its jangly staccato and syncopated telegraphese, uncannily anticipates Harold Pinter and David Mamet. Her cry against institutionalised misogyny – “I will not submit” – resounds down the ages. PTIn Gogol\u0027s great phantasmagoric farce, an impecunious clerk newly arrived from St Petersburg is mistakenly assumed to be the eponymous inspector by the corrupt mayor and officials of this provincial town. Panic drives these paranoid locals to project a false identity onto this stranger. That would have been a good enough joke. Gogol, though, gives it an inspired, twist. His penniless nonenity turns out to be driven by an equivalent dread of being recognised as one of life\u0027s losers. So when he twigs to their exploitable mistake, he treats their absurd respect (not to mention their bribes) as long-overdue recognition of his true worth and becomes airborne with grandiosity. It\u0027s the interlocking lunacies that generate the comic delirium in this Russian masterpiece. PTOne of Pinter\u0027s most haunting and unnerving pieces. A married couple, Kate and Deeley, play games of power and possessiveness with the wife\u0027s former flatmate, Anna, who comes to visit for the first time in 20 years. The piece is horribly preoccupied with the use people make of selective – and conceivably invented – memories as weapon or way of gaining the upper hand. We mint memories, in this understanding of it, in response to the psychological needs of the moment: “There are things I remember which may never have happened, but as I recall them.” Deeley is threatened by Anna\u0027s youthful relationship to his wife and strongly attracted to the newcomer. There’s a wonderful evocation of rackety London when the girls lived as secretaries, but the uneasy comedy of all this turns lethal. PTThe best Jacobean tragedy outside Shakespeare, The Changeling also seems to anticipate film noir. The heroine hires a shady type to bump off her fiance. This villain has a facial disfigurement, but the piece is alert to how perversely attracted we are to what repels us. The assassin demands her virginity as his blood-money and the slide into shadowy corruption becomes inexorable. There is a subplot in a madhouse that is designed as a distorted mirror of the main action in its obsession with disguise, lunacy, and sex. PTThis Pulitzer-winning American playwright explores the history of her great-grandmother in early 20th century New York. Esther is a black seamstress – unmarried and illiterate – who sews ravishingly beautiful garments for other women to wear on their wedding nights. She gets what could be a last chance of happiness but it\u0027s destroyed in circumstances that are never sentimentalised. The sensual feel of fine fabric (her means of supporting and expressing herself) is conveyed with gorgeous descriptive power. Intimate Apparel manages to be uplifting without ever losing its irreverent humour. PTSophocles\u0027s play is still the most powerful ever written about the conflict between our obligations to the state and our duty to the ties of kinship. Antigone defies her uncle Kreon, the new ruler of Thebes, by burying her brother Polyneikes. He had brought an army against his native city and Kreon, in these politically volatile times, wants his corpse left for the dogs as an exemplary desecration. The philosopher Hegel saw this as the quintessence of true tragedy: not a conflict between good and evil, but between right and right. In fact, productions nowadays tend to come down in favour of Antigone and her self-sacrificing intransigence. PTRichard Bean had the inspired idea of transposing Goldoni\u0027s 18th century commedia dell\u0027arte romp from Venice to Brighton in 1963. Our jack-the-lad hero – frantically trying to hold down a pair of jobs, unbeknownst to either boss – is a failed skiffle player. The complications are deliciously warped. One character does a bunk to Brighton disguised as her psychotic twin brother who has been bumped off by her posh twit of a boyfriend in a gangland brawl. Still with me? The dialogue is naughty and knowing, but there\u0027s a terrific innocent joy to the physical clowning which peaks in the delirious sequence where our hero has to dish up lunch to the two masters at the same time. PTA supreme example of how a writer can make a play by putting together a triptych of miniatures. Holman was brought up in the pacifist tradition and Making Noise Quietly looks at the long-range effects of war in three chance encounters. In the first, set in a Kent field in 1943, a northern Quaker and an uninhibited London aesthete discuss their reasons for not fighting. In the second, a naval officer arrives to tell a mother of her son’s death in the Falklands War. The third is set in the Black Forest in 1986. An English private, gone AWOL with his disturbed eight-year-old stepson, come into testing collision with a rich German businesswoman who survived the Holocaust. There\u0027s a stunning scene in which she draws the little boy out of his dogmatic mutism by her repeated, stern insistence that he says “thank you” it\u0027s uplifing in the end but it\u0027s not pretty. Writing of rare sensitivity and cumulative power. PTThough he described it as “the lightest of light comedies”, Private Lives is the Noel Coward play that one would undoubtedly preserve for posterity. He wrote it as a vehicle for himself and Gertrude Lawrence, with indecent speed. The play centres on two orcees who, five years after their split, bump into each other on adjacent hotel balconies while on the first night of honeymoons with their new spouses. An elegantly contrived coincidence followed by a pattern of cheekily reversed expectations: most comedies end in marriage this one begins with nobbled nuptials as the couple unceremoniously ditch their second partners and abscond to Paris together. Elyot and Amanda are the kind of flighty egotistical couple that can neither live together nor apart. Anti-romantic comedy soaked in sex (and romance): “Don\u0027t quibble Sybil.” PT1240 Angels in America (1990-93), Tony KushnerSubtitled “A Gay Fantasia on National Themes”, Tony Kushner\u0027s astonishing two-part play is set in the AIDS crisis of the mid-1980s during the right wing administration of Ronald Reagan. The word AIDS was never mentioned by the President, and the struggle to find a cure was hampered by a lack of government recognition. Kushner retaliated by putting gay men centre stage in an epic that shows them fighting to forge their private and public destinies. This is, however, very far from a conventional “issue” play in its glorious ambition. The piece rages from Antarctica and the damaged ozone layer to a baroque heaven that god has abandoned. Prophetic angels crash through ceilings. There are “mutual dream” sequences where people wander in and out of each other\u0027 fantasies. The presiding demon of the piece is one of drama\u0027s greatest monsters: the incorrigible and shameless Roy Cohn was a real-life Republican fixer (and mentor to the young Donald Trump). PTA middle-aged woman is buried in a mound of earth first up to the waist then, after the interval, up to the neck. It is a sight that has never lost its capacity to startle. Beckett\u0027s Winnie prattles away dogged with optimism (“This will have been another happy day”) in a loquacious attempt to stave off hysteria and despair at her encroaching fate. Partly irritating, partly heroic, she brings forth a dotty lyrical monologue that\u0027s threaded with genteel half-remembered wisps from the “immortal” classics. Peter Hall, who directed Peggy Ashcroft in the part, rightly pointed out that “Beckett\u0027s theatre is as much about mime and physical precision as it is about words”. Except that his texts are great and this one is superb beyond belief. To quote Winnie: “What is that unforgettable line?” PT1440  Long Day’s Journey into Night (1940), Eugene O NeillWhen O\u0027Neill described Long Day\u0027s Journey as a “play of old sorrow, written in blood and tears”, he was barely exaggerating. This enormous autobiographical drama is so raw and unremitting in its revelations about his dysfunctional Irish-Catholic family that the author left instructions – mercifully disobeyed by his widow – that the play was not to be performed until 25 years after his death. You can understand the trepidation. Long Day\u0027s Journey plunges deep into the tortured heart of the Tyrones – James, the acclaimed actor who sold out to commercial success, his wife Mary who has recently relapsed into morphine addiction, and their two sons. When the play is under the baton of the right director, it\u0027s the like listening to the recapitulations in a great piece of music. You emerge drained but in a state of elating catharsis. PTHector wants to teach boys knowledge that will last them a lifetime. But the headmaster has become obsessed with government league tables and has hired Irwin to teach them glib, exam-passing techniques. That\u0027s the clash at the heart of Alan Bennett\u0027s hugely popular hit. It\u0027s set at a Yorkshire grammar amongst a group of clever sixth-formers. As with a lot of Bennett\u0027s work you can discern a revue-like structure in the play\u0027s glorious string of skits, gags, songs and sheer elating silliness. But it\u0027s also a brilliant portrait of a maverick teacher. The scene in which the doomed Hector analyses the Hardy poem “Drummer Hodge” with his pupil Posner is unsurpassed in drama as an example of humane teaching. Gay, unhappy Posner also has the play\u0027s best joke: “I\u0027m a Jew. I\u0027m small. I\u0027m homosexual. And I live in Sheffield. I\u0027m fucked.” PTFrank Hardy, an itinerant Irish faith healer, his wife, and his manager tell four monologues that contradict each other, leaving the audience to question truth and memory, lies and storytelling. Frank struggles to understand his own “gift”, and how his ability to cure comes and goes Faith Healer is also a parable about the artist and his inspiration. The play foundered when it opened on Broadway, but has since been recognised as a modern classic: in a good production, there’s a trembling sort of power to it. Friel’s writing can be rhythmical, incantatory, but it’s also gorgeously subtle. Although Friel throughout maintains a – crucial – ambivalence, the play attains a sort of transcendent grace of its own. HWPlays by this American writer tend to be long, slow – and strangely riveting. It’s hard to pin down what exactly makes John so bewitching. It is set in a kitschy, tat-filled Gettysburg guesthouse, where a fighting young couple interact with the dotty landlady and her blind but visionary friend. The house seems haunted: creepy dolls and pianos start playing themselves. But it’s also haunted by history (it was a civil war hospital), and by the older women’s memories of love, ghosts, and their own mystical experiences. All of this is a little spooky, but also rather emotionally stirring. Baker is also super sharp on the millennial couple’s dying relationship, which opens out into a look at how it’s often women who have to prop up men’s myths, to feed their needy hunger. HWFrom “I have always depended on the kindness of strangers” to “Stellaaaaaa”, Williams’s play has entered the popular consciousness. As well it might: there’s something eternal in its themes of loss, ageing, and the lies we live by. Fear and lust rub up against each other, sweatily few other writers have captured the heat of the South like Williams, and this is the playwright at his most atmospheric. Blanche DuBois – the deluded southern belle who shacks up with her sister and her macho, abusive husband – is a summit part for an actress, and everyone from Vivien Leigh to Tallulah Bankhead, Cate Blanchett to Gillian Anderson have had a go. HWThe only surviving full trilogy of Greek tragedies, through Agamemnon, The Libation Bearers, and The Eumenides Aeschylus traces the impact of violence and revenge down a Royal family, throwing questions of justice and duty into sharp relief. To win the Trojan war, Agamemnon sacrificed his daughter the trilogy opens with a play in which his wife Clytemnestra kills him to avenge her daughter’s death. In Libation Bearers, Clytemnestra’s son Orestes murders her in retaliation (if Antigone is a tragedy because it’s a conflict between right and right, this is perhaps a clash between wrong and wrong). The cycle is broken in Eumenides, where the gods form a court in which to try Orestes. It’s juicy, meaty, high-octane stuff – and has been given era-defining productions both in Peter Hall masked version at the National in 1981, and in Robert Icke’s crisp modern adaptation in 2015. HWPart of the playwright’s cycle exploring the African-American experience in 20th century American –  a play for each decade – this chapter is set in a Chicago recording studio in 1927. Ma Rainey, the “mother of the blues”, is slow to show up to record some tunes. Instead, we watch her band kill time and spar with one another. Although it all lands light as a butterfly, the script is stinging on subjects such as ambition and race relations. Ma Rainey, when she arrives, proves worth waiting for: an immense, haughty presence. There’s a twist towards the end, giving the play punch – plus the tunes are great, of course. HWIbsen wrote great women: we could have gone for Hedda Gabler. But A Doll’s House is one of those plays with a wide significance: written in 1879, it’s a proto-feminist text. When our troubled heroine Nora slams the door at the end of the play, it’s not just on her patronising husband, but on the whole of The Patriarchy. The play shocked some in its portrayal of a woman made so desperate by her suffocating domestic situation that she abandons her children as well as her husband, choosing freedom and self-actualistion over the prison of the home. Of course, things have changed for women since, but this exceptionally controlled play still unfolds perfectly – and that slam still resonates. HWYou could make a case for any of Chekhov’s plays really (we nearly went for his early, entertaining Platonov, just to be different) but the lucidity of The Seagull wins out. It’s got more plot, a sliver less ennui, than some of his others: a young man, Konstantin, longs to be a playwright his narcissistic mother Arkadina – an actress – is wrapped up in her new boyfriend, Trigorin, a successful novelist. He in turn romances Nina, Konstantin’s girlfriend and an aspiring actress. It’s not much of a spoiler to say none of their dreams exactly come true, life proving endlessly, exquisitely disappointing. The Seagull is a mordant comedy – scenes skewering both Arkadina’s monstrous ego and her son’s attempts at avant garde art are some of the best bits of theatre-about-theatre ever. But there’s also an unbearable tenderness to the play’s portrayal of young love, hope, and idealism. HW2340  Mother Courage and Her Children (1939), Bertolt Brecht Few, if any, playwrights of the 20th century had as much of an impact on theatre as Brecht: he wanted art to be a political tool rather than escapist entertainment, but also revolutionised theatrical form and style, doing away with naturalism. But it can mean his “epic theatre” is still associated with didacticism, rather than drama. Not so Mother Courage, though, which is epic in both senses: written after Hitler invaded Poland, but set during the Thirty-Years\u0027 War, it is a potent story of one mother’s attempts to profit from conflict, and the huge cost war always takes in the end. HWBased on the Greek myth where Medea kills her children in order to get revenge on her unfaithful husband, this tragedy has lost none of its force – or power to shock. But the text allows more sympathetic readings Medea too, as a woman fighting for justice in an unjust world. With a monumental lead part, and a chorus who react and comment on the action, the play has always been one of the most popular of the Greek tragedies. Taut and tense, you see the horror coming but feel desperately compelled to look. HWThe mother of a murdered child. Her imprisoned paedophile killer. A criminal psychologist attempting to understand what drove him to do it. Through first monologues, and then dialogue, this modem classic has much to say about the extremes of human anguish, but also our capacity for change, and for forgiveness. It’s a dark and thorny work, but a deeply humane one too, by a prolific British writer at her best. HW2640 The Importance of Being Earnest (1895), Oscar Wilde Has there every been such a reliably delightful comedy? The improbable plot of tangled engagements, lost handbags, invented wicked relatives, and real monstrous aunts runs like clockwork. There are innumerable blissful one-liners, the characters are delicious upper-class twits, and at every turn Wilde has a fine old time pricking societal niceties. It’s frothy fun, and funny froth, and always invites larger-than-life performances. Being so very bankable has led to Wilde’s play certainly being over-staged and it now feels thoroughly un-urgent – and then it makes you laugh all over again. HWSherman’s harrowing play pulls the rug from under you. You invest in the relationship between Max and Rudy, a decadent gay couple in Berlin in 1934 – but after the Night of the Long Knives they flee, before being caught and sent to Dachau. On the way, Max’s desire to survive produces sickening betrayal. He pretends to be Jewish rather than gay, but in the camp meets Horst, a man who reveals the honour in being true to one’s self. There’s an astonishing scene where – forbidden to touch – they have sex purely through words. Ian McKellen originally played Max, but Richard Gere and Alan Cummings have also taken on the role in what is now seen as seminal gay text – one that proves truth and love may flower in the most horrific, hopeless circumstances. HWAh, the transformative power of theatre… This familiar idea is irresistibly proven by Wertenbaker’s oft-revived play, based on a true story about a group of convicts in an Australian penal colony who put on a production of George Farquhar’s The Recruiting Officer. It has fun sending up the pretensions of theatre, but ultimately uses it as means for talking about empathy, communication, and understanding, as relations between the reviled prisoners and the cruel officers thaw. A direct piece of storytelling with a huge heart. HWLucy Prebble made her name with ENRON, charting the hubris of the financial giant, but while it may be less flashy, The Effect is still dazzlingly good. It has, at its heart, a question we’d all like to know the answer to: what is love? The play follows two volunteers in a clinical trial for a new anti-depressant when they fall for each other, they wonder whether their love is “real”, or a by-product. And given all interactions in the brain are just chemical, does it even matter? The idea of what’s really real and what’s really romantic, what happiness is and what function unhappiness might have, are turned over by Prebble’s own very sharp mind. Her characters are fun to spend time with, her dialogue is snappy, but she digs deep too, into both scientific theories and human emotions, taking us from the grey lows of depression to the technicolour highs of new love. HWIt can be hard to separate this play from an animating original performance by the great Mark Rylance, who played Johnny “Rooster” Byron – a wild misfit who lives in a caravan in the woods in rural England, gathering local young people to him like some kind of drink-and-drug-fuelled pied piper. Such a summary might sound tawdry, yet set on St George’s Day and ripe with Rooster’s storytelling, it has a mythic, mystical quality. A state-of-the-nation show powered by anti-establishment brio, it also precisely captures a contemporary rural community (very sweary, and very funny). Jerusalem became a ridiculously big hit, with audiences camping out round the theatre for tickets. But a recent revival suggests the play can still crow, whoever plays Rooster. HWWhat makes a great play? A lot of critics, academics, and playwrights themselves will point to form matching content. On this, Tim Crouch’s glitteringly clever play really delivers – while also being extremely moving. A stage hypnotist encounters the father of a girl he killed in a car accident. The father truly believes his daughter has been transformed into oak tree. At every performance, the father is played by an actor who’s never seen or read the play before they are given a script or fed lines by – yes – the hypnotist (played initially by Crouch himself, also acknowledging his “real” role as the playwright). The actor is transformed before us we accept that they are now the father. An Oak Tree has a radical honesty which has made it hugely influential among younger generation. We always know theatre isn’t “real” – by playfully acknowledging that, the emotional impact is actually heightened. It’s a magic trick where understanding the trickery only makes the magic more real. HWAthol Fugard came to see that the righteous anger of didactic anti-apartheid drama was not as effective as the subversive laughter of the black townships when it came to getting across the harshness of the conditions there. Certainly, there is nothing moralising or solemn about this piece which was developed by Fugard from improvisations with the great John Kani and Winston Ntosha who first performed it. A mischievous shaggy dog story, it pulls the audience into an atmosphere of good-humoured sociability. Sizwe is a work-seeker in Port Elizabeth who can\u0027t get a job because he doesn\u0027t have a permit. It turns out that he has found a dead man\u0027s pass book and has substituted his own photo, killing off Sizwe Bansi. A deceptively light and humane play that outlasts the apartheid era. PT3340 Purgatory in Ingolstadt (1924)  Pioneers in Ingolstadt (1928), Marieluise FleisserMarieluise Fleisser, the author of these sorely neglected plays, was the lover, protégée, and victim of Bertolt Brecht, and her subject was the lower Bavarian city of her birth. The plays use a bold collage technique instead of linear narrative, and she had penetrating insights into its vicious pack mentality and conformist claustrophobia. In Purgatory, she evokes a stifling Catholic ethos: we see two very different rebels (one girl seeks in vain for an abortion) who suffer the humiliation of having to crawl back to the pack. Brecht effectively hijacked her second play Pioneers (about the contact between the inhabitants and a visiting squad of bridge-builders). He imposed overt anti-militarism and sensationalising sex, and Fleisser was denounced as a traitor to German womanhood. Stephen Daldry and Annie Castledine directed a superb version of these plays at the tiny Gate Theatre in 1991. Since when, nothing. It\u0027s high time Fleisser was given her due. PTTempting as it is to include Michael Frayn’s sublimely funny backstage farce, Noises Off, the more serious Copenhagen just pips it. It imagines a real meeting between nuclear physicists, the Dane Niels Bohr and German Werner Heisenberg, in Copenhagen in 1941, to discuss developments that will lead to the atomic bomb. Then he reimagines the meeting, and reimagines it again – after all, no-one really knows what happened. Was Heisenberg warning his old friend of the Nazis’ advances in nuclear weapons? Hoping for a mutual pact to prevent the atomic bomb? Seeking absolution? Looking at the unreliability of memory, the structure of Frayn’s play is cleverly animated by the scientific ideas his characters discuss: Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle is the basis for its dramatic form. A big hit when it opened at the National, it went to the West End, Broadway – and wound up on TV, starring Daniel Craig. HWThis play was a theatrical explosion. Sarah Kane’s debut, written while she was a student, features a nasty tabloid journalist holed up in a Leeds hotel with a much younger woman, whom he sexually abuses. The world of the play – and its conventional theatrical form – is then blasted apart becoming a war zone: a soldier bursts in, explosions go off, and short scenes of grim horror unfold (stage directions include “he eats the baby”). Famously described as a “disgusting feast of filth”, Blasted was seen by critics as a puerile attempt to shock, and anointed as the classic example of provocative, Nineties in-yer-face theatre. But it’s since become canonical. It doesn’t seem to grow old: Kane’s writing has a horribly vivid energy, and the atrocities it depicts, depressingly, take on fresh resonance for each generation that discovers it. HWWho committed the first infidelity? Was it a man, or was it a woman? (You can bet it was a man who first thought of this prurient question.) The court in Marivaux\u0027s dark comedy thinks it has created the right laboratory conditions for finding out the answer. Four teenagers have been brought up in complete solitude and then are released into each other\u0027s company where their encounters will furnish “a most original entertainment” for the unseen Prince and his fiancée. The play incisively shows how easy it is to turn a stage into an experimental blank slate. But it feels a bit pervy – the Enlightenment\u0027s idea of reality television. Marivaux is elegantly conscious of the objections. There are razor blades secreted in the rococo décor of his works. PTIt\u0027s easy to make Pirandello sound like a forbiddingly cerebral writer. All his life he played tricksy games with philosophical problems such as the deceptiveness of identity. But his aim was to “to convert intellect into passion” and his best works succeed in doing so. Henry IV is about madness, the appearance of madness, and the consequence of deciding to become trapped within the appearance of madness. The protagonist is an Italian nobleman who falls from his horse at a pageant and comes round, convinced that he\u0027s the medieval German Emperor. For 20 years, he has been allowed to live this illusion, attended by flunkies in period-costume. But now comes an embassy bent on “shocking” him from this idee fixe. Richard Harris and Ian McDiarmid were the last pair to play Henry in the West End and they relished the chance to interweave the quizzicality and raw pain that the part requires. The predicament of the central character feels more tragicomically stimulating than far-fetched. PT3840 A Raisin in the Sun (1959), Lorraine HansberryThis play made history: the first on Broadway written by a black woman (shamefully, Britain wouldn’t have its equivalent – a play in the West End by a black British woman – until last year, with Natasha Gordon’s Nine Night). A Raisin in the Sun looks at the Youngers, an African-American family living in poverty in Chicago, dreaming of a better life – and fearing that their dreams will shrivel up like “a raisin in the sun”. Hansberry’s aching drama exhibits the same forceful tug as an Arthur Miller play, laying out how circumstances can crush hope. Its discussion of black identity, however, still crackles today – and the emotional punch that Hansberry’s script carries has drawn big names down the decade: Sidney Poitier starred in the premiere, and everyone from Denzel Washington to P Diddy has also had a crack. Hansberry died at only 34 one can’t help but wonder what other plays she might have had on this list. HWCaryl Churchill has been called the Picasso of modern playwrights. Today, at the age of 80, the British playwright continues startlingly to reinvent herself. Far Away is a twisted fairy tale that demonstrates her matchless gift for merging the apocalyptic and the fantastical. It unfolds in three episodes that shelve steeply. In the first, Joan is quizzing her aunt about what she has just accidentally witnessed. It sounds as if she has espied a bloody act of ethnic cleansing. Then the play escalates into a blackly hilarious vision of cosmic warfare. Partisan brutality has now spread from humans to the animal and mineral world. “The cats have come in on the side of the French,” someone says earnestly. The “natural goodness of deer has come through” says someone else. This is characteristic of Churchill, finding a brilliantly absurdist way of attacking the pernicious myth that there is a simple ide between virtue and evil, “them” and “us”. A sliver of genius. PTTom Stoppard sometimes gets accused of being all head and no heart – but this play proves otherwise. Yes, it’s a mind-achingly clever look at both science and art, pitting the rational against the romantic, while giving you mini lessons in chaos theory, the second law of thermodynamics and the life and shaggings of Lord Byron. But there’s a love story and a tragedy here, that in a well-calibrated production can be very moving. Two stories, set in the same country house, in 1809 and the present day, intersect and eventually overlap beautifully. The mathematic theorising forecasts hope as well as disaster for the universe, and the story offers the same for its characters.

Two consecutive quarters of contraction are typically defined as a recession.The contraction between April and June was mostly driven by sinking demand from abroad, the Bundesbank said. Exports “were down substantially”, it noted, as pre-Brexit preparations ahead of the UK’s initial exit date at the end of March prompted companies to build up stocks in the first quarter.“As things currently stand, it is unclear whether exports and, by extension, industry will regain their footing before the domestic economy becomes more severely affected,” the Bundesbank said.Appetite for German cars and other goods has also waned in China as growth in the world’s second-largest economy is cooling, partly due to the year-long trade war with the US.Up until a week ago, economists surveyed by Bloomberg were predicting\u0026nbspthat Germany’s economy will grow by 0.2 per cent in the current quarter.But since then big-name institutions including Deutsche Bank have lowered their expectations. The concern for many analysts is that continuing global trade tensions will prolong the downturn in German manufacturing and eventually feed through to the still-strong services sector.The central bank’s forecast follows weeks of disappointing economic data and news of meagre earnings at German companies. The government has signalled that it might be willing to step up spending should the downturn worsen.The European Central Bank is also considering providing extra monetary stimulus to the wider euro zone.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But their 2006 debut – the defiantly titled Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not – is arguably the most generation-defining, by a band experiencing the kind of hype that hadn’t been seen since Oasis with Definitely Maybe. Alex Turner’s sardonic and keenly observational lyrics on songs like “Fake Tales of San Francisco” and “When the Sun Goes Down” had fans clamouring to get into their early shows. It was an early example of the power the internet would hold over the music industry – propelling them from an unknown indie band on MySpace to the top of the charts in the space of six months.Please Please Me has a rhythm to it like little else released by The Beatles. Songs like “Twist and Shout” and “I Saw Her Standing There” have an energy that reflects the youthful vim of the band themselves, who were raring to go following the number one single from which the album takes its name. Their harmonies are thrilling to hear, and this is arguably the best album for capturing the band’s raw power.335 33) Yeah Yeah Yeahs – Fever to Tell (2003)In 2003, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs stuck a middle finger up to the naysayers who scoffed that they were little more than a bunch of posers. Their debut album Fever to Tell is a bristling record loaded with New York snark supplied by Karen O’s impressive vocal turns. Nick Zinner keeps the urgency going with roaring guitar licks while Brian Chase offers earth-shaking percussion on the likes of “Date With the Night” and “Y Control”. More than trendsetters – the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were the brains behind the smartest album of that year.Kanye West called it “white crunk music”. The band themselves called it “music for girls to dance to”. And songs such as “This Fire” certainly livened things up their irresistible hooks and disco energy, as frontman Alex Kapranos turned the male gaze on its head with lyrics like “I can feel your lips undress my eyes”. Fifteeen years later and “Take Me Out” still makes you swing your hips.Blur versus Oasis is a battle music fans will be waging for decades to come, but when it comes to debut albums, Oasis emerge as top dogs. Definitely Maybe was exciting, aggressive and loaded with attitude: a 22-year-old Liam Gallagher spits and snarls over the reverb-soaked guitars of “Cigarettes \u0026amp Alcohol”, and soars on that falsetto for “Live Forever”. Among the “too cool for school” alt-rockers who spurned the glitz and glamour of fame, Oasis asserted themselves as the definitive rock and roll stars.Stefani Germanotta’s debut album The Fame brought maximalist pop back to the forefront of the late-Noughties music scene, in an industry that was desperately lacking in pop as. Lady Gaga already sounded famous and she acted famous – but that doesn’t mean her music couldn’t stand on its own. Songs like “Beautiful, Dirty, Rich” and “Just Dance” seemed to convey Gaga’s love of fame and hedonism while remaining supremely self-aware of its superficiality. To top it off, it was masterfully produced and resplendent with slick, catchy dancepop and Eurodisco influences.Kendrick Lamar subtitled his debut record “A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar”, and indeed it feels as though you’re watching the movie of his early life – such is the autobiographical nature of this record. He raps in low, furtive tones, interrupted by voicemails from his family (his mother asks him pleadingly to return her car) that reinforce the familial themes. It is family, and faith, that keep Lamar on the outskirts of a world of violence and sin. Even this early on his career you hear the virtuosity and acute understanding of rhythm – Good kid, m.A.A.d City now stands as a classic album from a rapper who chooses the power of storytelling over a cheap punchline.Not every great debut album is defined by whether the artist has landed on their “sound” by the first track. Led Zeppelin were still figuring things out when they released their self-titled debut, yet it is essential because it laid the groundwork for what they would go onto achieve the following decade. “We were learning what got us off most and what got people off most,” Robert Plant said. You had the blues and folk notes on “Babe I’m Gonna Leave You”, and the chugging rock of “Communication Breakdown” Plant’s yowling vocals and Jimmy Page’s guitar. It did the trick.935 27) The Jesus and Mary Chain – Psychocandy (1985)“It was the crap coming out of the radio that made us want to be in a band more than anything else,” Jim Reid told Rolling Stone for the 30th anniversary of the Scottish alt-rocker’s debut album Psychocandy. “Because it was like, ‘Why is everything we hear so f***ing awful?’ That was the main driving force: how bad things were.” Psychocandy was certainly like nothing anyone else released at that time. Inspired by the Velvet Underground and The Stooges, the Reid brothers loaded their debut with buzzy guitars and hair-raising levels of feedback on singles like “You Trip Me Up” and “Never Understand”. It paved the way for countless shoegaze and alt-rock bands in the decades that followed.Grace is a masterpiece, and the only album the perfectionist Jeff Buckley was satisfied with before he drowned, aged 30, in a freak accident in Memphis in 1997. Yet had Grace been the only material ever released under his name (live recordings, covers and demos were released posthumously), it would have been enough to prove he was a rare and exceptional talent. His exquisite rendering of Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah”, his melismatic singing on “Grace” and the church-like hush of “Lover, You Should Come Over” – all of this and more carved out a rich legacy that ensures Buckley’s music will never fade.The whipsmart, cynical, outrageous young man on Eminem’s major label debut was a breath of fresh air – or perhaps more of a slap in the face – after a spate of soulful, conscious hip hop records. Of course, the rampant misogyny and homophobia his so-called “character” Slim Shady spat out caused uproar, regardless of how surreal the scenarios to which they were applied were.  Arguably what stands out the most on The Slim Shady LP is the sheer technical skill and lyrical ability that few have been able to match since.Not only did it lay the groundwork for so many punk, rock and heavy metal bands that came after them – but the manic rhythms and raw intensity of their power-chord ballads featured on The Who\u0027s my Generation propelled rock and roll to new heights in 1965.“Saviours of rock and roll!” “The greatest rock band since the Rolling Stones!” You have to pity The Strokes, who released their debut album under the biggest wave of hype imaginable. Yet it’s hard to deny the impact Is This It had on rock music – critics have argued that the Arctic Monkeys and Franz Ferdinand wouldn’t have existed if not for this band. They eschewed pre-programmed beats and autotuned vocals in favour of a gritty post-punk approach, and the result was an album that reinvigorated a floundering music industry, and inspired an entire generation of bands.The idea of a rap album was virtually inconceivable until Run-DMC released their full-length, self-titled debut in 1984. When he inducted them into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Eminem called them “the first movie stars of rap… they are The Beatles”. Busta Rhymes proclaimed: “Run-DMC didn’t change music, they changed everything.” The trio’s aggressive yet stark tracks – like “Sucker MCS” and “Hard Times” – were a dramatic contrast against the R\u0026ampB-driven rap of the time, an approach emulated by the rappers themselves, who spurned outlandish costumes in favour of tracksuits and sneakers. As an anniversary piece in Billboard noted, “they were authentic before authenticity in hip hop was even a thing”.Brian Eno’s experimental synths met Bryan Ferry’s romantic, old-school charm on the debut album from Roxy Music\u0027s bizarre art-glam-rock outfit. There were odes to Humphrey Bogart (“2HB”) and cyber-rock jams (“Ladytron”), and songs decorated with spooky-sounding hooks that wouldn’t sound out of place in The Rocky Horror Show (the character Riff Raff even seemed to take his cues from a balding Brian Eno).Still regarded by many as his greatest album to date, Reasonable Doubt asserted Jay-Z as a master freestyle – perhaps the best of his generation – recorded in a studio he compared to a psychiatrist’s couch. At the heart of the record is a blistering duet with the Notorious BIG, “Brooklyn’s Finest”, which practically heralded the shift of focus back from West Coast hip hop to the East.Rolling Stone\u0027s Lester Bangs described the Black Sabbath as “just like Cream! But worse”, and their debut album as “a shuck – despite the murky song titles and some inane lyrics that sound like Vanilla Fudge paying doggerel tribute to Aleister Crowley, the album has nothing to do with spiritualism, the occult, or anything much except stiff recitations of Cream clichés”. The Village Voice weren’t keen either, with critic Robert Christgau condemning it as “bulls**t necromancy.” Yet this is the album that invented heavy metal. Black Sabbath arrived ready to lure fans over to the dark side with Ozzy Osbourne’s piercing, operatic cry: “My name is Lucifer, please take my hand.” Critics be damned.1835 18) Sex Pistols – Never Mind the Bollocks, Here\u0027s the Sex Pistols (1977)“The album will last. The sleeve may not,” said the adverts for the Sex Pistols’ first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks, having caused nationwide uproar for swearing on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from a number of live venues in England. Yet despite many major retailers refusing to sell it, the album debuted at number one on the UK album charts and is today regarded as one of the most important punk albums in music history.Joe Strummer was a ball of rage and ambition when he and the rest of The Clash laid down the tracks for their debut album. Most of the guitar on this record was provided by Mick Jones, because Strummer didn’t think technical ability was punk enough. Yet their vision burns through on the buzz-saw attack of “Career Opportunities” and “White Riot”, raising a fist against unemployment, racism and the fat cats of industry. 2035 16) Guns N Roses – Appetite for Destruction (1987)Guns N Roses\u0027 Appetite for Destruction was the biggest thing to happen to hard rock since Led Zeppelin IV. Slash’s guitar and Axl Rose’s wild, animal howls contribute to the raw energy on songs like “Paradise City” and marked a dramatic shift away from the commercialised heavy rock that was being played on MTV at the time – proudly championing a gritty form of hedonism instead. “A lot of rock bands are too f***ing wimpy to have any sentiment or emotion,” Rose said. Not this band.Daft Punk\u0027s Homework was originally intended as “just a load of singles”, until Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo realised they had enough quality tracks for a full-length release. Each one opens with a kind of motif upon which multiple textures build and sprawl outwards – sleazy guitar hooks, G-funk whines and glittering synths. It’s the album that alerted the rest of the world to the French house music scene.Sex and poetry go hand in hand, especially if you’re a Jim Morrison fan. While few bands manage to ide critical opinion as much as The Doors, their debut album’s organ-driven rock was as tight as their frontman’s famous leather trousers. They brought theatricality to the Sixties music scene and went onto inspire as broad a range of artists as The Stranglers to Skrillex. The baroque pop stylings and lustful lyrics on “Light My Fire” proved to be a breakthrough, and helped propel them to number two on the US Billboard 200.After making a name for himself on Jay-Z’s The Blueprint as well as by producing hits for Janet Jackson and Ludacris, Kanye West spent four years recording The College Dropout. His background as a producer was obviously beneficial to his own debut, at a time where hip hop sampling was being accused of being too safe. And he subverted many other hip hop clichés, skirting round the dominant “gangsta” persona and instead finding solace in family and the church.2435 12) Pink Floyd – The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967)Pink Floyd’s debut The Piper at the Gates of Dawn stands as a classic of psychedelic rock. Helmed by an unravelling Syd Barrett – ousted a year after the album’s release – it shows the band at their most playful, with several tracks going onto become staples of their live shows. Songs such as “Bike”, meanwhile, proved the band were not averse to a good pop hook along with the acid guitars and hazy production. 2535 11) Lauryn Hill – The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998)Lauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with the immense and groundbreaking record, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around.2635 10) Dizzee Rascal – Boy in Da Corner (2003)It’s staggering to listen back to Boy in Da Corner and remember Dizzee Rascal was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk.2735 9) Beastie Boys – Licensed to Ill (1986)Hip hop’s first number one album was an incendiary, all-guns-blazing record that would send shockwaves around the music industry for years to come. Few artists release something so assertive as this – a statement of intent to middle America that demanded they fight for their right to party. Beastie Boys\u0027 Mike D, Ad-Rock and MCA would move on from the frat boy humour and “good time” attitude of Licensed to Ill, but it is that record that delivered rap against a backdrop of Led Zeppelin and James Brown-inspired guitar licks.2835 8) The Notorious BIG – Ready to Die (1994)The rapper Notorious BIG, born Christopher Wallace, had been taking part in rap battles around Fulton Street, Brooklyn since he was 13 years old, but it was only at the urging of his friends that he quit a lucrative drugs operation and devoted himself to music. Living on a knife’s edge was all Biggie Smalls knew as a kid, when he was “waking up every morning, hustling, cutting school, looking out for my moms, the police, stickup kids just risking my life every day on the street selling drugs”, as he told Rolling Stone back in 1995. The things he witnessed and experienced were poured into Ready to Die – one of the best debut albums in hip hop – delivered in his signature throaty vocals with wit and humour.At less than 30 minutes, Ramones’ debut injects their rage, their disillusionment and their frustration directly into the listener’s veins. It’s a record that spurned the posturing of Seventies rock and stripped all of the artifice away to the bare bones beneath, with songs such as “Beat on the Brat” and “Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue” proving to be as surly as the band themselves. “Our early songs came out of our real feelings of alienation, isolation, frustration – the feelings everybody feels between seventeen and seventy-five,” singer Joey Ramone said. The whole record cost just $6,000 to make.NWA unveiled their cold, menacing sound on debut record Straight Outta Compton that heralded the beginning of gangsta rap and also launched the careers of Dr Dre, Eazy-E and Ice Cube. The latter made it clear they weren’t positioning themselves as people to look up to: “Do I look like a mother***ing role mode?” he demands on “Gangsta Gangsta”. Their track “F*** tha Police” – a protest track against racism and police brutality – led to them receiving a threatening letter from the FBI, which only contributed to their growing fame.Dubbed the Banana Album for its famous Andy Warhol cover art, The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico is proof of what a band can do when they are completely fearless. With Nico – the beautiful German vocalist added to the band at Warhol’s request – you have this exquisite balance of cool femininity and fiery machismo. Sex and hedonism are everywhere on this record, from “Venus in Furs” to “Run Run Run”, but it’s not so much glamour as glam rock – gritty tales of drug addiction and raw desire. Speaking of its initially low sales figures, Brian Eno observed that, nonetheless, “everyone who bought one of those 30,000 copies started a band”. David Bowie called it “the future of music”, and 52 years later, it still feels like it.A virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Jimi Hendrix used Are You Experienced  to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”.  And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his.“Jesus died for somebody’s sins, but not mine,” go the immortal opening words of Patti Smith’s debut album Horses. There’s a heady anticipation as she speaks the lyric in a low, seductive murmur, before switching to a cocky swagger as the electric guitar line kicks in. It was a bold move, to open her debut album with a reinvention of someone else’s song (in this case Van Morrison’s “Gloria”), but Smith was unlike anything the music world had ever seen. She was a poet, who wanted to capture the literary genius of her idol Arthur Rimbaud and channel it via the raw passion of an artist like Jimi Hendrix. “She was like a wildcat, walking out with this jacket slung over her shoulder,” Sonic Youth’s Thurston Moore once recalled of seeing her perform the album live in 1976. “It was life-changing.”How good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densley-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.”Unknown Pleasures is unlike any album that had been created before it – or indeed any album since. It’s mysteriousness makes it as compelling as many great works of literature indeed, our critic Chris Harvey said the spiritual force emanating from the Joy Division\u0027s record\u0027s grooves make it feel “almost Dostoevskyan”. Peter Hook’s basslines veer and thrum wildly beneath Ian Curtis’s dark mutterings that are at once urgent, detached, and strangely sexless. On “She’s Lost Control” it as though you’re hearing the band play from the end of a dark tunnel – the echoes of Curtis\u0027s voice and the ominous rumblings of that bass build and build. By the time you reach those final, shivery notes on “I Remember Nothing”, it doesn’t feel like an overstatement to call this a life-changing record.135 35) Arctic Monkeys – Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not (2006)A new wave of British guitar bands was already being pioneered by the likes of The Libertines, Bloc Party and Franz Ferdinand when the Sheffield-formed Arctic Monkeys arrived on the scene. But their 2006 debut – the defiantly titled Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not – is arguably the most generation-defining, by a band experiencing the kind of hype that hadn’t been seen since Oasis with Definitely Maybe. Alex Turner’s sardonic and keenly observational lyrics on songs like “Fake Tales of San Francisco” and “When the Sun Goes Down” had fans clamouring to get into their early shows. It was an early example of the power the internet would hold over the music industry – propelling them from an unknown indie band on MySpace to the top of the charts in the space of six months.Please Please Me has a rhythm to it like little else released by The Beatles. Songs like “Twist and Shout” and “I Saw Her Standing There” have an energy that reflects the youthful vim of the band themselves, who were raring to go following the number one single from which the album takes its name. Their harmonies are thrilling to hear, and this is arguably the best album for capturing the band’s raw power.335 33) Yeah Yeah Yeahs – Fever to Tell (2003)In 2003, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs stuck a middle finger up to the naysayers who scoffed that they were little more than a bunch of posers. Their debut album Fever to Tell is a bristling record loaded with New York snark supplied by Karen O’s impressive vocal turns. Nick Zinner keeps the urgency going with roaring guitar licks while Brian Chase offers earth-shaking percussion on the likes of “Date With the Night” and “Y Control”. More than trendsetters – the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were the brains behind the smartest album of that year.Kanye West called it “white crunk music”. The band themselves called it “music for girls to dance to”. And songs such as “This Fire” certainly livened things up their irresistible hooks and disco energy, as frontman Alex Kapranos turned the male gaze on its head with lyrics like “I can feel your lips undress my eyes”. Fifteeen years later and “Take Me Out” still makes you swing your hips.Blur versus Oasis is a battle music fans will be waging for decades to come, but when it comes to debut albums, Oasis emerge as top dogs. Definitely Maybe was exciting, aggressive and loaded with attitude: a 22-year-old Liam Gallagher spits and snarls over the reverb-soaked guitars of “Cigarettes \u0026amp Alcohol”, and soars on that falsetto for “Live Forever”. Among the “too cool for school” alt-rockers who spurned the glitz and glamour of fame, Oasis asserted themselves as the definitive rock and roll stars.Stefani Germanotta’s debut album The Fame brought maximalist pop back to the forefront of the late-Noughties music scene, in an industry that was desperately lacking in pop as. Lady Gaga already sounded famous and she acted famous – but that doesn’t mean her music couldn’t stand on its own. Songs like “Beautiful, Dirty, Rich” and “Just Dance” seemed to convey Gaga’s love of fame and hedonism while remaining supremely self-aware of its superficiality. To top it off, it was masterfully produced and resplendent with slick, catchy dancepop and Eurodisco influences.Kendrick Lamar subtitled his debut record “A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar”, and indeed it feels as though you’re watching the movie of his early life – such is the autobiographical nature of this record. He raps in low, furtive tones, interrupted by voicemails from his family (his mother asks him pleadingly to return her car) that reinforce the familial themes. It is family, and faith, that keep Lamar on the outskirts of a world of violence and sin. Even this early on his career you hear the virtuosity and acute understanding of rhythm – Good kid, m.A.A.d City now stands as a classic album from a rapper who chooses the power of storytelling over a cheap punchline.Not every great debut album is defined by whether the artist has landed on their “sound” by the first track. Led Zeppelin were still figuring things out when they released their self-titled debut, yet it is essential because it laid the groundwork for what they would go onto achieve the following decade. “We were learning what got us off most and what got people off most,” Robert Plant said. You had the blues and folk notes on “Babe I’m Gonna Leave You”, and the chugging rock of “Communication Breakdown” Plant’s yowling vocals and Jimmy Page’s guitar. It did the trick.935 27) The Jesus and Mary Chain – Psychocandy (1985)“It was the crap coming out of the radio that made us want to be in a band more than anything else,” Jim Reid told Rolling Stone for the 30th anniversary of the Scottish alt-rocker’s debut album Psychocandy. “Because it was like, ‘Why is everything we hear so f***ing awful?’ That was the main driving force: how bad things were.” Psychocandy was certainly like nothing anyone else released at that time. Inspired by the Velvet Underground and The Stooges, the Reid brothers loaded their debut with buzzy guitars and hair-raising levels of feedback on singles like “You Trip Me Up” and “Never Understand”. It paved the way for countless shoegaze and alt-rock bands in the decades that followed.Grace is a masterpiece, and the only album the perfectionist Jeff Buckley was satisfied with before he drowned, aged 30, in a freak accident in Memphis in 1997. Yet had Grace been the only material ever released under his name (live recordings, covers and demos were released posthumously), it would have been enough to prove he was a rare and exceptional talent. His exquisite rendering of Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah”, his melismatic singing on “Grace” and the church-like hush of “Lover, You Should Come Over” – all of this and more carved out a rich legacy that ensures Buckley’s music will never fade.The whipsmart, cynical, outrageous young man on Eminem’s major label debut was a breath of fresh air – or perhaps more of a slap in the face – after a spate of soulful, conscious hip hop records. Of course, the rampant misogyny and homophobia his so-called “character” Slim Shady spat out caused uproar, regardless of how surreal the scenarios to which they were applied were.  Arguably what stands out the most on The Slim Shady LP is the sheer technical skill and lyrical ability that few have been able to match since.Not only did it lay the groundwork for so many punk, rock and heavy metal bands that came after them – but the manic rhythms and raw intensity of their power-chord ballads featured on The Who\u0027s my Generation propelled rock and roll to new heights in 1965.“Saviours of rock and roll!” “The greatest rock band since the Rolling Stones!” You have to pity The Strokes, who released their debut album under the biggest wave of hype imaginable. Yet it’s hard to deny the impact Is This It had on rock music – critics have argued that the Arctic Monkeys and Franz Ferdinand wouldn’t have existed if not for this band. They eschewed pre-programmed beats and autotuned vocals in favour of a gritty post-punk approach, and the result was an album that reinvigorated a floundering music industry, and inspired an entire generation of bands.The idea of a rap album was virtually inconceivable until Run-DMC released their full-length, self-titled debut in 1984. When he inducted them into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Eminem called them “the first movie stars of rap… they are The Beatles”. Busta Rhymes proclaimed: “Run-DMC didn’t change music, they changed everything.” The trio’s aggressive yet stark tracks – like “Sucker MCS” and “Hard Times” – were a dramatic contrast against the R\u0026ampB-driven rap of the time, an approach emulated by the rappers themselves, who spurned outlandish costumes in favour of tracksuits and sneakers. As an anniversary piece in Billboard noted, “they were authentic before authenticity in hip hop was even a thing”.Brian Eno’s experimental synths met Bryan Ferry’s romantic, old-school charm on the debut album from Roxy Music\u0027s bizarre art-glam-rock outfit. There were odes to Humphrey Bogart (“2HB”) and cyber-rock jams (“Ladytron”), and songs decorated with spooky-sounding hooks that wouldn’t sound out of place in The Rocky Horror Show (the character Riff Raff even seemed to take his cues from a balding Brian Eno).Still regarded by many as his greatest album to date, Reasonable Doubt asserted Jay-Z as a master freestyle – perhaps the best of his generation – recorded in a studio he compared to a psychiatrist’s couch. At the heart of the record is a blistering duet with the Notorious BIG, “Brooklyn’s Finest”, which practically heralded the shift of focus back from West Coast hip hop to the East.Rolling Stone\u0027s Lester Bangs described the Black Sabbath as “just like Cream! But worse”, and their debut album as “a shuck – despite the murky song titles and some inane lyrics that sound like Vanilla Fudge paying doggerel tribute to Aleister Crowley, the album has nothing to do with spiritualism, the occult, or anything much except stiff recitations of Cream clichés”. The Village Voice weren’t keen either, with critic Robert Christgau condemning it as “bulls**t necromancy.” Yet this is the album that invented heavy metal. Black Sabbath arrived ready to lure fans over to the dark side with Ozzy Osbourne’s piercing, operatic cry: “My name is Lucifer, please take my hand.” Critics be damned.1835 18) Sex Pistols – Never Mind the Bollocks, Here\u0027s the Sex Pistols (1977)“The album will last. The sleeve may not,” said the adverts for the Sex Pistols’ first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks, having caused nationwide uproar for swearing on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from a number of live venues in England. Yet despite many major retailers refusing to sell it, the album debuted at number one on the UK album charts and is today regarded as one of the most important punk albums in music history.Joe Strummer was a ball of rage and ambition when he and the rest of The Clash laid down the tracks for their debut album. Most of the guitar on this record was provided by Mick Jones, because Strummer didn’t think technical ability was punk enough. Yet their vision burns through on the buzz-saw attack of “Career Opportunities” and “White Riot”, raising a fist against unemployment, racism and the fat cats of industry. 2035 16) Guns N Roses – Appetite for Destruction (1987)Guns N Roses\u0027 Appetite for Destruction was the biggest thing to happen to hard rock since Led Zeppelin IV. Slash’s guitar and Axl Rose’s wild, animal howls contribute to the raw energy on songs like “Paradise City” and marked a dramatic shift away from the commercialised heavy rock that was being played on MTV at the time – proudly championing a gritty form of hedonism instead. “A lot of rock bands are too f***ing wimpy to have any sentiment or emotion,” Rose said. Not this band.Daft Punk\u0027s Homework was originally intended as “just a load of singles”, until Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo realised they had enough quality tracks for a full-length release. Each one opens with a kind of motif upon which multiple textures build and sprawl outwards – sleazy guitar hooks, G-funk whines and glittering synths. It’s the album that alerted the rest of the world to the French house music scene.Sex and poetry go hand in hand, especially if you’re a Jim Morrison fan. While few bands manage to ide critical opinion as much as The Doors, their debut album’s organ-driven rock was as tight as their frontman’s famous leather trousers. They brought theatricality to the Sixties music scene and went onto inspire as broad a range of artists as The Stranglers to Skrillex. The baroque pop stylings and lustful lyrics on “Light My Fire” proved to be a breakthrough, and helped propel them to number two on the US Billboard 200.After making a name for himself on Jay-Z’s The Blueprint as well as by producing hits for Janet Jackson and Ludacris, Kanye West spent four years recording The College Dropout. His background as a producer was obviously beneficial to his own debut, at a time where hip hop sampling was being accused of being too safe. And he subverted many other hip hop clichés, skirting round the dominant “gangsta” persona and instead finding solace in family and the church.2435 12) Pink Floyd – The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967)Pink Floyd’s debut The Piper at the Gates of Dawn stands as a classic of psychedelic rock. Helmed by an unravelling Syd Barrett – ousted a year after the album’s release – it shows the band at their most playful, with several tracks going onto become staples of their live shows. Songs such as “Bike”, meanwhile, proved the band were not averse to a good pop hook along with the acid guitars and hazy production. 2535 11) Lauryn Hill – The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998)Lauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with the immense and groundbreaking record, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around.2635 10) Dizzee Rascal – Boy in Da Corner (2003)It’s staggering to listen back to Boy in Da Corner and remember Dizzee Rascal was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk.2735 9) Beastie Boys – Licensed to Ill (1986)Hip hop’s first number one album was an incendiary, all-guns-blazing record that would send shockwaves around the music industry for years to come. Few artists release something so assertive as this – a statement of intent to middle America that demanded they fight for their right to party. Beastie Boys\u0027 Mike D, Ad-Rock and MCA would move on from the frat boy humour and “good time” attitude of Licensed to Ill, but it is that record that delivered rap against a backdrop of Led Zeppelin and James Brown-inspired guitar licks.2835 8) The Notorious BIG – Ready to Die (1994)The rapper Notorious BIG, born Christopher Wallace, had been taking part in rap battles around Fulton Street, Brooklyn since he was 13 years old, but it was only at the urging of his friends that he quit a lucrative drugs operation and devoted himself to music. Living on a knife’s edge was all Biggie Smalls knew as a kid, when he was “waking up every morning, hustling, cutting school, looking out for my moms, the police, stickup kids just risking my life every day on the street selling drugs”, as he told Rolling Stone back in 1995. The things he witnessed and experienced were poured into Ready to Die – one of the best debut albums in hip hop – delivered in his signature throaty vocals with wit and humour.At less than 30 minutes, Ramones’ debut injects their rage, their disillusionment and their frustration directly into the listener’s veins. It’s a record that spurned the posturing of Seventies rock and stripped all of the artifice away to the bare bones beneath, with songs such as “Beat on the Brat” and “Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue” proving to be as surly as the band themselves. “Our early songs came out of our real feelings of alienation, isolation, frustration – the feelings everybody feels between seventeen and seventy-five,” singer Joey Ramone said. The whole record cost just $6,000 to make.NWA unveiled their cold, menacing sound on debut record Straight Outta Compton that heralded the beginning of gangsta rap and also launched the careers of Dr Dre, Eazy-E and Ice Cube. The latter made it clear they weren’t positioning themselves as people to look up to: “Do I look like a mother***ing role mode?” he demands on “Gangsta Gangsta”. Their track “F*** tha Police” – a protest track against racism and police brutality – led to them receiving a threatening letter from the FBI, which only contributed to their growing fame.Dubbed the Banana Album for its famous Andy Warhol cover art, The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico is proof of what a band can do when they are completely fearless. With Nico – the beautiful German vocalist added to the band at Warhol’s request – you have this exquisite balance of cool femininity and fiery machismo. Sex and hedonism are everywhere on this record, from “Venus in Furs” to “Run Run Run”, but it’s not so much glamour as glam rock – gritty tales of drug addiction and raw desire. Speaking of its initially low sales figures, Brian Eno observed that, nonetheless, “everyone who bought one of those 30,000 copies started a band”. David Bowie called it “the future of music”, and 52 years later, it still feels like it.A virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Jimi Hendrix used Are You Experienced  to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”.  And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his.“Jesus died for somebody’s sins, but not mine,” go the immortal opening words of Patti Smith’s debut album Horses. There’s a heady anticipation as she speaks the lyric in a low, seductive murmur, before switching to a cocky swagger as the electric guitar line kicks in. It was a bold move, to open her debut album with a reinvention of someone else’s song (in this case Van Morrison’s “Gloria”), but Smith was unlike anything the music world had ever seen. She was a poet, who wanted to capture the literary genius of her idol Arthur Rimbaud and channel it via the raw passion of an artist like Jimi Hendrix. “She was like a wildcat, walking out with this jacket slung over her shoulder,” Sonic Youth’s Thurston Moore once recalled of seeing her perform the album live in 1976. “It was life-changing.”How good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densley-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.”Unknown Pleasures is unlike any album that had been created before it – or indeed any album since. It’s mysteriousness makes it as compelling as many great works of literature indeed, our critic Chris Harvey said the spiritual force emanating from the Joy Division\u0027s record\u0027s grooves make it feel “almost Dostoevskyan”. Peter Hook’s basslines veer and thrum wildly beneath Ian Curtis’s dark mutterings that are at once urgent, detached, and strangely sexless. On “She’s Lost Control” it as though you’re hearing the band play from the end of a dark tunnel – the echoes of Curtis\u0027s voice and the ominous rumblings of that bass build and build. By the time you reach those final, shivery notes on “I Remember Nothing”, it doesn’t feel like an overstatement to call this a life-changing record.Fans are hoping Styles will also address rumours that he is set to take part in a major new film, after reportedly turning down the role of Prince Eric in Disney\u0027s live-action remake of The Little Mermaid.\u0026nbspHe is apparently seeking a new project after receiving acclaim for his role in Christopher Nolan\u0027s box office hit\u0026nbspDunkirk\u0026nbspin 2017.\u0026nbspEarlier this year, the former One Direction star and now-solo artist auditioned for the role of Elvis Presley in Baz Luhrmann\u0027s biopic of the rock and roll singer, but lost the part to US actor Austin Butler.\u0026nbspThe interview will likely also feature discussion of\u0026nbsppotential new music, following the release of Styles\u0027s self-titled, critically praised debut album in 2017.\u0026nbspThe\u0026nbspnext issue of\u0026nbspRolling Stone\u0026nbspis out on 3 September.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

So are\u0026nbspattempts by the Saudis to reheat isions between Sunnis and Shia. Are we right to view the region as a place of sectarian strife, asks Robert Fisk. Or is religious coexistence in the Arab world much stronger than antagonism and violence?Click to followThe IndependentThere are two stories that I and my colleagues have been writing about the Middle East for more than 40 years. Both are wrong.\u0026nbspThe first is that the next war will be about water. Or the lack of it. I started writing about the conflict over H2O when I visited Aleppo and found that the Queiq river – which was supposed to run beneath the fine white stone bridges in the city centre – only reached the outskirts as a two-foot wide stream of sewage.Turkey decided to build dams on the Tigris – and the waters of that great river started to fall in Iraq. The Lebanese claimed that the Israelis were stealing water from the Litani river in southern Lebanon. There were secret pipelines in deep valleys invisible from the air, they said. I trudged with UN soldiers through the actual river, downstream, in these dark ravines. But there were no pipes.And there’s been no war. The second, far more sinister, story we’ve all covered is that the Middle East is a sectarian quagmire in which religion and faith have created an age-old antagonism between Muslims and Christians, between Sunni Muslims and Shia Muslims and between Muslims, Christians and Jews. The region is therefore permanently at war, its people poisoned by sectarian hatreds and doomed to eternal conflict – which we civilised westerners must occasionally step in to sort out.\u0026nbspDidn’t the French and British arrive in Lebanon in 1860 to stop the Druze slaughtering the Christian Maronites? Didn’t the British have to intervene to stop fighting between Muslim and Christian Palestinians and Jewish immigrants in Palestine between 1920 and our humiliating retreat in 1948? Didn’t the Americans and British and French and Italians arrive in Lebanon to end a Christian-Muslim civil war in 1982? Didn’t the Americans have to send their troops to separate Sunni and Shia death squads in 2004 and 2005 and 2006?In our reports – certainly in mine – much emphasis was placed on the suffering of Catholic Maronites in Lebanon, Copts in Egypt and Catholics and other Christian sects in Iraq. They were being slowly driven from the Holy Land, we would write. I recall visiting a clutch of burnt-out Egyptian churches and bombed churches in Iraq. The headlines – for obvious reasons – always used the word “exodus”. And the flight of the Christians – to Europe, America, Australia – was always “of Biblical proportions”.Mahmoud Abbas and Pope Francis in front of the Church of Nativity\u0026nbspin Bethlehem\u0026nbsp(AFPGetty)In the northern Syrian city of Qamishleh, I sat beside a church with a group of Orthodox and Catholic bishops and clergymen in a variety of black hats and red sashes. The Syrian war had been underway for four years. Please, they begged, stop telling Christians to leave the Middle East. We had been attending a Syriac wedding where clerics were bedecked in gold, scarlet and black robes. There were hosts of blazing candles, a multitude of blessings, and much ululating a very definite reminder that Christianity was an Eastern – not a western – religion. But of Qamishleh’s 8,000 Christian souls, only 5,000 remained. Isis\u0026nbsphad seen to that. Most of the Christians were Assyrians, the descendants of the 1915 Assyrian genocide, which accompanied the far larger holocaust of a million and a half Armenian Christians at the hands of the Ottoman Turks.The clerics in Qamishleh – part of it still held by the Syrian regime, the rest by the Kurds – believed that their latest “exodus”\u0026nbsp(there I go again) only began after the 2003 Anglo-American invasion of Iraq whose architects, as we all know, were born-again Christians. One of the priests spoke loudly and with considerable anger. “This loss of Christians is a very negative thing,” he said.Among the priests was a certain Father Gabriel, tired and sick since he fled his Syriac church in Deir ez-Zour in July 2012. “Nusra totally destroyed our church there and all our houses,” he said. “We thought we would be able to return in about 15\u0026nbspdays”. Which is, I noted at the time, what the Palestinians – Christians as well as Muslims – thought when they fled their homes in 1948. “The west is not receiving us because theirs are Christian countries. They are secular countries. In a couple of generations, the Syriacs in the European countries will have disappeared.”The west is not receiving us because theirs are Christian countries. They are secular countries. In a couple of generations, the\u0026nbspSyriacs\u0026nbspin the European countries will have disappearedFather Saliba recalled how Isis\u0026nbsphad captured the northern Iraqi city of Mosul, burnt\u0026nbspits churches and libraries and established its “Islamic State”. “France said: ‘We will take the Christians in’, but we believe we should live here…. Now Isis\u0026nbsptries to destroy us so we will have no place in this country. We knew early on that this was an existential challenge to our presence in the Middle East.”\u0026nbspBut, I thought at the time, hasn’t the presence of Christians in the Arab world always be an “existential challenge”? I recalled how in Lebanon, I had once been taken on a scholarly tour of the tiny Maronite Christian parishes high above the Mediterranean, squat humps of churches in the hills north of Beirut, the sun white on their stones, sometimes built over Roman temples, much as Muslims would later construct their mosques within or around Christian churches. In many cases, the eyes of the saints and holy men of Christianity on the ancient church frescoes had been gouged out and local Maronite villagers told us that this was the work of the Muslim invaders of the eighth century.\u0026nbspBehnam and Mart Sarah Syriac Catholic Church, which was damaged and defaced during its occupation by Isis (AFPGetty)Untrue, said the experts. Many monasteries converted to Islam and the monks themselves cut the eyes from their own Biblical heroes in order to conform to the Muslim world’s refusal to countenance the portrayal of a human face in a place of worship. French academic Christian Decobert believed that when the Arabs arrived in Egypt, the Near East and in North Africa, all the countries were Christian. “Half of the Persians were Christian ... Under the Byzantines, there was a man of religion who had power and very frequently he was in charge of the collection of taxes,” Decobert said.When the Arabs began to settle in their newly conquered lands, they decided to create an administration. And of course – this is my own interpretation – they needed tax collectors. “Some monasteries disappeared,” Decobert said. “Some survived. Some converted to Islam – this was nothing to do with faith, it was about the cultural system. And the first people who converted to Islam were the monks. So the heads of the monasteries became key people in the Islamic system. There was no distinction between religious and economic life.”Kamal Salibi, one of the finest of Lebanon’s modern historians – a Protestant and an old friend, he died almost eight years ago – wrote a short but revealing book called A House of Many Mansions, which will still be read a 100 years from now for its historical revelation and its wisdom. He insisted that the Maronites did not come to Lebanon as a persecuted people from the Orontes valley, as they claimed, and that they had in fact begun their life as heretics. As the years passed, Salibi, a professor at the American University of Beirut, became even more sensitive to what he called the “Muslim predicament”\u0026nbspin the Middle East.And it is indeed strange that although they remain a profound minority in the region, the Christians of the Arab world should have become not just a sounding board for Islam, but a minority fine tuner on the instrument of coexistence between two great religions, more often than not in harmony but with a distressing habit of producing discord – to the delight of religious extremists and, alas, of politicians and journalists.Writing my new book on the Middle East, scheduled to be published next year, I intended to devote my chapter on religion to Muslims and Islam. But it was instructive for me to discover, as I worked on the chapter, that it was turning out to be, primarily, about Christians. Perhaps I can give readers a hint as to why this is the case by quoting directly from my text. Needless to say, blood and pain and betrayal crowd the many pages before and after the chapter on religion.Aphrem II, at the heavily damaged church of St\u0026nbspMary in Syria’s eastern city of Deir Ezzor\u0026nbsp(AFPGetty)Yet in modern times, Salibi asked, “what traditional civilisation could continue to stand on its feet once the west Europeans – partly as a result of their special genius, partly as a result of their geographical location, partly as a result of their guts and their luck – found a way of going around Africa, crossing the Atlantic and reaching the Americas, tapping wealth beyond the dreams of avarice all over the world ... reducing the whole world to relative poverty and to increasing poverty. Well, from that moment on, the Muslim world and other legitimate civilisations ... could no longer stand in the face of the west. And this is the situation which continues to the present day.”Over Salibi’s lecture to me, needless to say, there hung the canopy of a very dark history the 1860 mutual slaughter of Christians and Druze in Lebanon which the Ottomans were powerless – or unwilling – to control. Muslims descended on the Christians of Damascus in an even worse blood-letting – the “largest single massacre of Christians in the Arab world”, as one historian was to call it – which was suppressed with extreme brutality by the Ottoman Turks. We shall return to this later.\u0026nbspYou have the last Sultans, all of them being pianists and playing Mozart and trying to paint and reading western booksThis did not involve any intention of “converting”\u0026nbsp– in itself a word which has become a cliché and thus obsolescent – but out of what humanist scholar Tarif Khalidi would refer to as “a particular Muslim fascination with Jesus…” Khalidi – still gloriously alive – once spoke to me “of another age and another narrative when Christianity and Islam were more open to each other”, a period when the traditional images of Jesus in Islamic art were like “a love affair between Islam and Jesus”.Once described as “the foremost Islamic scholar of our time” by Edward Said, Khalidi – a Palestinian Muslim whose mother was a prominent Lebanese feminist – is the latest translator (into English) of the Quran. But he is also the author of a wonderful book of Muslim stories about Jesus, a body of literature which he calls the “Muslim gospel”. In Islam, of course, Jesus is greatly revered as a prophet, although his inity is rejected.Created with Sketch.Scars on Middle East landscape bear witness to past peace failures Show all 16Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A Syrian tank lies turned over in the Hermon Stream in the Banias Nature Reserve on the western edge of the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.

The building is a scar in the landscape as it stands deserted following the 1967 Middle East war when Israel captured the area from the JordaniansThe battle for the soul of Islam between Sunnis and Shias – today, between the Sunni autocrats of the Gulf and the four-decade old Shia\u0026nbspIslamic Republic of Iran and its unfortunate allies – has been a sad and wearying feature of this great, wondrous, often misunderstood, misinterpreted and sometimes, for a Christian, deeply confusing faith. If the seventh century martyrdom of Hussein and Ali are a passion play of betrayal and blood whose pain may be framed at Kerbala and Kufa as well as the betrayed and bloodied man on the hill at Golgotha, then perhaps this calvary unites Christians and Shia\u0026nbsprather than Christians and Sunnis. Our attempt to understand the isions within Islam fascinated our Christian ancestors. The 17th century cleric George Abbot, later Archbishop of Canterbury, compared the differences between Sunni and Shia to those between “Papistes and Protestant”.Western ignorance was heightened by just the kind of Catholic-Protestant parallel which Archbishop Abbot drew. For the difference between the two sects is theological, not doctrinal. Sunnis stress the unity of the community, Shia\u0026nbspthe integrity of government. This is echoed in the Iranian-Saudi polemic today: “you are splitting the community’’ versus “you are an unjust government’’. Thus when Churchill created the Iraqi state with a Sunni king from Arabia but with a largely Shiite population, a real ‘line in the sand’ had been drawn long before George Bush senior used that phrase as he sent American troops into Iraq for the first time in 1990.Hamas and Israel in 2014 (AFPGetty)At a time when the world – or at least its media and pseudo-opinion makers – would have us believe that the Middle East is now breaking apart as a result of\u0026nbspinter-religious hatred and warfare, it will be all the more necessary to read the work of Ussama Makdisi – a brilliant professor of history at Rice University in the US and, interestingly, Edward Said’s nephew – when his extraordinary and deeply penetrating study of ecumenism and the modern Arab world is published this autumn.\u0026nbspLike all great histories, the very first words of his text give us his theme. “Every history of sectarianism,” he writes, “is also a history of coexistence.” Makdisi happily concentrates on the northern and eastern part of the Middle East (the ‘mashriq’ in Arabic) – Lebanon, Syria, the occupied Palestinian territories, Israel, Jordan, Egypt and Iraq – rather than all the territory of the former Ottoman empire. This avoids any analysis of the most egregious Middle Eastern but non-Arab sectarian massacre of modern times: the genocide of a million and a half Christian Armenians by Muslim Turks (and Muslim Kurds) in 1915 and the succeeding years, along with the aforesaid Syriac Christians.But the story of Arab coexistence, in the last years of the Ottoman empire and the century after its collapse, provides Makdisi with an opportunity to examine the Middle East’s common share in a global 19th-century revolution. This “revolution”, in Makdisi’s words – and it’s good to use the word in the non-violent sense – “introduced the profoundly important and historic principle of political equality among citizens, many of whom had been discriminated against or classified as inferior in centuries past.” These included Jews in Europe, blacks in the United States, and non-Muslims in the Ottoman Empire. In Ottoman domains, Makdisi suggests, this development occurred after 1860 when the Christians and Druze mercilessly assaulted each other in Lebanon and Syria.Shia\u0026nbspand Sunni Muslim clerics stand on the rubble of Hezbollah’s al-Manar TV station in Beirut.\u0026nbspHumanist education helped Lebanon recover\u0026nbspfrom its 15-year\u0026nbspwar (AFPGetty)He likes to talk about the “ecumenical frame”, the scaffolding upon which the reconciliation of modern political “solidarities” (political equality, etc) were reconciled, with the reality of religious and ethnic differences in the region – which included a new political order which embraced both the “secularity”\u0026nbspof citizens and (italics: and) the necessity of religiously segregated laws which governed (and still govern) marriage, orce and inheritance.\u0026nbspWhen I read the page proofs of Makdisi’s admirably short book, I was immediately reminded of the comic moment when the late President Elias Hrawi of Lebanon suggested that he would like to introduce civil marriage to his country of freedom and coexistence. Far from applauding this magnificent attempt to bring Lebanon into the modern world, normally argumentative bishops and priests and vicars and otherwise suspicious Sunni and Shia\u0026nbspimams and clerics immediately met in mutual conclaves hitherto unknown in the modern history of the Levant – to jointly denounce Hrawi’s isive, unpatriotic and irreligious suggestion.\u0026nbspIt not only encouraged what we might refer to as inter-faith marriage. Far more disastrously, it meant that the huge income obtained from church and mosque control of orce and problems of inheritance would disappear, and might – horror of horrors – be retained by Christian and Muslim families. My own non-academic journalist’s conviction is that “religious”\u0026nbspwars are not in fact created by ergent forms of faith but by property and money. Who holds the most land and the larger amount of treasure applies, I fear, rather too precisely to almost any “theological”\u0026nbspdispute – whether this takes place in lands of oil, overseas investments or the control of real estate (as in ‘a Protestant parliament for a Protestant people’).Makdisi notes with grim cynicism how the massacre of Christians in 1860 in Mount Lebanon and Damascus is dismissed in Arabic literature, even today, as the “haditha”, the “event”\u0026nbsp– the same word used by most Lebanese for their 1975-90 civil war. More perversely, as Makdidi says, this blood-letting is called “tawshat al-nasara” – the “hubbub of the Christians”. The tragedy of Makdisi’s narrative comes, inevitably, with the Balfour Declaration in favour of a Jewish “homeland”\u0026nbspin Palestine when – these are my words, not Makdidi’s – a sectarian state for Jews was introduced to the Middle East at the moment when Arabs were (hopefully) adhering to a new model of non-sectarian secular life.AFPGetty)“The loss of a multireligious Palestine was a terrible blow that was compounded by the end of Jewish life in most of the Arab world,” Makdisi writes. “The destruction of the idea that one could be simultaneously Arab and Jewish still scars the Arab world.” And – again, these are my words – if Israel’s supporters object to my own reference above to that nation’s “sectarian state” (since it contains hundreds of thousands of Arab Muslims and Christians), Netanyahu’s support of the new law which makes Israel “the nation state of the Jewish people” should silence them all.Talking of words, I have to say that Makdisi’s otherwise flawless thesis is occasionally crippled by his inability to shake off the fraudulent academic jargon which American universities now seem to inject into their scholars. Much of the text of Age of Coexistence\u0026nbspis mercifully free of this language. But I sighed repeatedly when I had to negotiate “historicisin” “empathetic” (for sympathetic), “valorised”, “secularity”, “consociational”, ”coevalness”, “situate” (for place), and our old enemies “posit”\u0026nbspand “space”. These words are the secret scripture of the clique, the little academic verbal and semantic ticks and contrivances designed to keep the elite of academia safe from proles like us. But Makdisi’s work is too important for these irritations to distract us. What he does is to remind us, repeatedly, of the critical declarations of secularism which existed in the history of the Middle East.The tragedy of\u0026nbspMakdisi’s\u0026nbspnarrative comes\u0026nbspwith the Balfour Declaration in favour of a Jewish “homeland” in Palestine when\u0026nbspa sectarian state for Jews was introduced to the Middle East at the moment when Arabs were (hopefully) adhering to a new model of non-sectarian secular lifeWhen the Sharif Hussain was negotiating with Colonel Henry McMahon over the future of the Ottoman Middle East – the all critical correspondence containing Britain’s most outrageous betrayal of the Arabs – he (Hussain) wrote of how “the Muslim is indistinguishable from the Christian, for they are both descendants of one forefather”, while McMahon challenged Hussain’s claim to Syria and what is now Lebanon on the grounds that they were not “purely Arab”. The Christians of the region, in other words, could not be “Arab”\u0026nbspin the eyes of the British.\u0026nbspHussain’s non-sectarian nationalism was all the more instrumental since it almost coincided with the 1919 constitution of Syria when Hussain’s son Faisal briefly ran his “Arab kingdom”, which guaranteed freedom of religious thought and religious practices for “all sects” and promised that each community (Christian, Muslim, Jewish) could administer its own personal status laws and local councils. In the same year, as Makdisi reminds us, the Egyptian Christian Coptic priest Qommus Sergius preached national unity from inside the great Al-Azhar in Cairo, the most venerable Muslim religious institution in Egypt, perhaps in the Arab world.Al-Nuri Mosque in the Old City of Mosul (AFPGetty)This “new”\u0026nbspkind of secular nationalism was bursting forth within the Arab world at the same time as Anatolia was being emptied of its Christian Armenians by the Muslim Turks. Christian Arabs were largely unaffected and untouched by this act of genocide. Turkish reforms, originally secular in character and at first welcomed by the Armenian themselves, turned into sectarian nationalism and, I suspect, were already taking on the aspect of fascism when Ataturk created the Turkish state. Ataturk’s passing was mourned by the Nazi paper Volkisher Beobachter with a black-fringed front page. This heritage, alas, continues in Turkey even today.Few Arabs in the Middle East today dispute the sectarianism which the French, British and later American empires re-injected into the Middle East. The French ripped Lebanon from Syria and set up minorities – especially the Alawites – to control Sunni Muslims in Syria. The British were intent on creating a Jewish “homeland”\u0026nbspin a part of the Ottoman empire which had hitherto been a homeland for Jews, Muslims and Christians. Oddly, Lebanon survived with more freedom than most of its Arab neighbours. The primary task of government, Makdisi points out, was “to harmonise relations between communities, not democratise relations between inidual secular citizens.” To Arab thinkers in Beirut and Damascus, including many Christians, ‘Arabism’ should be defined “not by ethnicity, blood or race ... but by a common culture”.Oman will find itself in troubled waters if it keeps playing two sidesWhat is Britain’s policy on Iran?Lies and buffoonery: Boris Johnson’s fantasy darkens the Middle EastHow Egypt’s army determines the destiny of the entire Middle EastCertainly, Makdisi does not avoid the creation of the Arab dictatorships. “The tragedy of the military nationalists in Iraq, Syria, and Egypt,” he writes, “was that their commitment to revolution was far more energetically manifested in their construction of post-colonial security regimes than it was in building postcolonial democratic secular states.”In other words, while the military men destroyed modern Arab politics, Islamists threatened to destroy modern Arab culture. Mosques and churches could stand in this sparse environment. Political parties and trade unions were smashed. One of the great late 19th century Lebanese intellectuals, Boutros Boustani, a Christian translator of the Bible into Arabic, founded a school for Maronite Christian, Sunni and Shia Muslim children to educate pupils in a non-religious environment. In his self-financed newspaper, he preached that knowledge led to enlightenment which led, in turn, to “the death of fanaticism and the birth of ideals held in common…the fundamental cause of the trouble was the intolerance that is born of ignorance, and that the only way to peace among the sects lay across the untilled field of knowledge.”Or, as we would say today with Blairite repetition: education, education, education. Perhaps that is why Lebanon, the most educated population in the Arab world, recovered from its 15-year civil war in the late 20th century. Humanist education remains the watchword of Tarif Khalidi. It’s a lonely battle in a landscape of generals and autocrats who will use history but never acknowledge its lessons. That is why the Sharif Hussains and the King Faisals and the Salibis and the Boustanis and the Makdisis are so valuable.\u0026nbspThen I am reminded of a walk along a Manhattan pavement during the Iraqi civil war atrocities after the Anglo-American invasion. There on a news-stand was the latest copy of Time magazine, a journal I usually stay away from. But its front cover promised “how to tell the difference” between a Sunni and a Shia. Different ways of praying, different kinds of mosques. I bought it, of course. Heaven spare us all.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

PRESS ASSOCIATION Photo. Picture date: Saturday June 29, 2019Figures from the Gambling Commission estimate that 55,000 children in the UK could have a gambling problem.Fruit machines remain the most common way for children to first encounter gambling but bookmakers and online casinos have come under increasing pressure over the proliferation of adverts for betting, particularly in places where children are likely to see it such as during football matches and on social media.The available evidence indicates that exposure to gambling at a young age increases the risk that a person will become addicted in later life.Twitter has become an important platform for the both traditional and e-sports companies to advertise to potential customers. The study found that the five biggest operators -\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspLadbrokes, bet365, Coral, Betfred​ and Paddy Power - sent an average of 78 tweets per day.Much of this content is designed to be widely attractive, memetic and, most importantly, shareable, the study\u0027s authors wrote.\u0026nbspAs a result, it is very difficult to restrict, or even predict, the audience for a given piece of messaging.Despite the risks of children being exposed, just 0.1 per cent of social media gambling ads were found to contain a warning about the minimum age for placing a bet.The advertising\u0026nbspindustry\u0027s code of conduct states that\u0026nbsp“marketing communications must be obviously identifiable as such” but many of the social media adverts assessed did not do this.Close to three quarters of the gambling adverts appeared to break advertising industry regulation in some way, the researchers said.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

PRESS ASSOCIATION Photo. Picture date: Saturday June 29, 2019Dr Becker told The Independent: “That is, of course not an extremely big difference, but it comes from a data set with thousands of respondents. Hence, while children might not be the biggest driver of life satisfaction and happiness it has on average still a\u0026nbspsignificant influence.”They found that adults who have regular contact with their children are happier than parents who still live with their children or never had them.\u0026nbspDr Becker said: “We build on a lot of pre-existing literature and rather than finding some completely unique\u0026nbspnew result for children, we lend further evidence to the literature suggesting that children correlate with higher happiness under specific circumstances.”Researchers also found that marriage was “consistently positively correlated with wellbeing and lack of depressive symptoms”.The findings show social networks are also an important determinant for well-being and happiness – it is not just about being married or having children but\u0026nbsphaving people to share feelings and thoughts with too.“Taken together, our results suggest that social networks may be important for wellbeing and mental health in old age. Spouses, partners and children are often the basis of long-lasting social networks, which can provide social support to elderly people,” according to the study, published in Plos One.“While results on parenthood might be controversial and depend on the age of the studied population, there is widespread agreement that social support is associated with higher life satisfaction, and that social networks are an important factor for wellbeing.”\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A practice run fell 20mph short of the record, but conditions improved on the day and a tailwind helped.Changing the aerodynamics of the car was a balance, as it decreased the 4x4’s top speed, but reduced wind resistance when the bike was released.Mr Campbell laughed: “Porsche spend millions testing their cars in a wind tunnel and we stick a big Tupperware box on the back of it!”He was so desperate to break the record that he ditched a parachute designed to help him brake quickly before the end of the airfield – because it was causing turbulence.\u0026nbspBut he did wear the latest kangaroo-skin protective suit, which inflates in the event of a crash.His next challenge will be to try to reach 220mph next year on a six-mile track at the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah, USA.He said: “This has been a five-year programme and the record was the culmination of one part of it.“We have been bound by finances and budgeted to do what we can. Our plan is now to go to Bonneville and use a longer test track.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I think Remain is the best option for the country and for my constituents.She denied Labour\u0027s position was chaotic, saying Mr Corbyn would be guided by the party membership\u0026nbspand the shadow cabinet over how to act.Ms Abbott added: I believe Jeremy will do what he has always done which is do what he thinks is best for the country and the Labour movement.Her comments come after Mr McDonnell said he believed that staying in the EU would be the best choice, a sentiment that was swiftly echoed by Ms Thornberry.Ms Abbott and Mr McDonnell are long-standing allies of the Labour leader, and their position will heap pressure on Mr Corbyn to shift his Brexit stance.Meanwhile, the Labour leader has demanded the full publication of no-deal contingency plans after a leaked Whitehall dossier warned of months of shortages, chaos at borders and a possible recession.Speaking as he prepared to meet business leaders in Hertfordshire to discuss the potential impact of no deal, Mr Corbyn said: “The government’s own Operation Yellowhammer dossier makes the chaos and damage that will be caused by Boris Johnson’s no-deal Brexit crystal clear.“If the government wants to be believed that it doesn’t represent the real impact, it must publish its most recent assessments today in full. Boris Johnson’s denials can’t be trusted, and will do nothing to give businesses or consumers any confidence that the dire state of affairs described in these documents aren’t right around the corner.“What we know for sure is that this government is wilfully committed to a policy that the prime minister and the cabinet know will destroy jobs, push up food prices in the shops and open up our NHS to a takeover by US private companies.”Elsewhere, Boris Johnson accused Mr Corbyn of wanting to\u0026nbspargue about Brexit for years.The prime minister wrote on Twitter: Jeremy Corbyn wants to cancel the referendum and argue about Brexit for years.I am committed to leading our country forward and getting Britain out of the EU by October 31.We are ready to work with our friends and partners to get a deal. But if you want a good deal for the UK, you must simultaneously get ready to come out without one.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

has demanded ministers drop “cruel” plans to instantly end the free movement of people in the event of a no-deal Brexit.\u0026nbspIn a scathing letter to the home secretary – seen by The Independent – the London mayor said the proposals would be a “fundamental affront to British values of tolerance and respect”.\u0026nbspMr Khan’s comments come\u0026nbspas Downing Street said free movement for EU citizens “as it currently stands” will end on\u0026nbspthe 31 October Brexit deadline – despite a replacement system not yet up and running.No\u0026nbsp10 said the structure\u0026nbspallowing European Union citizens to freely live and work in the UK would “look different”, with changes including tougher checks to prevent foreign criminals entering the country.In his letter to Priti Patel on Monday, Mr Khan said he was “very concerned” about plans to end free movement on day one of a no-deal Brexit. “I urge you strongly to reconsider,” he said.The London mayor continued: “I fear that such a

enormous contribution to our economic, cultural and civic life.“By putting the rights and freedoms of EU citizens in the UK at risk in such a careless and brutal fashion, these plans would be a fundamental affront to British values of tolerance and respect.“These plans risk providing encouragement and cover for perpetrators of hate crime and discrimination in the UK who may be heartened by the government discriminating against people on the basis of their nationality.”Mr Khan also claimed that to proceed with the plans – despite warnings of “another Windrush”\u0026nbspscandal – could

the UK, said in a statement: “The idea of ending freedom of movement abruptly on October 31 in case of no deal is reckless politics.“It hollows out the prime minister’s unequivocal guarantee to EU citizens he has given only three weeks ago. Ending freedom of movement without putting legal provisions in place for those EU citizens who have not yet successfully applied through the settlement scheme will mean that millions of lawful citizens will have their legal status removed overnight.“We have been calling for the settlement scheme to be a declaratory registration scheme, so all EU citizens who have made the UK their home are automatically granted status, as promised by those in government.”A Home Office spokesperson said: “EU citizens and their families still have until at least December 2020 to apply to the EU settlement scheme, and 1 million people have already been granted status.“Freedom of movement as it currently stands will end on 31 October when the UK leaves the EU, and after Brexit the government will introduce a new, fairer immigration system that prioritises skills and what people can contribute to the UK, rather than where they come from.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Although it was higher than a year ago, the 1.2 per cent annual rise still lagged behind inflation, which is running at 2.1 per cent, according to the latest official data.“There is little doubt that the market continues to face its inevitable challenges,” said Glynis Frew, chief executive of Hunters, an estate agency with over 200 branches across Britain.Official data showed last week that the average price at which homes are sold grew only 0.9 per cent in the year to June, while in London it tumbled by 2.7 per cent. The average British home cost £230,292 in June, down from a peak of £232,000 in August 2018.Buyers have been biding their time as it remains unclear whether the UK will leave the EU with or without a deal. In the latter case, house prices could plunge by almost 6 per cent in 2020 and another 3 per cent in 2021, according to forecasts by the government’s spending watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility.However, the more confident buyers are now abandoning the ‘wait and see’ approach and taking advantage of improved housing affordability as the Brexit deadline nears, Ms Frew said, commenting on Rightmove’s findings.For its latest report, Rightmove measured 130,435 asking prices, covering around 90 per cent of the UK market. The properties were put on sale by estate agents between 7 July to 10 August and advertised on rightmove.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is still not clear why those strange parts of the sky would behave in such an outstanding way.But researchers have now claimed that those spots of energy could be the consequence of conformal cyclic cosmology, a theory that suggests that our universe existed in another form before ours.

That radiation could last from one version of the universe into the next, they claim.Strange flashes are coming from our nearest black hole, scientists sayThose places where the electromagnetic radiation was especially high\u0026nbsp– referred to as Hawking points – could therefore be left over from the previous universe.Those anomalous points would therefore be explained by what is known as CCC theory.

Initially I found the whole thing funny, until I realised how bad it is.The pain and discomfort it has caused is far from funny.I guess Ive formed a kind of anger towards Veet.But Im also shocked that such bad injury can occur from a product readily available.If you deviated slightly from the instructions, you can cause serious damage.A spokesperson for Reckitt Benckiser, which makes Veet, said: We are sorry to hear of the reaction a customer has had to a Veet hair removal cream product and we wish the gentleman a speedy recovery as soon as possible.As the health and safety of our consumers is a top priority for us, we ensure all Veet products meet stringent safety standards.We strongly recommend that customers read and follow all the instructions on the packaging and product labels for safe use.Although its rare,customers experience a reaction to the product we advise they seek advice from a healthcare professional."},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy corbyn speech journalists boo heckled","story":"The Labour boss couldnt hide his smile as activists at a speech interrupted reporters and shouted them down.In a speech in Corby today Mr Corbyn confirmed he WOULD bring a vote of no confidence in Boris Johnson - but admitted that he wasnt entirely surehe could win it.He begged MPs who wanted to stop a No Deal Brexit to join him in bringing Boris down - and got a standing ovation from his devoted supporters.But during the QA session afterwards the press conference descended into chaos as audience members started shouting out and attacking reporters for questioning him.The heckling came as:Today Mr Corbyn was asked whether he would be able to step aside for another caretaker PMhe didnt have the support.But before he could even answer, several people in the audience cried: No!Mr Corbyn smiled and said: Let Andy ask his question.

Politicians don’t get to choose which public votes they respect.Corbyn would wreck the economy, he won’t keep our streets safe and his only answer to Brexit is more delay causing more confusion – showing he’s more interested in playing cynical party political games than respecting the referendum result.Only Boris Johnson and the Conservatives are committed to delivering Brexit by October st, whatever happens, so that we can deliver the change that our country needs and the people voted for.He’s spent his le appealing to the same tiny band, and until the past few years has never been trusted with the slightest genuine responsibility.He’s been able to spout off about everything from the IRA to the Middle East without ever having to actually act on his wrong-headed convictions.And, with Corbyn now Leader of the Opposition, his mindless and dangerous cult brook no dissent. Labour MPs who disagree with him are Tories in disguise.The media daring to ask him questions are “a disgrace”, as one of his barmy army put it yesterday. Voting Conservative makes you just plain evil.The contrast between Magic Grandpa and Boris couldn’t be clearer. While the latter can deliver a good gag, his record also bears the most serious scrutiny. Two terms as Mayor of London. A former Foreign Secretary.The only person around Corbyn with the slightest experience of actual power is his Shadow Chancellor.

who was named the sixth best dressed woman in the world at the time - had at least  lovers including Indian Prime Minister Nehru and singer Leslie Hutch Hutchinson, who she once gted a jewel-encrusted penis sheath.She was said to be sexually obsessed, once being thrusted across a banquet table during a romp with one lover.Lord Mountbatten - who Prince Louis is widely-believed to be named after  - was ‘devastated’ by her infidelity in the early days of their marriage.But realising he had little choice in the matter, he began taking lovers of his own, too.Yesterday, FBI documents from the s revealed shocking claims that Mountbatten - who was murdered by an IRA bomb  years ago this month -  was secretly “a homosexual with a perversion for young boys.”In the documents, the couple are described as “persons of extremely low morals” and many have suggested both were bisexual - a huge taboo at the time.Here, we delve into their controversial marriage.The great-grandson of Queen Victoria, Mountbatten – the uncle of Prince Philip – was born in  at Frogmore House, Windsor as Prince Louis of Battenberg, a title he lost when he and other royals dropped Germanic names during World War I.By the time he met -year-old Edwina Ashley, in , she was a leading light in London society with an inheritance of £millionfrom her grandfather, financier Ernest Cassel, to fund her party lestyle.Their wedding, at St Margaret’s chapel, Westminster, attracted a crowd of , and was attended by many members of the royal family including Queen Mary, Queen Alexandra and the then Prince of Wales – the future Edward VIII.Both were virgins when they wed but Edwina soon revealed her love of sex when she asked to go to Paris on their honeymoon so they could explore “the most awful places we could find”.Louis found sex less appealing, calling it a mixture of psychology and hydraulics.He was so awkward in bed he was said to have named her breasts Mutt and Jeff - naval slang for medals.Louis - affectionately known by his family as Dickie - was often away with the navy and cracks began to show in their marriage after the birth of their first daughter, Patricia, in .Edwina was so jealous of the attention the baby got that she packed her off to a nanny the South Coast and embarked on a series of affairs.She soon surrounded herself with a harem of lovers she referred to as “ginks” – including Lord Molyneux, a rich American polo player called Laddie Sandford and newspaper editor Mike Wardell.Daughter Pamela Hicks later revealed that several admirers were often in tow at the same time, and even had to be kept apart at the family home, Broom House in Park Lane.“When my mother ed from shopping one day she was met with, Mr Larry Gray is in the drawing room, Mr Sandford is in the library, Mr Ted Phillips is in the boudoir, Señor Portago [is] in the anteroom and I don’t know what to do with Mr Molyneux’,” she wrote.Divorce, especially within the Royal family, was frowned upon and Pamela said the fallout was “messy and complex.”“When my father first heard that she had taken a lover, he was devastated,” she said. “But eventually, using their reserves of deep mutual affection, my parents managed to negotiate a way through this crisis and found a modus vivendi .”The pair agreed to a ‘discreet’ open marriage and Pamela said that her father’s “total desire for my mother’s happiness” was what made the marriage work.When her husband was posted to Malta, in the early s, Edwina enjoyed a fling with American golfer Bobby Sweeney.For his part, in , Dickie began to flirt with -year-old Margaret Whigham, the future Duchess Of Argyll – who became notorious for her own sex scandal in , when she was photographed performing a sex act on an unknown man.He finally entered into a long term affair with Yola Letellier, the boyish Frenchwoman who inspired Colettes  novella, Gigi.But the biggest scandal of the couple’s marriage was about to break.Its reported that pair were the “talk of the West End” and the scandal had “shaken society to its very depth”, causing the woman to be “exiled” by royal command.The woman was soon identied as Edwina – who had recently joined her husband in Malta – and the man was wrongly thought to be singer and activist Paul Robeson.After a court case held in secret, the paper finally apologised and offered “genuine and deep regrets”.But many believe Edwina’s real lover was the suave and famously well-endowed West Indian cabaret singer and pianist, Leslie ‘Hutch’ Hutchinson, who was becoming notorious for bedding society women.The bisexual entertainer - who had lost his childhood innocence when his father took him to a brothel at the age of  - had arrived in London in the s after being discovered by Cole Porter.“Edwina interrupted Hutch playing the piano,” he says. “She kissed his neck and led him by the hand behind the closed doors of the dining-room. There was a shriek, and a few minutes later she ed, straightening her clothes.“Hutch seemed elated, and before he ed to the piano, told me that, with one thrust, he had flashed [propelled] her theof the dining-room table.”Lady Mountbatten was said to be so besotted that she showered him with gts, including a jewelled gold cigarette case, a gold ring engraved with her coat of arms, a gold and diamond watch and – outrageously – a Cartier, jewel-encrusted penis sheath.One disputed story surrounding the pair was that they were once locked in a sexual position when Edwina suffered from vaginismus - a condition that makes the vagina clamp around a penis - and the couple had to be separated at hospital.One night, an inebriated Mountbatten fell into Quaglino’s restaurant and told the bandleader, Van Straten:  “I am lonely and sad and drunk...

You will be beheaded.John Letts says he begged his son to come home, telling him: A father should never live to see his son buried.He went on to accuse him of being a pawn ... helping spread hatred, pain, anger, suffering and violence.Letts was entitled to citizenship through his Canadian father John but was born in the UK and grew up in rural Oxfordshire with HIS organic farmer dad and British mum Sally.Sources said the Canadian government had “gone berserk” at Britain ripping up Letts passport.Office of Public Safety minister Ralph Goodale said: “Terrorism knows no borders, so countries need to keep each other safe.“Canada is disappointed the United Kingdom has taken this action to offload their responsibilities.”It is thought the decision to revoke his citizenship was one of the last actions of Theresa May’s administration."},{"url":null,"title":"jeffrey epstein prince andrew shady pals","story":"The Queen’s silliest son has been friends with Jeffrey Epstein for many years.Andrew even invited the convicted paedophile to Sandringham House, her private home in Norfolk.Grotesque Epstein was convicted of securing a child for prostitution in  and served  months in prison.Last month Epstein was charged again, for sex trafficking of minors, and on August  he killed himself in prison.But Andrew is loyal to his awful friends.He met Epstein even AFTER his  conviction. They were photographed walking in New York’s Central Park after Epstein’s conviction for securing a child for prostitution.Andrew apparently had to reassure the Queen personally he did not have relations with underage girls, though he was photographed with his arm round one of Epstein’s accusers. What a conversation that must have been.“Air-miles Andy” has long been an embarrassment to the Royal Family and the country, the best possible argument for getting rid of the monarchy.He likes to travel by helicopter to events he could just as easily reach by car.He once took a £, helicopter trip from Windsor to West Sussex, which is less than an hour and a half by car. But his profligacy is just the start.His role as a “special trade representative” from  to  cost the public £million including travel and police protection. One trip to America by private jet cost £,.And he wasn’t very good at it. Wikileaks revealed the US ambassador to Kyrgyzstan wrote of Andrew’s diplomacy: “Rude language a la British . . .  turned to the general issue of promoting British economic interests abroad.He railed at British anti-corruption investigators who had the ‘idiocy’ of almost scuttling the al-Yamamahdeal with Saudi Arabia.”Former minister Chris Bryant said of Andrew: “When I was at the Foreign Office, it was very dficult to see in whose interests he was acting.“He doesn’t exactly add lustre to the Royal diadem.”He lives in luxury with his similarly profligate and foolish ex-we Sarah at Royal Lodge in Windsor Great Park, which was renovated at a cost of £million when he moved in.His family are supported by the Queen’s income from the privy purse and the Duchy of Lancaster. In exchange, he performed  royal engagements in .He tried to get his daughters Beatrice and Eugenie full-time royal status — with the money too — but his brother Charles said no.He is attracted to shady dictators and the worst detritus of the international rich.Several times he met the son of former Libyan tyrant Colonel Gaddafi, Sa al-Islam — wanted by the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity.Andrew had to step down from his envoy role in  over his friendship with Ilham Aliyev, the president of Azerbaijan who has been criticised by Amnesty International.Again, Andrew loyally continued to visit his pal.He was also close to Goga Ashkenazi, a Kazahk socialite. So much so, Goga’s ex Timur Kulibayev — who controls much of Kazakhstan’s oil and is now married to the former Kazakh president’s daughter — paid £million for Sunninghill Park , the house Andrew shared with ex-we Sarah Ferguson.That was £million over the asking price.I have visited Sunninghill. It was ugly and peeling. Buying it was the act of a person buying access to the Royal Family.But Andrew doesn’t think about such things. He took Goga racing at Ascot and introduced her to the Queen.He is profligate, entitled and foolish. He has lived too long in a fetid world of the shady super-rich.What did he think would happen  He has the entitlement of a Royal but none of the responsibility.With vile Epstein now dead, Andrew issued a statement: “His Royal Highness deplores the exploitation of any human being and the suggestion he would condone, participate in or encourage any such behaviour is abhorrent.”This is an awful piece of PR guff, which implies that HE is the victim. How dare people think such things about him It is not good enough when the issue is child trafficking.Andrew must say what he knew and did not know. People will believe he is stupid. That is a defence of sorts. He must apologise for his poor judgement then go somewhere very quiet.I am not a monarchist. But being Duke of York and a Knight of the Order of the Garter should mean something.If Andrew were heir to the throne, the monarchy would fall over this.

Central to this is the ongoing downturn in industry.”Exports “were down substantially”, the bank noted, as pre-Brexit preparations ahead of the UK’s initial exit date at the end of March  led to companies building up stocks in the first quarter.Bundesbank added: As things currently stand, it is unclear whether exports and, by extension, industry will regain their footing before the domestic economy becomes more severely affected.”Although economists have not yet predicting a Europe-wide recession, they have voiced fears that the European Union will not thrive while its power economy is struggling.Germany accounts for more than a quarter of the EUs output, with its  million people.Many of the blocs countries count Germany as their number one trading partner.This includes France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Slovakia, Sweden and Italy.Katharina Utermöhl, senior economist at the German insurer Allianz, told the New York Times: If the largest member state is affected, this will also start to weigh on the euro area as a whole because of the close economic relations.”She added that, should Europe suffer more blows such as a no-deal Brexit, the risk of a recession is rather high.It comes ahead of Boris Johnsons crunch talks with Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron in Paris this week.The PM believes Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel will cave and broker a new Brexit deal.This is despite Brussels chiefs saying repeatedly they will not reopen talks over a fresh deal.Speaking during a visit to a hospital in Cornwall yesterday, Boris told Sky News: We will be ready to come out on Oct.  - deal or no deal.“Of course, our friends and partners on the other side of the Channel are showing a little bit of reluctance to change their position - thats fine - I am confident that they will.I hope that they will compromise - they have seen that the UK parliament has three times rejected the Withdrawal Agreement, the backstop just doesnt work, it is not democratic. I hope they will see fit to compromise.The PM has stated that we will be leaving the bloc “do or die” by the Halloween deadline and has won the backing of Brexiteers for his tough stance against Brussels – refusing to meet any EU leaders in person until now.However, Boris has also said that brokering a trade deal with the EU is a top priority.He said: “I want a deal, we are ready to work with our friends and partners to get a deal butyou want a good deal for the UK you must simultaneously get ready to come out without one.”"},{"url":null,"title":"edinburgh festival best joke tourettes charity complains","story":"The Dave Award went to Swedish comedian Olaf Falafel for his joke: “Have you heard about the man who kept shouting broccoli and caullower  He thought he might have florets.”But Suzanne Dobson, chief executive of the UK Tourette’s Action charity, was not laughing and called the joke “rubbish”, claiming it had brought “shame” on TV channel Dave.She said: “Not only is it not funny to poke fun at people with Tourette’s, it’s not even that funny a joke, is it ”Ms Dobson said: “I would ask them to walk in the shoes of somebody with Tourette’s for a day, and then tell methey find it quite so amusing.”She also said the charity had several calls from parents, who said their children with Tourette’s syndrome had been angered and upset by the joke.The charity had been about to launch a campaign to stop Tourette’s being used as a punchline, which Ms Dobson said was “unfortunately about a week too late”.Kate Stone, one of the lists who shortlisted Falafel’s joke for the award, said: “It’s a good one, it’s a pun, everyone kind of recognises it as it’s intended to be a joke and I think that’s one of the things that matters the most for this.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Not for a moment did they envisage having to act on it.The letter was — like almost everything Mr Corbyn has ever said or done — about posturing rather than acting. The Labour leader spent  years as a backbencher before his elevation to being Leader of the Opposition.During those three decades he achieved precisely nothing.Had he not been elected leader, the few people to have been aware of his existence would have known him as a minor fringe MP who hung out with terrorists and racists.The sum total of his contribution to politics as a backbencher was to have proposed  Early Day Motions, the parliamentary equivalent of tweeting.Topics which he considered worth his time included “seal genitalia”, “Disney children’s pyjamas” and an MI proposal to use pigeons as flying bombs.Mr Corbyn’s natural disposition is to tear down, to criticise and to oppose.He could not even bring himself to support his own party when it was in power, voting against the last Labour government  times.There is not a single piece of legislation that owes anything to his contribution.This is the context in which his and Labour’s seemingly incoherent stance on Brexit — one day against another referendum, another day for one one day for Brexit, another day for Remain — must be seen.He is uninterested in the mechanics of a concrete solution. He has no real views on the details of Brexit or even how we get there.For Mr Corbyn, Brexit is a means to an end — which is as a vehicle to power.That is why, for example, he has on  occasions instructed Labour MPs either to abstain or to vote with the Government on Brexit, rather than attempting in any serious way to force the Government to change course, either over the type or Brexit on offer or a second referendum.He wants Brexit.He and his coterie of revolutionary socialists believe that leaving without a deal will be chaotic and that in that chaos Labour will be swept into office.But that, by definition, requires Brexit both to happen and to be chaotic.Most of his party take a dferent view — most are Remainers — so every so often the Corbynites view it as tactically wise to offer the appearance of wanting to work against the Government’s version of Brexit.Hence yesterday’s letter. But it is all meaningless posing. In her speech yesterday rejecting Mr Corbyn’s demand that she support him as PM, Jo Swinson hit the nail on the head.She said: “In my first week as leader of the Liberal Democrats I called on Jeremy Corbyn to table a vote of no confidence in the Government and I asked him to table it before summer recess, because that was the only way to be sure we could hold an election before crashing out on the st of October.”You do not have to share Ms Swinson’s opposition to Brexit to accept that her analysis is spot on.Mr Corbyn refused to table such a vote of no confidence at the end of July. Had he actually wanted to avoid No Deal, he would have done.There was every chance Boris Johnson’s new government would have lost and we would now be in the middle of an election campaign.Whatever the outcome of that election, we would not — as we are now — be spending time analysing the prospects of a so-called government of national unity or looking at cynical letters written by the Labour leader.Mr Corbyn and his allies doubtless think they are being extremely clever, riding two horses at the same time.But his problem is that every time he opens his mouth, the unsuitability for office becomes ever clearer. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It shows a transformation in the approach, that Boris Johnson is willing to leave on a fixed date with no question of extension.“It’s the do-or-die pledge in black and white. It’s not merely symbolic. Once it’s signed that’s it, the UK is leaving.”MPs voted to repeal the European Communities Act of , legislation that brought Britain in the EU, with a majority of  votes in September this year.In doing so they pushed through the European Union Withdrawal Act  - which will be put into effect when Barclay signs the commencement order.This is legislation designed to bring into force the whole or part of an Act of Parliament which may have been previously delayed.Boris Brexit plan is said to have enraged Tory rebels, frustrated because they cant legally stop the order being signed.Tory Remainer Dominic Grieve is set to challenge the order by reversing it retrospectively, Guido Fawkes reports.Meanwhile Sajid Javid is in Berlin today for the UK governments first meetings with Berlin.Finance minister Olaf Sholz tweeted: Good meeting today with my new UK colleague @sajidjavid.

in a hint they wouldnt back him to be PMit came down to it.The letter was the most positive reaction to Mr Corbyns call, which was rejected by all sides of the political spectrum.But Tories reacted with fury at the idea that their own side was talking to the Opposition at all.Iain Duncan Smith told The Sun: It’s contemptible than anyone would talk to an anti Semitic Marxist about possibly forming a government.And he wrote in thetoday that trying to stop Brexit would be the true betrayal.The thought that anyone would listen to this man, who stood on a manesto in  to deliver on the vote to leave the EU while opposed to a second referendum, but who now declares he is in favour of a second referendum, is ludicrous, he wrote.The message to those like Mr Hammond who want to block Brexit and to those who would do deals with Mr Corbyn to block Brexit is this: leaving with no deal isn’t a betrayal of the British people, but trying to stop it is.Mr Corbyns plot to take power as a caretaker PM to delay Brexit again and call a fresh election has been slapped down by most of the opposition MPs - who said they will refuse to work with him.The Liberal Democrats, Greens, SNP and Plaid all agreed they wanted to work together to stop a No Deal Brexit, but poured cold water on his demands to be installed in NoBoris Johnson is brought down.New Lib Dem boss Jo Swinson said this morning that he doesnt command support right across the House of Commons, and he has not been much use, frankly, on the issue of Brexit."},{"url":null,"title":"michael gove says no deal brexit dossier is worst case scenario and leaked by disgruntled former minister","story":"Published by The Sunday Times, the documents warn Britain will be hit with a three-month meltdown at its ports, a hard Irish border and shortages of food and medicine -

and pointed the finger at the anti-democratic EU for pushing the UK towards a No Deal by refusing to negotiate.After more than three years of Brexit dominating EU affairs, the bloc has repeatedly refused to reopen the Withdrawal Agreement which includes an Irish border insurance policy that Johnsons predecessor, Theresa May, agreed in November.Mr Johnson will tell Mrs Merkel and Mr Macron there must be a new Brexit deal when he makes his first trip abroad as PM.Details of the PMs travel plans emerged as Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn reiterated his call for MPs to work together to prevent a no-deal Brexit.Mr Corbyn, who set out his plan to be installed as a caretaker prime minister last week to stop the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal, said his proposal is the most democratic way to prevent a no-deal."},{"url":null,"title":"brits would rather have a no deal brexit than let jeremy corbyn wreak havoc in no10 poll reveals","story":"Nearly half of voters want to leave the bloc without a withdrawal agreementit means the Labour boss stays away from Downing Street.Forty eight per cent of voters want Corbyn away from No but around a third,  per cent, preferred the option of Corbyn as PM and a second referendum being staged.Meanwhile  per cent of voters were unsure either way, a YouGov poll found.The vote also found that almost a quarter of Remain voters would prefer No Dealit meant no Corbyn in No, while  per cent of Labour voters say the same about their own leader.While  per cent of Leave voters would rather a No Deal Brexitit meant no Corbyn -

Primates including marmosets, capuchins, squirrel monkeys and lemurs would no longer be allowed to be kept or traded in the UK. An estimated , primates are being kept as pets in Britain. Experts believe some are owned as designer pets and must-have accessories.Labour believes only a total ban will end animal cruelty – with the move included in the party’s “Animal Welfare Manesto” which will be published later this month.Under its plan, monkeys and other primates currently kept as pets would be allowed to stay with their owners as long as the keepers were registered and agreed to subject themselves to regular inspections.  The clause avoids potentially damaging headlines by ruling out the need for a monkey amnesty or forced euthanasia of primates already kept as pets. Shadow Environment Minister Luke Pollard said: “It is astonishing that it is still entirely legal to keep primates as pets, regardless of how endangered or dangerous the animal is. “Anyone can browse the internet and buy a primate with little or no checks and inspections. “We know that primates are very intelligent, social animals with complex needs that simply cannot be met in a home environment.  “Labour will ban people from keeping pet primates as part of our plans to bring Britain’s animal welfare laws into the st Century.” An RSPCA spokeswoman said: “We don’t believe that primates should be kept as pets because their needs simply cannot be met in a domestic environment. “They are intelligent, sentient and highly social animals with complex needs. “Just like humans, primates can become depressed without adequate stimulation.  “They need a spacious and enriched environment that challenges their intelligent brains and allows for them to behave like primates should, yet we find them kept alone in indoor bird cages in living rooms. “The RSPCA regularly sees primates that have been kept as pets with behaviour problems and very poor health, especially metabolic bone disease , as a result of totally inappropriate care.” In , Greater Manchester was dubbed Britain’s monkey capital after the charity said more monkeys were kept in the area than anywhere . The RSPCA received more calls about primates in distress in Greater Manchester than any other part of Britain, with reports animals were being kept as pets in yards, garages and houses.

And the fact that we’re having this conversation shows that people misunderstand the nature of that document.    I think as he does with many other things, Jeremy Corbyn has misunderstood what this is. Separately, a massive government-funded advertising blitz to inform the public of the risks of No Deal will begin within weeks. The campaign with adverts across the media is expected to cost £million. The briefing said petrol and medical supplies could be disrupted and up to % of lorries using Channel ports may not be ready for French customs checks - with delays lasting formonths. It added , workers who cross daily from Spain to Gibraltar face delays of more than four hours “at least for a few months”.  It said some supplies of fresh food will fall with hundreds of thousands of customers affected by water supplies. It added  foreign boats could be illegally fishing in UK waters after October , risking clashes at sea. And it said the “fragile” care industry could be hit by rising inflation and small operators could collapse within three months. But Mr Cleverly said: “I know that document intimately and it’s based on worst case scenarios.” "},{"url":null,"title":"brit tourist severs artery going","story":"NewsBrit tourist severs artery going down \"extreme\" water slide with ft plungeEXCLUSIVE: Holidaymaker Jade Graves, of Hull, felt an intense dull pain in her lower pelvic area and looked down to see blood running down her legs at the Aqua Paradise Water Park in Nessebar, BulgariaShareCommentsByChris Kitching:,  AUG Updated:,  AUG Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news world-news video water-park-holidaymaker-severed-artery-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA British tourist says one of her arteries was severed in a horror accident on an extreme water slide with a ft, -degree drop.

The mum said she felt an intense dull pain in her lower pelvic area as she hit the pool at the bottom of the slide and was horried when she saw blood streaming down her legs. She claims she became faint and breathless due to severe blood loss, and spent four days in hospital after undergoing a blood transfusion and surgery to repair the damage. Have you suffered a aposholiday from hellapos  Email webnews@mirror.    Ms Graves, from Hull, is now considering legal action against the Aqua Paradise Water Park in Nessebar, Bulgaria - visited by hundreds of Brits every summer - saying she continues to struggle with signicant psychological trauma. She suffered horric injuries when she went down the Space Jam slide on July  last year. She claims she followed the leguardaposs safety instructions and crossed her arms and legs.    Ms Graves told : “I still can’t believe what happened to me on that slide. I was meant to be having a lovely holiday with my family but the whole experience has been traumatising. “As I hit the water, I was in a lot of pain and I lost so much blood that I had to get a transfusion.  Ms Graves said a staff member looked after her as she lost a signicant amount of blood, but she became faint and breathless. It was a complete nightmare and I still get deeply upset about it.  “I am still uncertain as to what happened exactly, because I followed all the rules put to me by the leguard.  After being taken to Le Hospital in Burgas by ambulance, she was stitched up, given a blood transfusion and underwent surgery to repair a severed artery, she said. She claims she suffered profound arterial bleeding leading to haemorrhagic shock and secondary anaemia. Her treatment in Bulgaria was covered by her travel insurance.  Ms Graves said she was forced off work for about five weeks while recovering from her injuries back home in the UK. A week-long stay at the resort can cost more than £, per person in peak season. The Brit has hired the law firm of Irwin Mitchell to investigate the incident. She said: I really hope that the investigations can get to the bottom of it as I don’t want anyone  to have to go through what I have.    “I wish I had never set foot in that water park.” Ms Graves has called for more awareness on the potential dangers of water slides. Cheryl Palmer-Hughes and Tejire Akaunu, the expert international serious injury lawyers at Irwin Mitchell representing Jade, said in a statement: “This is a deeply concerning case where a young woman has sustained horric injuries during what was meant to be a fun and relaxing time. “Unfortunately we see a lot of these cases at this particular time of year, and Jade’s le has been completely turned upside down with her suffering mentally as well as physically.  "},{"url":null,"title":"crying children found filthy home","story":"NewsCrying children found in filthy home covered in rubbish, faeces and broken glassPolice found rubbish piled up to the ceiling, a kne on the floor, and a crying toddler whose nappy was full at the home in Swansea, WalesShareByLata YedroudjJason EvansRobert Dalling:,  AUG Updated:,  AUG NewsBoth parents were sentenced at Swansea Crown Court \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailPolice found two young children living in a filthy house, with filled  rubbish, blocked toilets and with mouldy plates scattered around. Officers only discovered the unsanitary state of the house after neighbours found a crying child knocking at their door after he was locked out of his home in Swansea, Wales, in May. They followed him to his house but heard another child crying inside, and soon alerted the police. Cops arrived at the scene shortly after and witnessed the disastrous living conditions the children had been made to endure. Upon entering the home, they found rubbish piled up so high it was dficult to move around. They also found mouldy plates in the kitchen and a toddler sat in a high-chair whose nappy was full. There were dirty clothes on the floor, a large kne at the top of the stairs and broken glass scattered across the floor in one of the bedrooms. The toilet was blocked and filled with black water, and the wash basin was also out of action.Dog faeces was also lying around, Wales Online reports.   Both parents were in the property and asleep at the time, but didnapost know police had entered until they were roused. The parents, who are from Swansea but who cannot be named to protect the identity of the children, had previously pleaded guilty to child neglect when they were sentenced at Swansea Crown Court. Both are long-term drug addicts, but social services had visited the house a month earlier and had not raised concerns. Sian Cutter, prosecuting, said the conditions in the home came to light in May this year when a boy - who is below school age - knocked on a neighbouraposs door one lunchtime. The boy was said to be crying and in a distressed state saying he could not get back into his house - when asked how long he had been out, the child replied all day.  Miss Cutter said the neighbour took the boy home, and when she heard anther child crying inside the property she called the police. Miss Cutter said the neighbour later told officers she had often see a number of the familyaposs children in the street without shoes, and that the youngsters would sometimes ask her for food and drink, orthey could come inside when it was raining. The mother has six previous convictions for  offences, including for thefts and failing to ensure her children attend school regularly, while the father has six convictions for  offences ncluding thefts, supplying Class A drugs, and burglary. Robin Rouch, representing the childaposs mother, said social services had visited the house a month before the day in question and had not raised any concerns about its state, so the conditions the police found had in all probability not existed for a y period.

Caroline Barnett, , cooks everything from delicious takeaway favourites to lunch box staples. She never buys ready meals or pre-prepared food from the shops and keeps costs down by planning each weekaposs menu meticulously, making her own bread and cakes. Caroline also does special fakeaway dinners which range from scampi in a basket to homemade fish fingers, chip buttyaposs with homemade bread eaten in the local park which she calls chipnics. Sheaposs able to save thousands of pounds each year through her thrty tricks.    The mum-of-eight lives with her husband John, , and children Ellena, , Joshua, , Daniel, , Finlay, , Henry, , Sophia, eight, Florence, six, and Emilia, two, at the family home in Evesham, Worcestershire. Examples of Carolineaposs meals include sausage and egg McMuffins, Nandoaposs-style chicken and cakes- which she makes entirely from scratch using healthy ingredients. The mum saves time on washing up by giving each one of her eight children their own role in tidying up after dinner. Caroline insists that her tight budget doesnapost limit the range of what she can whip up for her family. She uses her creative touch to let the family enjoy fun meals that theyaposll remember - like homemade fish fingers and jars of special, home prepared sweet treats.    She said: Iaposm a mad planner, I plan everything. My motto is: aposFailing to plan is planning to failapos. You have be military when you have a family this big. Iaposm a sergeant major without the shouting, all the children have a role within the house when it comes to washing up. I cook everything from scratch, everything we eat I make myself, I never buy ready meals. I like to know whataposs in our food, the only way to feed a family is to cook from scratch, we all eat the same thing. When you get into the supermarket you get bombarded with stuff you donapost need. I hate waste, I try not to waste anything. If I get to a Friday and my fridge is virtually bare then Iaposm really pleased because then Iaposve shopped well. Caroline and husband John have to transport their clan around in the family minibus and have a strict morning routine to get everyone to school or college on time. She does the weekly shop on a Saturday morning after she sits down and plans the seven days of meals she and her family will be eating. Her typical weekly shop will consist of enough food for seven days worth of breakfasts, lunches and dinners.  Caroline said: Breakfast is usually toast, cereal and fruit and porridge. Mornings can be a bit crazy getting everyone out on time. Lunchtime is mixed, some take packed lunches to school. My husband does the sandwiches and I usually add some cakes or sweet treats Iaposve made myself, I try to avoid crisps. I donapost buy cheap, supermarket alternatives because I know I can save the money by making my own. I make my own bread, cakes and also make my own pizza. The supermum said instead of going to one supermarket, she shops around and is always on the look out for a bargain. She said: I shop around, I start off at Aldi where I get all my staples from such as tinned food, pasta, rice, passata. Weaposll go to Tesco after that for other bits and Iaposll get branded washing powder. I do my planning on a Saturday morning. I plan what weaposll have for the week and then I get out and go straight to the supermarket. If Iaposve seen something that week that I like the look of or want to get the children to try then weaposll add that. We work about £-£ a week. I know what Iaposm going to cook in my head, itaposs all there and I always try to be one step ahead.  The main event of the day is dinner, which Caroline puts extra special thought into. Suppers can range from an elaborate kebab style chicken shawarma to cowboy pie to classic crowd pleasers like spaghetti bolognese. Caroline said: I try and make memories for the children by doing extra things to try and make each meal special. My idea is that theyaposll look back on their childhood and theyaposll say: aposwow, do you remember when mum made thatapos. My main concern for dinner is to make sure itaposs healthy. We have treats of course, le is dull otherwise. I want people to come together around the table and chat about their day. I cook things that anybody could cook, Iaposm a home cook, Iaposm a mum that enjoys cooking. Iaposve got only a set amount of time to get food on the table, usually  minutes. Nothing takes too long.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex were photographed boarding a -seater Cessna  at Nice airport on Saturday, as a scheduled British Airways flight took off behind them. They had arrived on the French Riviera with baby Archie just three days earlier, again on a private plane from Farnborough airfield in Surrey. Last night Sir Elton released a rare statement defending the Royal couple, who stayed at his £m palatial home Castel Mont-Alban during their short break.    The singer, a close friend of Harry’s mother Princess Diana, said: “To maintain a high level of much-needed protection, we provided them with a private jet flight. “To support Prince Harry’s commitment to the environment, we ensured their flight was carbon neutral.” But environmentalists said the decision to fly privately could not be offset by Sir Elton’s donation to the sustainability website Carbon Footprint. Paul Morozzo, Climate Campaigner for Greenpeace UK, said: “An airliner is over ten times as polluting as a modern train, and private jets are ten times more polluting still. “It’s vitally important that all frequent fliers reduce the number of flights they takewe are to confront the climate emergency.” Ken Wharfe, an ex-royal protection officer who guarded Princess Diana, said: “Frankly it’s hypocritical. Harry can’t be preaching about the catastrophic effects of climate change while jetting around the world on a private plane.”    Earlier this month Harry and Meghan chartered their own luxury aircraft for both legs of a six-day trip to Ibiza to celebrate the Duchess’ th birthday. It is not known who paid for that journey. The decision to fly privately means they have generated an estimated seven times the emissions per person compared to passengers on a commercial flight from Nice to Britain. There were more than  commercial flight options for the same route. Harry and Meghan’s trip to France was estimated to have had a carbon footprint of just over three tons and their earlier trip to Ibiza was believed to have had a footprint of more than four tons. The carbon footprint of an average person in the UK is  tons a year. The couple’s decision to use a private jet for their Ibiza trip means the journey would have emitted six times more carbon dioxide per person than a scheduled flight from London to the Spanish island. The flights there and back would have given out . tons of carbon dioxide. There are around  scheduled flights from London and the South East to Ibiza each day.    At least one leg of the journey to the Spanish island is thought to have been booked through NetJets, which has earned the nicknames ‘Hertz For Heirs’ or ‘Uber for billionaires’ because of its services for the mega-rich. NetJets says it has been carbon neutral since  by investing in research to create sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels. Coming so soon after both Harry and Meghan of their climate change concerns, the private flights provoked widespread criticism. In an interview published in the September issue of Vogue with conservationist Jane Goodall, Harry revealed that he and Meghan wanted a “maximum” of two children because of environmental concerns. The issue was guest-edited by the Duchess. She selected climate change activist Greta Thunberg as one of her “forces for change” to be put on the front cover. However -year-old Greta, , travelled to New York from England by boat because she refuses to travel by plane.

Jack Watkin was illegally driving Jo Stringfellowaposs Range Rover Sport when he collided with a bus near his home in Alderley Edge, Cheshire. The bus driver tried to speak to Watkin about the minor shunt, and although the -year-old was not to blame, he refused to give his details and drove off. It later emerged the self-proclaimed aposrich kid of Instagramapos was not insured to drive the £, car.  At Stockport magistrates court, he admitted failing to stop after an accident and having no insurance. Watkin previously made headlines after claiming to own seven lavish sports cars, including two Mercedez-Benz, a Porsche, Rolls Royce and Bentley - which he apparently kept in a huge garage at his home. He claimed his familyaposs wealth meant they were known as the aposBritish Kardashiansapos. In court, the self-employed photographer was ordered to pay £ in costs and surcharges. His driving licence was also endorsed with six penalty points. The crash occurred on December  last year after Watkin went to buy the rail card at Wilmslow railway station. His mother, , denies permitting Watkin to drive the car and will face a trial in November. Watkin was also driving within his two year aposprobation periodapos. Under the New Drivers Act, motorists who have just passed their test are now subject to a probationary period for the first two years. In this probation period, should a new driver reach six or more penalty points, they can have their licence immediately revoked. Prosecutor Miss Eileen Rogers: “There was a minor road traffic collision with a red single decker bus. The driver tried to exchange details but Jack argued with the bus driver refusing to exchange details then left.  “Officers did checks and found the car registered to Jo Stringfellow and further checks showed the vehicle had no insurance. Ms Stringfellow denies permitting the vehicle to be driven with no insurance.” Watkinaposs lawyer Jeremy Spencer said in mitigation: “The vehicle is owned by Miss Stringfellow, she and Mr Watkins father are in a relationship and Mr Watkins lives with her at her address. He accepts that he took the vehicle, owned by her, and he drove a short distance, stupidly not making enquiries about insurance. He actually went to the train station to get a railcard.  “The position is where the cars and the buses get together the bus driver accepts he had slight misjudgement with the space available. It was his fault, however the key issue was there was a legal responsibility to exchange details. He was tracked through the DVLA. Watkin previously boasted that his father paid for him to enjoy £, designer shopping sprees and that he frequently flew off to lavish holiday destinations on his private jet. He was also selected to appear on a TV show called The Majors after he began sharing images of his lestyle complete with the hashtags #richkidsofinstagram and #ridiculouslestyle.  In his  interview to promote his Instagram page, Watkin said: aposaposIaposm used to people being jealous of me – whether theyaposre teenagers or adults. I can handle all the envy.

The warmest August bank holiday Monday on record was in , when a temperature of .C was recorded, although bookmakers Betway think that next week could be hotter. However, forecasters at netweather.tv are more cautious and have predicted highs of C in London on Monday, just below the record. A spokesman for the website predicted warm weather for much of the country over the bank holiday weekend.     They said: There are signs that parts of the UK could see some fine, warm and sunny weather. This looks more likely for England and inland Wales, but the far north-west of England joins Northern Ireland and Scotland with a higher risk of rain, more cloud and temperatures remaining in the high teens  low s. For the rest of England and Wales temperatures could reach into the mid to high twenties.  However, there is still a lot of uncertainty with the weekend forecast. High pressure is trying to build up from the south but low pressures and weather fronts continue to interrupt from the north-west. Betway is offering   odds on the August bank holiday being the hottest on record. Company spokesman Alan Alger told the:The ever-changing nature of the UK’s island climate has left us offering odds on August being the wettest on record one minute, to suddenly betting on bank holiday Monday being the hottest ever. “After a week of low temperatures and showers we’re now looking at a strong chance of Monday breaking the record for being the warmest ever August bank holiday, a record that currently stands at .C – ditch the raincoats and dig out the sun cream!” "},{"url":null,"title":"weird items jeffrey epstein allowed","story":"NewsWeird items Jeffrey Epstein was allowed in jail including womens underwearThe paedophile financier was allowed special privileges while behind bars for soliciting a minor for sex and was even referred to as a clientShareByTom DavidsonSenior Reporter:,  AUG Updated:,  AUG NewsJeffrey Epsteins  month prison sentence for child sex offences was unusual in a lot of ways \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailJeffrey Epstein was afforded special privileges by prison officials while locked up more than  years ago, according to a bombshell new report. The paedophile financier admitted to soliciting a minor for sex as part of a plea deal that saw him sentenced to a -month stretch in a Florida jail. Epsteinaposs deal with prosecutors has come under intense scrutiny for its perceived leniency in recent months. And investigative reporting by the Miami Herald has shown that the millionaire was not just given a short sentence - he was allowed special privileges and referred to as a aposclientapos.    Documents from the Palm Beach County Sherfaposs Office show that Epstein purchased two pairs of small womenaposs underwear at the prison despite the face he was serving a sentence for a sex offence with a minor. He also bought more than  single-serve cups of coffee in just over a year and used nearly two tubes of toothpaste every month. He had an anti-aging book aposFace Exercises That Prevent Premature Agingapos confiscated from him.    In an email on the day he was admitted to the jail, one official said Epstein’s cell door could remain unlocked, and that he was allowed “liberal access” to a television. Records referred to him not as an inmate, but as a “client.” And his work release schedule was seven days a week where he was allowed to spend up to  hours a day outside the jail, including time at home.    Bradley Edwards, an attorney for some of the women who have accused Epstein of sex offenses, previously alleged that the work release schedule allowed Epstein to have sexual encounters with at least one female visitor. A log of who visited him was destroyed. Epsteinaposs plea deal more than  years ago is the subject of an investigation with reports that Epsteinaposs victims were not informed before it was agreed in a violation of Florida law.Epstein killed himself less than two weeks ago while in a New York jail awaiting trial for further sex offences against children. His death is the subject of several investigations in the United States.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 25","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFiona McCuish of Ardrishaig captured the VIC puffer wending its way up the Crinan Canal.Fiona used her camera phone as the vessel passed through West Bank, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 28 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat is it with recruiting #professionals# to Argyll We seem to be a distinctly unattractive prospect, as witnessed by the problems with recruiting a dentist in Lochgilphead.What people fail to appreciate is that they stand to gain so much more than they would lose by coming to Argyll.The scenery is unrivalled the pace of le is civilised we are not that far from the central belt and a sense of community remains.Just turn to our front page story for proof.Disappointment at losing out on council grant funding has turned into joy in Tarbert.But only because the people of the village have such big hearts, as they have demonstrated in the past.The council may argue that this vindicates its decision to refuse funding.

They also make for an excellently contrasting pair.From Mendelssohn’s exuberant opening bars, we are swept through music that is complex yet captivatingly, joyously melodic throughout, while Enescu’s is moody, breathlessly dramatic and, in parts, simply volcanic.Guest directed by Marianne Thorsen, SE will explore the specic charm of seeing a small group of musicians performing live. With fewer instruments, the fabric of the music becomes more tangible, subtle shts in mood may have a new-found presence, and pieces you think you know well might offer surprising new colours when heard live. With fewer musicians on stage, it is easier to follow each inidual path and witness the beautul alchemy of eight artists creating something together.Thorsen is an acclaimed soloist and passionate chamber musician. Former leader of the Nash Ensemble, she regularly performs with Norway’s Trondheim Soloists, one of the founding ensembles of The Bridge network and festival.The first half of the tour, which is called Chamber Notes, will call at Crear Studio, Kilberry, on August , followed by a performance at Mull Theatre, Tobermory, on August  before moving on to Inverness and Dundee.Other Scottish dates, including Edinburgh and Glasgow, are programmed for February .PIC:Marianne Thorsen. no_aMarianne Thorsen"},{"url":null,"title":"kilberry sportive well supported in sunshine","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Kilberry Loop Sportive saw around  cyclists take on a -mile route starting and finishing in Tarbert.All eyes were on the forecast for the non-competitive cycling event on Saturday August .

We do at the moment have a dentist and fully qualied staff and are happy with their work.Rumour has it that the aforementioned dentist and staff will be taking on patients from Mid Argyll Hospital, which I presume they tend to already.But the practice is to lose its local NHS patients, so they will deal solely with patients who require dental treatment from the hospital. I think this situation leaves the NHS patients in limbo.I am sure we would rather that the current dentist and all of her staff be given a chance to voice their opinions on this matter as much and as well as the local populace.Yes, it will be brilliant to have both dentists in the town. There is the possibility that those on the local list who are currently treated well by the dental department at the hospital maybe still seen by the dentist and her staff, but I would like this to be confirmed by the local NHS trust.Brian MacDonald, CrinanSir,Hundreds of people across Scotland have been helped through their exam results by a local group of Skills Development Scotlandcareers advisers.Based across the north of Scotland, the advisers were part of a team taking calls at the SDS Exam Results Helpline from am on results day.The helpline is a vital service, supporting young people and their families at what can be one of the most stressful times of their lives.Expert advice and guidance is available all year round, not just on results day.Our professionally qualied careers advisers are working in every state secondary school in Scotland and from our network of high street centres across the country.In schools, careers services are delivered one-to-one, in classrooms and at school events across all year groups, supporting young people to develop the skills to make informed career decisions throughout their lives.

Earthlight, Luminous and Selene - during .Last week they added to their canon for the curious with four more instantly appealing, yet erse, songs, neatly packed together as The Dopamine Girl EP.Each compelling composition while dferent from the next, encompasses beautul orchestration and haunting harmonies.And while it may take a degree or two to decipher the cryptic cantations, as with the previous EPs, The Dopamine Girl is a press repeat type of listen.Title track Dopamine Girl is, in their words, a short and sweet alternative-pop song... We knew it would last forever, but forever had its day.The Twin Peaks-inspired Love Dilation is as dark as it is atmospheric.But it is perhaps the utterly engrossing simplicity of Imprints that makes it so special. While McAndrew has the harmonic range, Smalls almost monotoned meanderings, accompanied by the backing vocals of Grant Pringle and Cameron Jack, creates the rawest of emotions.Concluding the new EP is the orchestral art-song, A Theory of Everything. Built around a single, beautully menacing chord, which apparently symbolises the background radiation in our universe, the finale discusses the search for discovering a unying theory of everything.To quote Small from Imprints, As you travel through space, you are displaced, imagining time. You exist like a plant, you bloom and you grow, then wither and die. But the one card you play, genetically, is always an ace.

at Barrel Law, near Hawick.In September, plans for an poundm wind farm were rejected by Scottish Borders councillors.The proposal would have seen seven turbines, of up to m in height, erected on land to the north-west of Roberton, near Hawick.The company behind the plans, Germany-based ABO Wind, then submitted an appeal to the Scottish Governmentrsquos planning and environmental appeals ision .As part of that appeal process, the DPEArsquos appointed reporter Elspeth Cook held a hearing at Forman Hall, Roberton.However, the hearing was simply to clary and define legal terms and certain technical standards in order to help inform Ms Cookrsquos decision.For example, one point of contention between Scottish Borders Council and ABO Wind is whether or not the combined appearance of Barrel Law and the existing wind turbines at Langhope Rig will create a lsquolandscape with wind turbinesrsquo or a lsquowind turbine landscapersquo, as per the legally-defined definitions.The councilrsquos position is that a distance of between -km is required in order to maintain the current landscape type in the valley, but ABO Wind suggest the turbines should be less than km apart, as they state that spreading out the two turbine sites would actually make the landscape look more saturated as the wind turbines would effectively cover a larger area.Furthermore, they state that a greater distance between the two developments would push the Barrel Law turbines outside of the topography which makes wind farms viable in this area.Appearing as part of ABO Windrsquos  of representatives, land and development consultant James Welsh told the reporter: ldquoIn our opinion we preserve the distinct identity of the two groups.ldquoThere are examples of wind farms being approved with similar distances between them but still being accepted as being clearly separate wind farms.ldquoTo insist on a greater separation would increase the effect of a cumulative effect between them.Scottish Borders Councilrsquos planning consultant, Dr Guy Wimble, said: ldquoI donrsquot dispute that they are identiable as separate elements, my issue is the effect of the wind farms on the landscape, and recognising that they are two dferent wind farms not one development.ldquoThe proximity of them makes this appear more of a wind farm landscape rather a landscape with wind farms.ldquoWhile I accept that separating the developments would make the wind farms seem more spaced out, by putting them closer yoursquod increase density.John Campbel QC, appearing on behalf of a group of objectors called Barrel Law Action Group, said: ldquoIf you pull the wind farms apart then clearly you increase the area of cumulative effect.ldquoIf you pull them together, yoursquore going to increase the cumulative effect just by sheer numbers, and you lose the ability to discern the two as distinct entities.Melrose and Leaderdale councillor Tom Miers, appearing in his capacity as Scottish Borders Councilrsquos executive member for planning and environment, told the hearing: ldquoIt seems to me that the guidance allows for developments in this area but doesnrsquot necessarily

Despite the great effort, the match ended in a - defeat.Jack McNab played a blinder over the weekend with smashing runs on both days.Coaches commented: #This has been a fantastic opportunity for the team and the Edinburgh Cup set out and proved exactly what we wanted to achieve and that was to sample experienced teams at -a-side.#We learned a lot from the weekend and are chuffed to say the team did the town proud during their first proper transition to the -a-side game where the Us have secured a place in Glasgow and District Youth Football League nd ision.#Fundraising efforts for the trip included Helen Gilchrist running a children#s quiz, a full day#s spinning by squad members in Campbeltown Coop, a successful bag pack in Campbeltown Tesco, a very successful tombola and baking stall at their own festival, generous donations from the Coop  and Laggan Community Council, a sibling of one of the Tarbert players holding a coffee morning in her local nursing home, the Kinloch Bar running ious football cards and a darts charity event along with generous donations from parents and grandparents.The Us appreciate every penny raised to get them to the tournament.Leftover funds went towards a framed photo of the team, by the Edinburgh Cup photographer, for each player plus player of the tournament gts which the coaches decided should be awarded to Jack McNab and Imogen Todd, who displayed some excellent saves throughout the festival, and a small keyring for coaches Rhys Blair, Dougue Renton and Robert Todd.Organisers would also like to thank Mairi MacMillan and Robert Graham for accompanying them on the trip, all the fundraisers, CDJFA for supporting their efforts and also Kintyre Sports Council for the use of the bus.#We wish the Us all the best in their first year of the Glasgow League who secured strip sponsorship from local businesses Donald Mclean contractors and Munch.#Photographs show pictures of the team, yellow T-shirts purchased through fundraising and one in their red strips and one of CDJFA player Jake McEachran who played for Port Glasgow on Saturday."},{"url":null,"title":"competition heats up on stronvaar green","story":"The tournament was well supported by the two local clubs and others from mid-Argyll and beyond and the round robin sections of four matches were keenly contested.The semi-finals featured two triples from CBC, Argyll BC and Vale of Leven BC, and these resulted in a final between Campbeltown’s Steven Dickson, Neil Maguire and Hugh Newlands and Vale’s Colin McIntyre, Grant MacLeod and Robert Scott.A good crowd gathered around the green to watch the match and saw the Vale trio take control with MacLeod the stand-out performer gaining the shots that mattered to give his team a decisive win.President Bobby Dalziel thanked Archie and Tracy for their generous sponsorship of the event and invited them to present the trophy and prizes."},{"url":null,"title":"pupils stay cool to catch late winner","story":"Campbeltown Pupils applied the perfect finish to their pre-season preparations with a hard-fought win over Rhu.Having been regular visitors to the Caledonian League side’s summer tournament, winning the competition in , the one-off match was played in a good spirit, but it was the Pupils who found their ruthless streak to snatch a win in the closing minutes.Rhu, fielding a team with plenty of height and energy, featuring several former youth players from Dumbarton FC # and former teammates of Pupils’ playmaker Donald McCallum # threatened early on.At the other end, though, the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils had first-half chances, with Scott Souden and youngster Calum McKillop both having one-on-one opportunities, but their efforts were stopped by the Rhu keeper.The second half exploded into le on the hour mark as former Sons youth Callum Scott made his mark for Rhu, turning inside his marker to curl a classy left-footed finish beyond stand-in goalkeeper Ellis Robertson.Undeterred, the Pupils searched for an equaliser, and were given the opportunity minutes later when a Rhu handball in the box was penalised by referee Thomas d’Alessandro.John McCallum, playing as sweeper in a back three with Fraser Wylie and Ross Souden, stepped up to send the keeper the wrong way and make it -.However, after a lapse in concentration, the Pupils conceded a second goal, a cleverly guided header from a near-post corner evading Robertson in goal.Then, with the -degree heat and high humidity making the game hard work for both teams, the Feathers-sponsored Pupils rallied to equalise.A sweeping move involving midfield trio Keith Mitchell, Stuart Crossan and Donald McCallum found Scott Souden, who made no mistake when bearing down on goal, lashing a right-foot shot past the Rhu keeper, to the delight of his teammates and the clutch of Campbeltonians making the long journey to spectate.Then, in the dying seconds, after seeing shots blocked at their own end, thanks to some vital interventions from Robertson, the Pupils stole a winner when midfield substitute Finn Scott was teed up by Scott Souden to slot the ball home low beyond the Rhu keeper, ensuring the visitors completed pre-season unbeaten.Pupils manager Campbell Robertson said: ‘The conditions were tough, but the boys played really well, and our shape was good too. We would like to thank Rhu Amateurs for their excellent post-match hospitality.’Meanwhile, the Pupils’ centenary season officially starts tomorrowwhen they host Argyll rivals Lochgilphead Red Star at Kintyre Park, in the SAFL’s aptly named Centenary Cup, with a pm kick-off.And with two more Saturday group matches to follow in August, firstly away to Dunoon and then at home to Tarbert, the Pupils will look to continue their dazzling pre-season form once the competitive action begins.Photograph:"},{"url":null,"title":"simply the best for james","story":"James was + after nine holes and then proceeded to put together an excellent back nine to finish on +.Meanwhile Donald had gone to + n the front nine only to fall back on the inward nine and finished on +.Result: , James Williamson +  ,  Donald Brown +  ,  Bill Brannigan +  ,  Sandy Watson +  , Ken MacMillan +  , Robert Cook  +."},{"url":null,"title":"letter trying to keep everyone happy","story":"We, as the private landowners, have endeavoured throughout the years to make this historical area  as fully accessible to the general public as possible.Our use of introducing a few sheep to graze down the grass over certain months of the year is our preferred method but often, when summer visitors appear, we find the animals get frequently disturbed and distressed with human contact , and very often remove them in busy months to avoid any upset.The larger access gate is frequently left wide open, leading to constant rounding up of the livestock and  posing a danger to the passing road users, with even the odd complaint about our animals ‘deposits’  around the Footprints area coming into the equation too.Changing climate conditions have ensured that bracken and other plant species have increased in volume as every year passes and with worry about the decreasing insect population and visiting dogs perhaps being harmed by ingesting sprayed grass, we have never used any chemical solutions to help keep the undergrowth at bay.Strimming has been used on occasions  but this, too, has produced complaints from the public about the unnecessary removal of wild flowers and plants that provide food for the visiting bird and butterfly population.Sign posts are often needlessly torn down and often used to fuel beach fires and barbecues, with even the old, fragile, stone dyke surrounding the area being constantly clambered over,  rather than using the access gate, causing stones to be dislodged and even the wall being  deliberately dismantled, in order to use the stones to construct fire pits for outdoor cooking.In short, we’ve found there are never any easy answers when it comes to trying to keep everyone happy.Yours,Catherine Barbour,"},{"url":null,"title":"top artist jolomo finds inspiration on his doorstep","story":"The latest exhibition by John Lowrie Morrison, which opens on Saturdayat the Archway Gallery in Lochgilphead, concentrates on paintings of Crinan and Knapdale, landscapes found within a few miles of his Tayvallich home.Although John’s work is now sought out by collectors all over the world, he continues to exhibit every August at his #local# gallery # this will be his th solo exhibition at the Archway.

It is an intimate world, personal and subjective, the world of our thoughts and feelings. Children live in it quite naturally, but as adults we tend to withdraw from it.#I use high-key expressionist colour to express how I feel about the landscape.#I’ve been painting the area around me now for over  years, and the more I paint Knapdale, the more intensely I use light and colour to express my emotions for the landscape.#John worked for  years as an art teacher at Lochgilphead High School, then in art education with Strathclyde Region before leaving work to paint full-time in .His distinctive colourful landscapes quickly made him one of the Scotland’s most successful painters, with celebrities such as Sting, Madonna, Simon Le Bon and Gregor Fisher collecting his work.Wilma Meikle, who owns the Archway Gallery with her husband Iain, said: #We’re delighted that John has supported the gallery for all these years. His exhibition is always the highlight of our year and the new paintings are amazing.#It’s also really nice to have a show which is relevant to this area.

I think for many parents who have childcare challenges,there can be a real sense of relief as the summer holidays end, and to some extent I feel that myself.The pressure to fill six weeks with entertainment and activities, and go on holiday, can be immense, especially on a tight budget. For some children too, the holidays can be a dficult time and school can offer them ato some familiar routine.However, I remember the impending dread I felt when I was a child in the final days of the summer holidays. I hated the back to school adverts on TV as they heralded the end of free days playing on the rocks at the Pans shore, and of loosely defined bedtimes.So I was glad that our youngest daughter Skye was looking forward to school as she enters P. She met friends she hadnrsquot seen in weeks this morning and smiled as she said hello to George the lollipop man.She seemed slightly anxious as she waited in line in a new place, but the friendly manner of her new teacher visibly lted her mood and she went in with a smile, unknowingly tracing my childhood footsteps and those of her big sister.But then as I walked home, I was suddenly overwhelmed with anxieties: money worries, work worries, deadlines, bills etc. It seemed asduring the holiday period I had consciously decided to put such thoughts aside, to just enjoy the family time. Now was the pay back, we had ed to lsquorealityrsquo.But then I suddenly remembered a tale a fellow storyteller had told me many years ago. It just popped into my head and it spoke to me as I wandered back. And the truth in the story was the antidote I needed in that moment. And so I will share it with you in case you may one day find you need it:There was once a weaver who was weighed down with worries. He had so many things to do, so many responsibilities he looked into the future with dread. His worries kept him awake at night, which of course made his worrying worse during the next day. It was a vicious cycle.Then one day, he was sitting at his loom working and his worries got in the way. He couldnrsquot concentrate and he made mistake after mistake. He cursed and this was heard by an auld guidewe who happened to be passing by his window.ldquoFir whit reason dae ye curse at yer loom son, is there nae joy in yer work  she asked.The weaver looked up, feeling ashamed: ldquoIrsquom sair sorry fir ma words. Itrsquos just that as I work I think aboot orsquo ma troubles.The old woman nodded in understanding. She knew about troubles herself.ldquoAye, she said with an understanding nod, ldquotroubles can fair get ye doon.Then she paused and thought for a moment. She could see in the weaverrsquos face that he was riddled with anxieties.ldquoCan I show ye something that will tak ye awa frae yer work fir only a few minutes The weaver was happy to have a break so he left his loom and came outside.ldquoDae ye hae a bucket  asked the guidewe.ldquoA bucket ldquoAye a bucket, tae put some water in, she explained.The weaver fetched his bucket, wondering what the old woman was going to do with it.She took it to the well and filled it with a little water.ldquoNoo son, I dinnae kenthis will be tae heavy fir ye tae hold up.The weaver laughed: ldquoOrsquo course itrsquos no too heavy, fir ye only put a wee drop orsquo water in it.So the woman asked him to prove this by holding up the bucket with arms outstretched. The weaver had strong arms because of his work and held the bucket before him without any effort.ldquoAh, said the guidewe, ldquosae itrsquos nae tae heavy.ldquoIt isnae heavy at arsquo, replied the weaver.The old woman smiled: ldquoIn that case, keep haudin it afore ye like that fir  minutes. He wondered why she was asking him to do this, andshe was just trying to make a fool of him. But he was also intrigued and knew her to be an honest old soul, and so he did as she asked.After a few minutes of holding the bucket in front of him, it began to feel much heavier. After five minutes, his arms began to ache and soon they began to shake. The pain began to spread to his back as he desperately tried to keep the bucket in position.ldquoIs  minutes no over yet  asked the weaver desperately.ldquoIf the bucket is now tae heavy fir ye, put it doon son.He was reluctant to admit that the bucket was now too heavy to hold and so put it down.ldquoThe water got heavier son, didnrsquot it ldquoThe water wasnae heavier, protested the weaver, ldquoye just made me hold the bucket for tae lang.ldquoSae the water did get heavier, no in itself, but for you!The weaver looked confused and the guidewe continued.ldquoWater can get heavierye haud it ower lang afore ye, evenitrsquos just a wee drop. Yer worries are like that water, son. I am sure that they are many but ye mak them much heavierye try tae haud them in yer thochts arsquo the time.She smiled at him: ldquoTry an put the bucket doon as often as ye can,ye ken whit I mean. Dinnae mak it heavier than needs be. When ye need tae, haud it, but no arsquo the time.ldquoIn fact, she added while raising a pointed finger, ldquohauding it arsquo the time gies ye pain and paralyses ye. Yersquoll hae nae ability left tae empty the bucket.And so the old woman wandered off, leaving her words with the weaver. He looked down at the bucket. He lted it again and held it in front of him. It wasnrsquot as heavy now as before, but still had the same amount of water in it. She was right, water can get heavieryou hold it for longer, even though itrsquos the same weight.He chuckled to himself and watched the woman as she waddled down the street.ldquoThank ye! he called out.He ed to his loom. This time he whistled and sang as he worked. He enjoyed his creation and made no mistakes, for he had put his bucket of worries down for a while.Later they would still be there, but they might seem lighter and easier to manage now that they had stopped paralysing him with anxiety.And so that was the story. And as I arrived home, I realised that although I needed to deal with lots of things, I wasnrsquot going to give my worries more weight by holding them constantly in my thoughts.Itrsquos really

years. While the name of these types of promotions seems to imply that players will be on the receiving end of totally free spins, during which anything won can be kept and withdrawn, the truth is often a bit murkier than that.The UK Gambling Commission has played no small role in attempting to clear up the matter. According to them, to use the term ldquofree spins casinos must genuinely offer free games with no strings attached, such as wagering requirements. The old, standard spins are to be referred to as ldquobonus spins instead.When Free Spins Are Not Truly Free SpinsThere are several occasions when free spinsarenrsquot free. Any spins which come with wagering requirements, for instance, breach the concept of being truly free. Wagering requirements, also known as playthrough rates, denote that a player must wager whatever they win a specic number of times before they can withdraw those funds.Wagering requirements are common in deposit bonusesbut shouldnrsquot be included in any offer which proclaims itself to be free.Free Spins With No Wagering RequirementsFortunately, the new regulation issued by the UK Gambling Commission, Swedish Gaming Authority and others are aiming to fix this issue. True free spin deals should come with no hidden terms and no strings attached. They should be offered to players with a genuine chance to win real money for free, money which can ndasha player desires ndash be withdrawn from the start. This doesnrsquot mean to say that there arenrsquot other terms and conditions.Many top free spin bonuses tend to come with dates attached, only being valid during a predetermined period. Moreover, they may only be valid on select slot machines and could be limited to players in a specic region.Only a Handful of Chances to WinThere is a downside to the new ldquofree spins offers at casinos. They generally tend to provide a limited number of spins, far fewer than the old no deposit bonuses with wagering requirements, and deposit offers. Moreover, they are often only valid on slot games which do not offer substantial cash prizes, including many simple - line games from NetEnt and others.Promos Which Are Ideal for Test Driving CasinosSuch free spin bonuses which come with no wagering requirements at all are hardly going to be appealing for players who fancy landing big wins. As mentioned, they tend to be valid on slots which donrsquot offer such epic wins. However, these promos and deals may make the ideal introduction to slot gaming for new players, or those who wish to test-drive a slot before deciding to wager real money on it.The East Lothian Courierencourages readers to gamble responsibly.

The procedure for iding matrimonial property, which is any money and other assets owned jointly or inidually is that it is to be ided fairly, which may not simply mean equally. If the situation has to be resolved in court that can result in a decision that is far from satisfactory to one ndashor both ndashof the partners.ldquoItrsquos important that we advise clients about the fact that Alternative Dispute Resolution is available. These situations emphatically donrsquot involve an inevitable progress to court ndashwhich should be regarded as very much the last resort, he says.In fact, some % or more of cases are now dealt with through negotiation rather than a court order that determines the ision of assets. People who proceed to court, says Ferry almost inevitably have an urgent issue such as suffering from a serious shortage of money or protection issues resulting from circumstances of domestic abuse.The alternative routes principally involve collaboration or mediation. Mediation, involves an independent mediator guiding the parties toward a solution. The mediator does not usually give them legal advice as to their entitlements though in assisted mediation both parties have their solicitors in the background .ldquoThat is an option that sometimes works out well ndash but many people are looking for veriable answers, and this can be achieved through the collaborative approach which I find is generally a better way to resolve disagreements.Ferry, a trained collaborative lawyer, believes this route is best to minimise conflict and secure financial choices ndashwhile also, importantly, ensuring the best future for the children. He explains that collaborative law involves the parties and their advisers in four-way meetings with discussions around the table, in private and without the delay of correspondence and court proceedings. And this, he says helps to avoid subsequent, and potentially costly, misunderstandings.The problem with pensionsPensions, for example, can become very contentious. ldquoIn our experience pensions are frequently overlooked by clients when considering orce settlements. However, the value of the pensions built up during the marriage or civil partnership is taken into account and can be substantial. Our clientsrsquo settlements often involve pension sharing agreements.ldquoHowever, pensions can be extremely complicated ndashnot only in terms of valuing them and iding them but itrsquos also important to get the best advice on which pensions should be shared and which should not. Some have more benefits attached to them than others. For example, there may be spousersquos benefits attached to them which may be very valuable.In addition, he adds, there are ious types of pensions such as Self Invested Personal Pensionswhich can be convoluted when dealing with them in orce cases as sometimes these can involve multiple underlying property and other assets contained in the pension which may need to be valued too.ldquoYou need to take advice not only about its value at the date of separation but also its type of pension and current value. A failure to identy pension interests or to correctly apportion the value of a pension may have dramatic long-term implications for either spouse and there is a strict timescale involved after orce for implementing the pension share.Business assetsFerry says that clients also need advice about business assets and shareholdings, as to what constitutes matrimonial property as these can, inadvertently, be converted into matrimonial property in the course of, for example, restructuring a company that was founded or bought before marriage.ldquoShareholdings that may be worth several millions can be transferred into the joint matrimonial pot and that possibility is not often considered by the accountant or tax advisor involved, he says.These are just a few of the issues to be considered but despite the obvious vexations that separation and orce involve, Ferry believes in confronting them in a positive, proactive way. The Family LawAct of  was well thought out and is quite flexible, providing for the needs of inidual cases, he says.Divorce, he adds, need not end up in long, drawn out court proceedings. ldquoWhether via a pre-nuptial agreement or a collaborative resolution, with good legal advice parties can deal with separation and orce in way that achieves the solution that works best for them both.Noel specialises in all areas of family law but is particularly noted for acting in high value cases for high net worth iniduals, for example, celebrities, sports personalities, entrepreneurs, business owners, directors, professionals and executives.

Unlike the diseases of the pasts, such as tuberculosis, which could be cured with antibiotics, or the scourge of cigarettes which has been signicantly reduced by measures ranging from hefty taxation to the smoking ban, obesity and the damage it causes will be much harder to reverse.So far, no country in the world has achieved a signicant or sustained reduction in its obesity rates.

Figures obtained by the Herald earlier this year showed that the number of bariatric surgeries carried out on NHS Scotland has fallen by a fth - from  in   to  in  .The question is whether changing the food environment can offer an effective alternative.One criticism is that restricting price promotions will disproportionately affect the poorest. It is impossible to separate obesity from deprivation.One in three adults living in Scotlands most deprived communities is obese, compared to one in five in the most affluent postcodes.In its submission to the Scottish Governments consultation, BMA Scotland said: \"Increasing food prices have in some cases led to people choosing cheaper food products that are often less healthy.\"Finding ways to ensure that healthy options are also more affordable than unhealthy alternatives can help to change peoplersquos behaviours.\": Warning over back-to-school spike in asthma attacksOf course, pleasure as well as price influences shoppers and, with the best will in the world, making a six-pack of apples cheaper than a six-pack of chocolate biscuits is unlikely to make the fruit bag more appealing to someone seeking a quick endorphin hit.Nonetheless, there is evidence that a price-based approach can work.Professor Peter Morgan, of Aberdeen Universitys Rowett Institute, pointed to studies showing that subsidising healthy foods can change behaviour.He said: \"These demonstrate that both subsidiesand taxationsignicantly alter dietary consumption of targeted food items and contribute to weight control through restricting calorie intake.\"This work confirms other research which suggests that price reduction policy to reduce the cost of healthy foods is more effective on food choice than price increases .\"He said foods high in sugar and saturated fat should be automatically excluded price promotions.The push to change the food environment through legislation is also a signicant pivot away from the narrative of personal responsibility that has dominated the obesity debate for decades.It is no coincidence that major food and drinks brands from Cadbury to Coca Cola have rushed to sponsor major sporting events.Professor Mike Lean, an expert in human nutrition at Glasgow University, said it was vital that any obesity strategy makes clear that exercise is for health not weight loss.\"It is most important to state clearly that physical activity does not contribute usefully to weight loss, to help people already obese.

However ndash and itrsquos a huge however ndash they all say theyrsquore not quite there yet, and the issue that puts them off independence the most is the aggression and bullying they associate with the Yes movement.When you tell them that online Unionist trolls are just as bad, they simply donrsquot believe you. The experience of Yes supporters may be one of Unionist abuse and bullying, butyoursquore a Unionist your experience will be one of bullying and abuse from nationalists. Thatrsquos how social media bubbles work.The bottom line is that soft No voters, who hold the balance of power in any future referendum, are being deterred from shting their position because of the nastiness of a vocal minority in the Yes movement.Recently, therersquos been a spate of ridiculous and alienating behaviour from some quarters. Jackie Kay, the Makar or national poet, said Scotlandrsquos attitude to race was decades behind England. Kay has a Nigerian father and a Scottish mother. However, with depressing predictability, comments by a woman of colour were written off by white people who wonrsquot accept any criticism of Scotland.These are the people who see reporting facts as ldquorunning down Scotland. Drug deaths go up. Itrsquos running down Scotland. Trains could be better. Itrsquos running down Scotland. News on employment, or productivity, or pay ndash whatever it is,it isnrsquot celebratory itrsquos part of a vast conspiracy against Scotland.Yoursquod be forgiven for wondering: it Scotlandrsquos that perfect, why the push for independence  I want independence as I can see le needs to get better.This fringe wraps itself in the flag. It gets outraged that Union Jacks are on supermarket packaging not Saltires. If they werenrsquot doing such damage to the Yes movement it would be comic.These people are so chippy and thin-skinned, so easily offended, that they are the embodiment of a new type of ldquoScottish cringe ndash their sense of self and their belief in their own country is so fragile anything can threaten it.:Elections watchdog may delay second Scottish independence referendumA few days ago Nicola Sturgeon had to come to the defence of Janice Forsyth when the online Yes fringe turned its ire on the BBC broadcaster. Forsyth tweeted the literary festival Bloody Scotland a joke about Jimmy Krankie. Some independence supporters assumed it was an insult directed at the First Minister. It wasnrsquot.Forsyth was insulted and attacked, as was the BBC. The FM had to put a message out asking people to please leave Forsyth alone.The pro-independence website Wings Over Scotland has floated setting up its own political party. It seems that a signicant minority of Yes supporters see this as a good thing. On social media, the site is known for trolling, abuse and insults.Therersquos a deep confusion and hypocrisy here. The people who support the idea of this new political entity have a long history of viciously attacking anyone who suggested voting for any Yes-supporting party, other than the SNP, at previous Scottish elections. A Green vote was heresy. ldquoBoth votes SNP was their line. Now therersquos a populist alternative in the offing, a form of Scottish nationalism which suits their aggressive tastes, the mantra of ldquoboth votes SNP doesnrsquot matter anymore.The idea that a populist form of nationalism in Scotland will woo much-needed No voters is absurd. The rise of populist nationalism in Scotland will set back every advance so far made.And this takes us to the crux of the problem ndash we now have two competing visions of independence. One comes in the form of politicians like Ms Sturgeon and Patrick Harvie of the Greens. Itrsquos considered, pragmatic, non-threatening it wants to woo opponents. It wants a progressive, fair and equal Scotland, and believes the way to improve the lot of ordinary people is to leave behind the broken Westminster system. The other is Trumpian in nature and thrives on offence rather than persuasion. It wants independence at any cost.To some extent, you could say of the SNP, ldquohell mend them. For years now, the party has allowed this populist fringe to offend and bully. Now the populist fringe is coming for its seats.:Thousands march in support of Scottish independence in Aberdeen with All Under One BannerThe one abiding image of the Yes movement over the last year has been independence marches through towns and cities. The organisation behind the rallies, All Under One Banner, was caught up in internal feuding this summer, which also didnrsquot help the public image of the Yes movement. But more importantly, the marching doesnrsquot help garner new voters. Will waving a Saltire ever persuade a single Unionist to back Scottish independence Genies donrsquot go back into bottles. The only way for the broader Yes movement to protect itself from this growing online wing is to speak up. If people donrsquot speak up then the metastasising populist fringe risks alienating voters who can be wooed and drowning out the voices of the good, decent, majority of independence supporters.Neil Mackay is Scotlandrsquos Columnist of the Year."},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-chocs-away-shop-talk-stakes","story":"SADLY, with chains such as Tesco taking over the corner shop and the introduction of self-service tills, you dont get so many interactions like this, but as a traveller from Aberdeen commented: \"I was in Motherwell, about to get the bus back to Aberdeen.

Now that claim is seemingly dead in the water, the Tories have hit on a new way to boost an economy they seem hell-bent on ruining: raise the state pension age to  and, thanks to the combination of more workers and fewer pensioners, the state will stand to benefit to the tune of poundbn.According to the Centre for Social Justice - a right-wing think-tank chaired by benefits-slasher and one-time Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith - existing policies that will see the state pension age rise from  to  in  and then again to  by  should not only be speeded up, they should be turbo-charged too. Indeed, with the proportion of the population reaching pension age growing far faster than the proportion reaching working - and hence tax-paying - age, the organisation has mooted raising the state pension age to  by  before ramping it up to  just seven years later.At face value it almost seems like a reasonable plan. When the first state pension was introduced over a century ago, it was only ever meant to act as an insurance policy to be cashed in by those unlucky enough to make it into an infirm old age. With just a quarter of the population living long enough to receive it, the cost of providing that version of the pension was relatively small.Due to dramatic increases in le expectancy in the intervening years, though, state pension provision has become a hugely costly business, with the near poundbn the Government pays out to pensioners now expected to balloon to closer to poundbn in little over a decade.As the bill for state pensions is met out of current year taxation, with the taxes paid by todayrsquos workers funding the pensions paid to todayrsquos pensioners, the intergenerational impact of that will be immense raising the pension age is the most obvious way to ameliorate the impact. After all, anything that can reduce the burden on taxpayers while also increasing the pool of workers paying into the system has got to be a good idea, right Well, yes, only there are three glaring problems that show why the plan in its current form should never have seen the light of day. The most obvious issue with forcing swt and dramatic changes to retirement plans is that great swathes of the population are finding it hard enough to work beyond  as it is, never mind keeping on going to  and beyond. Sure, many people are more than capable of continuing to work beyond the official retirement age of , and many do so out of choice. But for those who have spent  years scrubbing floors or laying bricks, fighting fires or digging roads working into later le may not be an option.The state already makes allowances for those in the former group, giving all workers the option to defer taking their state pension infor enhanced payments when they do decide to draw it. Those in the latter group have no such luxury, though, with no systems in place to enable those who cannot keep working to take their pension early at a suitably reduced rate. The implication for them is clear:the pension age is raised further many people will face the stark option of either continuing in a physically demanding job they are physically unfit to do or potentially falling into poverty.The risk of the latter is all too real, with a study from Professor Bernhard Ebbinghaus of the University of Oxford finding that the proportion of over-s living in severe poverty in the UK is already five times what it was in , with our state pension provision largely to blame.The UK is, Professor Ebbinghaus said, ldquoa good example of the Beveridge-lite systems that have historically failed to combat old-age poverty because they ldquohave rather ungenerous basic pensions with means-tested supplements which ldquoreproduce relatively high severe poverty rates among the elderly. Low though the state pension may be, putting it further out of that age-grouprsquos reach is hardly likely to help solve the problem.Then therersquos the question of le expectancy. While it is true that part of the dficulty in accounting for the state pension is that people now typically live for  years or more in retirement, in some parts of the country - and Scotland in particular - that is not the case. And while Scottish males being born today are expected to make it to  and females to , there is no expectation that anyone born between  and  - the first cohort that would be impacted by the mooted pension-age rises - will make it to .That is the crux of why the proposal cannot be allowed to fly. Yes, itrsquos a fallacy that each of us has a pension pot sitting at Westminster with our name on it - and, no, none of us has a right to be supported in retirement by the state - but it would be a cynical government indeed that would expect its citizens to pay the pensions of older generations without any hope of ever getting one of their own. It would be an egregious breach of the social contract and no exaggeration.The Centre for Social Justice has its own spin on the age-rise proposal, with its chief executive Andy Cook saying that by finding ways to help older people stay in work the Government would be doing its bit to improve their health and wellbeing. But as those who want to do that already have the means of doing so, the proposal smacks more of finding ways for a Government staring financial ruin in the face to cut its own costbase.Sure the state pension is expensive, and sure it makes sense to find ways of limiting the extent to which that cost will grow. But doing that in isolation, without also finding ways of growing the pot used to meet that cost, makes no sense at all.Then again, with immigration, that becircte noire of any self-respecting Brexiteer, being the most effective way of increasing the working-age, tax-paying population, is it any wonder the Centre for Social Justice has had to be so extreme "},{"url":null,"title":"letters-need-true-unity-not-vanity-project","story":"Given that we are in a national emergency where normal arrangements do not hold, it is not sufficient to argue, as Mr Corbyn does, that he, on the basis of ldquothe normal constitutional processes, should be interim PM. If he is honest with himself about how he is widely perceived, then he must accept,he genuinely has the nationrsquos interests at heart, that he is not the right person to lead this cross-party coalition.In any case it is desirable that the leader of a government of national unity should not be the leader of any of the main parties, all of whom have particular axes to grind, but should instead be an experienced back-bench parliamentarian who can be impartial, and who has earned and can command the widest possible trust and support in the house. Suggested names of suitable candidates include Kenneth Clarke, Harriet Harman, or Yvette Cooper.If Jeremy Corbyn, in this moment of national crisis, proves to be concerned only with putting personal vanity and party interests first at the expense of sincerely getting this laudable initiative to work, he, and unfortunately his party, will not be forgiven.Robert Bell, Cambuslang.JO Swinson was right to reject the idea of a caretaker government of national unity headed by Jeremy Corbyn. While MPs who oppose a disastrous No Deal Brexit must work together to find a solution, it must be a workable solution, not a fantasy. And a Corbyn-led government is not deliverable ndash it is doubtfulhe could even count on the support of all Labour MPs.The caretaker government option must be pursued, but it must one be headed by a Prime Minister who both commands a majority in the House of Commons and has credibility with EU leaders. The EU must be able to have confidence that the Prime Minister genuinely plans to offer a further referendum, preferably on a deal less damaging to the UK and the EU than that negotiated by Mrs Mayrsquos government. As Mr Corbyn has been all over the place on Brexit, and is still lacking a clear position, he has no credibility whatsoever.The SNPrsquos support for the Corbyn option just delays the dficult work needed to get a credible solution. This increases the risk of the UK crashing out of the EU at the end of October. But maybe that is what the SNP actually wants, despite its repeated protestations to the contrary Alistair Easton, Edinburgh, EH.ALAN Thomsonis concerned that Parliament should respect the will of the  per cent of Scottish voters who in  chose to remain within the UK. He shows no such concern for the will of the  per cent of Scottish voters who in  chose to remain within the EU.After the failure of the independence referendum, the Scottish Government acted with commendable realism and maturity, accepting that the independence cause would have to be relegated to the back burner for the immediate future. It would perhaps still be there, had it not been for the lunacy of Brexit: a move of which the results could never have been anything but bad, and thanks to the well-nigh unbelievable irresponsibility and incompetence with which the process has been conducted are all set to be catastrophic, for the entire UK and most of all for Scotland. If this is not a ldquomaterial change of sufficient magnitude to warrant a re-opening of the independence issue, I canrsquot imagine what would be particularly since a key argument of the No campaign in  was that by remaining in the Union Scotland would safeguard its place in the EU.Mr Thomson imagines that it is ldquodebatable whether Boris Johnson will succeed in re-negotiating a withdrawal agreement.

Now we want to reach out to the public and local organisations theand breadth of Scotland to get their feedback.“I would encourage everyone with an interest to consider the new strategy and to join the conversation. “The consultation is available online but we will also be going out to communities across rural, island and urban locations in the next  weeks where it would be great to hear as many views as possible.”data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Colin points out a wall during the Bennachie dig.\"  Open day for people to see dig at Bennachie viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"The strategy aims to protect our climate as well as meeting the needs of its people and businesses.It’s a fine balancing act but the government believes the strategy will tackle climate change, help the economy prosper and improve our health and well-being. There will also be more accountability with proposals for citizens’  and a delivery board.However, the strategy only provides a broad overview of the direction the government is taking, rather than a detailed action plan.Michael explained: “It sets out the direction we will be travelling in for the next  years, with the clear intention that this will not sit on a shelf gathering dust.“The delivery plan, which will be released when the strategy is finalised, will be updated every year to see how much progress has been made on the objectives.“That plan will contain far more detail on what we, as a government, plan to do to meet our targets.”While the government will, of course, lead the way, every Scot has a part to play in the strategy – particularly when it comes to our climate.Michael said: “Scotland has the most ambitious targets for tackling climate change in the world.“The Climate Change Bill, currently before the Scottish Parliament, includes an increased ambition to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, with a net-zero emissions target by .“Transport is currently the largest contributor to Scottish emissions.“This will be tackled through a range of actions including an ambition to phase out the need for new petrol and diesel cars and vans by .“We will promote and design our transport system so that walking, cycling, public and shared transport are promoted ahead of private car use.“However, we also need to help people make the transition to lower carbon travel – to walk or cycle for short journeys,they are able to, or use public transport ahead of single driver car journeys.“That will not only help to reduce car emissions, which are currently responsible for the most greenhouse gas emissions, but will also help people become more active, improving their health and well-being.“There is no doubt in my mind that our climate is changing. The Beast from the East ably proved that.“It cost the UK economy at least £ billion per day as gridlocked roads and no trains or buses meant many workers were unable to get into work.“We are experiencing more severe winter weather, coupled with summers which are hotter and wetter.“That should serve as a real wake up call to us all that we need to change our behaviours now.“Government has a major part to play but we each also have a personal, inidual responsibility to take action to ensure we minimise the impact that we’re having on the environment.“We have to get this right for future generations, given the impact it could have on their lives.”Michael admits that it may be a struggle to wean people away from their cars.For the car remains the dominant mode of transport in Scotland. In ,  per cent of all journeys were made either as drivers or passengers in a car or a van. This was up from  per cent in  and  per cent in .The proportion of single occupancy car trips also shows an increasing trend. The figure of  per cent in  compares with  per cent in  and  per cent in .But with  per cent of Scotland’s greenhouse gas emissions caused by transport, and cars being responsible for the lion’s share, our love affair with the car has to change.It’s for that reason the Scottish Government is moving fast to rid our streets of petrol and diesel cars.The move to electric cars by  – the most ambitious target in the UK – should help meet the emissions target.It has also recently introduced low emission zones in Glasgow city centre, with Edinburgh, Dundee and Aberdeen set to follow.However, with bus trips also in decline, the government has a major job to do in persuading people to change their habits.Michael said: “We need to encourage people to make greater use of public transport.“That, in turn, will help reduce congestion in our cities and towns – as well as reducing emssions.“A double decker bus can take up to  passengers while occupying little more road space than a single car.“Bus use generally has been in decline since the s for a number of reasons, one being longer journey times caused by congestion on the network.“If we can tackle that, people will be more inclined to travel by bus once again.”Technology, both existing and yet to be dreamed up, will also have a role to play.Michael added: “The rail electrication project proves what we can do – we need to be ready and able to introduce new technologies.“However, what people want today and in  years is the same– linking people and places in ways that are reliable, affordable and safe.“Our strategy will be a catalyst for change. “By focusing on our priorities and delivering the outcomes, Scotland will have a transport system that demonstrates to the world that it is open for business.”The strategy opened for public consultation on Wednesday, July , and will close on Wednesday, October .The consultation team will be going out to train and bus stations across the country in the coming weeks to guage public opinion.Members of the public are also being encouraged to have their say online.Visit consult.gov.scot transport-scotland national-transport-strategy to have your say.

Please feel free to contact us with any questions by phoning  ,# said those involved.A spokesperson for the project went on to say: “A huge thanks to all the landowners who have helped us by agreeing the essential land access we need to get started. With their support together we can protect Orkney’s unique wildle for future generations.”The traps will be laid around  metres apart in preferred stoat habitat, which may include some road verges. They will be checked regularly by the project staff.The Orkney Native Wildle Project is a partnership between Orkney Islands Council, Scottish Natural Heritageand RSPB Scotland. Following three years of development generous support for the project has been provided by, the Heritage Lottery Fund and EU Le, providing a combined grant of £. million for the duration of the five-year project.Stoats are native to the UK Mainland but not to Orkney, where they were first recorded in . Since then the population has increased rapidly and is now fully established and widely-distributed throughout Mainland Orkney, Burray and South Ronaldsay.

In  the Paris Agreement was negotiated, committing countriesto keep the global temperature rise well below ºC and make efforts towards keeping it below .ºC.Despite many weaknesses the Paris Agreement has been a surprisingly effective spur to both governments and business.COP will see around , delegates spending two weeks in and around the SEC in Glasgow, and many more will march, rally, protest and take part in alternative events in the city. Around  prime ministers and presidents will attend. The world’s nations will report how they are doing on the goals in the Paris Agreement .At Friends of the Earth will be hosting experts and agitators from the FoE international network, just as we have been hosted by them when they have had a COP in their country.We will also be working with other environment, development and protest groups to make sure that the voice of civil society is heard loud and clear inside and outside the SEC.COP will bring increased scrutiny on the actions of the Scottish Government in tackling the Climate Emergency.

Neils grandmother is in the centre of the centre row.He said: “A good friend of mine owned a bar in Dromore, she gave me an old bottle that said ‘ginger beer’ on it. It was meant as a joke because I’m ginger, but it ended up starting a fascination with bottles.“I started looking into where the bottles were made and background to them.“My original intent was to collect a bottle from every county, but soon I found out there are a lot of bottles out there, probably  known bottles. They are very dficult to find. I would hunt through antique shops, flea markets, auctions and that type of thing. You also pick some up by word of mouth or even dig them up from an old dump site.“My collection ranges from Coleraine to Cork, but a number of local bottles have eluded me. I am aware of bottles from Lurgan, Portadown and Banbridge but am yet to locate these. In particular, the Crystal Mineral Water company in Banbridge produced some fantastic stoneware bottles and it would be the pinnacle of my collection to add one of these.” The bottle from the Crystal Mineral Company in Banbridge that Neil would love to add to his collectionExplaining the history of stoneware bottles, he said: “They were produced during the Victorian era, late s, early s, and were all hand made. No two bottles are the same due to the processes involved, but the minor flaws are what add to their charm. “Historically stone bottles were gradually replaced by mass produced glass bottles, the result of which is that many of these were buried in landfill sites or dumped in rivers and canals and can be dficult to locate.”Neil added: “I’ve always had a big interest in local social history, these stoneware bottles are part of it. I have been working hard in documenting the past so that it can be preserved for future generations. “I have amassed a collection of local items, everything from clocks to water pumps, but there are a few items that I have struggled to find. I am keen to locate any stoneware bottles from Banbridge and anything relating to the Dunbar McMaster spinning mill in Gilford.”He said: “I was born in Gilford into one of the mill workers houses owned by the Dunbar McMaster company and my family were historically mill workers there. I have a fantastic photo of my grandmother working in the mill taken during the Coronation in . I am seeking anything relating to the mill and its history such as receipts, packaging or advertising or even furniture.”Neil commented: “I am part of a local history group, who meet regularly to discuss past events and places and we regularly showcase items so that they can be shared by all.“I would really love to put on an exhibition in Banbridge and that’s probably where this is going.”Open Day raises over £, Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Sadly Neil’s we Kate doesn’t share his enthusiasm for artefacts from the past: “She thinks it’s a load of junk, she’s a minimalist.”If you can help Neil add to his collection email him at neilreid@gmail"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed the 20 ni sights on lonely planet s ultimate uk travel guide","story":"The Giant#s Causeway has been ranked as the UK#s third best tourist destination by respected travel guide Lonely Planet, finishing ahead of attractions such as Hadrian#s Wall and London#s Tate Modern art gallery.For the first time Lonely Planet has picked its  most unmissable experiences and hidden gems across Great Britain, Northern Ireland and the Channel Islands to form its ultimate UK travel hitlist.Titanic Belfast was also ranked in the top  UK destinations by Lonely PlanetIn total,  sights and experiences in Northern Ireland feature in the list which was unveiled today, including the Crown Liquor Saloon in Belfast, Rathlin Island and Londonderry’s walls.Out of the score of attractions only one is in Co Armagh , while none of the sights in Co Tyrone feature in the Lonely Planet must see list.Welcoming the news, Niall Gibbons, CEO of Tourism Ireland, said: “The inclusion of  Northern Ireland experiences and attractions – including the Giant’s Causeway at number three – in Lonely Planet’s ‘Ultimate UK Travelist’ is good news and will surely help to inspire GB travellers to put Northern Ireland on their holiday wish-list. “It is another well-deserved accolade for all of these attractions, which provides Tourism Ireland with a great hook to continue to promote Northern Ireland as a ‘must visit’ destination.”Lonely Planet’s VP of Experience, Tom Hall, said: “Lonely Planet’s Ultimate United Kingdom Travelist brings together the UK’s most compelling sights and experiences, ranging from world-class museums and giant cathedrals to rollicking festivals, inky lochs and tiny pubs. “We’re thrilled to name the Giant’s Causeway one of the UK’s very best sights - alongside many other wonderful experiences in Northern Ireland including spotting puffins and seals on Rathlin Island and riding a boat through Co Fermanagh’s Marble Arch Caves.”Giant’s Causeway is described by Lonely Planet as “timeless” and “unrepeatable” and is beaten only by the Edinburgh Festival Fringe and London’s British Museum.The Ultimate UK Travelist is available at a cost of £..

speaks on his","story":"THE mother of -year-old Gerald McAuley who was shot dead by a loyalist gunman in August  says she has never felt any hatred towards the man who took her son’s le. While helping families move out of the burned streets of Clonard, Gerald, a member of the Fianna youth, was shot dead by on Waterville Street, not far from his Colinward Street family home. During the Scarman tribunal, an acting superior of Clonard Monastery spoke of how he had given Gerald and three others hit by shotgun blasts the last rites. Gerald was taken to the Royal Victoria Hospital where he was pronounced dead at .pm. The tribunal concluded he had been shot by a Protestant gunman. Speaking to the Andersonstown News Gerald’s -year-old mother Nellie spoke of how her second oldest child was born on the Feast of St Gerard and how much he loved fishing, birds, motor racing and bikes. “I remember when Gerald left school, he went to St Thomas’, he got himself a job in a factory in Northumberland Street. I remember he was working in it around three weeks and he came home and said ‘Mummy, the boss wants to see you.’ The first thing I asked was ‘What have you done ’ I went down and the man praised Gerald, how much of a good, clean worker he was and told me how much he had in common with his own sons. He told me how he wanted Gerald to go to the Tech come September but that Gerald had told him how he wanted to join the Irish Merchant Navy when he came of age. I saidthat’s his wish I can’t hold him back.”Nellie spoke of how on August   she had gone out to look for Gerald as he hadn’t come home.Telling how fraught the roads around Kashmir, Falls and Albert Street had become as violence flared around her and her son Jim as they looked for Gerald. “I remember Gerald came in around am that night and went to bed. I got up the next morning to go to work, I worked in C#A as a cleaner and I turned on the news. It was saying about Patrick Rooney, Trooper McCabe and the fella, the bus driver from Ardoyne who had been killed. I came home later that day and Gerald was in the house with his friend. I said to him ‘Waren’t you in work ’ He said ‘Mummy, there is no work, it’s gone, it’s away.’ He went straight out again and that was the last I saw him.”Nellie said she went out to look for Gerald as trouble continued to flare and found herself at the City Hospital. “I remember the Sister on the ward brought me into the office and I said to her that I was looking for my son. She went out and came back and I will always remember how she said ‘No mother, he’s not here, there’s only a boy of around  in Musgrave.’ I said that’s him, that’s Gerald. “Gerald was a big lad, he had it in the shoulders, he had a big frame and he wore a size  shoe. I remember later a priest being on the other side of the street from our house, he was wearing a heavily beaded vest, a beret and a stick and said ‘Mrs McAuley your son has gone to Heaven,’ then he turned on his heel and walked away.”Following Gerald’s death Nellie recalled her feelings: “You’re here and you’re not here. About six weeks after Gerard was buried we were invited up to the old Felons at the side of the cemetery and that night they had a colour party come on the stage and said that night that Gerard was in the Fianna from  years old. Looking back on it Gerald asked me could he go away for a week with the boys out of school. I remember he said he needed five shillings and could I give it to him. He said he needed an enamel plate, cup, mug and even then the penny didn’t drop. I brought him down to Millets and we got the plate, everything. The fella in the shop said he would need a wee container to carry his eggs in and we got that as well. Soon after he came in to say ‘Mummy I’m awful sorry some of the boys couldn’t get their money and couldn’t go.’ I don’t know how long after that then he did go.”  years on from the anniversary of Gerald’s death on Thursday, Nellie reflected how she “wasn’t ing right” half a century ago.” “I never had any hatred. Gerald died on the Feast of the Assumption, August , that’s Her day, he was taken on Her day and that’s the way I looked at it.” A wreath-laying ceremony for Gerald McAuley will take on Friday, August  at .pm in Bombay Street Memorial Garden.

They told us at a meeting in April that they would keep us informed by email, but we have yet to receive an email from De La Salle to inform us that the work was going to start. They basically think we’re going to go away, but you know what  – we live here, we’re not going to go anywhere.”A spokesperson for De La Salle said the school had engaged in“considerable consultation” and modied plans three time to benefit its pupils and “the whole community”.“The school has kept the community in touch with developments as the contract process drew to a conclusion including leaflet drops and an open evening in April to present and view final design plans. A meeting with residents followed shortly after the open viewing evening. The school also indicated that with tendering administration nearly complete the work would start by the summer. Following notication from the successful contractor the school provided details to residents immediately about the contract start arrangements. We also advised local political representatives.”The spokesperson added: “The school has already invited residents to participate in a Management Committee to minimise the impact of any potential disruption to residents during the construction phase and to oversee the usage of the new facilities which will be available to the whole community next year. During the open viewing evening, at subsequent meetings and in written communications residents have been encouraged to join the Committee.“We remain committed to working with the local residents during the construction phase and thereafter.”FOGOG maintain that the pitch will be detrimental for the people of the area.“There’s going to be a major loss access to open green space,” Ms Kerrigan said.“There’s a covenant on this green. It should be protected for everybody. It shouldn’t be fenced off for exclusive use, not to mention noise pollution, lighting pollution, the additional traffic to this area, but fundamentally the loss of open green space. Glassmullin green is precious to the residents, it’s precious to the community.“We don’t have access to open green space in West Belfast. This is the last open green space in West Belfast and it should be protected for this generation and the next. We lost it before when it was Silver City, and we’re not prepared to lose it again.”She added: “We’ll do what needs to be done to protect Glassmullin Green. We’ve campaigned since  and we’re not going to stop now.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"portrait honour for campaigner raymond","story":"A PORTRAIT of a local victims campaigner has gone on display as part of an exhibition by an artist who believes he embodies the true spirit of the north.The painting of Raymond McCord is among  by artist Shauna Fox that have gone on display at the exhibition in the Sea Holly Gallery in Hill Street.Shaunawas born in Bangor but is now based in London, where she is studying fine art painting at Camberwell College of Arts. She makes paintings, sculptures and installations related to being a woman in st century Britain and, more recently, issues related to the north.Shaunw asked her father to pick someone for a portrait who he believes unites communities here. His answer was Newtownabbey man Raymond, who became well-known for his work as a victims campaigner after his son, Raymond Jnr, was murdered by the UVF in .Shauna explained: “Raymond McCord is a victims’ campaigner and he’s a man I’ve always admired – an archetypal Ulster man, brave, unrelenting and he believes that the only way we can deal with the past and move forward isboth communities deal with it together.“My work focuses a lot on ethical issues and human rights. I have explored the destruction of Aleppo by barrel bombs, the oppression of women in relation to honour and sacrice and the Troubles in Belfast.“I studied Ethics at school and from there I became interested in humanitarian and ethical issues. I knew my peers knew little of the atrocities, injustices and inhumanity being carried out at home and abroad on a daily basis and so I based my artwork around these issues in an attempt to raise awareness and present my thoughts, views and responses to them in an innovative and stimulating way.“This body of work is mainly based on my experience of living in Northern Ireland for  years, moving to London and then looking at it from afar. Moving away has made me interested in finding out more about where I’m from, but the more I discover about where I’m from, the more I question whether it’s somewhere I can be proud of and want to live in again.”Raymond said he was “honoured” to be featured in the exhibition.“It is an honour to have a portrait done. I never ever dreamt something like this would happen to me. Unbelievable. I can#t thank the artist enough.“The portrait itself will be dedicated to my son young Raymond and the rest of the innocent victims and in particular to the many from North Belfast. This is for all of us in both communities.”Shauna’s exhibition runs until August  at the Sea Holly Gallery in Hill Street."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"youve got to love lunch at the lansdowne","story":"IN recent weeks, the North Belfast News has covered much that the brand new Lansdowne Hotel on the Antrim Road has to offer.Back in the day, the establishment was the place to go and thanks to a recent refurbishment, its new owners are hoping to restore its glory days. From  stylish bedrooms, a stunning bar with an extensive drinks and cocktails menu and even an eye-catching garden and bridal suite, the Lansdowne has it all.As for grub, the Lansdowne caters for diners from AM to PM and a recent Thursday lunchtime visit for myself and two colleagues offered us the chance to sample some dishes from their lunch menu.The menu is made up of light bites, small plates and main plates so your choice depends on just how hungry you are and how much time you have. We were greeted and shown to our table by their new yet welcoming staff and joined for lunch on this occasion by co-owner Jim McLaughlin who took little time in doing the work for us by selecting some of his favourite and most popular dishes from across the lunch menu. Jim’s background is in food, so we had no hesitation he would deliver the right goods to the table.It wasn’t long before our huge selection of grub arrived in front of us and left us with the question, where to begin We were served three main plates – the larger courses on the Lansdowne lunch menu. First up was the simple yet classic Chicken Caesar salad – a generous portion of sliced chargrilled chicken mixed in with maple-cured bacon lardons, baby gem lettuce, garlic focaccia croutons and lashed with parmesan shavings drizzled in Caesar dressing. Often known as the not so healthy salad option for dieters, it would have been rude not to try this classic and spoonful after spoonful, the smorgasbord of flavours really came out. The next main plate was the duck confit, served on a bed of sweet potato mash, green beans with a dash of herb butter and red wine jus. For me, it was quite the standout dish and as a duck lover, it hit all the right spots from the crispiness on the outside to the easily torn-off meat on the inside, all brought to le by the sweet potato mash and red wine jus.The last of the main plates was my colleague’s definition of heaven – a huge pot of steamed mussels in garlic and white wine cream and served with rosemary and red onion focaccia bread. A massive lover of all things fish, the silence at the table was noticeable as she made her way through the portion, which, priced at just £, could easily be shared amongst two.Also served up on this lunchtime occasion was a selection of small plates which are proving the most popular choice od customers, according to Jim. Small plates are exactly what they say on the tin and take a form similar to Spanish tapas, meaning they are ideal to share. Customers can choose  for £,  for £ or  for £ so whether you want a nibble over a drink or simply can’t choose and need to try a few, the world is your oyster at the Lansdowne.For me, the stand-out small plate was the crispy pork belly with a layer of caramel apple sauce. Pork belly is one of my favourite things and, having previously worked in a Chinese restaurant, I am all too familiar with it and this did not disappoint.Another triumph was the firecracker chicken wings, served with a blue cheese dip. The wings were a perfect combination of a fiery wsoon overtaken by the wonderful dip – I would highly recommend.The brie also deserves a paragraph to itself because it was simply mouth-watering. A crispy shell was soon followed by the delicious melted delight that is brie but the dish was really taken to the next level by the homemade blackcurrant gel and it is not dficult to see why it is the most popular side dish order, according to Jim.Also served to us on small plates was the crispy beef: large chunks of beef brisket which were cooked to perfection and beautully seasoned with pickled carrot and a tastebud tingling Asian dressing which ensured the beef inside the crispiness was moist and melting.The deep fried salt and chilli squid was equally as good and something I also adore – well, anything salt and chilli really. The squid was fresh, fried expertly and served with a napa salad, harissa mayo, coriander and sesame seeds, it would put some Chinese restaurants’ attempt at the dish to shame.The small plates were a huge success on our visit and enjoyed in the impressive surroundings of the stylish bar, for me it was exactly how ‘bar food’ should be – in fact, it was on another level. I cannot wait to try some of the other small plates which include spicy Italian meatballs, crab bruscietta and sweet potato bhajis. The main plates were mighty fine too and maybe with a cocktail or two the next time. I am already looking forward to planning my next lunchtime visit to the Antrim Road’s famous stalwart.

has rejected the findings of a poll which revealed that almost three out of five voters in Northern Ireland would prefer a border down the Irish Sea to a hard Brexit.Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the idea that more people here would rather remain closely aligned with the EU than the UK is in no way reflective of the community he represents.The survey carried out by Belfast-based polling and market research company LucidTalk asked people how they would vote in a referendum proposing that Northern Irelandremained aligned to the European Union, \"perhaps staying in the single market and the customs union\".Read MoreDire Brexit warnings of no-deal listed in leaked document dismissed by DUPAlex Kane: Boris Johnson could be tempted by Brexit backstop only for Northern IrelandCorbyn: Brexit

the response, unionist voters were largely opposed to the prospect of breaking away from the United Kingdom in favour of the EU, with some % of Democratic Unionists and % of Ulster Unionists rejecting the idea.However, Sir Jeffrey questioned the level of support for staying aligned with the EU indicated by the LucidTalk poll, saying it contrasts with the views of his constituents in Lagan Valley.\"These polls by LucidTalk I dont think accurately reflect opinion,\" he told the Belfast .\"Their polling methods are not reflective of the wider community, especially on the unionist side.\"In contrast to the  of people that they poll, the people that I talk to in my own constituency do not share that view at all. data-dfpadtargetingSir Jeffrey Donaldson\"A clear majority of them

position of opposing the backstop and protecting links with the United Kingdom. data-dfpadtargetingMartina Anderson\"We believe that it is not in Northern Irelands best interests, economically or in any other way, to be torn away from Great Britain,\" he continued.He said the UK is one of the largest economies in the world.\"We export far more goods to Great Britain than we do to the rest of the world, including the EU combined, so I dont think it is a credible or rational approach that we should create barriers between ourselves and what is by far our biggest market.\" However, nationalist

of Sinn Fein and SDLP voters who responded to the poll backing the Northern Ireland only backstop.Sinn Fein MEP Martina Anderson said the survey reinforces her view that more people would prefer a united Ireland as a means to staying within the EU than a potentially catastrophic crash-out.\"Opinion poll after opinion poll has shown that the majority are in support of a pathway back into the EU,\" she said.\"I think we need to acknowledge that the vast majority of people in the north voted against Brexit.\"If faced with the choice, they would prefer an enhanced border in the Irish Sea.\"Ms Anderson added: \"If unionists are surprised, they dont have their finger on the pulse of the people that they represent,\" she said.\"The majority of the people quite clearly dont want to see a hardened border.\"Also responding to the survey, SDLP Brexit spokesperson Daniel McCrossan said his only surprise is that the number of people who favour a border in the Irish Sea over a potential hard Brexit is not higher.\"Brexit has been an absolute calamity which looks about to end in a disastrous no-deal,\" the West Tyrone MLA said.\"This will be bad for business, trade and commerce.\"It will especially hit people hard along the border.\"A united Ireland has become a reality for many now and not just an aspiration.\"It should be no surprise to anyone that a further majority wants to avoid a hard border on this island that would interrupt integrated supply chains, damage our economy and bring hardship to border communities.\"Its sadly also no surprise that the DUP continues to ignore the wishes of most people.\"The Tory-DUP Government at Westminster has no mandate for a no-deal exit.\"The majority of middle ground voters also supported the compromise, with % of Alliance voters and % Green Party voters backing the proposition."},{"url":null,"title":"backlash as linfield consider ditching no sunday games rule","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER

But Linfield chiefs feel that -they reach the group stages of the Europa League - their team will need an extra day to recover from their Thursday night fixture before playing again.Hence the proposal to move Saturday games to Sundays, despite the long-standing Never On A Sunday rule in its constitution.Mr McGivern said: \"To reach the group stages would be huge for the club and many things need to be taken into consideration.\"We will have extra games - and that will have an impact in terms of scheduling our league matches.\"We cant play home games at Windsor Park on a Sunday because of a club rule. \"Will we have to change that  Probably, but our members will decide that.\"Linfield can play away on a Sunday but there must be a rule change for a home fixture.\"We will be a few games behind other sides and thats the price for being successful in Europe.\"The whole image of the club will be lted and theres obvious financial benefits.\"However, possible change to the clubs constitution has been criticised by North Antrim MLA Mr Allister. \"I think it will be a retrograde step,\" Mr Allister said.\"Theyve had that rule for a very long time. \"To use the exigency of this present situation as an excuse for changing it permanently I think would be inappropriate - and out of keeping with the culture and tradition of Irish League football.\"The ban on Sunday football matches was lted by the Irish Football Association only in , despite protests from the DUP and evangelical campaigners, including the Free Presbyterian Church.The first match held on a Sunday since the ban was lted was an Irish Premiership match between Glentoran and Bangor at The Oval in Belfast.See back page for full story"},{"url":null,"title":"bombay streets burning by loyalists 50 years ago remembered in","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Ryanair is also seeking a High Court injunction tomorrow to stop strike action by its UK-based pilots on August - and September -.Ryanair did not respond to a request for comment when asked when it would begin cancelling flights. Company sources promised \"robust contingency\" planning should the strikes go ahead so a minimal amount of flights would be cancelled.The airline is seeking an order against Forsa, the parent union of the Irish Airline Pilots Association. Ryanair argued in the High Court that balloted strike action by some of their pilots was unlawful. Forsa is contesting the airlines application for an injunction.Justice Denis McDonald began hearing arguments yesterday from Ryanairs legal representative Martin Hayden.The airline claimed strike action would be in breach of an agreement both parties signed up to in the summer last year.The airline also argues Forsas ballot and subsequent notice of strike action was unlawful, and that the  agreement is a \"binding conclusion\" and \"over-arching\".Mr Hayden told the court Forsa has not actually quantied what it is claiming and Ryanair, although \"not indisposed to making an offer\", is prevented from doing so in the absence of such a request. \"To make a counter offer you need to have something to counter,\" he said.Justice McDonald disagreed with this assertion, arguing that this is not backed by mediator Kieran Mulvey in his report, but Ryanairs understanding of his report.\"Im not asking for your understanding, Im not seeing anything from Mr Mulvey saying Ryanair cannot make a counter proposal without further information from Forsa,\" Justice McDonald said.Mr Hayden said the \"damaging strikes\" would not only affect Ryanair as a company, but many customers. \"If I could say this, this is ultimately a pay request... that the go-to moment is a strike, its a disproportionate response,\" he said.The hearing will resume this morning, but a judgment is not expected until tomorrow."},{"url":null,"title":"carbon offsetting no solution over harry and meghans private jet journey","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

They also claimed that the deceased Creggan man suffered further injuries as he fell to the ground on a laneway outside St Marys Church in the estate.However, Seamus Bradleys family repeatedly maintained that he died later having been taken away from the scene in an army saracen and sustained fatal injuries whilst being subjected to torture during interrogation.The Coroner, Judge Patrick Kinney, however ruled out both versions of the events at Laganside Court in Belfast last Thursday . The judge said he was satisfied that Seamus Bradley was killed by a soldier who got out of a Saracen, fell to one knee and opened fire, but added that he had been unable to identy the soldier responsible for the shooting.“He was running across an open area of ground, he had no weapon and he was clearly visible,” Mr Kinney said.The Coroner also concluded that the deceased man could not have reasonably been percieved as posing a threat of death or serious injury to the soldiers in the Army vehicle nor to anyone  and that the use of force by the soldier was “entirely disproportionate to any threat that could have been perceived.”Furthermore, Mr Kinney said, there was no first aid or medical assistance provided by the soldiers, butit had been there was a “reasonable prospect” that Seamus Bradley would have survived. The judge also concluded the victim was not mistreated by British Army personnel in the Saracen either by physical assault, torture or shooting.Seamus Bradleys brother Danny who has pursued the case for decades told the Derry News: “First of all I would like to make a statement referring to my brothers first inquest in . The prosecution showed a black and white picture to the jury and then turned to my father and called him a liar and said your son was not tortured.“This same man was aware that there were coloured pictures showing that Seamus neck was badly marked and which the black and white images failed to show.“Seamus was stripped naked and badly beaten about the face and shot three times at close range. At the original inquest one soldier claimed that Seamus fell out of the Saracen onto his face, but the army medical officer said that never happened.“Sadly, the police at the time did not show the Bradley family any of the pictures and it took to  for the police to show nine black and white pictures. Then in  the Coroners office showed us  coloured pictures. It can be safely be said that both the black and white and coloured pictures went missing to save the security forces embarrassment.”Danny Bradley also told the Derry News: “I have mixed emotions but I achieved what I set out to do. That was to clear Seamus name and thats what matters. Its not about me.”“I also intend to send the Inquest report to the Irish Government as well as the independent ballistics report because this was a war crime. My brother was a soldier, a volunteer in the Provisional IRA. His papers were logged under war file by the British Government and they have broken the Geneva Convention becuase they had declared war on the IRA.“By doing so they must take responsibility for and due care of their prisoners and I will be asking for a proper investigation-something which the state failed to deliver in .”In  the former Historical Enquiries Team in their examination of the Bradley case concluded that the British Army,they were telling the truth, had acted lawfully with respect to his killing, but added that the death had never been “effectively investigated.”Sinn Féin MLA Raymond McCartney Justice Spokesman welcomed the Coroners Court decision and said: “The Bradley family have been campaigning for the truth about what happened to Seamus for many years. All families bereaved by the conflict are entitled to access to the truth about the deaths of their loved ones.“We need to see the British Government implementing the legacy mechanisms agreed at Stormont House so that families and campaigners can get access to the truth.”googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshCAPTION: -year-old IRA volunteer Seamus Bradley."},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland society dealt decade anniversaries commemorations","story":"This week’s th anniversary commemoration of the Battle of the Bogside comes in the midst of a decade of anniversaries of many of the seminal events in recent Irish history. Half-a-century on, this week has also seen contention and disturbances surrounding the Apprentice Boys of Derry annual parade in Derry-the very same demonstration that was the focal point for the beginning of serious violence exactly  years ago.But, whilst the events of August  in Derry without doubt played a pivotal role in shaping the following decades, in a wider context it was just one episode amongst many more fraught historical events of the last  years.The decade between - was undoubtedly one of the most consistently eventful in Ireland throughout the twentieth century.Within those ten years the country went through the campaign for Home Rule, World War One, the Easter Rising, the Irish War of Independence, partition, the Irish Civil War and the foundation of the Irish Free State and Northern Ireland. Added to that were campaigns for social change exemplied by the  Lockout and the suffrage movement.In combined effect, each of these hugely momentous events left no strata of Irish society untouched or unscathed by the violence that emanated from them. And, the historical shockwaves of some of these events, most particularly partition, also shaped future events in Northern Ireland that literally exploded onto the streets in the late s.In the Republic of Ireland concerted efforts have been made in recent years to make this decade of centenaries more inclusive and tolerant and respectful. The civic remembrance of those Irish men who fought and died on the British side in WWI has grown for example and the previously unthinkable visit to Dublin by an English monarch has taken place.Republican leaders once sworn to end Queen Elizabeth II’s reign in Northern Ireland by any means necessary have greeted her with handshakes and smiles. Uncomfortable conversations around these events have also taken place.In the North, still three years away from the conclusion of this decade of th anniversaries, there is the looming prospect of how the creation of Northern Ireland will be dealt with by nationalists and republicans.The outward signs at least are of course currently not good, encapsulated as they are by the ongoing absence of Stormont. Overlapping it all is the fact that in the North the events of  years ago are beginning to come full circle into the realm of major time passed milestones.So, half-a-century after the Civil Rights movement rocked the foundations of the Northern state to their core, how have we dealt to date with the commemoration of seminal historical events north of the border Professor Peter Shirlow is Director at the Institute of Irish Studies at University of Liverpool and was formerly Deputy Director of the Institute of Conflict Transformation and Social Justice at Queen’s University. He has undertaken conflict transformation work in Northern Ireland and has used his knowledge to work with former combatants and non-governmental organisations in Yugoslavia, Moldova, Bahrain and Iraq.“I think we have dealt with these issues in ways that have shown a lot of maturity, especially when it came to commemorating .“There was a lot of stretching beyond previously comfortable positions and remembering for example the children and the Royal Irish Constabulary who were killed and a realisation that conflict is just not about the commemoration of those who were on ‘your’ side. We are also beginning to look at women in this period who were made invisible.“There are many ways in which to understand what happened and they are a lot more erse than we have been told, but we haven’t yet built this into ways of how to deal with our past,” Peter Shirlow said.The insistence within each community that their version of the stories of the past are the ‘righteous’ versions has been at the root of inter-communal stre even decades after actual conflict has ceased. Heroic versions of the past are something that Peter Shirlow says that as a society we need to look beyond. He added that his research has indicated that Northern Ireland’s dferent cultures are not necessarily converging on that issue as yet.Professor Shirlow is also the Independent Chair of the Office of the First and Deputy First Minister Employers’ Guidance on Recruiting People with Conflict Related Convictions working Group.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshHe told the Derry News: “I have found a very strong sense in the Protestant Unionist Loyalistcommunity that the conflict is finished and there’s a need to move on. They don’t want to engage because there’s a sense it’s in the past, that it’s over.“More people in the PUL community seem to have drawn a line under it-that it was  years ago, so there’s a reluctance to engage. A lot of loyalist prisoners came out and went back to work and don’t appear to have the same fascination with the Troubles.“The republican view of that is they believe loyalists do not want to engage because they are ashamed. It’s not a practical or a sensible view.“I’ve done a lot of research within Protestant working-class communities and there’s some acknowledgement of history, some reverence for Edward Carson and a degree of asking where we are going, but not a lot of interest in looking back at what happened during the Troubles.”The academic also said that he senses with the nationalist and republican community a need that their narrative of events “must be proven right.”So, the Derry News asked Peter Shirlow about how things will pan out when the centenary of the creation of Northern Ireland arrives It’s an issue he believes which still very much reverberates within the political sphere today.“The issue of partition is part of the inter-party talks at the minute. We will have to decide whether Northern Ireland is a ‘good place’ or a ‘bad place’.“We tend not to concentrate on what we have done well. Culturally we are globally renowned-from Van Morrison right through to Snow Patrol’s Crashing Cars being the most listened to song of the st century so far. In terms of sport we recently hosted The Open and we have names such as Rory McIlroy, Graeme McDowell and Darren Clarke, but we don’t use what should symbolise the positive aspects but concentrate on the fractious issue of conflict. It makes us forget how globally regarded we are,” he said.Professor Shirlow also contends that the all invasive aspects of one-sided commemoration also often obscure the stories of human bravery and kindness that took place during the conflict.“There are stories of the Troubles where many people put their own lives in danger to save others. I know someone in Ardoyne who took a policeman into their home and him to stop him being killed. It stops the appreciation of victims being someone’s mother or father, son or daughter. And, I’m sure it’s the same in Derry.“Commemoration doesn’t look at a lot of le experiences or the fact that people on both sides took risks to help protect each other. Commemoration can largely be about the self.”The Derry News also asked Peter Shirlowhe thinks that at specic times, political parties push their ideas of commemoration onto their prospective voters to purposefully polarise communities “There is part of it that is a response to ‘your’ community and that symbolises that these events have power and politicians are sometimes trapped in that. But, of course parties will use that for their own ends.“If we united on issues like the health service, education, employment and the environment perhaps there wouldn’t be such a focus on identity. However, there are signs that people are exploring other ways to move forward,” he said.CAPTION: Professor Peter Shirlow, Director of the Institute of Irish Studies at the University of Liverpool."},{"url":null,"title":"special creggan performance dedicated lyra mckee","story":"A special all-female performance of a play written by esteemed Irish dramatist Brian Friel took place in Creggan yesterday in memory of Lyra McKee.Art Over Borders’ th Lughnasa FrielFest paid tribute to the young writer and journalist who was killed in the city with a free performance of Brian Friel’s  play The Enemy Within.Two performances had been scheduled to take place in two churches, St. Columba’s Church of Ireland in Omagh, Friel’s birthplace, and All Saints Church of Ireland in the Waterside Derry on Saturday.However, festival organiser Arts Over Borders unexpectedly announced the additional free performance in Creggan.The Enemy Within is centred around Columbas room or cell in the Autumn of , on the island of Iona, off the West coast of Scotland.The entire play centres around issues such as ‘Who am I’ and ‘To whom am I connected ’Published in , Friel wrote the play connecting it to the social troubles at the time.Columbas enemies were not only limited to his inner self, but also to his own family. Even though he had left Ireland, presumably for good, his family held an immovable grip which crippled Columba in his work on Iona.This pressure contributes to the inner struggles Columba is forced through in several parts of the play.Yesterdays performance on the last day of the four-week festival was dedicated to the memory of Lyra McKee who was shot dead during rioting in the Creggan area on April  of this year.Her partner Sara Canning was invited along by the organisers. Derry born festival co-curators Sean Doran and Liam Browne felt it was appropriate and timely to honour the memory of Lyra McKee with this all-female world premiere presentation.Speaking to the Derry News, Mr Doran said: “Our international Brian Friel Festival is jointly held in Donegal and Derry, with the Derry location now celebrating the playwright’s more socio-political plays and themes of justice, gender and ethnicity.“To complement the Lughnasa FrielFest Donegal, Here I Come! we have given the title of OVERCOME to Derry’s Lughnasa FrielFest in recognition of Derry’s ability to continually overcome its challenges and to resonate  years on from the Civil Rights marches of  that were directly inspired by the Black American Civil Rights movement.“The Black spiritual singers Ruby Philogene MBE and Tayo Aluko will join the casts of Brian Friel’s The Enemy Within and The Freedom of the City offering sung preludes and interludes to the Omagh and Derry performances.”Mr Browne added: “We had the pleasure of working with Lyra previously when she kindly agreed to be part of a discussion  in our Home of St. Patrick Festival in Armagh in . On that occasion she explored the particular challenges that face young women today, the pressures to reveal, issues around identity, privacy and such.“The subjects which Friel explored throughout his work of gender, poverty, ethnicity, isolation and spirituality mirror the themes which also concerned Lyra and about which she wrote.”googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"strength community shown newtown mayoral visits","story":"Newtown Mayor Cllr David Selby with members of the Men#s Shed\" Strength of community shown in mayoral visitsThe fire cadets in Newtown.\" Skip to next photo Show caption  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\" href\" my account emailthispage \""},{"url":null,"title":"a level result celebrations ysgol bro hyddgen machynlleth","story":"With their A-level results at Ysgol Bro Hyddgen are, from left, Owen Kimpton , Seren Fabltspan classtruncate-full-screengter , Harriet Bletcherand Lewys Meredydd lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Pictures: A-level celebrations at Ysgol Bro HyddgenAur Bleddyn with her A-level resultsat Ysgol Bro Hyddgen, Machynllltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgteth.lt spangtlt spangt\" Pictures: A-level celebrations at Ysgol Bro HyddgenPicking up their A-level results at Ysgol Bro Hyddgen, Machynlleth, are from lefltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtt: Aeryn Carpenter ,Celt John , Macsen Tomos , Stefan Jones .lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Pictures: A-level celebrations at Ysgol Bro HyddgenPicking up their A-level results at Ysgol Bro Hyddgen, Machynlleth, are from lefltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtt Tomos Chickand Rose Williamson lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Skip to next photo Show caption  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\" href\" my account emailthispage \""},{"url":null,"title":"outstanding welsh bacc a level tally caereinion high school","story":"Caereinion High School A-Level results..Pictured left to right, Laura SchjoettFltspan classtruncate-full-screengtrances AndrewHarry Woodhouseand Ezri Alkilani-Brown .Picture by Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Pictures: Outstanding Welsh Bacc and A-level tally at Caereinion High SchoolCaereinion High School A-Level results..Pictured is Head Girl, Aggie Titley .Picture byltspan classtruncate-full-screengt Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Skip to next photo Show caption  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\" href\" my account emailthispage \""},{"url":null,"title":"39 excellent 39 a level results praised llanfyllin","story":"Llanfyllin High School A-Level results..Pictured is Head Boy, Iolo Jones.Picture by Pltspan classtruncate-full-screengthil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Pictures: #Excellent# A-level results praised at Llanfyllin High SchoolLlanfyllin High School A-Level results..Pictured left to right, Head Boy, Iolo Jltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtonesLltspan classtruncate-full-screengteah Jacksand Arran Evison .Picture by Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Pictures: #Excellent# A-level results praised at Llanfyllin High SchoolLlanfyllin High School A-Level results..Pictured is Head Boy, Iolo Jones.Picture by Pltspan classtruncate-full-screengthil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Pictures: #Excellent# A-level results praised at Llanfyllin High SchoolLlanfyllin High School A-Level results..Pictured left to right, Rhydian Moreton ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtand David Caan-Woollltspan classtruncate-full-screengtey celebrating their results..Picture by Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Pictures: #Excellent# A-level results praised at Llanfyllin High SchoolLlanfyllin High School A-Level results..Pictured is Tilly Thornton celebrating hltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgter A and B..Picture ltspan classtruncate-full-screengtby Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Skip to next photo Show caption  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\" href\" my account emailthispage \""},{"url":null,"title":"pictures strong year a level successes welshpool high school","story":"Celebrating A-level results at Welshpool High School are Maisie Inns, left,and Jennltspan classtruncate-full-screengta Foulkes .

By working with the Downpatrick Property Trust, we are able to regenerate this building to provide a commercial interest and much needed guest accommodation in the heart of the town.Breenrsquos Corner is the third project to be undertaken by the trust.It previously developed and later sold Maghinis House in Irish Street and also developed Britches Close in English Street as commercial and office accommodation.The trust also invested pound, in the Breenrsquos Corner buildings when they were bought and refurbished as residential accommodation in .The last of the residential tenants vacated the building several months ago and it has remained unoccupied.Current commercial clients which occupy ground-floor shops are not included in the development.The trust, which is chaired by Fergus Kelly, was described treasurer Mal McGrady as ldquoa community developer of the last resort which gets engaged when there is no private interest in developing a building or the cost of renovation would make development prohibitive for any private investor.He said: ldquoWe are excited by the new concept that Stephen Magorrian and Denvirrsquos proposed to us.ldquoThis concept is a win-win both for Denvirrsquos as it gives extra accommodation while bringing back this property into use which is beneficial to the townrsquos tourism offering.Mr McGrady said that the project was important to Downpatrick town centrersquos continued development.ldquoAt present this buildingrsquos external facade is an eyesore, particularly for traffic entering the town centre.ldquoWe will have the facility to provide an extra  beds in the town centre which will help provide accommodation for people on golf tours, bike tours, casual visitors and bus tours who stop at the St Patrickrsquos Centre and Down Museum and we believe that this will help regenerate the town centre, he added.The development, which is designed by JNP Architects and is being carried out by Keelryan Developments Ltd, of Newcastle, intends to provide affordable, contemporary guest accommodation to appeal to tourists and visitors who wish to stay in the town.Mr Magorrian said the Horatio Group would be responsible for the interior fit-out of the rooms and suites which would be leased from DPT and marketed by Denvirrsquos on its website and other hospitality sites such as Air bnb.ldquoI want the guests to be totally surprised when they come into the accommodation as it will be totally dferent to the exterior, he remarked.ldquoGuests can either walk the few metres around the corner to breakfast at the inn or enjoy a breakfast hamper provided by Denvirrsquos made up with items from local suppliers..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/17822015.plenty-see-year-39-s-fermanagh-county-show/resources/images/9653973.jpg","title":"bandstand john garrity","story":"How long have you been performing Where do you perform What is your favourite song to play and why What has been your biggest gig to date Who are your major influences Do you write your own songs  What inspires your songwriting What would be your dream gig Best moment as a musician so far What is the most unusual venue you have played What is your lsquogo-torsquo encore song Whats the best thing about performing Do you always perform solo or do you also play with a band How would you describe your sound Any last words This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He was a gentleman, his handshake was all anyone needed, and it was one of the most successful of partnerships.“The Ulster Rally team extend their condolences to John’s family and friends, and to the members of his staff that worked so enthusiastically with the John Mulholland Ulster Rally.” The British Rally Championship described the Co Antrim businessman as a “gentleman and a legend,” and added: “We are saddened at the loss of John Mulholland, a massive supporter of the BRC and rallying as a whole.”A post on the John Mulholland Motor Group Facebook said the owner had “turned his matchbox cars into a real le,” by creating an “award winning, thriving car showroom, which he filled with love, energy and enthusiasm”.It said: “He rallied most of the roads in Ireland and further afield. He applied perfectionism and professionalism to everything he did yet somehow managed to have more fun than anyone.“Most importantly, he was a father and husband. Everything he did, every deal he made, every late hour spent at work was for his family who are now completely heartbroken.”The post adds: “If you ever had the pleasure of meeting John, you will know the impact he left on you and the room. His energy was infectious and his passion and charisma for what he did will remain infamous.“The self-marketing campaigns will go down as the best in history.”It adds that funeral details have not yet

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We learn about the Romans, World War Two, the American Civil War at school, but most people have never been taught about the history of their own country.ldquoWe have more castles than any other country in the world per square mile, and thatrsquos something worth celebrating.Fonmon Castle is a rarity among Welsh castles, uniquely well-suited to creating interactive events like jousting, workshops, Renaissance and Steampunk fairs, and many more.ldquoFonmon Castle is one of the few Welsh castles that is still lived in, explained Mr OrsquoHenessey. ldquoIt has remained within two families since it was built by the Marcher Lords during the Norman invasion.ldquoIt recently it was sold to a very friendly couple and they headhunted me in order to help them turn the castle around, to open it up to the public and help teach people more about Welsh history.ldquoTheyrsquove basically provided me a blank cheque.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

However, because it cannot be guaranteed never to trigger them, they need to be implemented in a cost-effective way that minimises the impact on critical supplies.ldquoOperators of those critical supplies should, in any case, take steps to ensure sufficient resilience.Industry regulator Ofgem said its investigation would examine the gridrsquos requirements to hold sufficient back-up power to manage loss of generation supplies, how generators met their obligations with respect to the transmission fault and whether distribution network operators complied with their obligations.The watchdog also said it would be ldquolooking at whether the companies made the right decisions both in the numbers of customers disconnected and whether those customers disconnected were the right ones.Ofgem launches investigation into power cuts ## https:t.co xxHntolC pic hnTxAIgmmdash ofgemAugust , Ofgem said it was liaising with the rail regulator and rail authorities ldquoto understand better why the drop in frequency on the energy network led to disruption for passengers.The % cut, a mechanism known aslow frequency demand disconnection , is generally understood to try to avoid disruption to critical infrastructure such as hospitals and transport networks and is usually evenly spread across Britain.Welcoming the report, a National Grid ESO spokesman said it is ldquoright and proper to have a full investigation into ldquothe performance of the electricity system, and subsequent signicant disruption to transports networks and critical infrastructure.Investigators are looking at National Grid ESO, National Grid Electricity Transmission,  distribution network operators in England and Wales, generators RWE Generationand Orstedto see whether any breached their licence conditions.Ofgem has the power to fine firms found to be at fault up to % of their UK turnover.Jonathan Brearley, Ofgemrsquos executive director of systems and networks, said: ldquoItrsquos important that the industry takes all possible steps to prevent this happening again.ldquoHaving now received National Grid ESOrsquos interim report, we believe there are still areas where we need to use our statutory powers to investigate these outages.ldquoThis will ensure the industry learns the relevant lessons and to clearly establish whether any firm breached their obligations to deliver secure power supplies to consumers.The final report is due to be submitted to Ofgem by Friday September .National Grid chief executive John Pettigrew was given a pay rise of almost pound million this financial year, earning pound. million, up from pound. million the previous year.The remuneration committee, according to the firmrsquos annual report, said he had ldquocontinued to deliver strongperformance in his third year in the role..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Blackout report blames  uextremely rare and unexpected u lightning strike article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--Promoted Stories       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

prevent dogs dying in hot cars this summer and to raise awareness on summer safety for our canine friends.Just a few minutes in a hot car can prove fatal for dogs and yet every year animal welfare charities and the police receive thousands of reports of animals being left alone in cars on warm days.That’s why together with Dogs Trust, Councils across Northern Ireland are running ‘Summer Fun for Cool Canines’ events as part of the Dogs Die in Hot Cars campaign, to raise awareness about the dangers of leaving dogs in hot cars and to provide dog owners with practical tips to keep their dog cool and safe this summer.Laura McAnea, Campaigns Manager at Dogs Trust, said: “Many people still believe that it’s OK to leave a dog in a car on a warm daythe windows are left open or they’re parked in the shade, but the truth is, it’s not.“A car can become as hot as an oven very quickly, even when it doesn’t feel that warm and a dog can die in a hot car in  minutes. When it’s  degrees outside, in a car it can reach an unbearable  degrees within the hour.“We are delighted to be working with Local Authorities to raise awareness of the dangers of this and to try and prevent the heartbreak and distress caused when a much-loved family pet suffers, or dies, because they have been left in a car on a summer’s day.”Dogs Trust advise thatyou see a dog in distress in a hot car, call your local Animal Welfare Officer who will liaise with the PSNI to organise the rescue of the dog. This will help ensure the dogs can be removed from the car as quickly as possible, in a safe and legal manner.Signs of heat stroke in dogs include heavy panting, excessive drooling, vomiting, being drowsy and uncoordinated and collapsing. Dogs Trust advise that to help a dog in this condition, place them in the shade, pour small amounts of tepid, not cold, water onto their body, help them to drink small amounts of tepid water and once their breathing has settled, call the nearest vet.You can find out more about caring for dogs in the hot weather on the Dogs Trust website at https:www.dogstrust.org.uk news-events issues-campaigns

Now in its st year, the region’s longest established listing of company performance provides insight on the accomplishments of Northern Ireland based companies, either Northern Ireland registered or where a signicant proportion of their business is transacted in the province. The  edition of the Top  incorporates analysis of figures filed at each companies year end and posted at Companies House and primarily relate to financial periods ending in late ,  and . SUMMARY Sales have grown to £.bn from £.bnwhich is a growth of .%. While extremely encouraging this result needs to be tempered with the fact that profits for the top companies decreased by nearly % to £.m. Shareholder value for the Top  companies increased by .%. Revenue sales Sales revenue is the income received by a company from its sales of goods or the provision of services. The performance of the Top  showing a .% sales growth to £.bn is exceptional in what is a dficult trading environment and period of uncertainty for the provinces businesses. The Brexit question came to the fore on June ,  so all the financial figures shown in the listing have come post the referendum and in essence since the suspension of the Assembly in January . Moy Park continues to hold sway with the highest turnover, currently £.bn, up from £.bn previously – snapping close at their heels is WR Barnett Ltd . Next in the listing are a number of high fliers, LCC Group Ltd and John Graham Holdings Ltd. John Graham Holdings Ltd, which trades as Graham, is another privately owned company based in Hillsborough and specialising in building and civil engineering projects – Graham posted annual sales of £.m in its latest financial accounts up from £.m – an increase of some .% year on year. One of the perennial high performers of the Top  showed a signicant decrease in sales dropping it from a position last year of  to a position this year of . Fane Valley Co-Operative‘s sales decreased from £m to £.m – this is a result of their change in ownership of Linden Foods. Linden Foods is now a joint venture and has entered the list at number  with sales of £.m. Another indicator of strong performance within the listing is that turnover figure required to gain access to the Ulster Business Top  is at its highest ever, with Heron Bros Ltd posting year end sales results for    of £.m. Last year’s number  was Cranswick Country Foodswith sales of £.m. This represents a rise in sales required of .%, to make the Top . Cranswick Country Foodshas risen to  in the listing posting impressive sales growth of %. Profitability Since the Ulster Business Top ’s inception in , we have identied the top companies by measuring turnover, while also accepting that both profitability and tangible shareholder value are also key measures of performance. This year has seen a drop in profit margin for the Top  companies from a margin of .% to .% with total profits now sitting at £.m compared to £.bn for the corresponding companies in their prior year. Northern Ireland Water Ltd has retained its position as the most profitable business within the listing, posting pre tax profits of £.m on a turnover of £.m a margin of .%. Northern Ireland Electricity Networks Ltd is second most profitable with pre tax figures of £m against a turnover of £.m . While the reduction in profitability of the Top  is disappointing this can be tempered by the fact that a number of the companies made signicant losses during the last filed figures recorded for the compilation of the listing.
