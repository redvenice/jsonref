Kindness isn’t a trait landlords are famous for, but Aktemel is on a mission to change this with Scotland’s first social enterprise letting agency that specialises in housing people on low incomes or benefits.Aktemel, an experienced property developer and private landlord, founded Homes for Good in 2013 after cutting ties with a letting agency that had been managing her properties in Glasgow. “We took our portfolio back from them and I made a point of going and visiting all my tenants and finding out who they were,” she says.One tenant made her realise that she had to take action. “She was two months behind on her rent,” recalls Aktemel. “There was hardly anything in her house, all her stuff was in bin bags, and she said: ‘I thought you were coming to evict me.’”“That for me was really powerful because the fear that she had, I mean, can you imagine living like that? The letting agent treated her so badly that she didn’t have any concept of her rights, and I just remember thinking that I never want any one of my tenants to feel like that. I said: ‘No, I’m not coming to evict you, let’s just get all your stuff unpacked, and let’s work out where we are and how we can go forward.’ She stayed in the house about another six years.”This kind of one-to-one care was at the centre of Aktemel’s vision for a dedicated tenancy support service for the most vulnerable people in her local community. She resolved to offer people more than bricks and mortar. “The first full-time person I employed was a social worker,” she says. “Because the human interaction is where you make a difference to people.”To date, she has secured £13.1m in social investment, and the Homes for Good group now manages around 500 properties – half of which it owns. It works with more than 800 tenants and 180 landlords in and around Glasgow and the west of Scotland. Its latest support has come through a £3m commitment from Big Issue Invest, the social investment arm of The Big Issue, which Aktemel describes as ‘a perfect partner for us’.Homes for Good is the second social enterprise that Aktemel has built, having spent 18 years running a Scottish arts and regeneration charity that she founded. “I knew how you could help people to change their lives if you treated them well,” says Aktemel. “But I didn’t know how to be a letting agent because I’d never been one. It was actually my husband who said to me: ‘Just do it your way.’ And I thought: ‘Well, my way is it needs to feel friendly, it needs to feel like home.’ People need to not feel afraid to talk to us.”Today, the Homes for Good team is helping tenants with benefit claims, to access mental health services or cookery classes, and with getting back into work. A grant from the national lottery also gives tenants a chance to work with an interior designer.All this support makes good business sense to Aktemel. “We’ve only evicted one person ever,” she says. “We prefer to work in a human way with people from the outset to avoid problems further down the line.”In an ideal world, social entrepreneurs wouldn’t have to pick up the slack in a housing crisis, but Aktemel says her tenants can’t wait around for things to change. “If you talk to the Chartered Institute of Housing or Shelter or anybody else, they say the solution is to build more genuinely social housing. They’re absolutely right about that and I completely agree, but in the absence of that happening – for whatever reason – people need to live somewhere.”“We’ve got lovely tenants who are in receipt of housing benefit,” says Aktemel, who actively welcomes people claiming any benefits. “The fact that most landlords say no to people on housing benefit means that the only choice such tenants have is at the bottom of the market and it’s really poor quality.”Homes for Good was awarded £2.4m in national lottery funding in September 2019 to roll out its model across the UK. Aktemel has ambitions to manage 1,000 homes within four years.Since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, Homes for Good has stepped up the support it offers tenants, including helping those who haven’t required it before but who now need to access benefits or mental health support. It has also rolled out a range of tenant engagement activities, including virtual afternoon teas, children’s workshops, film clubs, and the interior design programme.As for other landlords, Aktemel has this advice. “Landlords get economic benefit out of providing homes, and I think we should never lose sight of the responsibility we have for that. I’ve seen the way that you can help people change if you put time and you put kindness into them.”Building a better societyNationwide Building Society is working with communities to support local housing and build a better society.

The European Union’s climate observation program puts the two years in a dead heat.Regardless of these minor differences, all the datasets again underlined the long-term heating up of the planet due to the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation and other human activities.The world’s seven hottest years on record have now all occurred since 2014, with the 10 warmest all taking place in the last 15 years. There have now been 44 consecutive years where global temperatures have been above the 20th-century average.Scientists said average temperatures will keep edging upwards due to the huge amount of greenhouse gases we are expelling into the atmosphere. “This isn’t the new normal,” said Gavin Schmidt, director of Nasa’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies. “This is a precursor of more to come.”The record, or near-record, heat came despite the moderately cooling influence of La Niña, a periodic climate event. “While the current La Niña event will likely end up affecting 2021 temperature more than 2020, it definitely had a cooling effect on the last quarter of the year,” said Zeke Hausfather, a climate scientist at Berkeley Earth, which found 2020 was narrowly the second hottest year on record.“It suggests that we’ve added an equivalent of a permanent El Niño event worth of global warming in just the last five years,” Hausfather added, in reference to the counterpart climate event that typically raises temperatures. “Records like this further reinforce the need to reduce our emissions sooner rather than later.”The climate crisis is drastically altering environmental processes across the globe, as the scientific analyses of 2020 show.The annual average sea ice extent in the Arctic was, at 3.93m sq miles, the joint smallest on record, tied with 2016, while oceans were “exceptionally warm”, Noaa said, with just two previous years recording hotter marine temperatures. Average annual snow cover for the northern hemisphere was the fourth lowest on record.Rising heat in the atmosphere and water is causing glaciers to melt, rising sea levels, as well as helping fuel larger and more destructive storms. The US, buffeted by an unprecedented Atlantic hurricane season in 2020, was hit with a record number of major disasters last year, costing tens of billions of dollars and resulting in several hundred deaths.“Global warming won’t necessarily increase overall tropical storm formation, but when we do get a storm it’s more likely to become stronger,” said Jim Kossin, an atmospheric scientist at Noaa. “And it’s the strong ones that really matter.”Wildfires, fueled by vegetation parched by prolonged heat, ravaged huge areas of California and Australia last year, while the Arctic experienced astonishing temperatures well above average.“This year has been a very striking example of what it’s like to live under some of the most severe effects of climate change that we’ve been predicting,” said Lesley Ott, a research meteorologist at Nasa.The UK Met Office has already predicted that 2021 will also be among the hottest ever recorded, with the world now “one step closer to the limits stipulated by the Paris agreement”, said Colin Morice, senior scientist at the Met Office. Governments will meet later this year in Scotland for crucial UN talks aimed at building upon the Paris deal, which committed countries to avoiding a disastrous global temperature rise of 1.5C from pre-industrial levels.“We are headed for a catastrophic temperature rise of 3-5C this century,” warned António Guterres, secretary general of the UN. “Making peace with nature is the defining task of the 21st century. It must be the top priority for everyone, everywhere.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0754d7f1fb8ec413b28881525a281f8f30e82aaa/0_1765_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d038c57aa1a3bb4970718ec277f9f9b","title":"from morning candles to pavement scooters this weeks fashion trends","story":"What’s hot and what’s not in fashion this weekThe Blob Ugly trainers were due an upgrade.

In Covid’s latest cruel reversal, they are now doing everything they can to show that they are working their socks off.With a rising number of cases leading the UK to announce that the United Arab Emirates would be removed from its travel corridor list from Tuesday, British nationals returning home now face 10 days in isolation.And in the aftermath of that announcement by the UK transport secretary, Grant Shapps, social media users have realised that an extraordinary number of the former stars of the TV series Love Island and Geordie Shore appear to be, at present, in the UAE.Some of these exiled influencers are posting the same sunloungers-and-posh-dinners content as before – Dubai is not subject to lockdown measures like the UK. But now they are having to scramble to delete the hostile messages ensuing from their followers.With “essential work trips” being one of very few consistently allowed justifications for travel as the UK’s rules have fluctuated over the last few months, some of the influencers in Dubai are trying to indicate that their 3,400-mile trip was a necessary part of their work – appearing in videos and paid-for endorsements.As reaction built up on Wednesday, the Love Island star Anton Danyluk, who has been in Dubai since 10 December and has posted images of himself out for meals and smoking shisha in a pool, showed a video of his laptop with a view of the skyline behind it and the caption “love my office view”.Meanwhile, The Only Way Is Essex star James Lock posted at least two images of his laptop, with unspecified graphs on screen, in his stories. On Wednesday morning he told his followers he and his girlfriend, Yazmin Oukhellou, were “working away, despite what you may think, we are still grafting”. He posted a video of himself sunbathing, with a drink but no laptop, an hour later.Oukhellou, also an influencer, had previously explained that the Dubai trip was for an unavoidable product launch. “We are here for work purposes, for business,” she said. “Obviously we’ll make the most of it while we’re here as well.”They are far from alone. The Geordie Shore stars Chloe Ferry, Sophie Kasaei, and Bethan Kershaw, said the apartment they had rented had a room devoted to producing sponsored content. Gabby Allen, another Love Islander, has told her followers: “Hey guys, just to let you know, we made the decision to fly out to Dubai as my boyfriend’s business is based here and luckily allows us to travel.”Others could have travelled before the UK ban on non-essential international journeys was imposed in November. The Love Island star Kaz Crossley has been there since October and, her agent said, was therefore a “resident” rather than tourist, the same claim made by fellow islander Georgia Harrison.The extraordinary proliferation of workaholic influencers in Dubai, taking refuge even as the coronavirus case count rises, led the writer Clive Martin to describe the emirates hotspot as “the Covid Casablanca”.Residents might welcome their city’s popularity with British tourists in general, but some are unimpressed by the latest deluge.“With all of them coming in, getting reservations at attractions and slots for residents has been so difficult,” said Rhea Matthew, a social care executive. She said the problem was a specifically British one and coincided with the rising case count in the UAE. “Our city became so full overnight. Things were good and then boom – tourists everywhere. Things are escalating here and it’s scary.”The UAE government has cited “a significant acceleration in the number of imported cases”.In the influencers’ defence, Laura Anderson, another Love Island veteran, who is in Dubai, said: “I saw someone in my comments saying you’re on holiday, but when you’re working you’re not on holiday … I’m definitely not out and about every day as I need to be on my laptop working and life here is strict.”But Olivia Attwood, yet another Love Islander, summarised such arguments derisively from her home in Manchester. “It’s the constant ‘I’m working, not on holiday’ shout,” she said in a video. “There is a difference between being able to earn money wherever you are, and being there for work.”With scrutiny of the reality stars intensifying, Trending Travel, a holiday company that specialises in using celebrities to advertise, said it had been forced to stop posting anything featuring influencers.Its chief executive, Keith Herman, said the company had advised about 15 influencers it works with, and who are in Dubai, against posting at the moment.“Most have listened to us,” he said. “We’ve told them the world has changed over the last two weeks, you’ve got to be more sensitive to who is seeing your posts.” In their defence, he said, some had contracts to honour and were inexperienced. But he added: “Morally they should just lie low at the moment.”The influencers themselves, meanwhile, were not keen to expand on their social media statements. Of the 23 contacted by the  only Crossley’s agency provided a statement on her behalf. Twenty-one did not respond, while Danyluk’s agent asked if the influencer would receive a fee."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f0cd57d1cc0d38ddb011681606d74d93285e934/0_89_1509_905/master/1509.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTMucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=87c8d9149f0a8bbd5fdb78d697253cef","title":"the biggest vaccination programme in uk history but is it fast enough podcast","story":"Government aims to vaccinate 12 million people by middle of February.

Wine hopes to oust Yoweri Museveni, 76, who has been in office since 1986. Museveni, who took power after the fall of the dictator Idi Amin, is known for bringing stability to the region and for helping manage the HIV crisis.

Changes to the sport’s legal and financial frameworks are never swift or easy, but reform of the Levy – for instance, to include bets placed on races overseas – has been suggested as a potential source of between £30m and £40m a year in revenue.The prospect seemed within reach when Nigel Huddleston, the minister for sport, told the House of Commons in December that the department of culture, media and sport would examine reform of the Levy in 2021, three years earlier than necessary under legislation. Now, however, the Racing Post reports that Huddleston wrote to Anna-Marie Phelps, the British Horseracing Authority (BHA) chair, this week to say – in what sounds like classic Yes, Minister-ese – his department will only examine “whether there was a case for bringing forward the timetable” for review.The BHA insisted on Thursday that little has changed, and that it will “look forward to continuing our dialogue with government, and providing further evidence which highlights the need for urgent reform of the Levy to ensure that it is sustainable and fit for the digital age.” However, a sense that racing has already started to slide down the government’s list of priorities – having not been unduly prominent in the first place – is hard to escape.The betting industry, which faces issues of its own with a review of the gambling laws underway, is also likely to resist an extension of the Levy to bets on overseas racing for as long as it possibly can. This aspect of the BHA’s plans is an attempt to reach straight into the bookmakers’ balance sheets and remove tens of millions of pounds from their gross profits,. While there is certainly an argument that British racing has as much right to it as the betting firms do, that is not quite the same thing as earning or deserving it.Levy income will be the sport’s principal source of revenue until crowds return, and it seems likely to dwindle further over the next few days as the weather intervenes to disrupt the racing programme.Friday’s main meeting – the Huntingdon card which was due to feature the Sidney Banks Memorial Hurdle, won 12 months ago by Shishkin – was abandoned on Thursday after a nearby brook burst its banks, while the scheduled card at Sedgefield was abandoned on Wednesday.Jumping at Lingfield next Monday has also been lost to waterlogging, although the card has been re-arranged as a “Jumpers Bumpers” fixture on the all-weather track. No problems are currently reported at Warwick, where the 13-runner Classic Chase is due to be the feature race of Saturday’s action."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/96fcab0c5d8dc141ab40453806afacc014b76f1f/0_24_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d50a5c5c45a0c9d9a535725c43d42dae","title":"sri lanka v england first test day two live","story":"72nd over: England 248-3 (Root 123, Lawrence 56) Morning everyone and thanks Tim. Ah man it’s good to be back, if a little odd to be back to see England dominating the first Test of a tour. Might it be that ... they’re getting good at this? In the 37 years I’ve been watching them I can’t remember a pool of similar talent, that’s for sure – though there’s a lot of work to be done for them to get to where their best sides have. Anyway, Root gets well down the pitch to sweep De Silva’s first ball for four, and two singles follow. 72nd over: England 242-3 (Root 118, Lawrence 55) Root nurdles Shanaka for two, then Lawrence late-cuts him for four. That was class. If he can get through the new ball, he could be the next Ben Foakes. That’s my stint done, so I’ll hand over to Daniel Harris, the distinguished presenter of United Rewind. Thanks for reading and I’ll be back on Sunday, if the game goes that far.71st over: England 235-3 (Root 115, Lawrence 51) It’s a double change as Chandimal summons Hasaranga. The timing is another sign that he doesn’t have much faith in him, but I’d back Hasaranga to prove him wrong in the long run. This over includes a no-ball, showing his inexperience, but also a leg-break that turns a yard. If Shane Warne was on commentary, he’d be raving about him. 70th over: England 233-3 (Root 114, Lawrence 51) With the new ball not far away, Chandimal decides it’s time to turn to his fifth bowler, the medium-paced allrounder Dasun Shanaka. He shows a bit of intent by (a) bowling a maiden and (b) picking up a straight push from Lawrence and trying to throw down his stumps.69th over: England 233-3 (Root 114, Lawrence 51) The milestones keep coming: Lawrence clips for another single and that’s the hundred partnership. It has taken 26.2 overs, which is rapid by Sri Lankan standards, and it’s the second hundred stand in a row. England’s all-time partnership record at Galle is under threat, less than a day after it was set by Root and Bairstow.68th over: England 227-3 (Root 109, Lawrence 50) Lawrence reaches fifty in his first Test innings. He went down the track, didn’t get to the bounce, had to settle for a block, then did better next ball, with a straight push past Perera for a single. He’s been so assured: it’s as if he got all the nerves out of the way yesterday by dropping that dolly. Credit to Root, too, for letting Lawrence have most of the strike. “So pleased for Joe Root,” says Mike Galvin. “He has stood tall under a lot of pressure. This century will, hopefully, relieve that and he will go on to bag more.”67th over: England 223-3 (Root 107, Lawrence 48) Lawrence is beaten outside off stump by Embuldeniya, but he shows a good temperament again by sweeping the next ball for two. “Waiting for Leach,” says the subject line from David Reynolds. “I am being distracted in a snowy Prague,” he goes on, “by two Test matches in the early morning – wonderful. But I am not a little frustrated that these two are selfishly denying the people what they really crave: the Taunton Bradman back at the crease in a Test match.”“Any chance of link to TMS for overseas listeners?” wonders Richard Turner. “It gets hidden every day.” I’m fairly sure one of our readers will have found it. 65th over: England 214-3 (Root 105, Lawrence 42) And another single to Root off Embuldeniya. England lead by 79.64th over: England 213-3 (Root 104, Lawrence 42) Just a single to Root off Perera.63rd over: England 212-3 (Root 103, Lawrence 42) Mickey Arthur is so angry he’s throwing his water bottle to the floor, but I can’t see that he has any grounds for complaint. The ball went from bat to ground to wrist to hand. And the ground is the crucial bit.Root, facing Embuldeniya, reverse-sweeps and misses, or does he? The close fielders reckon he’s nicked or gloved it. I’m not so sure...62nd over: England 210-3 (Root 102, Lawrence 41) And Root sets off for the next hundred with a sweep for two. I wouldn’t bet against it.They’re back out there, and second ball after lunch, Root laps a single off Perera to reach an excellent hundred, his first of the 2020s. He takes off his helmet, kisses the badge and smiles even more broadly than usual. “He’s played absolutely beautifully,” says Mike Atherton.“Good morning Tim,” says Em Jackson, “from a rather icy West Denton, Newcastle. Just logging on for work and to quote Mister Burns when he was managing the Springfield Nuclear Plant Softball Team, in relation to England’s rejuvenation in the early hours, GMT...”Hit at least 99 Joe Root.I told him to do that.There’s been something missing from our coverage today – an email from John Starbuck. But here he comes... ”Morning, Tim, from West Yorkshire-under-Snow.” Morning John, glad you could join us. “Mockers alert! Assuming he gets his century, and a big one at that, you’ll have to be hauling the Root-puns suitcase down from the top of the wardrobe. Are you going to have a net for that?” Puns? Us? 61st over: England 206-3 (Root 99, Lawrence 40) Root sweeps Embuldeniya for... three, thanks to a good ing stop at deep square leg. Embuldeniya goes over the wicket into the rough, conjuring memories of Ashley Giles, who is on the ground in his role as England’s boss. But it’s just a ploy for a couple of balls, and when he goes back round, he beats Lawrence outside off. And that is lunch, with Root poised on the brink. He’s gone from Root 66 to Root 99, and more importantly, he’s been big enough to play second fiddle to a debutant. Dan Lawrence has scored a fearless 40 and made up for the early loss of Jonny Bairstow. The morning belongs to England, who are in charge of this Test. Sri Lanka have one bowler doing a great job – Lasith Embuldeniya, with all three wickets for 80 – while the other three have managed none for 111. Still, they were doing OK themselves this time yesterday. And England, as their faithful supporters know, always have a collapse in them. See you in half an hour.One over left before lunch. Can Root get four more?60th over: England 203-3 (Root 96, Lawrence 40) Root plays a false shot! An inside edge that just eludes short leg’s right hand – but it wouldn’t have been out anyway, as Perera had overstepped. Lawrence shows his legside skills now, going down the track to play a whip for two. He may be Both Sides Billy. 59th over: England 193-3 (Root 94, Lawrence 37) Root sees those sweeps and thinks he’ll play one too, off Embuldeniya, through midwicket, and he’s into the nineties. 58th over: England 188-3 (Root 89, Lawrence 37) Perera takes over from Hasaranga and Lawrence plays a different kind of sweep – later, finer, not far from the man on the 45 but getting past him to go for four. England’s lead is now 53. 57th over: England 183-3 (Root 88, Lawrence 33) Embuldeniya is back, and after a few dots Lawrence slog-sweeps him for six. That’s the way to bring up a fifty partnership with your captain on your debut. Lawrence has hogged the strike, facing 58 balls out of 88, but this reflects well on Root rather than badly on him.56th over: England 177-3 (Root 88, Lawrence 27) Lawrence bears out Sangakkara’s point by smacking another four through the covers, going forward to Hasaranga and flat-batting with quick hands. Contrary to his reputation, he has barely hit the ball to leg at all. On this evidence, he’s an Offside Olly.55th over: England 172-3 (Root 88, Lawrence 22) Another tidy over from Fernando, apart from one ball way down the leg side, which is so bad that it costs only a bye. On commentary, Kumar Sangakkara is talking about Dan Lawrence. ”Very assured and very confident... his judgment is excellent.”54th over: England 170-3 (Root 87, Lawrence 22) Lawrence edges Hasaranga, prodding at a leg-break, but gets away with it because there’s no gully. Unfazed, he sees Hasaranga drop short and cuts for four to ease the pressure. Zak Crawley, Ollie Pope, now this guy: England have enough fearless young batsmen to form a queue, in true English fashion.53rd over: England 161-3 (Root 83, Lawrence 17) Just when his spinners have taken back control, Chandimal switches to swing and seam. It’s a surprising move but Asitha Fernando comes bustling in and keeps the pressure on. He gets close to the stumps, and if he’s allowed to stay there by the umpire, he’ll generate some rough for Hasaranga’s leg-break. Here’s Brian Withington. “Hovering around zero degrees here in Dorridge, so casting envious eyes at Galle. Sad to see not-so-YJB dismissed early but a treat to welcome YDL, son of Chingford, to the crease. The young man has got something, including the ideal batting partner for a debut innings. And being reared on the raging Bunsen that is Chelmsfordabad can’t hurt when batting in Galle ...”52nd over: England 160-3 (Root 82, Lawrence 17) Now Hasaranga bowls a maiden too, as he finds his groove and ties Lawrence down. Two good contests. “Morning Tim!” Morning, Ben Heywood. “It’s a positively balmy -5C here in Virpazar, Montenegro, and as it’s dry for the first time in weeks I’m pulling no.1 son out of his last day of virtual school and we’re bunking off to go snowboarding.” Proper parenting. “We’re also taking a plastic bat and a bright orange practice ball to celebrate the fact that Montenegro are – after two victories against Estonia late last year – now ranking above Christmas Island in the ICC rankings! I’m hoping to add to my solitary cap, so do put any weird nations in touch who’d like to come and lose to the Montenegro Bokaneers when travel opens up again. And let’s have a century from Root, please.” Just one international talking about another.51st over: England 160-3 (Root 82, Lawrence 17) Lawrence spots a rare bad ball from Embuldeniya, rocks back and cuts for four. That was commanding, but then he cuts again, less certainly, and gets away with it as the ball drops short of the man at backward point. This is a good contest.50th over: England 155-3 (Root 82, Lawrence 12) Perera goes off after a disappointing spell and gives way to Wanindu Hasaranga, the exciting young leggie with the fast arm action. He bowled too short last night, but he’s on the spot now with his googly, surprising Lawrence and rapping him on the splice. 49th over: England 153-3 (Root 81, Lawrence 11) There is a maiden! And an even better over from Embuldeniya, who beat Lawrence with one that turned and bounced and dislodged a bit of the surface. The pitch is coming to the party.48th over: England 153-3 (Root 81, Lawrence 11) Four singles off Perera, Lawrence is into double figures, and Sri Lanka haven’t managed a maiden for 28 overs, which isn’t like them.Meanwhile, in Brisbane, Marnus Labuschagne has got his hundred, but India have got him out. “Working from home in Kuala Lumpur,” Joel Eley wrote a few minutes ago, “and have a batting masterclass onscreen from Labu at the Gabba. Hope Root can push on and I will just imagine his sumptuous cover drives as you report on the OBO. Bit worried about the Aussie batting line-up for the next Ashes – Warner?, Pucovski, Labu, Smith and Green.” Yes, the Aussies are looking reassuringly shaky, although they’re still narrow favourites to win this Test and the series.47th over: England 149-3 (Root 79, Lawrence 9) Lawrence has been looking to play every delivery, but now he watches one from Embuldeniya very carefully, sees that it’s not the arm ball, and lets it pass close by his off stump. This feels so good, he does it again next ball. Is it too early to say that he’s got the temperament?46th over: England 148-3 (Root 78, Lawrence 9) A single to Lawrence, a single to Root, two to Lawrence: the guy has nine from eight balls. He won’t always find it this easy. 45th over: England 144-3 (Root 77, Lawrence 6) Root’s a dancer too, not going down the track but back, on his toes, to glide Embuldeniya square for two. And I’ve just realised that that first fine careless boundary from Lawrence took England into the lead.44th over: England 142-3 (Root 75, Lawrence 6) After taking a single off his first ball, what is Lawrence going to do with his second? Stroke it through the covers for four, which it fully deserves, as it’s a full toss. By the time he gets to his fourth ball, he’s dancing down the track to take a single to long-on. Root does his best to keep up with a two and a single of his own.43rd over: England 134-3 (Root 72, Lawrence 1) Dan Lawrence has had quite a wait to face his first ball in international cricket, but when it comes he plays it confidently off the back foot and takes a quick single into the covers. Legside Larry? Not so far. Root gets two more from a pull, but that’s a fine start by Lasith Embuldeniya, who is on course for a ten-for. The ball to Bairstow gripped and turned and suggested that today will be a lot more testing than yesterday.No reprieve this time! Bairstow props forward, gets a nick to gully, and the only doubt is whether the ball carried. It did, and Sri Lanka have broken the big partnership already. The ball is turning more than yesterday.42nd over: England 131-2 (Root 70, Bairstow 47) There’s nothing like an alarm to wake you up. Root bounces back with a punchy off-drive for four. Oooh. No edge, and it was hitting the stumps, but Root was struck just outside the line of off. Sri Lanka keep their review, and Root smiles that boyish smile of his.Root sweeps and misses, or edges, a full ball. He could be in trouble here if he hasn’t got a nick.It looks as if the first over will be bowled by Dilruwan Perera, who wasn’t at his wily best yesterday. “Hovering around zero here in Piedmont,” says Finbar Anslow. “Still under a foot of snow that fell on Christmas Day. Re the SCG crowd abuse, I was wondering whether there’s any literature on crowd sledging? My memory goes back to a delightful moment at Hove when the future prime minister of Pakistan was offered ‘a glass of scrump’ (declined with a smile). I hope that’s the kind of comment he remembers.” Ha. Whether there’s literature, I’m not sure. There’s certainly plenty of folklore, enough to make a good book. You could call it Declined with a Smile.“Another gorgeous day here in Georgetown (Penang),” says Spencer Robinson. “Last week I revived my long-lost cricket career with my first net in 30 years at the fabulous Penang Sports Club. Despite plenty of aches and bruises, I’ve survived to tell the tale and have been looking forward to a masterclass today from Messrs Root and Bairstow in the art of playing spin bowling. Please stop the rain in Galle!” I’m on it. The covers are off, and the sky is showing some flecks of blue amid the grey.Rumours from Galle suggest that the rain has relented and play will resume at 11.10am local time, which is 5.40 in the UK – ten minutes’ time.“A very good afternoon to you from Singapore,” says Matthew Ayre. “It’s been a miserable start to the year with freakishly high rainfall (even for monsoon season) that started on the 31st and has run nearly incessantly since. Then, a sensational start from England’s bowlers and today – the sun’s out! Glory be, and may it please please continue.” Good to know there’s light at the end of somebody’s tunnel. “Disappointing no play yet.” Paul Hand is speaking for us all. “Here in Almaty, Kazakhstan (GMT+6) at minus 10, I was rather looking forward to a full day of cricket to follow. Stay safe everyone at this uncertain and difficult time.” Amen to that. Almaty! Very classy. If anyone else is thinking of sending an email, do say where you are. And give us a flavour of the weather, especially if it’s even worse than it is in Galle. It’s still raining in Galle, but there’s another Test going on right now – the big showdown in Brisbane between Australia and India, tied on 1-1 with just this game to go. The Indians have so many injuries that they’ve picked a bowling attack with four Test caps between them. And they still managed to get rid of David Warner for hardly any – he’s not just Stuart Broad’s bunny now – and Steve Smith for 36. At tea, Australia are 154 for three, with Marnus Labuschagne, the mini-Smith, looking ominous on 73. Join Emma Kemp for the  OBO here. Joe Root had the day of his dreams yesterday, and Abhijato Sensarma has been thinking about him overnight. “The numbers of the (relatively) young English skipper suggest he’s no longer the prolific batsman everyone assumed he would be at the start of his career.” True, though I would argue with “young” – he’s just turned 30. “But the returns from his captaincy decisions have been growing for a long time even now.” Go on... “Backing Buttler, rotating his seamers, yesterday’s innovative captaincy – he’s slowly on the rise of this gig’s learning curve. There remain a few off-putting moments, like his handling of Archer, but I feel the time shall soon come when he compensates for his diminishing numbers with excellent tactical fortitude. Ah, the India tour is either going to be majestic or an absolute disaster, isn’t it?” Ha. Because he’s so boyish, Root tends to be treated as if he has just taken over. In fact he’s England’s fifth longest-serving captain, on 45 Tests, level with Nasser Hussain. He has got better as a tactician, from a low base. But he has got worse as a batsman, as England captains usually do, and I’m still not convinced that those missing runs are a price worth paying for middling leadership. He has it in him to be England’s best batsman for 50 years: I wish he would just get on and do that. But if he has a few more days like yesterday, and has them in India and Australia, and handles Archer as well as Eoin Morgan does, I’ll be delighted to be proved wrong.If you’re in Britain and up early, you’re not alone. “Good morning Tim.” Good morning, George Browne. “For years I have been cursed to miss the start of play on overseas tours, but I am pleased to say that this is now a thing of the past. One year and ten days ago I became father to beautiful twins, Otis and Cassie (doesn’t Otis Browne sound like a Windies fast bowler?). These two now ensure that I am awake at ungodly hours to witness these key early overs. Hurrah for fatherhood... I think. Keep up the good work.” You too! But as this is , can I just suggest that Cassie Browne also sounds like a Windies fast bowler?It’s raining. Not the forecast thunder, but a steady drizzle, just to make England feel at home.Morning everyone. The pandemic has done funny things to us all. Some have grown their hair, others have applied to join the Stasi, and others still have become vulnerable to modest off-breaks purveyed by bouncy young Englishmen. After winning the toss on a turning pitch beneath Galle’s famous fort, the Sri Lankans collapsed like a sandcastle and handed Dom Bess a sensational five for 30, which even he admitted that he didn’t deserve. Stuart Broad’s three for 20 was, by common consent, a much better performance. England wobbled too, but only briefly, before Joe Root and Jonny Bairstow showed how it’s done with an unbroken partnership of 110. For Dinesh Chandimal, Sri Lanka’s stand-in captain, the task is simple: get rid of them both early on, and stop England’s lead reaching three figures. For Root, it’s even simpler: find 34 more runs to score a Test hundred for the first time in the 2020s. And then add some more, to pile up a lead of 200 and have a fair chance of an innings victory. It would not be unlike England to stage a collapse of their own. They can’t just carry on serenely from the whitewash of 2018, can they?The weather forecast is mixed – steamy with a chance of thunder after tea. Play starts at 10am local time, 4.30am in the UK."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/594186aad579d576ef00b8fafe2383e669c1cf94/275_50_2880_1728/master/2880.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTQucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=f00d49b54acd31194c149ae73fd762a4","title":"joe biden coronavirus stimulus package","story":"Plan includes $160bn in vaccination funds and $1tn in relief to families, including $1,400 stimulus checksJoe Biden has unveiled a $1.9tn coronavirus relief proposal, aimed at urgently combating the pandemic and the economic crisis it has triggered. As the US faces its deadliest stage of the pandemic, Biden described the moment as “a crisis of deep human suffering”.The ambitious, wide-ranging plan includes $160bn to bolster vaccination and testing efforts, and other health programs and $350bn for state and local governments, as well as $1tn in relief to families, via direct payments and unemployment insurance.“There’s no time to waste,” Biden said. “We have to act and we have to act now.”Details of the aid package had been released by Biden’s transition team earlier on Thursday. If adopted, the proposal would tack on $1,400 to the $600 in direct payments for iniduals that Congress approved most recently. “We will finish the job of getting a total of $2,000 in relief to people who need it the most,” Biden said. Supplemental unemployment insurance would also increase to $400 a week from $300 a week and would be extended to September.“During this pandemic, millions of Americans, through no fault of their own, have lost the dignity and respect that comes with a job and a paycheck,” Biden said on Thursday, speaking from Wilmington, Delaware. “There is real pain overwhelming the real economy.”Biden ran on the promise that he would deliver Americans through the coronavirus crisis, and more recently has pledged to ramp up vaccination efforts, and oversee the administering of 100m covid-19 jabs during his first 100 days.Ahead of the president-elect’s inauguration next week, a deeply ided US is also facing an unmitigated public health crisis. More than 385,000 people have died of Covid-19. Meanwhile, weekly unemployment claims have jumped to 965,000. Before the pandemic, the figure was typically about 225,000.With Democrats having gained an edge over Republicans in the Senate, the Democratic leader Chuck Schumer has said Biden’s Covid-19 relief package will be his top priority, even as the legislative body contends with the impeachment trial of Donald Trump.In passing the proposal, Biden has an ally in Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator and former presidential contender, who will soon be at the helm of the powerful Senate budget committee. As chair of the committee, Sanders will have control of budget reconciliation, a process that allows Congress to expedite some legislation.The “rescue plan will begin to provide our people with much-needed support”, Sanders said.Biden has also called on lawmakers to extend a national eviction moratorium, which expires on 31 January.Housing advocates have been pressing Biden to extend and bolster a federal ban on evictions in recent weeks and months, and they have asked him to additionally include funds for rental assistance in relief proposals. His current plan includes $30bn in rental and utility assistance for those struggling to pay bills. Advocates are also asking Congress to cancel any rent or mortgage debt incurred during the pandemic.The president-elect said that while “these plans won’t come cheaply”, a failure to act “will cost us dearly”.Still, several provisions in the president-elect’s plan could face resistance, including his bid to have Congress raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. As a candidate, Biden signaled that raising the minimum wage would be a top priority. But Republicans have long opposed such a move. The Republican Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, blocked a minimum wage increase in 2019, and Republicans filibustered a minimum wage increase effort in 2014.So far the plan has, however, united two diametrically opposed forces – Democratic socialist Sanders and big business. The US Chamber of Commerce, an influential lobbying organization that represents business interests, praised Biden’s proposal.“We applaud the president-elect’s focus on vaccinations and on economic sectors and families that continue to suffer as the pandemic rages on,” the group said in a statement. “We must defeat Covid before we can restore our economy.”The proposal will be Biden’s first test of his ability to work with a ided Congress and make good on his promise to pull the country out of the coronavirus crisis.“Come Wednesday, we begin a new chapter,” Biden said.Trump’s leadership during the pandemic has been erratic. He backed “Operation Warp Speed” to quickly develop vaccines and treatments, but also picked fights with leading government scientists like Dr Anthony Fauci and his own appointees at the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Biden has pledged to take his lead from science, and has named Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, as his top medical adviser. He has tapped businessman Jeff Zients, who has a reputation for successfully tackling complex missions, to coordinate the government’s coronavirus response. He has also selected the Yale medicine professor Dr Marcella Nunez-Smith, to head an effort to ensure equity and fairness for racial and ethnic minorities in access to vaccines and treatments.But he will need more than top-résumé talent, experts say. It is still unclear how the new administration will address the issue of vaccine hesitancy, with many Americans, including a worryingly high percentage of healthcare workers, saying they are wary of getting a shot.Next Wednesday, when Biden will be sworn in as president, marks the first anniversary of the first confirmed case of Covid-19 in the United States."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dcb60ab03ca622691da5195da9d8897a2d11090b/0_221_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=3fd72dd9a8917959fcbd02f47ea956d8","title":"carbon neutrality is a fairy tale how the race for renewables is burning europes forests","story":"Wood pellets are sold as a clean alternative to coal. But is the subsidised bioenergy boom accelerating the climate crisis?Järvik has lived in the Haanja uplands in the southern county of Võru for more than 10 years. His closeness to the forest has shaped his life as a carpenter and the fortunes of the surrounding villages, with their handicraft traditions – a substitute for farming on the poor arable land. Upcountry, travel literature promotes the region to city dwellers, promising its ancient woodlands as a place to rest and reinvigorate the mind.But in 2015, the Estonian government allowed what is known as clear-cutting in some parts of the Haanja nature reserve. The practice involves stripping entire areas of mature forest and removing whole tree trunks. This relaxation of the logging rules came as international demand for Estonian wood soared – not just for furniture or construction, but because of an unlikely culprit: Europe’s renewable energy policies.“Sometimes I can’t bear to go outside,” Järvik says, standing by the stumps left on land stripped by the logging company Valga Puu. The firm is a subsidiary of Graanul Invest Group, Europe’s biggest producer of the wood pellets which are burned on an industrial scale as biomass for heat and light in many of Europe’s former coal-fired power stations.The days Järvik is spared the sound of harvesters have become rare. “You don’t want to leave home, because the landscape has become so impassable, it leaves you feeling anguished. But still the noise comes.”Natura-protected zones are managed under the legally binding provisions of the 1979 EU birds directive and the 1992 habitats directive. But logging is governed by domestic laws, and Estonia permits it as long as it does not damage bogs and other special habitats, or fall within bird mating seasons. Campaigners say that by allowing intensive clear-cutting in Natura 2000 sites, Estonia is in breach of the habitats directive and undermining the EU’s climate goals.Siim Kuresoo of the non-profit Estonian Fund for Nature (ELF) doesn’t just blame the Estonian government. He says there is a direct connection between the subsidised growth in the biomass industry encouraged by EU renewable energy policies and the acceleration of unsustainable Baltic tree-felling. The Council of Estonian Environmental NGOs (EKO), of which the ELF is a member, has made a complaint to the European commission alleging “systematic” breaches by Estonia of its forest conservation obligations.To investigate the subsidised European pellet trade and its impact on Baltic forests, we uploaded boundary files for Estonia’s Natura 2000 zones to Global Forest Watch, an online platform for monitoring forests, and found that per-hectare tree cover loss (the removal of the tree canopy rather than outright deforestation) in these areas accelerated after 2015. That was when the government adjusted park conservation rules to allow clear-cutting of up to one hectare at a time in some nature reserves.This acceleration appears to be taking a toll on bird species like the black grouse, woodlark and others. Woodland birds are declining at a rate of 50,000 breeding pairs a year, according to national records.The clearances are also damaging the ability of Baltic forests to store carbon, and could be undermining climate goals by reducing the chance for Estonia and Latvia to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions. “We convert our trees into pellets and sell them to energy plants in your countries,” says Ivar Raig, one of the Saku campaigners. “This is considered to be sustainable, but we suffer.”Sustainability goes to the heart of the European renewable energy debate. The drive to replace coal, one of the world’s biggest sources of carbon emissions, with cleaner sources of power, is a top priority in the fight against climate change globally.A switch to burning wood in the form of pellets appears to offer a simple and in theory carbon-neutral alternative to coal-fired power stations because trees take up carbon dioxide from the air as they grow. As long as the burned trees are replaced with new plantings, there is no net addition to the stock of carbon in the atmosphere.However, that process of carbon take-up can take many decades. And in the furnace, burning wood releases more carbon dioxide per unit of energy than burning gas, oil, or even coal. By accelerating carbon dioxide emissions in the short term, burning wood for electricity could be fatal for states’ ability to meet the Paris Agreement goal of keeping global heating to well below 2C by 2050.A flaw in the legislation meant that woody biomass was fully categorised as renewable, even if it came not just from wood residues or waste, but from whole trees. This meant that companies could directly harvest forests for pellets – rather than making pellets from the by-products of timber cut for other uses – in the name of sustainable forest management.As the EU moved in 2018 to double the use of renewable energy by 2030, scientists warned the European Parliament that this loophole in the sustainability criteria of the revised EU legislation would accelerate the climate crisis and devastate mature forests. But against the competing interests of the multibillion euro biomass lobby, it went unamended.When Raul Kirjanen founded Graanul Invest in 2003, it was just him and his computer in a small office. By 2005 the company had opened its first factory in Imavere, Estonia, compressing sawdust and the waste wood from other processes into tiny pellets that could be bagged up and shipped overseas for burning in everything from domestic heaters to vast power plants to generate electricity.Today the European wood pellet trade is booming. Graanul Invest is the second biggest wood pellet maker in the world and Kirjanen is one of the richest people in the Baltics where the Estonian press call him “the pellet king”. In 2019, the company manufactured 2.5m tonnes of pellets, up from 1.8m tonnes the previous year, across its plants in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and the US.Every month tens of thousands of tonnes of wood pellets leave the port of Riga to cross the North Sea on Graanul Invest’s vessel, the MV Imavere. Much of this cargo is bound for the port of Immingham, where it is transported to UK power stations including Drax, which has converted four of its six units from coal to biomass since 2013 and is now the world’s largest biomass burning plant. The UK accounts for more than a third of Graanul’s annual revenue. Denmark, the Netherlands and Italy are also target markets.But electricity production from wood pellets would not be financially sustainable without public subsidies: the British government paid Drax the equivalent of €2.4m (£2.1m) a day in 2019. Drax will have received more than €11.2bn (£10bn) from the UK government since its conversion to biomass in 2012 until subsidies run out in 2027, researchers from the Ember have calculated.Other European governments are following suit. In the Netherlands, the government has promised energy companies RWE, Uniper and Onyx (formerly Engie) more than €3.5bn in subsidies to use biomass, making the country one of the biggest importers of wood pellets in Europe. Campaigners are anxiously watching Germany, where Onyx Power, a subsidiary of the US hedge fund Riverstone, is examining the possibility of converting coal plants to biomass. “Biomass only exists at the scale that it does because of subsidies,” says Duncan Brack, associate fellow at the London-based thinktank Chatham House. “We’re effectively paying to increase carbon emissions in the atmosphere, which is an absurd use of public money.”Brack says that the 2009 EU renewable energy directive triggered a raft of subsidies for renewable power generation. “But since then solar and wind have really crashed in price. Now is the time to stop subsidising biomass.”“There’s huge infrastructure employing people and spending money, all based on subsidies,” says Michael Norton of the European Academies’ Science Advisory Council (EASAC). “The original simplistic idea of bioenergy from sustainable forestry suddenly blossomed into an industry achieving the opposite of what it was meant to do.”In November 2020 we visited the Haanja nature park to verify the accelerated felling suggested by satellite data. Travelling south through the park, we passed small villages made up of wooden houses, wide black lakes and cows grazing in pastures. Near Vakari village our van took a left, passing wetlands surrounded by birch trees, and turned on to a stretch of road in a clearing. It was as if someone had carefully cut out rectangles of forest. A sign said the plot was owned by Valga Puu.Since 2016, more than 100 hectares (247 acres) of forest in the Haanja park have been felled on land owned by Graanul Invest Group, a significant increaseon the previous five years, when less than 20 hectares (49.4 acres) was felled, according to Global Forest Watch. We checked their data against our own analysis of high-resolution Google satellite images and corroborated it on the ground. In practice, the method means leaving mostly stumps in the harvested patch. In the nature reserve, a few trees stand sentinel, part of Graanul Invest’s efforts to maintain bioersity.Graanul has been able to accelerate tree felling on the protected lands because Estonia’s Nature Conservation Act ides it into three zones: strict nature reserve, conservation zone, and limited management or buffer zone. Human intervention is prohibited in the first two limited economic activities by landowners, including logging, are allowed in the buffer zones. Clear-cutting in buffer zones must still comply with the EU habitats directive. Official literature from its logging subsidiary Valga Puu tells a different story. “Our goals for 2020 are related to the supply of Graanul Invest plants,” the company says in its latest annual report. We put this to Valga Puu’s chief executive, Andres Olesk. “Not the best wording,” he responded.Harvesting old and poorly managed forests can increase the ability of the forest to hold carbon and improve the habitat for small birds and mammals, according to the European commission. This could be the case in Estonia, where much of the woodland grew naturally 70 years ago on farmland left behind by Estonians who were killed or deported from rural areas during the second world war. “The share of low-quality timber in Estonian forests has always been high due to the fact that during the Soviet era the forests were not managed at all,” Marku Lamp, deputy secretary general of the Estonian ministry of the environment, says. “This has in some ways been an opportunity to sell the low-quality stock.”Robert Matthews, a UK climate scientist whose team carried out some of the research underpinning the revised EU Renewable Energy Directive, describes the idea of low-quality wood as “the sting in the tail”. “What is low-quality wood? It’s almost like a get out of jail free card.”Graanul Invest replanted 1.5m trees in 2019, according to its annual report. Birch, a deciduous tree, is the dominant species across the 55,000 hectares (136,000 acres) in the company’s portfolio, but Graanul Invest replants 1.7 times more coniferous types such as spruce, a fast-growing species that the company says can “improve the carbon sequestration capability” of forests. Even so, it takes years for these tiny spruces to grow large enough to extract or sequester the carbon that is emitted by cutting them down – a problem known as carbon debt.It takes decades or even centuries for whole trees, unlike corn or other biomass crops, to regrow, says Massimiliano Patierno, an environmental engineer at the International Institute of Law and Environment. “If we count a period of, say, 40 years, in which the new trees have cancelled the carbon debt, then yes, that biomass can be seen as carbon-neutral,” he says. “But if we consider a very short period of time, it is likely that the carbon debt will not be cancelled.”Dr Mary Booth at the Partnership for Policy Integrity says that if the wood or forestry residues burned for electricity were instead left to decompose on the soil, they would emit carbon dioxide more gradually. “The accumulated net impact of such emissions likewise speeds warming,” she says.The latest felling in the Natura 2000 part of the Haanja nature park took place recently in a forest that was 70 years old and home to a number of different species, Siim Kuresoo says. Experts hold that generally, the more erse the forest, the greater the variety of animals and plants it can host. Žiga Malek, assistant professor in land use and ecosystem dynamicsat Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam, says: “The vegetation that was there before protected the soil from being eroded.” Clear-cutting is allowed in Natura 2000 areas as long as it does not conflict with local conservation rules, Malek adds. “In this case it would mean minimum disturbance,” he says. “Which this is not.” Replanted forests can provide climate benefits, he adds, but they cannot fully replace the lost forest ecosystem. Altering the forest type can also affect the amount of carbon stored in the ground. Mature and closer-to-natural forests sequester more carbon in the long run, due to a healthier ground biomass, Malek says. “Even if the clear-cut area is planted with one fast-growing species, it will not be as effective in terms of carbon sink as the more nature-like forest would in the long term.” Kirjanen says his company is not doing anything out of the ordinary. In an email, he said that the “awesome” Estonian timber industry is the largest employer in rural areas because it has been able to grow and compete internationally. Almost all Europe’s existing forests are the result of “forest management” of a similar kind. “If we want our forests to be like this in the future, they must be managed,” he said. “Many protected areas in national parks are semi-natural communities, and without maintenance, conservation values often disappear.”There are signs that the EU intends to tighten the rules around what wood can be harvested as renewable energy. An expert group convened by the European commission recently recommended that biomass should be considered sustainable only if it comes from feedstocks listed in an annexe of the renewable energy directive, including bark and sawdust, and “pre-commercial forest thinnings”, apart from sawn logs. Graanul Invest says that if there is demand for wood as in other fields, it makes sense to use the waste material both from forestry and the wood industry for useful applications – including energy. But scientists and campaigners say we simply don’t have time to cut down trees for energy production if we are going to meet climate goals. “The urgency has completely changed in the last 15 years,” Michael Norton says. “We don’t have until 2070 – emissions have to come down sooner. Biomass that increases carbon emissions in the next 10 to 30 years is not compatible with climate change policy.”Back in the Haanja nature park, Kuresoo says it will take many decades for the trees that have been felled to date to grow back to their former size. “This idea of carbon neutrality is a fairy tale,” he says. “Climate change is already happening. We should be planting trees instead of taking them down.”This article is based on Money to Burn, a cross-border investigative project led by the Dutch public investigative journalism platform Argos and supported by Investigative Journalism for Europe.

Ministers announced this week that they would be distributed to all 317 local authorities in England.However, experts have repeatedly raised concerns about the accuracy of the devices made by Innova.The tests are specifically designed for use on people with Covid-19 symptoms and are most effective at identifying those with high viral loads, who are the most infectious. They are supposed to be administered only by trained professionals.The quick turnaround time means the tests can find positive cases that would not otherwise have come to light. However, many experts are concerned that people who test negative will presume they are safe to get involved in activities with others, or visit vulnerable and elderly people, with some saying this week that they may cause serious harm.The MHRA is understood to have expressed similar concerns to officials in Matt Hancock’s Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) on Tuesday, a week after the rollout began in secondary schools.Sources said the regulator made clear that it had not given the green light to the daily use of these tests on pupils who would otherwise have to self-isolate.Prof Jon Deeks, a biostatistician of the University of Birmingham and Royal Statistical Society, described the use of rapid tests in this context as “ridiculous and dangerous” and welcomed the MHRA’s stance.He said: “It is really important that we have confidence in the safety and effectiveness of tests for Covid-19 and all other diseases - this is the responsibility of our regulator.“This clarification of the unsuitability of lateral flow tests for saying people are not infected with SARS-CoV-2 from the MHRA demonstrates that they are taking their responsibility seriously to ensure that tests are used in a safe way.“The government needs to take greater care in ensuring they evaluate the potential harms as well as the benefit of all their mass testing proposals.”The decision is a another setback for the prime minister’s mass-testing plan and raises questions about the proposed full return of schools after the February half-term, which is partly dependent on the availability of serial testing.The government could apply for an exceptional use authorisation from the MHRA but this would take time and it is far from clear that it would be approved.Any further distribution of the daily tests may also be on the condition that people are warned more explicitly about the risks, instead of a negative result being presented as a “green light” that they are Covid-free.Williamson stressed the importance of repeat testing when he appeared before MPs on the Commons education select committee on Wednesday. He also said parents of primary school children would be expected to carry out the tests on their child at home – a suggestion likely to raise alarm bells at the MHRA, which has not approved self-administered tests in this way.Williamson said: “Testing is a really important part of bringing people back into school. It’s an important part of fighting Covid-19 right across the community.“If we’re testing a child, in essence we’re in a position where we’re also testing a household as well. We’re extending staff testing as of next week to primary schools and I would like to see it rolled out to all pupils, that’s my ambition – that’s where I want us to get to.”A spokesperson for the DHSC said: “Lateral flow devices are a vital tool to finding more asymptomatic cases and the government’s approach to testing in schools will reduce transmission.“We are testing teachers and students weekly on site to find positive cases and break the chains of transmission. In addition, as part of an ongoing evaluation, we are doing daily contact testing in schools using an assisted testing model. “The evidence and lessons from these and other evaluations will be used to inform our review of the effect of daily contact testing on breaking chains of transmission and any future plans.” The MHRA has also been approached for comment but had not responded by the time of publication."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dada28673a37f89c61e27dadd51281558c91b13e/0_281_4950_2971/master/4950.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=d0b3db14467c6e0835359bb19d3e8147","title":"coming of age day japan covid in pictures","story":"Young adults gathered in Japan to celebrate reaching 20, the age at which they can drink alcohol, smoke and get married without parental approval, although many events were cancelled due to coronavirus fears"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9f77eb3c5a353b5b61b89766c65c5fbc28c5f37/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9cf6a492e5951bf9c0270bf293288427","title":"western saharas diplomatic opening dakhla in pictures","story":"US plans to open a consulate in Western Sahara mark a turning point for the disputed territory.

Staff will not have to restrict their movements if the second test is negative, rather than having to wait 14 days.Assistant chief medical officer Dr Ronan Glynn said a similar change may be applied to contacts in the general population if case numbers were to drop significantly.A further 28 deaths of Covid-19 patients were reported by the National Public Health Emergency Team yesterday. This brings to 2,488 the total number of deaths in the pandemic.A total of 26 of these deaths occurred in January, while the dates of two deaths remain under investigation.Nphet also reported 3,955 new confirmed cases of the disease, bringing to 163,057 the total number of cases in the Republic.Of the new cases, 1,210 are in Dublin, 456 in Cork, 235 in Louth, 221 in Meath and 218 in Limerick, with the remaining 1,615 cases spread across all other counties.InfectsThe reproduction number, a measure of how many other people a case infects, now stands at 1-1.3, according to Prof Philip Nolan, chairman of the Nphet epidemiological modelling advisory group.He said that from an epidemiological perspective, the current wave was different to what had been seen since spring, “and perhaps worse”.“The penetration of the virus throughout all ages of the population is a particular cause for serious concern, as is risk of severe disease that all of these people face. Poor health outcomes, risk of serious or long-term illness and hospitalisation remain a risk for us all when it comes to Covid-19. That is why we must follow public health advice and protect not only ourselves but our hospital system and healthcare workers by staying at home.Of the 208 deaths so far this month, 23 were linked to outbreaks in hospitals and 38 to outbreaks in nursing homes. Those who died ranged in age from 25 to 98. Of the 132 people who died on January 6th-12th, 92 per cent were over 65, and the mean age was 79, officials said.ChallengedAccording to Prof Nolan, people have worked hard to reduce contacts and the impact of this was beginning to be felt in the figures. However, the hospital system would continue to be challenged over the coming weeks and there were also concerns about outbreaks in specific settings.Almost half of all cases reported during the entire pandemic occurred in the past fortnight, he pointed out. One in every 67 people have tested positive in this time.The incidence of the disease now is 20 times what it was in early December, while the number of deaths each day has risen from four to 23.The more transmissible variant first identified in the UK in December now accounts for 46 per cent of samples sequenced by Irish labs, officials told a Nphet briefing yesterday.Dr Cillian De Gascun, director of the National Virus Reference Laboratory, said it was not unusual for viruses to mutate over time, and two of the three recently identified variants from the UK and South Africa were in Ireland.“While some of the new variants will increase the risk of becoming infected because they have increased transmissibility – they can stick longer and better to surfaces – this does not mean that our continued adherence to the public health advice is in any way less effective.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4458651.1610649544!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the social worker said were two seconds of pleasure worth it for all this","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tStephanie Walsh was asked in 1971 if her family would offer a temporary home to a young pregnant girl. Photograph: Diarmuid GreeneLast week Stephanie Walsh wrote in The  about how she was asked in 1971 if her family would offer a temporary home to a young pregnant girl, as an alternative to the girl going to a mother and baby homes.“I had just given birth to our third child when the 17-year-old pregnant schoolgirl came to live with us, acting as an au pair. The girl and her parents wished for her pregnancy to be kept secret. This was the climate of the early 1970s.“This girl was part of our family until her baby was born,” she wrote. Later the young mother, following discussions with Walsh, her own parents and a social worker, decided to have the baby adopted.“At that time it seemed the best option for the baby and the mother. In the Ireland of the time, single pregnant girls had few choices.”She was not alone. Elaine O’Malley, then in her early 20s, and her husband, who live in Co Limerick, offered a home to five young women – some in their early 20s, one under 17 – between 1979 and 1983.Following an inspection by a social worker, “it went from there”, she says. No money was exchanged. The girls stayed for up to six months, had their own room and helped out around the house and with babysitting.“They were very much part of the house. They ate with us, watched television with us, were part of the family. I smoked at the time, so we smoked together, and went on days out on Sundays, and on weekends away.”The O’Malleys never asked the women their stories, but the women shared over time. One, who had recently lost her father, did not want to hurt her bereaved mother by telling her she was pregnant. One told her family that she had got a job elsewhere.“The youngest was still at school. Another had a boyfriend who visited. “We knew these girls were going through hell,” she says. Once a girl ran away. When she came back, the social worker came to see her.O’Malley was in the room with the two of them for the meeting. “I can still remember what the social worker said to the girl. She said, ‘Was it really worth it? Was two seconds of pleasure worth it for all this?’ ”AdoptionThe O’Malleys drove the women to the maternity hospital, where their social worker met them. “I visited every day after that.” It was understood that the babies would be given up for adoption, but the women did have six months to change their minds.O’Malley was present for the handing over of one baby. “The girl and the baby and a nun went into a room, and then the girl came out without her baby.” O’Malley had lost a baby to infant mortality, so she understood profound grief.“The difference was, my baby died. I didn’t have to give him up,” she says. “I found watching that handover heartbreaking. Those girls were not giving up their babies by choice. There wasn’t another option open to them.”Afterwards, the girls stayed with the O’Malleys for a week or 10 days, to try and adjust. “We wanted them to stay longer, but after a week or so the social worker would come out and say, ‘It’s time to get back to your life now.’“We had been told from the beginning by the social worker that we’d never hear from these girls again once they left that we were part of a past they would want to forget,” she says. “We think of those girls who lived with us so often, especially this week.”The social workerBridget, who prefers not to be identified, was a social worker in the west of Ireland for 25 years from the late 1970s. She was one of two who worked full time with women facing crisis pregnancies: “My abiding memory of that work is grief,” she says.“That has stayed with me. I feel this inside in the marrow of my bones, because everyone I worked with had grief. People who couldn’t have a baby – I’m talking about adoptive applicants – they had terrible grief.“The women who placed babies for adoption I can’t even begin to describe the grief of that loss. And the adopted children not knowing who you are really is the biggest loss of all. Although who can say what is the biggest loss of all?“Mothers would have come to us in a state over their daughters being pregnant,” she says. “I don’t ever remember a father coming in: by that, I mean the father of the pregnant girl. I don’t ever remember a boyfriend of a girl coming.“It was always a woman, whether it was the girl by herself. Sometimes they didn’t tell their parents. Or sometimes it was a friend of the girl came with her a girlfriend. The men were absent.”Mostly they were in their 20s and 30s. Many of them worked full time and were terrified they would lose their jobs. No matter what age they were, she says, it was “very difficult for anyone to keep a baby unless they had support from home, and support from home wasn’t always there”.In all, her adoption agency dealt with 400 cases. Sometimes Bridget had to be the one to deliver the news of the pregnancy to a parent.“I remember one girl couldn’t face her mother. She just couldn’t tell her. So she asked me if I would tell her.“So I wrote to her mother and asked if she would meet me. And she did. I told her that her daughter was pregnant. And she said, ‘I would prefer if you had told me she had cancer.’ And those were the days when a cancer diagnosis more than likely meant death, in people’s heads.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4458778.1610666359!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"josepha madigan apologises for normal children comment","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister of State with responsibility for Special Education Josepha Madigan’s comment was criticised by Forsa’s Andy Pike. File photograph: Crispin Rodwell Minister of State with responsibility for Special Education Josepha Madigan has on Thursday apologised over comments describing children who do not have additional education needs as “normal”. Earlier on Thursday, the Government announced it would reopen special schools and primary classes for children with additional needs from next Thursday, January 21st. The decision followed meetings between school staff unions and the Department of Education, and was welcomed by disability advocacy organisations. But speaking about the reopening of special schools in the Dáil, Ms Madigan said: “We all know that even for normal children remote teaching is difficult, but for children who have additional needs it is particularly difficult.” Her description of children without additional needs as “normal” was immediately criticised on social media. “I sincerely apologise for my language. It is absolutely not what I meant to say,” Ms Madigan later said in a post on Twitter. Ms Madigan’s apology came in response to a tweet from Andy Pike, head of education at the Forsa trade union, who said: “There are no normal or abnormal children. There are just children. All of whom are different and some have additional needs. Hope the Minister will clarify her statement.”Ms Madigan concluded her response to Mr Pike by saying: “Looking forward to continued co-operation into the future”.Earlier, when she spoke in the Dáil, Ms Madigan said the Covid-19 pandemic “tore up many of our best laid plans” to a certain extent. “Anyway, it is a positive development today because we will see special schools - they are the schools with the children who have the most severe and complex needs - reopen next Thursday. There are ongoing discussions in terms of the logistics and practicalities that need to be worked out. All the resources will be given to special classes children in mainstream as well as in special schools so that they can reopen successfully with essential workers and continue.”She had been responding to Fine Gael TD Emer Higgins who said: “We are the only First World country in the entire globe in which special schools are closed at this time. Ireland is the only country whose special needs children were caught up in a stalemate with unions.

As the US faces its deadliest stage of the pandemic, Mr Biden described the moment as “a crisis of deep human suffering”.The ambitious, wide-ranging plan includes $160 billion (€132bn) to bolster vaccination and testing efforts, and other health programs and $350billion (€288bn) for state and local governments, as well as $1tn (€824bn) in relief to families, via direct payments and unemployment insurance.“There’s no time to waste,” Mr Biden said. “We have to act and we have to act now.”Details of the aid package had been released by Mr Biden’s transition team earlier on Thursday. If adopted, the proposal would tack on $1,400 (€1,150) to the $600 (€494) in direct payments for iniduals that Congress approved most recently. “We will finish the job of getting a total of $2,000 (€1,647) in relief to people who need it the most,” Mr Biden said.Supplemental unemployment insurance would also increase to $400 (€330) a week from $300 (€247) a week and would be extended to September.“During this pandemic, millions of Americans, through no fault of their own, have lost the dignity and respect that comes with a job and a paycheck,” Mr Biden said on Thursday, speaking from Wilmington, Delaware. “There is real pain overwhelming the real economy.”Mr Biden ran on the promise that he would deliver Americans through the coronavirus crisis, and more recently has pledged to ramp up vaccination efforts, and oversee the administering of 100 million Covid-19 jabs during his first 100 days.In advance of the president-elect’s inauguration next week, a deeply ided US is also facing an unmitigated public health crisis. More than 385,000 people have died of Covid-19. Meanwhile, weekly unemployment claims have jumped to 965,000. Before the pandemic, the figure was typically about 225,000.With Democrats having gained an edge over Republicans in the Senate, the Democratic leader Chuck Schumer has said Mr Biden’s Covid-19 relief package will be his top priority, even as the legislative body contends with the impeachment trial of Donald Trump.In passing the proposal, Mr Biden has an ally in Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator and former presidential contender, who will soon be at the helm of the powerful Senate budget committee. As chair of the committee, Mr Sanders will have control of budget reconciliation, a process that allows Congress to expedite some legislation.The “rescue plan will begin to provide our people with much-needed support”, Mr Sanders said.Mr Biden has also called on politicians to extend a national eviction moratorium, which expires on January 31st.Housing advocates have been pressing Biden to extend and bolster a federal ban on evictions in recent weeks and months, and they have asked him to additionally include funds for rental assistance in relief proposals. His current plan includes $30 billion (€25bn) in rental and utility assistance for those struggling to pay bills. Advocates are also asking Congress to cancel any rent or mortgage debt incurred during the pandemic.The president-elect said that while “these plans won’t come cheaply”, a failure to act “will cost us dearly”. – Four people have died after supporters of outgoing US president Donald Trump invaded the US Capitol in an extraordinary attack on the heart of American democracy on Wednesday.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons january 2021","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlTo order The 2020 limited-edition Matt Christmas jigsaw, go to telegraphcartoonjigsawsOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514. To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Politics latest news: Schools unlikely to reopen after half term, warns education committee chairmanEngland\u0026#39s new lockdown rules - and the stricter measures being consideredCoronavirus latest news: Brazil travel ban needed to stop UK \u0026#39tripping up at last moment\u0026#39Donald Trump\u0026#39s impeachment timeline – what could happen next?Watch: Healthcare workers save thousands of vaccines after power cut Boris Johnson considers post-Brexit changes to rules on 48-hour working week Grand Canyon helicopter crash that killed five Britons caused by \u0026#39violent gust of wind\u0026#39, report concludes150,000 fingerprints, DNA and arrest records deleted from police database in tech blunderHave you had the Covid vaccine or due to get one?

And that accusation you spoke about is centred around a view that there is a liberal metropolitan view governing editorial decisions.“The easy way to combat that is to have a very erse group of people involved in making those decisions, and then you make better decisions.”Asked if he believed that the BBC was guilty of Brexit bias, Mr Sharp said: “No, actually, I don’t. I think there were certain occasions where the representation was unbalanced. So if you ask me, did I think that Question Time seemed to have more Remainers than Brexiteers? The answer was yes.“But in terms of the breadth of the coverage, I think it was incredibly balanced.”Impartiality is “clearly the biggest issue” for the BBC, Mr Sharp said. And while both sides of the political debate bring “confirmation bias in terms of rational thinking and emotions”, he criticised the corporation for being overly defensive of its output.“The BBC certainly, to my dissatisfaction, has adopted the ad hominem defence, which is: ‘We are the BBC, therefore it’s impartial.’ I do think you have to look at the evidence and what you’re being accused of, and ask yourself the hard questions.“The BBC should be its own toughest critic on impartiality, it shouldn’t be instinctively defensive. It should say, ‘somebody intelligent has accused us of being impartial we are going to look at it objectively and form a view.”Mr Sharp said he had enjoyed Roadkill, the drama written by Sir David Hare, the Left-wing playwright, and starring Hugh Laurie (below) as a corrupt politician intent on privatising the NHS.“Clearly, in producing those four episodes of fiction with Conservative villains, that was a partial view that could influence people in the way they view the Conservative Party. Think of a 12- or 13- or 14-year-old watching it,” he said.He described the licence fee as the “least worst” option and told the committee: “I am not in favour of decriminalisation.”His answers prompted Julian Knight, the Tory MP who chairs the committee, to say: “‘No’ to decriminalisation, the BBC’s Brexit coverage wasn’t biased - ‘meet the new boss, same as the old boss’, it feels to me.”Mr Sharp confirmed that he has donated £400,000 to the Conservative Party over the last 20 years. He has an estimated personal fortune of £150 million, and told MPs that he plans to donate his £160,000 BBC salary to charity.In terms of BBC spending, he said: “I would want to see the money spent as though it was yours and mine and my mother’s - very carefully.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"bbc safe unexciting hands fan andy pandy","story":"Richard Sharp\u0027s appearance in front of Thursday’s The Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee (DCMS) was a job interview with a difference. For he was auditioning for a role he’d already got. The pre-appointment hearing of the new BBC Chairman began with committee members flocking to declare their interests, “I am Spartacus” style.“I declare that I was a BBC journalist for five years”, announced Chairman Julian Knight proudly.“I was a BBC News reporter and news studio presenter, puffed John Nicolson of the SNP.“I was a BBC reporter way back in the mists of time”, Steve Brine added hastily. The committee bemoaned Mr Sharp’s CV. Although brimming with Square Mile triumphs, it contained very little journalism.“There are some concerns within the organisation that you and the Director-General have no editorial experience whatsoever”, said Mr Knight. “Are you a regular consumer of BBC output? If so, what type?”“I have been for the whole of my life” Mr Sharp replied, misty-eyed as he reminisced about Listen With Mother, Andy Pandy and The Woodentops.“I was inspired by Raymond Baxter on Tomorrow’s World. I was very disappointed when that programme was stopped.”\u2028Mr Knight looked slightly sceptical if only Mr Sharp’s list had included the BBC’s more recent intellectual highlights like Mrs Brown’s Boys or Mock the Week.“The programmes you’ve mentioned, they all go back a long time!” His subtext was clear – OK, Boomer. Mr Sharp tried name-dropping more recent flagship fare: Fleabag, Line of Duty – “and who doesn’t enjoy the David Attenborough series?”The Chairman still looked unconvinced, and in truth, Sharp’s choices were a little obvious. Name-checking Attenborough when you’re the incoming BBC chairman felt a bit like interviewing for an English degree having only read the Great Gatsby. Steve Brine seemed keen to test Sharp’s ‘yoof’ credentials – and burnish his own.“Do you know what Dude Perfect is?” he said, mentioning a YouTube channel beloved by Gen-Zers everywhere. John Nicolson fumed as Mr Sharp’s donations to the Conservative Party were unveiled – “£2,500 in the last 10 years”, £400,000 between 2001 and 2010. (Where had David Cameron gone wrong, I wondered?)“That, of course, was during the worst of the austerity programme”, said Mr Nicolson, seething with performative incredulity.“You’d £400,000 in spare cash and you thought that the most deserving recipient was the Conservative Party? You could have given it to charity, you could have given it to homeless people – you could have given it to CHILDREN ... ” Cue a pathos-laden violin accompaniment, but he had not reckoned on Mr Sharp’s wide-ranging open-handedness.“I have given substantially more to cancer-fighting entities”, retorted the Chairman-elect.“In fact, the amount I have given to charities dwarfs the amount I’ve given to political donations, if that’s the question you’re asking”, he said with a whisper of sarcasm.You could almost see a thought bubble reading: ‘You walked right into that one, sonny!’ forming above his head.Like Trevor MacDonald lamenting the plight of Bosnian orphans – the sort of dispatch that usually starts: “THESE were the lucky ones …” – Mr Nicolson delivered a second heart-rending monologue, this time about equal pay disputes.For a second I was transported from the Committee room to war-torn Sarajevo.“It’s not a fair struggle if the BBC has unlimited cash, and they’re up against somebody who has to fund herself. That’s not a fair battle.” An awkward silence followed. “That’s a question. Do you agree?”In truth, little stuck to Mr Sharp, even after the proverbial had been brought into close contact with the fan.He fluently deployed trendy corporate jargon and phrases like “matrix of ersity”.The licence fee, he added, was the least-worst model, although when we next get a chance to review ... it may be worth reassessing.He suavely ducked questions of Brexit bias. Between his pleasant demeanour and carefully bland answers, all this proved disappointing to the jaded committee hacks. Evidently expecting a firebrand or Tory Shires dinosaur, what they got was much less exciting. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"hong kongs rule law extinguished","story":"In 2019, Martin Lee QC and the barrister Dr Margaret Ng were jointly awarded the International Bar Association’s Human Rights Award for their lifelong defence of freedom, democracy and the rule of law in Hong Kong. The following year, in April 2020, they and 13 other democracy activists in Hong Kong were arrested for having taken part in “unauthorised assemblies” to protest against the erosion and abuse of the rights of the people of Hong Kong by the Chinese government.Their trial will be held later this year and a prominent British Queen’s Counsel, David Perry, has been instructed. However, far from defending his fellow barristers in what will be a trial that has been initiated for political reasons, Mr Perry has agreed to lead for the prosecution. Mr Perry is a distinguished barrister whose career has concentrated on prosecution rather than defence. He has appeared before in Hong Kong courts when he led the prosecution against a former chief executive who was charged with serious corruption.I do not question Mr Perry’s integrity but I have no hesitation in criticising his judgment in agreeing to lead for the prosecution at the forthcoming trial. Mr Perry, so far as I am aware, has no political axe to grind. He may believe that, as someone who has prosecuted in Hong Kong courts before, it is reasonable that he should be asked to do so on this occasion, and equally reasonable that he should accept. If that is his view, he is displaying a naivety and insensitivity of a high order.What is clear to me from the circumstances is that this trial is not taking place just because the defendants are believed to have broken the law and should be punished, if found guilty. It is taking place because of the determination of the Chinese government to destroy the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong.That this is a political trial is easy to demonstrate. The alleged offences took place in 2019. The defendants, although well known, were not arrested and charged in 2019. It was not until six months later that they were, suddenly, arrested and charged. This was clearly the result of a political decision taken by the Chinese and Hong Kong authorities.It is being suggested that Mr Perry had no choice but to accept the brief to prosecute because of the barrister’s “cab-rank rule”. This requires that a barrister should take the first set of instructions they receive, regardless of who the client is.That argument will not wash. The rule does not apply to instructions received from a foreign government or from abroad, when the barrister can use his discretion. In any event, few would object if Mr Perry declined to act because he had genuine issues of conscience that led him to decline to be responsible for the prosecution of defendants in a trial that was only being held for political reasons.After all, during the First and Second World Wars, conscientious objectors were permitted to refuse to do military service. If that was acceptable when the nation’s freedom was at stake, it would hardly be unavailable to a barrister who recognised that he was, probably, being instructed solely to lend a veneer of respectability to an otherwise show trial.It is true that Hong Kong still has courts and judges that are not, yet, subject to the political control exercised in mainland China. There they do not have the rule of law but rule by law, where peaceful protest is criminalised by laws designed for that purpose. However, the Chinese government has imposed on Hong Kong a National Security law that is incompatible with any country or territory that enjoys the rule of law.British judges who sit on the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal are considering withdrawing because of the damage that Beijing has already done to the rule of law in Hong Kong. Lady Hale, the former president of the Supreme Court, admitted she would have “a serious moral question to ask myself” if she agreed to sit on the bench in Hong Kong cases.If that is true for British judges, it must also be true for British barristers. If Mr Perry feels he must appear in this trial he should offer his services for the defence and not for the prosecution.Sir Malcolm Rifkind is a former foreign secretary and was responsible for the final stage of the negotiations for the return of Hong Kong to China  More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"new york experiences another coronavirus surge anonymous doctor","story":"The patient lay prone on the emergency room bed. His oxygen levels – registering far below a healthy 95 per cent –  were cause for concern but he was still able to breathe on his own. “Is this one for ICU?” the attending doctor asked his supervisor as he pulled open the paper-thin blue hospital curtain. “No, just monitor him on 100 per cent oxygen for now,” replied the head of the ER, a pulmonology specialist at a community hospital in New York, who has treated hundreds of Covid-19 patients since the outbreak crippled the city in March. “We had been trained to intubate, intubate, intubate when a patient gets into difficulty,” said the ER chief, who manages a floor of 25 beds. “That’s what we were doing until we figured out it was killing people. Looking back, we definitely could have prevented so many deaths by not putting people on ventilators.”The  returned to the emergency room of a hospital in New York City it visited during the height of the first wave of the pandemic in mid-April. The doctor allowed us rare access to show the reality of what frontline workers have been facing, but on condition that neither he nor the hospital were named.As New York experiences another surge, the doctor said the hospital was once again close to capacity. However, this time around he was not so fearful.“The disease has changed,” the doctor told The . “It’s much less dramatic than what we were seeing, far fewer are dying,” he said.“I used to walk into the ER past the freezer truck morgues parked outside the entrance and for the first time in my career I was scared. Every day we were seeing death. Now we’re in the heart of the second phase, but we’re much more confident.”Back in April, the ward was unnervingly quiet. Every bed was taken up by patients who lay unconscious as intubation tubes did their work. There was a palpable sense of panic among the physicians, who could not figure out what they were doing wrong.During the last visit, the prone patient in the corner (a man in his mid-40s) let out a stirring cough before taking a sharp intake of breath. The ward was now a cacophony of sound, a comforting sign of life.The man has been in for five days now and his condition has neither improved, nor deteriorated to the point of needing a ventilator.“We have learned not to overreact when oxygen levels drop,” the doctor explained. “We were too keen to put people on ventilators when that should have been the last resort.”According to research published in medical journal Clinical Infectious Diseases, ICU patients receiving mechanical ventilation had a 70 per cent mortality rate, compared to 21 per cent of hospitalised patients not requiring intubation.Managing a patient on a ventilator is a time-consuming, delicate task that requires caregivers to monitor and adjust the amount of oxygen they are receiving, the pressure in their lungs and the time between breaths, among other factors, the study noted.When hospitals in New York, China, and Italy were swamped with patients early in the pandemic, that simply was not possible.The ventilator tubes also inflame tissue, which can interfere with breathing, and make it much more difficult for a patient to recover if they are taken off.Doctors now believe intubation should only be done in extreme cases and, where possible, a patient should be given a less intrusive course of 100 per cent oxygen.Patients in the UK on ventilators, in a video taken at the end of last April: The doctor, who himself contracted the virus shortly after our visit, said the number of patients the hospital was placing on ventilators had fallen from two or three a day to two or three a week.Some 30-35 per cent of the hospital’s 110 ER and ICU patients are in with Covid-19. Back in April, the percentage hovered around 98 per cent.The doctor said fewer than five per cent of Covid-19 patients he has treated over the last month have died, a decline from nearly 30 per cent in Spring.In April and May, the state’s daily death tolls were regularly exceeding 700. On Thursday, it recorded 144 deaths. “Whatever is going around New York now has less efficacy, it’s like we’re seeing a much weaker strain of the virus,” the doctor said, who cautioned that he could not speak for other parts of the country. California, by comparison, recorded 442 deaths on Thursday, having been spared the worst of it in Spring.The doctor compared what the UK was seeing now with what New York saw during the first wave. “It’s like they are experiencing what we did in reverse,” he said. The non-stop wailing of ambulance sirens, the lines outside hospitals. We were there, but, for now at least, we\u0027re not now.New York got its spring surge under control by implementing widespread testing, contact tracing, as well as phased lockdowns. Leaders also developed consistent messaging about necessary precautions.Where New York City, which has a similar population size and density to London, set the terms of its own lockdown, the UK capital’s response depended mostly on guidelines set for the entire country.The doctor also noted a drop in the average age of patients in his ER, which may be because a sizable percentage of the city’s over-65s contracted the virus in the first wave and those who did not have mostly been sheltering in place.The doctor says his hospital in Brooklyn has seen a spike in hospitalisations since the Thanksgiving and Jewish Rosh Hashanah holidays in November.Earlier this month they admitted a father with his 43-year-old son and a 87-year-old woman with her 94-year-old husband, all of whom had spent Thanksgiving with their families despite advice from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention not to mix households. “We treated them with a cocktail of Remdesiriv, blood thinners and oxygen, and the elderly couple were sent home,” said the doctor, who used to dread receiving older patients as they were more likely to end up on ventilators. “The mortality rate was shocking for a time,” he says.Almost 8,000 Covid-19 patients are now hospitalised across New York State, double the amount reported in just a month ago, and the highest total since May 22, when 19,000 were admitted.Andrew Cuomo, New York Governor, said the state is not yet at a “critical level”, but warned he was prepared to reactivate the 2,500-bed makeshift hospital at the Javits Center if numbers rise any higher.The biggest problem hospitals in New York now face, the doctor warned, is staffing. Private hospitals like his have been forced to lay off higher-paid doctors as they struggle to plug the funding gap left by the huge drop in elective surgeries.Others either quit or retired early amid low morale, reflecting a growing trend across the state. Some 1,000 workers walked off their jobs at health centres in upstate cities of New Rochelle and Albany, complaining of being overworked and given inadequate protection.Mr Cuomo has said potential staff shortages is now a greater concern than available beds for patients. He has even asked hospital officials in the state to identify retired doctors and nurses to help over winter.At the Brooklyn hospital, the ER chief said he has taken to starting his shift at 3am and finishing at 9pm as there is no one to hand over to until late in the evening.“I’m worried what will happen in the new year if we lose any more doctors,” he said. “It’s no good having the treatment if we don’t have the staff to administer it.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"vaccine success brink oftransforming lockdown debate","story":"After almost a year of watching the seemingly unstoppable onslaught of Covid-19, the speed of progress now is hard to take in. Just a few months ago, Chris Whitty, the Chief Medical Officer, was telling colleagues he didn’t believe a vaccine would come in time. Now we have several of them, highly effective, already delivered to millions worldwide. The logistics, the safety: it’s all going as well as can be expected – in Britain, especially. The big question is what happens next.Israel will be the first to give the world an answer. Benjamin Netanyahu, up for re-election in March, is now campaigning as the vaccine king after cutting a deal with Pfizer to make his country the “model state” of the Covid inoculation. He’s offering up vast amounts of anonymised health data, to help Pfizer learn more, and supplies have come rolling in.Israel, a country the size of Wales, will soon be vaccinating as many people a day as Italy, France and Germany put together. Already three-quarters of its over-60s (ie, those most likely to die from the virus) have been protected. The rest will be covered within days, not weeks.Israel won’t see a collapsing R-number or plummeting infections: not for a while, at least. The main vaccine effect should be a breakdown in the link between infections, hospitalisations and deaths. Protecting a small number of people should mean big results, given that the oldest 20 per cent account for 90 per cent of virus fatalities. If all goes as planned, then Israel will have downgraded Covid from a fatal virus to a bug which is nasty, but no longer the killer we have come to know.The vaccine idend should be discernible in Israeli hospitals very soon. Scientists at the Weizmann Institute reckon that the proportion of over-60s in critical care will have roughly halved within two weeks. By Easter, it thinks, most Covid deaths will be eliminated in Israel. It will be the first major country in the world to achieve this.And, all going well, Britain should be the second. Our vaccination programme is still steaming ahead. The Prime Minister’s first deadline – 13 million vaccinations by the middle of next month – remains in sight. Just over half of Britain’s Covid-19 deaths are amongst the over-80s, almost all of whom should have been offered a vaccine within a fortnight. Add another two weeks for the vaccine’s protection to set in, and the number dying from Covid-19 should be half what it would otherwise have been by the end of next month.This is the projection by the Covid-19 Actuaries Response Group, which has had a strikingly good track record since it was set up to monitor the pandemic. If Nadhim Zahawi’s vaccination programme goes roughly to plan, it says, hospital admissions will be half what they’d otherwise be by mid-March. Intensive care admissions would be down by only a third: a lower number because those admitted tend to be younger. But overall, the Covid-19 burden on the health service will look very different very soon.While plenty can still go wrong, ministers remain pretty confident – and more than they let on. Some in government think the official target will be easily surpassed – although they’ve been told never to confess as much in public. Kate Bingham, who masterminded the vaccine procurement programme, almost let the cat out of the bag recently by saying the schedule will be “met – and possibly exceeded”.If she’s right, and if Covid deaths fall by 80 per cent by mid-March, can lockdown restrictions still be justified? Politically, it’s a difficult question and battle lines are already being sketched out. Jonathan Ashworth, the Shadow Health Secretary, has said that we won’t be able to go back to normal “while the virus will still be circulating” – which it’s likely to keep doing throughout the summer. Even with hospital numbers down, he says, Covid-19 can still be a debilitating disease with lasting side effectsAt this point, what would Matt Hancock say? Once everyone likely to die from the virus has been vaccinated, would he be prepared to lift restrictions and be accused of letting the virus rip amongst the young?  I asked him recently and he hinted that he was ready for the fight. “There are many illnesses in the world,” he said. “We have to live our lives.”These words sound odd, coming from a minister who usually argues for tighter lockdown. Only last weekend he was privately arguing it was time to stop people exercising (ie, walking) with a friend. But there’s not necessarily a contradiction. In Israel, it’s argued that tighter lockdowns mean earlier relaxation – because the virus, if it gets out control, slows vaccination. The country’s Covid tsar, Nachman Ash, has said he’s ready to unlock even if virus levels are still high. “Our strategy is to inoculate the people who are at the highest risk,” he said, “so we can open the economy even if the number of infected has still not gone down.”Sceptics grumble that Israel’s example may not be so instructive because it’s unique: a tiny, highly-organised country with the world’s best digitised health records. It doesn’t need to slow things down by asking vaccinated people to wait 15 minutes to see if they suffer an anaphylactic shock: they know who’s at risk because their technology tells them. But the basic theory Israel is testing is that Covid’s power to kill can be stopped quite quickly. That, if proven, will be a universal lesson.Many Tories are getting nervous and want the Prime Minister to commit to relaxing as soon as the top-risk group are vaccinated. But he has an obvious retort: that it’s still a theory. Even Israel is waiting to see what the hospital numbers show, whether the theory pans out. All depends on how the relationship between infection numbers, hospital numbers and deaths really does change. Britain will find out soon, but not for a few weeks.This week, Netanyahu told his Cabinet that it’s precisely because they’re so close to the finish line that they need to keep discipline now. “This is how we will save lives,” he said. “This is how we will be first in the world to emerge from the coronavirus.” It would be quite a boast for Boris Johnson if Britain were to be the second.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"working mother unthanked hero lockdown","story":"Before I launch into this feminist apoplexy, a caveat: almost none of the complaints listed herein apply to me. I am, in terms of lockdown motherhood, about as lucky as a woman can be. I have a job that can be done from home, a husband who pulls his weight, a house big enough for everyone to find a quiet space in which to study, and an au pair who can oversee the children’s home-schooling while we work. None of our children have any mental or physical disabilities, they are all beyond the infant stage of total dependency, and their schools are, this time round, providing a full schedule of live lessons, which keeps them busy for most of the day.This concatenation of luck, privilege and timing makes it possible for a mother to survive lockdown with her career and her sanity intact. But it is vanishingly rare. No wonder most of the mothers I know say they are right at the end of their rope.This pandemic has been gruelling for parents of both sexes. A survey during the first lockdown found that fathers were doing roughly double their usual amount of childcare. But in relative terms, the ision of labour remained stubbornly old-fashioned: mothers still did 2.3 more hours of childcare than fathers, and 1.7 more hours of housework.Working from home is also much harder for mothers, because in most families they are the primary carers. Theirs is the sleeve that gets tugged first, whenever a child is confused or bored or squabbling with a sibling. During the first lockdown, mothers were only able to do one hour of uninterrupted paid work for every three hours done by fathers. They were also – not coincidentally – 43 per cent more likely to have lost or left their job during lockdown.Even as I write, I am distracted by a continuous tinkle of WhatsApp notifications from other parents at my children’s school, struggling to get into Teams or make sense of a homework task. Every single message is from a woman. Some are looking after small babies or disabled children, as well as trying to homeschool and hold down a job. “Too much! All too much!” wails one.And what recourse is there, when it becomes too much? Theoretically, the furlough scheme now extends to parents who can’t juggle work with lockdown childcare. But a TUC survey published this week found that more than 70 per cent of mothers asking to be furloughed for this reason have been refused. The same is true of fathers, but only 167 men have asked, compared with 3,100 women: a disparity that suggests men are still vastly less likely than women to see childcare as their responsibility.But most working mothers don’t want to be furloughed. Some can’t afford a 20 per cent pay cut. Some are afraid that, if they don’t make their presence sufficiently felt, the boss will start to think they are dispensable. Others, knowing that the companies they work for are under strain already, don’t want to be a nuisance. And some simply don’t want to stop doing a job they enjoy.And so the impossible, dreadful acrobatics continue: teaching with one hand, working with the other, and keeping the household aloft on one toe. This pandemic has produced many ordinary heroes. But none, I think, has been more ubiquitous, or less applauded, than the working mother.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"marcus rashford leads calls overhaul","story":"NewsMarcus Rashford leads calls for overhaul of free school meals systemThe footballer joined chefs Jamie Oliver Hugh Fearnley Whittingstall and Tom Kerridge, and actress Emma Thompson in penning a letter to Boris Johnson to demand a full reviewmirrorShareCommentsByLizzy BuchanPolitical Correspondent:,  JAN NewsThe footballer penned a letter to the PM demanding a review \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

In a joint letter, coordinated by the Food Foundation and backed by dozens of education leaders and charities, they said: “This week, we were heartened to see the Department for Education’s swt response to reports of inadequate Free School Meal food parcels being provided by private companies. “The robustness of the message from you and the Secretary of State on this issue was very welcome. They added: “Despite these positive commitments, we strongly feel that nowis the right moment for you to step back and review the policy in more depth.” Their demands include widening eligibility for free school meals, learning lessons from the pandemic, and examining funding and the transparency of contracts with school food providers.

Labouraposs Andrew Gwynne explained he began to feel grotty and run down in March, went on to display Covid- symptoms, and his initial illness lasted for about  days although he still feels the effects today. He is one of a host of people in Britain to report the evolving condition aposlong Covidapos - where long-term symptoms persist months after the initial disease has been shaken off. The MP for Denton and Reddish told the Commons: My condition is not as severe as it was even just a few months back, there have been real improvements, but itaposs been a hard slog to get here. For the first seven months or so the exhaustion came back frequently and to the point where doing just simple tasks around the house brought me out in massive sweats like Iaposd run the London Marathon. Have you been affected by Covid-  Share your thoughts in the comments section I had lots of dizzy spells, Iaposve never had vertigo before this, and oh the brain fog - in a job where you have to be razor sharp, my short-term memory is shot to pieces. Iaposve had to learn to pace myself, trying to push my limits would set me back. I still have to remind myself not to overdo it. Now the lasting symptom is still brain fog.When itaposs bad, taking in information and processing it is so dficult and physically and mentally tiring, often triggering headaches, dizziness and vertigo.Mr Gwynne said virtual participation in House of Commons business and proxy voting has helped him.  But he warned: I talk about the dficulties of me doing my job, but what about the mechanic, the builder, the emergency worker, the teacher, the nurse  People who donapost have the luxury of virtual participation and an efficient and brilliant office to hide deficiencies. Theyaposre left to struggle, make the most of it or lose their jobs.Mr Gwynne argued the Department for Work and Pensions needs to do more to recognise long Covid when carrying out work capability assessments and other interviews. He was among several MPs to press the Government to acknowledge that children can also suffer from the condition, with an awareness campaign required and access to treatment. Opening a backbench debate, Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moransuggested frontline workers living with long Covid should have access to a compensation schemethey are unable toto work.  She said: Long Covid affects young as well as old and the numbers are staggering. It is believed that there are , people living with long Covid already in the UK, seven million worldwide. Noting the Long Covid All-Party Parliamentary Groupaposs recommendation that the Government should set up a compensation scheme for frontline workers affected, she added: This scheme should go beyond existing sick pay schemes and should be specic to those living with long Covid who are unable to work.

Giving evidence to a Lords committee, the minister admitted “things are tricky at the moment” on exports but said her team is “working hard” to resolve issues as they arose. She added: “I think the deal is a good one for the UK, in fisheries terms, it’s true to say that we had, as an industry, dreamed some pretty big dreams and in some cases it’s true to say that we didn’t get everything we asked for.”The Tory MP also caused concern after suggesting one solution to border delays was for Brits to eat more fish. She said: “We export  per cent of what we catch in this country to the EU and we’re ambitious to carry on at that level but we will, I’m sure, also in the future want to eat more of what we catch here.” Lib Dem Alistair Carmichael said: “It is clear that the fisheries minister was not brought into discussions on the deal until after the event.

Calls mounted for ministers to trust parents by giving them £ a week to feed their kids after images of woeful food parcels sent to needy children prompted a furious backlash. Shadow Education Secretary Kate Green said families should get the cash through the benefits system, allowing parents to get full value and to choose the right supplies for their children. She said: “Ministers are claiming to be disgusted by the images of woefully inadequate food parcels, while blaming inidual companies and proposing no long-term solution. “The government should put its trust in parents by giving them the money for free school meals to ensure their children are not going hungry.”Shadow DWP Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said the social security system had far too many holes and said parents would make the best choices on how to support their children. The Child Poverty Action Group backed the call, which it said would reduce stigma for struggling families. Chief executive Alison Garnham said: “Since the onset of the pandemic and the first lockdown, we have been arguing that getting cash to families with children should be a priority.Through our ‘Learning in Lockdown’ research we found that cash is the best option for replacing the value of free school meals and parents told us how much they appreciated the freedom to shop locally in their usual places to buy what they needed for their children without having to travel to school to pick up food or use vouchers at particular retailers.When receiving cash they have also said that they welcomed the lack of stigma it brought – every shop takes cash and everyone knows how it works. It comes as the Government faced criticism for telling schools they did not need to provide food parcels or vouchers over the February half term. Instead, guidance states pupils will be helped through a £ million Covid Winter Grant Scheme announced in November, with at least % earmarked for “food and essential utility costs”.  But unlike free school meals in term time, it is not a blanket offering to every child and the pot is also expected to cover bills for families and the most vulnerable.  The scheme was used over Christmas, after ministers refused to provide £ vouchers in the October half-term. But unlike the October half-term or Christmas, the whole of England is now in a full national lockdown. Union bosses said the plan would be an “unnecessary logistical nightmare” for councils, who are expected to directly help the hardest hit families.Kevin Courtney, Joint General Secretary of the National Education Union, said the plan risked potential disruption. He said: “Suggesting that local councils will be able to recreate a brand new system of supplying Free School Meals for the week of half term using the Covid Winter Grant Scheme is an unnecessary logistical nightmare, and the confusion and chaos this could cause will put millions of children at risk.” Richard Watts, chairman of the Local Government Association’s resources board, called for school vouchers to be extended. He said: “During the last full national lockdown government recognised the signicant extra pressures on low income families and extended free school meal provision into the school holidays. “Government was explicit that the Covid Winter Grant Scheme was not intended to replicate or replace free school meals, but was to enable councils to support low income households, particularly those at risk of food poverty as we moved towards economic recovery.” "},{"url":null,"title":"uk travel rules explained flight","story":"NewsUK Travel rules explained: Flight bans, quarantines and testing rules in fullAll the details of entry restrictions for the United Kingdom as the government takes \"urgent decision\" to restrict flights from South AmericamirrorShareCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical Correspondent:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsThe rules have been tightened to cope with the South African and Brazillian strains \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Yet since Covid hit, the Government has been surprisingly lax about screening arrivals. At the moment anybody can enter the country as long as they agree to self-isolate. But the government’s figures show that just % of people arriving in Britain are being checked to ensure they really are complying with quarantine requirements.Finally, ministers appear to have recognised the need for action. What is your view  Have your say in the comments section   Travellers from South America and Portugal are banned from entering the country from tomorrow, in an attempt to prevent the spread of the new Brazilian iant of Covid-.From Monday, no one will be allowed in without proof of a negative test result.But this measure should have come into force months ago. Other countries imposed much stricter restrictions far earlier.In Italy, for instance, entry requires proof of a negative test result as well as a requirement to take a rapid Covid test at the airport. It is incomprehensible that nearly  days since the Government first placed England under lockdown, it has only now realised the need to plug this gap in our defences.

A photo of Oliver Shultz shows the -year-old with badly blood shot eyes lying in his hospital bed.The Latrobte, Pennsylvania boy is suffering from Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome , a condition which seems to only affect younger coronavirus patients.It can cause dferent parts of the body to become inflamed, including the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes and gastrointestinal organs. Oliver was brought to UPMC Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh by his mum, who thought he was just low on fluids. He tested positive for Covid- before an infectious disease doctor diagnosed him with MIS-C - the eleventh case the hospital had treated.Aimee Schultz told WPXI : “The scariest thing for my husband and I is not knowing. It’s new, so there’s no research.We don’t know what the long-term effects will be for him, what his future will look like. Oliver was left with severe muscle aches, a rash and an inflamed heart and needed treatment in intensive care.  His family are now fundraising to try and pay off some of the expenses of the linked to the illness. The mounting medical bills, insurance company phone calls while still in ICU to collect payments, and a projection of six months to heal Oliver’s heart that was badly damaged by Covid- and MIS-C have left this family with chronic health concerns, financial fears, and a need for community support, the GoFundMe page reads. Oliver has been allowed home now where he is recovering.“I’m hopeful I can get back to riding very soon, the young horse enthusiast told ActionNews.“It’s what I love to do and I don’t feel the same without riding my horse every day.” "},{"url":null,"title":"covid finally retreat cases now","story":"NewsNew data shows Covid- cases falling in parts of England - see how your area is affectedA majority of regions in England have seen their coronavirus case rates fall as Professor Neil Ferguson hails sign of plateauing and Professor Jonathan Van-Tam talks of the last few furlongs of this race, like in the Grand NationalmirrorShareCommentsByJoseph WilkesReporterJane Kirby:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video high-street-pharmacies-start-vaccines-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

While yesterday the Department of Health reported the highest ever death toll in the coronavirus pandemic so far - , - the case rate is dipping in London and other major regions, the latest weekly surveillance report from Public Health England says. In London, which continues to have the highest rate of any region, the rate of new cases stood at . per , people in the seven days to January , down from ,. in the previous week. The other regions recording a week-on-week fall are the East Midlands, eastern England, north-east England, south-east England and Yorkshire  the Humber. Three regions recorded a week-on-week increase: north-west England, south-west England and the West Midlands. What is the situation like where you live  Have your say in the comments section Yorkshire  the Humber continues to have the lowest rate: ., down from .. In yesterdayaposs daily figures from the Department of Health, the number of new cases reported in a -hour period was , - which is down on the record number of , reported on Wednesday last week. It comes as a senior epidemiologist says some parts of England are showing a plateau in cases of Covid-, while the rate of growth across the country as a whole is slowing. Professor Neil Ferguson, whose early modelling of Covid- made him a key player in the UKaposs first lockdown, said he thinks the current wave of the epidemic may be coming under control in some regions. In an interview with BBC Radio aposs Today programme, Prof Ferguson said: I think itaposs much too early to say exactly when case numbers are going to start coming down, but in some NHS regions in England and in Wales thereaposs sign of plateauing. London in particular is seeing a drop in the number of positive coronavirus tests, alongside the South East, he said. At the moment, it looks like in London in particular, and a couple of other regions - the South East and East of England -hospital admissions may even have plateaued, though itaposs hard to tell theyaposre coming down.  It has to be said this is not being seen everywhere. Both case numbers and hospital admissions are going up in many other areas but, overall, at a national level weaposre seeing the rate of growth slow. In yesterdayaposs update of the latest Covid- case rates for every local authority area in England, for the seven days to January , of the  local areas saw a fall in their case rates and two were unchanged. While saw a rise in case rates. Prof Ferguson, who is director of the Medical Research Councilaposs Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College London, said he would expect to see case numbers continue to come down slowly at a national level but with regional iations.  It will take longer though for hospital admissions - daily admissions - to start coming down and even longer for hospital bed occupancy to come down, he said. Asked how many more weeks of rising hospital admissions and deaths the UK could be looking at, he said: It critically depends on whether the lockdown weaposre in the moment will actually control growth in all areas. But I would hope that hospital admissions might plateau, instead of keep going up, some time in the next week. Hospital bed occupancy may continue to rise slowly for up to two weeks and deaths maybe even for longer.Weaposre going to be well over , deaths a day, even measured by the date people die rather than the date deaths are reported, before numbers start coming down. Prof Ferguson said the total number of deaths in the UK unfortunately is going to be well over ,, thereaposs nothing we can do about that now. Only about % of the population has been infected so far, which had resulted in , deaths, he said. So we have to get to very high levels of vaccine coverage in those vulnerable groups before we can reduce the risk of having basically the same number of deaths again.  If we only get up to  per cent coverage in in the elderly, for instance, that still leaves  per cent unprotected plus everybody . We can still get a very large epidemic, which unfortunately could kill many, many people, so what the modelling and all the analysis and all the groups feeding into Sagesays is, we need to be very cautious in how we relax restrictions and try to ensure we get as high a vaccine coverage as possible. Askedthere could be restrictions for many months to come, he said: Yes, and we canapost predict all of these things in advance. We couldnapost have predicted this new iant coming up, but the new iant without doubt will make the relaxation of restrictions more dficult because it is substantially more transmissible.  So it will be a gradual process to the autumn. Prof Ferguson suggested that the requirement to isolate after coming into contact with a person with coronavirus could be relaxed for people who have recently had the virus, such as NHS workers, but said this was a question for policymakers. It comes as Health Secretary Matt Hancock said three million coronavirus vaccines have now been administered across the UK. He tweeted that he was delighted with the news, adding: Weaposre accelerating the Covid vaccine rollout across the UK.  Prof Fergusonaposs comments came as some large high street pharmacies, including Boots and Superdrug, began rolling out Covid- vaccines. Six stores across England can administer the jabs from Thursday as the Government aims to hit its target of vaccinating around  million of those most at-risk by mid-February. People who are eligible for a vaccine will be contacted and invited to make an appointment through a new national booking service. This gives them the option of having the vaccine at a pharmacy or in a GP-led vaccination centre. Elsewhere, Englandaposs deputy chief medical officer, Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, has told the Sun newspaper: We are probably in the last few furlongs of this race, like in the Grand National. We just have a couple more fences. We have just got to stick with it.  Amid the warnings of struggling hospitals, the Governmentaposs leading scientist Sir Patrick Vallance has warned the country is in for a pretty grim period of deaths which will not reduce quickly. He told ITVaposs Peston programme that high death numbers will carry on for some weeks. Elsewhere, Public Health Englandaposs Siren study found that antibodies from past infection provide % protection against reinfection for at least five months. Although reinfections in people with antibodies were rare, the researchers identied  potential reinfections among , people who had had Covid- previously, putting them at risk of transmitting the virus to others. Full list of all the latest Covid- case rates for every local authority area in England Here is Wednesdayaposs update of the latest Covid- case rates for every local authority area in England. The figures, for the seven days to January , are based on tests carried out in laboratoriesand in the wider community . The rate is expressed as the number of new cases per , people. Data for the most recent four dayshas been excluded as it is incomplete and does not reflect the true number of cases. Of the  local areas in England, have seen a rise in case rates, have seen a fall and two are unchanged.

Professor Tim Spector revealed the odd virus symptom in a social media post on Wednesday. The Kingaposs College London epidemiologist, who heads the Covid Symptom Study App study, said one in five people still have less common indicators.And he also used the post on Twitter to urge the public to stay at homethey are feeling at all unwell - evenitaposs just a case of fatigue.Prof Spector said: One in five people with Covid still present with less common symptoms that donapost get on the official PHE list - such as skin rashes.Have you experienced aposCovid tongueapos  Let us know in the comments below.Seeing increasing numbers of Covid tongues and strange mouth ulcers. If you have a strange symptom or even just headache and fatigue stay at home! The professor also tweeted a gruesome picture of what aposCovid tongueapos can look like.Gabriel Scally, a public health physician and president of epidemiology and public health at Royal Society of Medicine, told The Sun that the virus can produce effects in such a wide range of body systems. She added: Symptoms in the mouth have been described for some time in association with Covid-. Certain diseases that affect the immune system may attack the tongue, causing changes including pain, discolouration, swelling or a strange texture. Other problems can stem from underlying conditions. Tongue issues can also be the result of poor mouth hygiene, smoking or an unhealthy diet. And mouth ulcers are very common and can be caused by a range of things, including hot food or drink, medicines, stress, hormonal changes or vitamin deficiencies. People were quick to thank Prof Spector in the comments below his tweet. One said: Yes! Good to see the less publicised symptoms here. Not everyone presents with those that are still held as definite markers. Still so many unknowns. I feel we need to adopt a mindset of: When in doubt please check it out. Another added: Very useful info. I wish there was much better communication and briefing about the full range of symptoms.

Kristy Horton, who found the site, said she is finding it really dficult to carry on with regular le knowing that such a terrible thing was happening so close to her home. She had been concerned about the site in Caddington, Bedfordshire, for some time, and called police after spotting a wounded dog and heard barking coming from inside a locked container.What police found was shocking, reports HertsLive.Kristy, , said: It was awful. It was probably the worst thing Iaposve ever seen. Iaposm finding it really dficult to carry on with regular le knowing that was happening so close to me and also that itaposs happening all over the country.Do you think the law is strong enough when it comes to animal cruelty  Have your say in the comments sectionIn total five dogs were removed from the alleged puppy farm outside Luton after Bedfordshire Police gained entry on January  following Kristyaposs call. Kristy, who recalled it was an incredibly distressing thing to witness but remarked that she and a group of residents had been suspicious of the site for a while - and seeing the wounded dog made her know she should act. Recalling the timeline of events, Kristy said that after phoning the police and the RSPCA she took the wounded dog to a vet. She had a horrible wound on her face and had blood everywhere, she looked seriously unwell, Kristy said. I probably could have got in a bit of trouble for deciding to take the dog straight away, but I couldnapost leave her there, my conscience just didnapost let me. Kristy said she later ed and entered the locked container with the police - who were helped by Bedfordshire Fire and Rescue Service - and saw five more dogs that looked extremely unwell. Their cages were full of faeces, and some didnapost even have enough space to turn around so were covered in their own filth, Kristy said. They were all very obviously underweight and they were obviously terried as well.  They were happy to see us when we came in but as we came closer they started cowering, she said. Amy Carpenter, , who also saw the site, said: I said it at the time and it still stands, this is the worst thing Iaposve ever seen. Itaposs disgusting, how someone could treat another living creature like that I donapost know. Itaposs heartbreaking. There was one Staffy in particular who was really skinny. You could see every single bone. There was also one dog there who had obviously had a huge number of litters, you could tell that her body was spent from having litters.  Both women said Caddington residents were shocked that this could happen in a small village like theirs. This is a small, dog-loving village. We all know each other really well and thereaposs a big community who love to walk their dogs together, Kristy said. I donapost think any of us could have expected something this horrible to be going on here. Itaposs something you see on the TV and in the news but this has opened my eyes a bit that this can be happening right on your doorstep.  The animals were removed from the location and placed into the care of RSPCA, which is now dealing with the incident. A spokesperson from Bedfordshire Police said: We were called at .pm on Thursdayover animal welfare concerns at a site in Caddington. Police gained access to the site with help of Bedfordshire Fire and Rescue Service and discovered five dogs.

I thought it was a bit odd, but when him and the co-driver started walking towards me, I thought they wanted directions so I locked my door because I was a woman on my own and there is the risk of Covid too, but then the guy just undid his trousers and started peeing by the back of the lorry. She said the men spoke to each other and looked at the startled woman but carried on urinating. She said: He was just laughing and took no notice of me. I couldn’t go past without getting an eye-full so I had to wait for them to finish. I thought ‘this is a long pee’ - it took absolutely ages. The guy eventually finished, gave it a shake and then looked back at me. Then they just drove off.

Sam Hicks, , was rushed into Southmead Hospital in Bristol on January  where she gave birth to surprise baby Julia. She and her husband Joe had only found out she was pregnant on January  after a home pregnancy test. Sam, who works at a care home, had done numerous pregnancy tests throughout the year, all of which had come back negative. “There were some signs,” said proud dad Joe, “but as Sam had done numerous pregnancy tests all which came back negative, she just put it down to stomach problems.”But when Joe, , felt a kick in his we’s stomach while they were sat relaxing on New Year’s Day, Sam decided to do another test, reports Bristol Live.Do you have a similar tale  Let us know by contacting us on webnews@mirrorThe next day Sam went and got another test - which this time confirmed she was aposthree weeks plusapos pregnant. The shocked pair - who already have Thomas, three and Johnny, eight, quickly set about making preparations such as booking in scans and appointments with the midwe. But Julia had other ideas, and arrived before the appointments were held. Sam and her newborn, who weighed in at lb  oz and was full term, remain in Southmead Hospital due to Julia having breathing dficulties. But she is making good progress and Joe hopes to have them home in the next few days. “I just can’t wait to get them back home,” he said.Amazingly Sam’s pregnancy was not picked up when she was admitted to hospital in November with coronavirus. “Obviously she was askedshe was pregnant when she was admitted and she said no, so that was that.” Sam, Joe and Thomas all tested positive for the virus with only Johnny getting a negative result, and went into self isolation. Sam was admitted to Southmead Hospital on November  after she had problems breathing and after treatment was discharged four days later. “She was pretty poorly and to start with when she came home, was slow and not really picking up,” said Joe. After a further two weeks at home, Sam ed to work. The family enjoyed Christmas as normal. Sam went to work on January  - walking  minutes to get there - and Joe picked her up at pm. He then went to work as a lorry driver, ing at around .pm. “When I got home Sam said she was worried that something was wrong so I called an ambulance,” said Joe. “Then we realised she was having contractions and I rang the maternity ward at Southmead and they said to come in.” The pair drove to hospital with Joe timing Sam’s contractions. “I was checking them on the car’s clock and they were coming every six minutes.” The pair arrived at the central delivery suite at .am and Julia was born at .am. Initially the hospital was concerned about her oxygen levels and Julia was carried for in the hospital’s NICU ward. Joe hopes Sam and Julia will be home in the next few days. “We already have two lovely boys, so Julia coming along was a massive shock,” said Joe. “But she’s absolutely gorgeous and we couldn’t be happier.  “When we found out Sam was pregnant we sat the boys down and told them they were having a new baby brother or sister. “Johnny was over the moon and really excited about the new sibling whereas Thomas is a bit too young to properly understand. “Normally siblings have a bit of time to get used to the news there is going to be a new arrival - not just a few days.” Joe said the family had managed to get a few items in preparation for the baby in the days before the birth. “I am a planner and already have a seven seater car and we’d managed to buy some of the bigger items after we found out,” said Joe. After hearing of the unexpected arrival, family, friends and neighbours have rallied around to give stuff. “We have so much now, so many clothes,” said Joe. “The support and kindness of our family, friends and neighbours and the local community has been overwhelming.

But since lockdown began, she’s enjoying more time with her husband Piyus, , and daughters Sienna, nine, and seven-year-old Isla at their Northampton home.“I really like being at home with the girls, and I know this is going to sound really bizarre, but I love home schooling,” says Sheena, .“Both girls have Zoom at am, so when they’re doing that, I’ll be doing my work. They have their designated study areas and I encourage them to work independently, but I make sure I’m present sothey need me, they can come and get me.”Sheena, who’s written a book, Perfectly Imperfect Mum, believes that it’s important for mothers to take the pressure off themselves.“Seeing people making perfect meals on Instagram can make us feel guilty and start judging ourselves,” she says. “As long as we try our best, that should be good enough. If you want to have beans on toast or chips, that’s OK.”Sheena is one of many people finding ways to embrace their time at home and make the most of lockdown.New restrictions are in place, with people all over the UK being urged to stay at home to stop the spread of coronavirus, protect the NHS and save lives.There’s light at the end of the tunnel with thousands of vulnerable people being vaccinated every week, but for now everyone must play their part by avoiding mixing with others. What’s really helping Sheena feel calm during lockdown is practising mindfulness. “Whether we’re eating meals, brushing our teeth, looking at our phones and watching TV, we’re always multi-tasking,” she says.“So we started practising mindfulness as a family and creating our own little videos so that other children could benefit. We go on little mindfulness walks, becoming more aware of our surroundings.“A simple technique is when we’re eating at home, we feel grateful for the food and then talk about where it came from. You start appreciating food you’re eating and feel fuller, rather than always thinking, ‘What can I eat next ’”As an active family who love to travel, the Tanna-Shahs have had to get creative during their time at home – and they’ve found themselves trying activities they’d never have imagined doing.“None of us are dancers at all, but we thought, ‘What can we do to make things more fun ’ so we filmed ourselves doing a dance to Super-heroes by The Script and shared it online,” says Sheena. “Before lockdown, I would have never dreamt we’d do anything like that!“My daughter loves Enid Blyton books, so we did a midnight feast outdoors and looked at shooting stars – it wasn’t something we’d normally dream of doing. And we went to Woburn Park at am last summer to watch the sunrise. We’re living in the moment, and not worrying about what everyone  is doing.” Although getting out in the fresh air is important, Sheena is happy to find alternative ways to exercise at home. “In winter, it’s really important to go outside and get your vitamin D, but maybe the weather ’s cold and wet,” she says. “So we bring that exercise indoors – as long as you’re moving and having fun, that’s great. There are so many things the kids can do online, whether it’s PE with Joe or yoga.”There are things we can all do to look after our mental wellbeing at this time.

It has been really nice – one of those things that has transferred really well from in person to online.“We’ve all made an effort to pick slightly shorter books to make it feel more relaxed. We’ve tried to choose books that are  pages tops as I think we’ve all found it hard to concentrate during lockdown.“We get to share books and we’re all able to introduce our own favourite types of books.” She says she and her friends have also tried a supper club, where they cook something over video and then sit down and eat and chat together.And evennot everything Flip has tried has been such a success, some ventures have still raised a few laughs. “Our choir also went online with hilarious results,” she says. “It might not have worked quite as well online, but it has still been fun.“The head of the choir has tried a new method where we all sing but our inidual laptops are muted, so we’re just singing at our screens.”For your mental health action plan, visit Clear Your Head today.

But how do they stack up and compare to their rivals Galaxy S and S+The key features here are that both come with G compatibility and a triple rear camera system. The main dference between the S and S+ is that the former has a .-inch display and the S+ is slightly larger at .-inches. Those screens are both edge-to-edge Dynamic AMOLED X Infinity-O displays. Itaposs complete with an adaptive Hz refresh rate which means smoother scrolling on the web and social media as well as when watching video.Are you going to get one  Let us know in the comments belowThe triple rear camera system on the phones is AI-powered to aid with better photo and video capturing with an improved Portrait Mode and Space Zoom which allows users to capture images at up to x zoom. Video capturing tools are also well-stocked, with K Video Snap allowing users to not only capture K resolution video but also grab clear still images from within that footage. There is also the new Directoraposs View mode which enables users to see and switch between the viewing angles of the dferent cameras in order to get the shot theyaposre looking for. Crucially, all this comes at a reasonable price for devices of this specication - the S starts at £ and the S+ starts at £.And what about the S Ultra The largest of the three new phones, the S Ultra comes with a .-inch Dynamic AMOLED X display, which Samsung says for the first time combines both Quad HD+ resolution and a Hz refresh rate. It also has a quad-camera system made up of ultra-wide, wide and dual tele-lenses which include a -megapixel sensor. The Space Zoom feature is enhanced here too and is able to shoot images at up to x.  A whole video can be recorded in K resolution at  frames per secondacross all four of those lenses and even the front-facing camera is at the very top end of smartphone capability. The Ultra is also the first Galaxy S series device to be compatible with Samsungaposs S-Pen stylus, meaning users are able to make notes, annotate and edit files using the pen. The S Ultra starts at £,.So how do they compare to the iPhone  range  The iPhone  handsets best comparable to the S series are the iPhone  Pro and iPhone  Pro Max. The  Pro starts at £, while the Pro Max costs £,. The  Pro has a .-inch Super Retina XDR OLED display, which is the same as the slightly cheaper iPhone , while the Pro Max has a much larger .-inch version.

Writing for MyLondon, he said: Coming from a Mauritian family, getting acquainted with spicy food early on in le is a rite of passage.When I watched a video of famous YouTuber, Matt Stonie, devouring  packs of Samyang Korean Spicy Noodles , I had an insatiable urge to try them out for myself. I bought a red pack of the x spicy hot chicken flavour off Amazon. It was delicious and the flavour was deep and strong... but then the inferno hit me. My teeth felt numb and my throat closed up as the lava trickled down into my stomach.  Not wanting to give up after just one mouthful, Reemul persevered and kept on eating. However, he only managed to consume half the bowl and was left feeling pretty disappointed with himself. My body felt numb, especially my fingers. My insides were hot as was my face. I was fanning myself down with my hands at one point, he explained. The next day I felt a sharp pain in my left ear whenever I touched it, which worsened as the day went on. By evening it was hurting so much that I felt Iaposd contracted an ear infection.  It hurt when I opened my jaw and my hearing from that side had become impaired, so I applied a couple of drops of olive oil to hopefully alleviate the block and pain. Over the weekend I still couldn’t hear well out of my left ear and some ringing had started.He Googled his symptoms and found a video blogger had experienced something similar after eating killer spicy noodles from Indonesia.It turns out, the chilli had loosened up the mucous membranes in his nose and throat and blocked his Eustachian tubes, creating the sensation of not being able to hear properly.

The worldaposs most powerful weapon, submarine-launch ballistic missiles, entered the square one after another, powerfully demonstrating the might of the revolutionary armed forces, news agency KCNA reported. Pyongyang is under international sanctions for its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes.Military aircraft were spotted releasing fireworks information, said NK News, a website that monitors North Korea, citing a source in the city.  On Wednesday, Kim Yo Jong, the leaderaposs sister and a member of the party Central Committee, criticised South Koreaaposs military for saying it had detected signs of a parade in Pyongyang on Sunday. The move was an expression of the Southaposs hostile approach towards the North, she said in a statement. Leader Kim and other North Korean officials had packed into an indoor stadium in Pyongyang on Wednesday to watch performances from military and civilian art troupes and youth groups. The performance was the latest in a series of largegatherings this week where Kim and the other attendees did not appear to wear masks or follow other social distancing measures.

He also notched twice in derbies, one a key penalty in a win at Dens Park and the opening goal of the - draw in December .Dark Blues boss James McPake has wasted no time in strengthening his squad this month, securing McMullan#s signature.With the winger being removed from United’s first-team training, it looks increasingly likely that deal will be accelerated to make the -year-old a Dundee player this month.Amid wage cuts at Tannadice as the effects of the coronavirus pandemic hit club finances, United boss Mellon admitted last week it was unlikely the club would be extending player contracts.Speaking after McMullan had put pen to paper on a deal at Dens, Mellon said: “I don’t think the club is in a position yet that it is wanting or able to give players contracts, or give Paul McMullan a contract.“It might change with other players, that remains to be seen.”Whether that includes Clark, fans on both sides of the street will be keen to find out.Meanwhile, McPake has made it clear a player’s past allegiances to rivals Dundee United are “irrelevant” as he looks to add quality to his squad.As well as the capture of McMullan, the Dens men snapped up striker Osman Sow after he had left United.The Swede has gone on to impress in dark blue this season, scoring seven times and topping the club’s scoring charts.The club also had former United midfielder Sam Stanton on trial in December.Lawrence Shankland wonder goal: New footage and Dundee United star’s reaction on a night numbers were outshone\" title\"#Lawrence Shankland wonder goal: New footage and Dundee United star’s reaction on a night numbers were outshone# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp lawrence-shankland-goal-video-dundee-united-stats embed # secretNZXsQnyx\" data-secret\"NZXsQnyx\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest"},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"skyes-limit-sabhal-mor-ostaig---unique-gaelic-only-college-set-stunning-island-location","story":"AS global interest in Gaelic grows, students from across the world are travelling to Skye to study at Sabhal Mograver Ostaig, the National Centre for Gaelic Language and Culture."},{"url":null,"title":"new-bbc-documentary-series-jamie-genevieve-great-indoors-air-week","story":"SOCIAL media star Jamie Genevieve will feature in a new documentary series this week."},{"url":null,"title":"list-glasgow-shops-administration-lockdown","story":"GLASGOWS prominent shopping streets will look very dferent post lockdown with many major retailers calling in the administrators."},{"url":null,"title":"glaswegians-urged-enter-short-story-writing-competition-over-90s","story":"WHAT was le like during the war  A charity is calling on the over-s to take part in its nationwide writing competition with a cash prize up for grabs."},{"url":null,"title":"classic-glasgow-boxing-bout-ends-drama-champion-ken-buchanan","story":"IT WAS a painful night, January , , not least of all for the two men pictured here during the British lightweight championship bout."},{"url":null,"title":"it-like-blitz-memories-glasgows-worst-storm","story":"WHEN it happened, it was considered modern Scotlandrsquos worst natural disaster."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-nicola-sturgeon-announces-six-changes-tougher-lockdown","story":"Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed tougher lockdown across Scotlandas coronavirus cases continue to rise and daily deaths reached a new record level."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgows-nil-mouth-brings-childrens-book-burns-night","story":"IT IS an unusual scenario in the fight against bigotry and intolerance."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-film-festival-2021-line-up-announced","story":"HE helped save a dying city Down Under and his extraordinary le was captured in an award-winning documentary."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-city-council-announces-25-payment-kids-free-school-meals","story":"COUNCIL bosses have announced that all families in receipt of free school meals will receive payments to support them through the current lockdown."},{"url":null,"title":"work-set-begin-bringing-canal-north-glasgow-life","story":"WORK will soon begin to build a new map, signs, vibrant  and information markers along the Forth and Clyde Canal in North Glasgow."},{"url":null,"title":"childrens-hearings-scotland-needs-recruit-panel-members-glasgow","story":"VOLUNTEER bosses have launched a massive recruitment drive to urge people in Glasgow to sign up to the Childrens Panel."},{"url":null,"title":"remembering-boomtown-glasgow-early-1700s","story":"GLASGOW in the s and early s was something of a boomtown.

Pace is absolutely right and we have to get after it, I would agree with that.#The OGUK boss believes the #ongoing support# of the Scottish Government and political parties will be #crucial# along with recognition that the sector is key to the ongoing security of the UK#s energy supply, its impact on Scottish GDP and the money the supply chain brings.If government and parties have confidence in the sector and believe it has a role to play in the energy transition that will be #incredibly important# in encouraging companies to come forward and invest in new cleaner forms of energy, Ms Michie adds.Veteran north-east entrepreneur and Opportunity North Eastchairman Sir Ian Wood says there is #no doubt# the north-east is #uniquely positioned# to take advantage of the #massive opportunity# the energy transition offers.With the support of government,  ONE is confident the new energy transition zone would lead to #transformational growth# and the organisation will continue to make the case to all political parties to support its aims.#ONE and its partners have a clear ambition to transform Aberdeen and the north-east of Scotland into a globally integrated energy cluster, focused on accelerating to net zero through developing energy transition activities#, Sir Ian says.#This includes the Energy Transition Zone and the Aberdeen Hydrogen Hub which are key milestone projects.#There is no doubt that the North East is uniquely positioned within Scotland and the UK to take advantage of this massive opportunity.#After  years of North Sea oil, the region has the infrastructure, business capability and world-class talent pool to create signicant investment and employment opportunities.#However, Jake Molloy, RMT regional organiser, says the city#s status as a hub for innovation is at risk of disappearing unless governments take prompt action to sht to cleaner forms of energy production.The Aberdeen-based trade union boss points to other European countries, such as Denmark and Norway, who are leading the way through subsidising the development of the technology, with the north-east being #left behind#.Mr Molloy claims governments are #just letting it happen# and that the region, despite the expertise of its workface, faces a #wasted windfall# unless investment is forthcoming.He says: #I think we’re being left behind to some extentyou look at what’s happening in Denmark and Norway.#The fact that Equinor, a state owned Norwegian oil company is building the biggest wind farm in the world off the east coast of the UK speaks volumes about what the state of Norway is doing to protect pensions and its welfare and state funding.“We on the other hand are just letting it happen, it’s passing us by, just what happened with oil and gas a wasted windfall.“We can’t afford to let that happen again.#The region#s reliance on oil and gas has to sht in the context of its #very mature basin# but also due to very obvious climate change concerns, the union boss adds.He says: #Most of the decommissioning happening in the UK is going to Norway, most of the turbines and most of the blades for the offshore wind sector are being built in Denmark and Germany, the bulk of the structural work is being done in the middle east or the far east.#This is a nation that built the installations producing oil and gas, we#ve got a track record of pretty good engineering standards but we#re not prepared to exploit those standards in any shape or form.I think we’re being left behind to some extentyou look at what’s happening in Denmark and Norway.#Jake Molloy, RMT union#We want to do it quick and we want to do it on the cheap so we#re sending it to the far east.#That#s a recipe for economic disaster and Aberdeen is the front runner.#Energy policy is largely reserved to Westminster but Mr Molloy says whoever enters the Scottish Parliament after May#s elections should call for faster action on the energy transition and be #banging that drum loudly#.We#re waiting and hoping that somebody with a big wad of cash is going to come along and save us all.#Jake Molloy,  RMT union.Direct government investment is required rather than #sitting waiting for private investment as is the case now, according to Mr Molloy.He says: #I just don#t understand why any politician can sit idly by and let this happen because it#s their constituents up and down the country, but especially here in the north-east that will suffer as a consequence and will continue to suffer.#We#re waiting and hoping that somebody with a big wad of cash is going to come along and save us all.#Inverness guest house operator David Shayer says he will likely have to #write this year off# as a result of a drop in custom due to the Covid- pandemic.Mr Shayer, who runs Aye Stay, a -room guest house on the city#s Bishops Road, does not even think he will be in a position to open in  as he claims there will be #no market#.It is a sentiment shared by many across the Highlands and Islands, a region which in  welcomed more than  million day visitors and .m overnight guests, generating £. billion for the economy on average each year.But it is a sector which has been ravaged by Covid- with restrictions on travel imposed across the UK and an almost non-existent international market.Looking ahead to the Holyrood elections, those in the industry want to see increased government support, and a number of other measures,they are to survive.Mr Shayer criticises the Scottish Government for #rushing through legislation# to introduce new short-term let regulations.The licensing scheme, due to be passed in April, would see self-catering and BB operators having to apply for a licence from their local authority.Guest houses would be exempt from the regulations but Mr Shayer says it is the #last thing# the industry needs as it emerges from the Covid- pandemic.He would also like to see more financial support as all he has had is a £, grant to last the year, with businesses only surviving because they are taking out #massive loans#.The guest house owner would also like the Scottish Government to assist on promoting the region as a holiday destination for the winter season.He says: #We#ve only got a short season in the Highlands from April to October.#If the Scottish Government could help in promoting the Highlands for a longer season and the benefits of Scotland for the winter with the skiing andthey want to come and see the snow in the hills.#I think that would help for people to get some money through the winter.#Daniel Mackenzie-Winters, chair of the Inverness and District BB Association, says bed and breakfasts have been #very hard hit# by Covid- and because many pay council tax, rather than business rates, the funding opportunities available to them from the Scottish Government have been #limited#.He is also critical of the move to introduce new short-term let regulations,  which he says have come at #completely the wrong time# and could end up #forcing small operators out of business#.However, the Scottish Government says existing operators will have until April   to apply for a licence under the new legislation, adding that it will #level the playing field between BBs and properties listed on s such as Airbnb#.Mr Mackenzie-Winters also urges the government not to revive plans for a so-called tourist tax, which has previously attracted support from both Highland and Aberdeen City Council.Highland councillors agreed in October to press the Scottish Government to include legislation for a tourist tax in future programmes.Proposals were paused due to the pandemic and have not been included in the current programme for government.He would also like to see more government investment to councils so that local infrastructure such as roads and toilets can be improved, which can have a #huge impact on visitor experience#.The BB association chairman adds:  #Highland Council were very keen on introducing this tax before the pandemic started but we need to encourage tourism over the coming years and we don#t want to add such a tax to our accommodation charges.#Improving connectivity to the north-east is an issue long championed by businesses and politicians eager to boost the economy of the region.Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerce, which has a membership of more than , businesses, say it is vital the region does #not become just a distant northern outpost#it is to recover post Covid-.A recent letter penned by the business organisation says Covid- has created a #hugely uncertain environment# for the transport sector.More than any other region of the UK, Aberdeen is dependent on air connectivity due to the volume of people travelling for oil-related business.Indeed, around , hotel bedrooms in the city have been lost to closure due to the dependence on business tourism.Shane Taylor, policy and research manager at the Chamber, says that in addition to holding in place the rates relief package for airports, governments must consider the suspension of Air Passenger Duty for an #extended period#.#When we look at the sector itself, I think it#s very clear that the aviation sector has been particularly challenged through this#, says Mr Taylor.#In Scotland we have had some benefit in getting airport rates relief and that has transitioned across the border.#Aberdeen Airport bosses have been vocal in calling for a change in the current tax system to make it a level playing field.Currently, passengers flying from Inverness are exempt from paying APD, meaning airlines are able to sell cheaper flights without profits being hit.Meanwhile, those travelling from Aberdeen must pay the duty when they book their flights.Highlands and Islands Airport is exempt from APD to ensure people living in Shetland and Orkney are not unfairly penalised when, for example, attending hospital appointments on the mainland.The Scottish Government has previously said the existing exemption must remain in place to protect remote and rural communities but airport bosses say their proposals would only refer to flights south of Inverness.Mr Taylor says the suspension of APD would not only help airports at a disadvantage such as Aberdeen but that this should be linked to the investment the industry requires to decarbonise, through means such as planes becoming more fuel efficient and using more sustainable biofuels.A spokesman for Aberdeen International Airport describes the success of the airport and the region as #intertwined#, adding that the city#s internationally-focused economy is #dependent# on connectivity.The airport adds that aviation is #central# to any UK economic recovery post-Covid- and says the government must #actively support# to link all regions of the UK  domestically and internationally to increase trade.The spokesman continues: #We continue to call on sector specic support and the introduction of a Regional Connectivity Fund and the abolishment of Air Passenger Duty are two levers government could pull to help aid our sector’s and the economy’s recovery.#Chamber bosses and political leaders in the city have consistently pushed for progress on £m plans to cut train journey times between Aberdeen and the central belt by up to  minutes.A report released last year said the next stage of plans for the project could be accelerated.The funding has been in place since  but construction works have yet to begin.Sandra Macdonald, chair of regional transport partnership Nestrans, says all parties involved now have a programme which will achieve a reduction in journey times and that the timescale for the project being delivered remains  under the -year terms of the deal.Mrs Macdonald, who is also an Aberdeen councillor, therefore expects work to start #fairly soon#those timescales are to be met.She says although this project will help deliver improved journey times between the north-east and the central belt funding #far in excess of £m# would also need to be forthcoming in order to address a #pinch point# at the Montrose basin where there is only single track rather than double.Mr Taylor agrees that improving rail times is a #really key initiative# for the region as the lack of connectivity betwen the two is #constraining economic growth#.He adds the the need for action is ever more pressing as a result of the HS project, the high-speed rail link connecting London to Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds, which will create an #economic disadvantage# for Aberdeen which as a city region will not directly benefit.#As far as I understand there is a plan to take it forward and progress it but we need to see that being put out in a concrete way so the region itself can look to that and see that process is finally beginning to progress#, Mr Taylor adds.#It#s due to complete round about the same time as the other work in the city region deal portfolio.#This funding was slightly separate to the city region deal but was announced alongside it, by .#As with all infrastructure projects, they take time, so to meet those timelines we really need to start soon.#For as little as £.

The Covid- pandemic has shone a light on the vital contribution that nursing staff make to the entire health and care system.#However increased applications for nursing will not result in an increase in nurses unless the Scottish Government increase the number of funded university places for nursing students going forward.#An increase in places across the fields of nursing is critical to future proof the workforce and ensure appropriate numbers of registered nurses are joining.“Over five percent of NHS nursing and midwery posts were unfilled at  September  and we know that the scale of nursing vacancies within social care is also a signicant concern. Workforce shortages are having a major impact on staff wellbeing and patient safety and this was the case even before the pandemic.“The Scottish Government must ensure Scotland has the nursing workforce it needs that nursing is seen as an attractive and rewarding career, nursing students are properly supported and that policies and working conditions support nursing staff to stay in this safety-critical profession.” vw, px\"  Last year the Scottish Government increased the intake numbers for nursing by % – the eighth successive increase # to , training places.A Scottish Government spokeswoman said: “Nursing and Midwery continues to be a popular profession, with UCAS reporting that in Scotland there were over , acceptances onto university places in , up by over , and more than  in excess of our target number.“We have committed £ million for extra nursing and midwery training places in this parliament, and the target of  has been already met and exceeded.

She has travelled and trekked throughout the world but now lives in Argyll amongst the scenery she loves. www.heatheryheightsDuring wintry weather and shorter days it can be tricky fitting in longer walks and time for exploring the outdoors.What is fantastic about Knapdale and Kintyre is that we only have to go a short distance to gain truly spectacular views. The three walks in this edition y from relatively short, using tracks and paths to the lovely viewpoint of Castle Dounie, to challenging, where the terrain is tough underfoot and good route finding skills are required. All three start at Crinan harbour before climbing up through oak and birch woods to gain open vistas with views to Jura, Scarba and Mull. The convoluted ridge walks are rugged and wild, the steep sides sweeping down to the Sound of Jura where tides race and swirl. If you are lucky you may see pods of dolphins or even whales.. At the car park a signboard shows the Crinan Trail. This is the shorter of the routes but all three start and finish together. Leave the car park and turn left. Keeping to the road by the shore you will see a trail marker post ahead leading you briefly along the shore before the path heads into oak woods. After m the path bends sharply left. To the right a faint trail heads west towards the Sailor’s Grave but your route starts its steep muddy ascent to the forestry road above.. On reaching the road turn right, after m you will reach a bench and the first junction to your left. Here you have a choice either come back from the track ahead or to your left. All routes can be undertaken in either direction. I suggest for the longer routes you go straight on and for the Crinan Trail you go left.. For the Crinan Trail follow the waymark posts and arrows. After .km the route turns right onto a path and winds up and down with glimpses of views to come. Turn left at a sign for a viewpoint. This will take you up to the knoll atop which the remains of Castle Dounie, a prehistoric dun, command spectacular views over the sound towards the Gulf of Corryvreckan. There it is said the Cailleach Bheur, a giant witch, once washed her plaid in its whirlpools. Enjoy the vista before ing down to the junction and turn left. The path now meanders down to the forestry road. Turn right and head north round the coast above Adnoe Point and back to your path down to Crinan harbour.. For the longer walks, go straight ahead at the bench . Follow the track for nearly km, which leads you round a couple of hairpin bends and above Adnoe Point, before turning south. Keep your eyes open for the waymark posts and turn left onto a path. Head uphill for m. At the viewpoint sign turn right up to Castle Dounie and enjoy. To your south is the ridge that leads to Creag Mhor.. Immediately after dropping from Castle Dounie you will see a broken down wall on your right. Follow this for a short distance until you can start to work your way up onto the ridge to your right, by a couple of birch trees with coners on the skyline above. The ridge walk is convoluted, airy, rough and summits numerous lumps and bumps with fantastic views. Keep to the crest or east side as the drop-offs to the west are impressive but not to be dallied with. The highest rocky bump of Creag Mhor is parallel to the north end of the rocks offshore.. After  minutes of knobbly and exposed ridge walking #you do not fancy tackling navigation along walls in woods # this is now the time to keep an eye out for an obvious wide firebreakin the trees, below to your left. This leads you at a ° angle straight to a forestry track in the valley below. To check you have the right point look across from the firebreak and you should see a wall continue the line on the other side. Head down the firebreak to the track and turn left. This will take you back to the junction by the bench where you can turn right on the forest road then left todown the path to Crinan harbour.. If you wish to adventure on* and are confident with your route finding then continue south on the ridge # crossing over an old wall not on the map # to where it suddenly drops to a tiny col with forest directly ahead. Ahead is a steep little rise with walls on it. One drops to the right but it is the one going southwest into the forest you need to follow, for the next m. Keeping the wall directly on your right, circumnavigating the odd boulder and ducking the odd branch, you will see that the deer have created quite a path and that the way is often clear. Eventually it drops you very steeply down to a stream with another wall directly ahead. Turn left, southeast, up the stream with the wall on your right # it is boggy # until you reach a quaint waterfall on your left. A small break in the wall to your right allows you to escape the trees that have fallen across the wall higher up. Continue with it on your left across a tree harvested area and up the bump ahead. You will pop out onto a track end.. Follow this short track down to the forest road below. Turn right and almost immediately turn left onto a grassy track that crosses a stream and heads east up into the forest. After m you will come to a sharp left-hand bend. Directly in front of you a wall goes steeply up into the trees. This is your route up to Bealach na Moine. It leads up slippery, mossy rock for m, over a barbed wired fence , up a very rough and eroded track for nearly m, past a spring hidden with fallen trees, then over more pleasant grass and moss to the col. This last section makes you realise why it is worth the effort as views open up east and west. Turn right over a couple of steep little hillocks on the ridge. Suddenly ahead you will see your goal, the trig point and the summit of Cnoc Reamhar, also known as Gallachoille Hill and a Marilyn to boot. It really is a fantastic view.. Toeither descend the way you came or drop down from one of the breaks in the ridge to the north end of the small lochan on the west side of the summit, and follow the faint Landover track north to the spring. Re-join your ascent route, taking care on the way down. Turn rightat the forest road it is now an easy km back to the junction with the bench. Turn right then left after m, following the path back to Crinan harbour.*You can also drop down the firebreak and turn right on the track to join the route up to Cnoc Reamhar,continuing along the ridge does not appeal.The described routes and accompanying information are there to be used as a guide and do not replace the use of map and compass and the skills required to use them.

The sector in Scotland accounts for around  per cent of UK production and is worth about £ million annually.One fth of these exports go to the EU, amounting to more than , tonnes a year.This is clearly a disastrous Brexit outcome for Scottish farmers and like all other aspects of Brexit, foisted on Scotland against its will.A terrible negotiating failure on the part of the Tory government, and a devastating blow to an extremely valuable part of Scotland’s farming industry, I am sure it will not be the first damaging impact to be highlighted once the deal is fully analysed.Alex Orr, EdinburghSir,The report on the Piers and Harbours Asset Management Plan and Fees and Charges –  , submitted to the Argyll and Bute Council Harbour Board meeting of December ,  makes interesting reading.At a time when budgets are tight and councils have had to make hard decisions about where to cut services, it is dficult to understand why the council budget should be used to supplement the funding of dedicated ferry infrastructure for which CMAL should be responsible.The asset management plan allocates £,, for planned marine infrastructure works for the year  , of which only £, , is devoted to multi-use facilities. The remainder, £,,, is mostly allocated to single-use ferry facilities, and a huge proportion of that is to provide overnight parking for CalMac ferriesreaders will have to make up their own minds about the merits of spending £,, for an overnight berth at Fionnphort, and £, on a feasibility study for a breakwater at Lismore.CMAL pay back around half of the £,, to the council through harbour dues for the use of council-owned piers, however, that still leaves a whopping £ million gap in the required funding.If past experience of other CMAL projects is anything to go by, the planned eight per cent increase in council harbour fees and charges up to   is not going to cover it.Fergus Gillanders, KilmelfordSir,Last year, , was challenging and, although many people like to give generously to charity at Christmas time, it may have been dficult to make a donation this festive season.It#s not too late # you can still help support the Royal National Institute of Blind Peopleby collecting and donating used stamps from cards and parcels you may have received.Your stamps will be recycled and turned into vital funds that will help RNIB support children with vision impairment.

Among the deserving recipients are leading lights who have battled to save lives and keep the NHS afloat and those who have kept the country smiling by spreading kindness.The list includes medical experts as well as volunteers working with youngsters, the elderly and those with disabilities. Those working in libraries, education and community arts also received recognition. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “In a year when so many have made sacrices to protect our NHS and save people’s lives, the outstanding eff orts of those receiving honours are a welcome reminder of the strength of human spirit and of what can be achieved through courage and compassion. “The  New Year Honours offer us an opportunity to salute their dedication and recognise many who have gone above and beyond in their contribution to our country. “As we begin a new year and continue to come together to fight this virus, may their service and stories be an inspiration to us all.”"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures a look back at 2020 2","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Some do exist, however, and while not attempting to be a comprehensive history, there is a nicely illustrated booklet about the hospital and its past entitled #Up The Brae#, produced a few years ago by Brenda Bratt, Jess Grant and my former colleague Dr Grace Fergusson .These photographs are a reminder of the loss of a signicant social and economic element in the fabric of Mid Argyll, where for generations it would have been dficult to find a family without some connection to #the AB#. For those who worked there, myself included, any sadness however is much more about the loss of a self-sufficient and widely respected mental health service.I was a late participant in the story of the AB, being appointed physician superintendent in , a post I held in addition to that of clinical director for mental health services for Argyll and Bute and West Dunbartonshire until , and I feel a duty to the many splendid colleagues with whom I worked to comment on the loss of the service in which the AB served as the nucleus.During the course of   the hospital was awarded the accolade #Best Mental Illness Hospital in Britain# as the result of a national competition launched by the King’s Fund and sponsored by the Sunday Times. This was a recognition of the multi-disciplinary spirit and enthusiasm for innovation that characterised the service, and the ethos of best clinical practice being led by academic excellence. The service went on to be recognised as a centre of excellence by many visiting accreditation bodies.My reason for making these points has nothing to do with nostalgia.The past has no utility in the present or the future except as a source for learning how best to proceed.The ingredients for a good mental health service are the same today as they were in  and they have little to do with buildings or even location. Staff have to feel they #belong# to something there must be a collegiate spirit binding together the ious disciplines shared professional development and peer support and clear lines of accountability. It is frankly hard to see any such features in the current delivery of mental health care.Someone once said #psychiatry isn’t sexy#, meaning that in any competition for resources with other clinical specialities, psychiatry will always lose, and so to get the best out of the NHS for folk with psychiatric disorder, exceptional effort is required. The achievements and values of the past can act as a springboard for such effort, but here they seem to have been squandered by a distant and disinterested health board.It is all too easy to avoid investing in a service by reorganising it into invisibility, but the people who pay the cost are those who deserve the best of specialist professional help.So I am certainly sad at the disappearance of the old AB, because it is symbolic of something having been lost that is much more important than stones and mortar.Professor Angus Mackay OBE FRCPsych, ArdrishaigSir,Scots have taken to online technology like never before to keep in touch during this dficult time.When we first went into lockdown, there were concerns over whether our networks would cope with this big increase in online traffic. But though customers# usage of data more than doubled, our networks were able to stand up to the demands.I’m immensely proud of the role my colleagues have played in keeping the country connected during this crisis. From the engineers who keep our broadband and mobile networks connected, to the vital contact centre staff in Glasgow, Dundee, Greenock, Edinburgh and Thurso, helping people when they need it most.I’m also proud of the role our people played in supporting the NHS in Scotland during the crisis, including working with Scottish Government to quickly provide communications to the temporary hospitals.The pandemic has shown the vital role digital technology and internet connectivity now plays in all our lives. If all homes and businesses are going to stay ahead, we know that fast and reliable broadband and good mobile coverage is going to be essential for the post-Covid recovery.We#ll continue to work with governments and local authorities to make sure that no areas are left behind.Jane Wood, BT Group Scotland Director, Alexander Graham Bell House, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 8 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It gives me no pleasure to be talking about further restrictions on businesses and our inidual freedoms to come and go as we please, but please know we would not be doing any of thiswe did not believe it was essential to get and keep this potentially deadly virus under control.#They are as follows:Limiting the availability and operation of click and collect retail services. Clothes, food, footwear, baby equipment, homeware and books will still be allowed # all other click and collect services must stop, she said.There must also be #staggered appointments# for click and collect to avoid potential for queuing and no access inside premises for collection will be permitted#We must reduce the reasons people have right now for leaving home and coming into contact with others,# said Miss Sturgeon.There will be new restrictions to takeaway services. Customers will no longer be permitted to go inside to collect takeaway food or drinks, she said. Any outlet wanting to do so will have to offer it from a serving hatch or doorway # to reduce the risk of customers coming into contact with each other or staff  indoors, she said.From Saturday it will be against the law to drink alcohol outdoors in public in all level four areas, for example buying a takeaway pint and drinking it outdoors will not be permitted, said Miss Sturgeon.#I know this is not a popular move but it is intended to underline and support the fact that we should only be leaving home right now for essential purposes # that includes exercise or recreation but it does not include simple socialising.#Strengthening the obligation on employers to allow staff to work from home whenever possible. #The law already says we should only be leaving home to go to workit is work that cannot be done from home # this is a legal obligation that falls on iniduals,# she said. Statutory guidance will be published to make it clear to employers that they must support their staff to work from home wherever possible.#If you#re staff were working from home during the first lockdown last year # they should be working from home now and you should be facilitating that,# she said.Strengthening provision for work carried out inside people#s houses to put the #guidance# previously issued into law to help with enforcement.

in further reducing the interactions that allow the virus to spread - will help our essential efforts to suppress it.\"And however technical the changes may sound, I know that all of them involve further restrictions on our essential liberties.\"The decision comes as Covid cases across Scotland continue to stay at a high level, with the National Records of Scotland today revealing that , people have died with confirmed or suspectedcoronavirus.Heres what you need to know:TakeawaysThe First Minister has said thatfastfoodtakeaways, including many big-name chains, will face tighter restrictions as customers will no longer be permitted to go inside tocollect takeaway food or coffee.Any outlet wishing to offer takeaway will have to do so from a serving hatch or doorway.This reduces the risk of customers coming into contact indoors with each other, or with staff.Alcohol changesAt the moment, dferent parts of Scotland have dferent laws in relation to the consumption of alcohol in outdoor public places.However, from Saturday, it will be against the law in all level  areas of Scotland to drink alcohol outdoors in public.This will mean, for example, that buying a takeaway pint and drinking it outdoors will not be permitted.Ms Sturgeon said: \"I know this will not be a popular move.\"But it is intended to underline and support the fact that we should only be leaving home just now for essential purposes.\"That includes exercise or recreation but not simple socialising.\"And when you do leave the home, you should only meet one person from another household, in a group no bigger than two people.\"I know this is a hard message -

but stay at homeNo changes have been made for rules around outdoor exercise -however, Ms Sturgeon reiterated the \"stay at home\"regulations.The First Minister said: \"This is intended to close an apparent loophole rather than change the spirit of the law. It will also bring the wording of the stay at home regulations in Scotland into line with the other UK nations.\"Right now, the law states that people can only leave home for an essential purpose.\"However, having left home for an essential purpose, someone could then stay out of their home to do something that is not essential without breaching the law as it stands.\"So the amendment will make it clear that people must not leave or remain outside the home unless it is for an essential purpose.\"This change will provide legal clarity to facilitate any necessary enforcement.Ms Sturgeon added: \"I want to be clear though that this does not change the range of essential purposes that currently enable people to leave their house - nor does it, for example, put any time limit on how long you can be outdoors for essential exercise.\"But it does mean thatthe police challenge you for being out of the house doing something that is not essential, it will not be a defence to say you initially left the house to do something that was essential.\"Click and Collect servicesShops that have been operating a Click and Collect service will have to stop doing so under the new guidelines.Now, only retailers selling essential items will be allowed to offer click and collect.This will include, for example, clothes and footwear, baby equipment, homeware and books.All other click and collect services must stop.The First Minister said: \"More importantly, for click and collect services that are allowed, staggered appointments will need to be offered to avoid any potential for queuing, and access inside premises for collection will not be permitted.\"I know that businesses affected by this change will be disappointed and that many have gone to great s to make services as safe as possible.\"But we must reduce as far as is possible the reasons people have just now for leaving home and coming into contact with others.

Clearly, we will stay closely involved and be seeking the best possible outcome as we have done in the past.’TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGOSpy camera scheme takes a step forwardThe group planning to set up a town centre security system in Campbeltown is considering applying to the government for funding.The Scottish Office has just made £ million available to pay for , new closed circuit television cameras to help fight crime in Scottish towns.The driving force behind Campbeltown’s proposed system, Kintyre Crime Prevention Panel, recently received an estimate for the cost of installing a system from a leading security firm. Thorne Security says it could have a system in operation for £,, less than half the amount the  previously thought it would cost.The system would include four cameras to cover Main Street, Longrow, Burnside Square and the area around Hall Street and the cross.Four special television screens at Campbeltown Police Station would allow the police to watch the pictures from the cameras. The images would be recorded on an industrial-quality video recorder at the station. The pictures could alert the police to trouble or help them trace offenders.The team from Thorne Security will be visiting Campbeltown at the end of January to demonstrate the equipment.The secretary of the , Sergeant Douglas Reid of Campbeltown police, has already contacted the Scottish Office for more details about the funding package. Sergeant Reid said: ‘The  is fully committed, following the tremendous public response, to go in as far as possible along this road.’The  is already planning to apply to other local and national bodies for contributions towards the cost of the system.The Scottish Office’s challenge competition will make funds available for groups representing local communities to bid for money to fund CCTV systems.Applicants from dferent areas will bid in competition with each other for a share of the government cash.The first town centre security camera system in Scotland was set up in Airdrie three years ago. New research shows that in the first two years after the system was set up, the crime rate plunged by  per cent.The Scottish Office says there is no evidence that crime was simply being shted to areas outwith the reach of the cameras. Instead the total amount of recorded crime actually fell.FIFTY YEARS AGOMcCartney again!Mr Paul McCartney, ex-bass guitarist with the Beatles, has recently purchased from Mr A Revie, Loch Ranachan Farm, which comprises  acres and adjoins his other farm, High Park.Mr McCartney has been spending a few days on the farm with his we and family over the festive season.One happy Rangers fanMr Crawford Morans of  Albyn Avenue, who is employed with the Ministry of Social Security, has had a good ending to the old year.

In the Clyde, however, the Board of Trade did not insist on this in respect of vessels trading exclusively within what is known as the smooth water area.This area was within an imaginary line drawn from Skipness Point to Fairlie. On the date in question, the accused conveyed a cargo from Glasgow to Tobermory via the Crinan Canal.As soon as he had left Crinan, he was in contravention of the regulations, having entered the more hazardous waters off the west coast.On behalf of the accused, an agent stated that he had traded with the Bloodhound for nearly  years. During the war, the ship had been requisitioned by the Ministry of Shipping, and under the orders of that department had been sent outside the limits of the smooth water area.The accused had naturally thought that what he had been doing during the war, when he traded to ports on Islay and the Ayrshire coast, he was free to do now.Sherf Macmaster Campbell imposed a penalty of £."},{"url":null,"title":"leader january 1 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Here we spotlight some of the deserving stars that Prime Minister Boris Johnson applauds as “an inspiration to us all”.Last year brought to the fore a new breed of community champions# including those working in the NHS to treat coronavirus patients, scientists developing effective vaccines and key workers keeping essential services operating.These “ordinary people” who continue to go above and beyond have been recognised for sterling work delivered in extraordinary circumstances.The  New Years Honours has recognised champions of sport as well as stars of stage and screen but this year, more than ever, it is ordinary people who have been recognised alongside them. Among the deserving recipients are leading lights who have battled to save lives and keep the NHS afloat and those who have kept the country smiling by spreading kindness.The list includes medical experts as well as volunteers working with youngsters, the elderly and those with disabilities. Those working in libraries, education and community arts also received recognition. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “In a year when so many have made sacrices to protect our NHS and save people’s lives, the outstanding eff orts of those receiving honours are a welcome reminder of the strength of human spirit and of what can be achieved through courage and compassion. “The  New Year Honours offer us an opportunity to salute their dedication and recognise many who have gone above and beyond in their contribution to our country. “As we begin a new year and continue to come together to fight this virus, may their service and stories be an inspiration to us all.”Jacquie Winning’s award “recognises the achievements of everyone” at Forth Valley Sensory Centre following “an exceptionally challenging year”.The  year-old from Falkirk was recognised for going the extra mile to manage “wraparound” services to people with sensory loss during the pandemic “COVID- has been challenging for everyone, but more so for people with sensory loss. Those with hearing loss face challenges due to face masks and social distancing interfering with their ability to lip read.“Those with sight loss face signicant challenges managing to maintain physical distancing while undertaking essential trips out,” explained the MBE recipient.Jacquie’s support included providing Braille copies of virus information, establishing telephone, text and email befriending lelines to address isolation and producing podcasts providing vital updates.“The impact is that some of the most vulnerable people in society have been incredibly well supported during the most challenging of times. Thanks go to the dedication, enthusiasm and willingness to adapt by our team, volunteers and partners, and tremendous support of our board of directors.”Cabinet Office confirmation of Dr Tamas Szakmany’s award made him “astonished, touched and humbled”. The  year-old from Newport explained: “I thought I was doing my job like everybody . I didn’t think for one minute it would result in this. I’m really surprised. Once I was allowed to talk about it, the first thing I said was how fortunate I was to work with this team. “ was dficult professionally. Personally, I had many successes. It was a double-edged sword. The MBE is recognition for the enormous effort everyone has made to get us through the first wave. I hope we have similar success again.”The Royal Gwent Hospital critical care consultant, recognised for exceptional service to the NHS, spearheaded Welsh Critical Care Network response during the pandemic, rapidly disseminating information on lessons learnt via traditional and social media s.

Michael Briggs’ MBE was rewarded for services beyond the call of duty in the voluntary sector and community.“Even though we’ve hardly moved out of the office, it’s all been pretty busy,” explained the EastBelfast Community Development Agency Executive Director.“We’ve been managing our COVID programme, buying bulk food to get out to groups we support. We developed a network of groups delivering small packages to people who are vulnerable, shielding or in financial need.” The  year-old continued: “There are so many stories from older people who say ‘it’s just good to know people are thinking about us.”Thinking the honour email was promotional, Michael initially “didn’t actually take it seriously”.He revealed: “I nearly didn’t open it.

More than £ million of this we have been grateful to receive at Sightsavers.Money raised by players has been indispensable in helping Sightsavers to fund, in  alone, eye services for more than , people and more than  sight-saving cataract surgeries.In , funding also helped us to support the Covid- response. Children with disabilities kept learning throughout the pandemic, thanks to distance learning equipment and teacher training, PPE and hygiene kits.Children like Marie in Sierra Leone, who is blind and was in danger of being left behind when schools closed, until she was given a typewriter, a radio and assistance so that she could keep studying.So, once again, a big thank you to all the players in Scotland for your generosity.To find out about some of the lives being turned around by players# support, please head on over to www.sightsavers.org ppl or give Sightsavers a call on   .Dr Caroline Harper CBE, Sightsavers CEO.Scots have taken to online technology like never before to keep in touch during this dficult time.When we first went into lockdown, there were concerns on whether our networks would cope with this big increase in online traffic. But, although customers’ usage of data more than doubled during the period, our networks were able to stand up to the demands.I’m immensely proud of the role my colleagues have played in keeping the country connected during this crisis. From the engineers who keep our broadband and mobile networks connected, to the vital contact centre staff in Glasgow, Dundee, Greenock, Edinburgh and Thurso, helping people when they need it most.I’m proud also of the role our people played in supporting the NHS in Scotland during the crisis, including working with Scottish Government to quickly provide communications to the temporary hospitals.The pandemic has shown the vital role digital technology and internet connectivity now plays in all our lives. If all homes and businesses are going to stay ahead, we know that fast and reliable broadband and good mobile coverage is going to be essential for the post-Covid recovery.While BT Group continues to invest billions in these networks, we know that we can’t do this alone. We’ll continue to work with governments and local authorities to make sure that no areas are left behind.Jane Wood, BT Group Scotland director.The  Covid crisis has prompted a greater sense of social cohesion and solidarity but it also exposed and exacerbated some of the barriers that blind and partially sighted people still face.Access to online shopping slots, a lack of essential health information in formats such as audio and braille, and confusion over whether social distancing allowed for blind and partially sighted people to still be guided added to the distress many felt.The first lockdown came out of the blue when we had little real-le experience of managing a national emergency, but it is now more essential than ever that we learn the lessons and ensure no one falls through the safety-net. Another period of enforced confinement during the winter months could hit some particularly hard.During the first lockdown, RNIB Scotland and other charities worked extremely hard to ensure the needs of the most vulnerable were met # at a time when even the most able in society were thrown by the suddenness and uncertainty the crisis had created.We negotiated set online shopping slots for people with sight loss, worked with public bodies to ensure the often vital information they put out was available in formats accessible to everyone, and claried the rules on guiding people with a visual impairment.These gains must be reinforced  we are ing to another nationwide lockdown.Currently, around , people are living in Scotland with signicant sight loss. Although most are over the age of , around , children and young people also have a visual impairment.The RNIB Helpline remains available on    and information continues to be broadcast on RNIB#s Connect Radio station. The RNIB Talking Book library posts and downloads thousands of titles in audio and other formats.Find out more at www.rnib.org.uk scotlandJames Adams, director, RNIB Scotland.As always in such matters, the UK-EU Brexit deal will iniably throw up more than a few surprises aside from the usual headlines heralding a British #victory# in negotiations.The fact that, for example, seed potatoes are not to be included in the deal will be deeply damaging to our rural economy. Scottish seed potato farmers are one of the biggest exporters of potatoes, used in the production of chips and crisps, in the world.The sector in Scotland accounts for around  per cent of UK production and is worth about £ million annually.One fth of these exports go to the EU, amounting to more than , tonnes a year.This is clearly a disastrous Brexit outcome for Scottish farmers and like all other aspects of Brexit, foisted on Scotland against its will.A terrible negotiating failure on the part of the Tory government, and a devastating blow to an extremely valuable part of Scotland’s farming industry, I am sure it will not be the first damaging impact to be highlighted once the deal is fully analysed.Alex Orr, Edinburgh."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week january 8 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

There are remarkable stories about his le, who knowsthese are true.ldquoCan you tell one of those stories then, dad  said Skye, not missing a trick.ldquoOh, er, well I will, but not tonight, because tonight I am retelling one of his famous tales in a dferent way, to show that stories can be told from dferent points of view, and then the moral we take from them may be a dferent one.The tale for this evening was the boy who cried wolf, a very well-known Aesop fable which has evolved and changed over the centuries, but the essentials have remained.ldquoWhatrsquos the moral in this story  I asked the kids.ldquoIf you keep telling lies then people will stop believing you, even when you tell the truth, said my -year-old Manja.ldquoYes, and thatrsquos a good moral. But now I want to tell the same story in a dferent way, and letrsquos seeyou find any dferent morals in it,ldquoOK, as long as you tell us the stories about Aesop tomorrow, bargained Skye.ldquoAgreed, I said and the kids settled for the tale.lsquoOnce there was a lad called Peter, who because he was  years old was given the responsibility of looking after the sheep on the hill above the village.He was told by his father: ldquoIf a wolf comes, blow this horn as loud as you can and we will come running to help you.He was proud to be given the responsibility and sat by the fire keeping warm, feeling very grown up. But as it got dark the moon came out and Peter saw strange shapes on the hillside. They were moving slightly and he couldnrsquot decide what they were. It seemed they were crawling towards him. It wasnrsquot a wolf but he became very scared.So he blew the horn as hard as he could. He heard the sound of shouting and running feet as his father and other villagers came running up the hill.ldquoWherersquos the wolf  asked Peterrsquos father.ldquoI donrsquot think they are wolves but therersquos something scary over there, he replied. His father looked and shook his head.ldquoThey are just bushes and trees, swaying in the breeze, explained his father angrily. ldquoYou have called us up here for nothing. Irsquom angry and disappointed in you. Do not do that again.He left with the villagers and reminded Peter: ldquoBlow that horn only when there is a wolf.Peter felt angry and disappointed with himself. But now he understood that it was just the outline of the trees and bushes in the moonlight, so he wasnrsquot scared of the shapes anymore.He sat by the fire eating his supper. It was a warm, cosy fire and it made him miss home and his family. His father had always told him that the warmth of a fire was for sharing, but he had no one to share his with. His head began to fill with stories and riddles, but there was no one to share these with either.He wasnrsquot scared anymore but Peter began to feel lonely. He had the sheep but they couldnrsquot solve riddles or listen to stories like his younger siblings, or sit with him by the fire and share its warmth. The fireside was always a place where his father told stories and his mother sang. Now he was alone and sadness overcame him. Hersquod never felt lonely like this.So he picked up the horn and blew it as loud as he could. Once again, the sound of shouting and running feet was heard as Peterrsquos father and his neighbours came running up the hill.ldquoWherersquos the wolf  asked his father.Peter looked down at the ground: ldquoWell, therersquos is no wolf, father, itrsquos just I was so lonely by the fire all by myself and...But he didnrsquot get the chance to explain. ldquoThere is no wolf  said his father angrily. ldquoI can hardly believe you have called us up here once again for nothing!Peter looked down at the ground and apologised, and promised he wouldnrsquot call them for nothing again. His father and the neighbours ed to the village in an unhappy mood.Peter settled down by the fire once again but this time he heard growling and when he looked up there really was a wolf. So he blew the horn as hard as he could. But there was no sound of shouting and running feet. So he blew again. Still nothing.So he shouted ldquowolf, wolf! in between blowing the horn, but his cry of wolf was ignored, because his father and the villagers didnrsquot believe him.The wolf seemed to understand the opportunity and so ate or killed all the sheep.rsquoSo the story ended. I sat back and looked at the kids for their reaction.ldquoWell, thatrsquos a dferent way to tell the story are there dferent morals in it  I asked.ldquoWell, Peter did blow the horn when there wasnrsquot a wolf, just like in the story in the book, but it wasnrsquot really for nothing was it  It was because he was scared, and then lonely and sad. It is the same story, but then again isnrsquot, reflected Manja.ldquoItrsquos from a dferent point of view, added Skye.ldquoAnd what morals or lessons do you see in this version  I asked.Well we had quite a discussion and I think an important one for the children at this time. Irsquoll leave you to have your thoughts on it.Except to say that we are all Peter sometimes, and whatever reason we feel the need to call for help ndash and there will be many dferent ones for

painting scenes from his home town and from Gullane, Dirleton and the Bass Rock, ranging from the castle ruins of the mighty to the humble cottages of the poor.Since he also liked Dunbar, not less than  of his postcards are from this East Lothian coastal town, which was popular among the tourists in Edwardian times.Some of his cards depict standard sights like the Castle Ruins and the Town Hall one has a quaint little cottage at Cleikum Toll and another the Loverrsquos Walk, a rump of which still exists.One of his most interesting cards , from a historical point of view, depicts the ancient Abbey Ruins at Friarscroft: they were quite a rural scene in Edwardian times, with sheep grazing and some old cottages in the background.This Trinitarian abbey was founded by the Countess of Dunbar in , as one of eight known houses to have been located in Scotland.The abbey still stood in  but it fell into a gradual decline the remaining friars moved away, and most of the stoneware of the church was taken away for local building projects.A  map shows that by this time, only the tower stood, being used as a dovecot.In , a group of archaeologists and antiquaries made excavations near the dovecot tower, finding the original tiled floor of the church, but no trace of an original dwelling-house for the friars anywhere nearby.Since the old friars had built their tower sturdy and strong, it still stands today , looking virtually unchanged since Phillimorersquos time.The only sheep to be found anywhere in the vicinity are the lamb chops for sale at the Co-op supermarket, although the cottages in the background remain more or less unchanged.Friarrsquos Walk, also known as the Monkrsquos Walk of Dunbar, is a more mysterious matter.This structure is still largely in existence, consisting of two parallel ancient sandstone rubble walls stretching southwards from West Port.It has been presumed that Friarrsquos Walk must have some connection with the Trinitarian abbey, and that the part connecting it with West Port is a later addition.The northern part of Friars WalkAlready in Victorian times, Friarrsquos Walk was used to dump rubbish and garden refuse from the gardens of the houses on High Street, but the entirewas passable within living memory.When examined by the archaeologists in , it was largely filled with earth and quite overgrown when I explored it in , things had not improved in the slightest.What might have been, through the deployment of a sergeant-major and  unemployed youngsters armed with shovels and saws, one of the leading tourist attractions of Dunbar has been left to fight a losing battle against decay.There does not appear to be any other instances of ancient double walls with a narrow walkway between them, and the Dunbar local historians have speculated what use had been made of Friarrsquos Walk in olden times.One rather adventurous hypothesis is that the Trinitarian monks used the walls as a walkway from their abbey to another building, perhaps their dwelling-house.When ended at its southern extremityby the construction of a Georgian or early Victorian building, Friarrsquos Walk is heading straight for what is today the grounds of the Priory, my own house in Dunbar.No ancient ruins ever existed in these parts, as far as can be discerned: a postcard from Edwardian times, stamped and posted before work on the Priory was begun in , merely shows farmland and market gardens.Maybe the friars had their garden here, growing fruit and medicinal plants Another speculation is that one of the walls of Friarrsquos Walk represents a substantial fragment of the post-medieval western town wall.Since at least the western wall of Friarrsquos Walk has several blocked doorways, a rationalist would instead suspect that it was intended as a rear lane to the houses on High Street, used for the removal of rubbish and garden waste.The mystery of Friarrsquos Walk is a profound one, and unlikely ever to be solved."},{"url":null,"title":"chance-say-proposed-crematorium-old-craighall","story":"Westerleigh Group wants to build the facility off the A, on the opposite side of the carriageway from the

initially approved the building of the first phase of houses with a condition which required upgrades to the Bankton interchange, including traffic control signals at the roundabouts and additional upgrades to the slip roads.However, the amendment will now allow  homes to be occupied before any of the upgrade work is carried out.Councillor Willie Innes, council leader, told the planning committee that Blindwells was ldquoone of the most important developments in our local plan.He said: ldquoIt is important this site moves forward, it has been so long in the waiting.ldquoIt is also important not to impose conditions on applicants that are onerous and can prevent it going forward.Some elected members voiced disappointment that no representative of Hargreaves took part in the virtual meeting however, it is understood technical dficulties prevented them joining in the discussion.Councillor Jeremy Findlay cast doubt on the traffic impact study claims that  homes would not make a lsquomaterialrsquo dference.He said: ldquoI am not an expert in traffic modelling but I do believe there will be queuing problems on the A as this development expands.The change to conditions to allow the delay to the road upgrade was unanimously approved by the planning committee."},{"url":null,"title":"tesco-asda-aldi-waitrose-announce-new-face-mask-rules","story":"Morrisons were the first to make a change to in-store rules and take a stricterstance on face masks, a decisions which earned praise from Health Secretary Matt Hancock.Mr Hancock said:ldquoI applaud the action Morrisons has taken today, the supermarket, they have said that they will not let people in without a mask unless they clearly have a medical reason.ldquoThatrsquos the right approach and I want to see all parts of society playing their part in this.Sainsburys followed suit and announced it will enforce mask wearing and shopping alone in UK stores as the country battles a rapid rise in Covid cases.But they are not the only supermarketscracking down on shoppers not wearing face coverings whilst shopping, a number of supermarkets have also announced that they will be doing the same.Tesco, Asda, Aldi and Waitrose are the latest to tighten their rules around shoppers wearing face coverings, stating that shoppers without medical exemptions will be refused entry to their stores.An Asda spokesperson said: ldquoIf a customer has forgotten their face covering, we will continue to offer them one free of charge.ldquoBut should a customer refuse to wear a covering without a valid medical reason and be in any way challenging to our colleagues about doing so, our security colleagues will refuse their entry.A Tesco spokesperson said that as well as tightening restrictions around shoppers wearing face coverings, customers are also being urged to shop alone.They said: ldquoWe are also asking our customers to shop alone, unless theyrsquore a carer or with children.ldquoTo support our colleagues, we will have additional security in stores to help manage this.Waitrose is also following the trend of offering disposable face masks to customers without a face covering, and denying entry to anyone who refuses to comply.Andrew Murphy, executive director of operations at Waitrose parent company, the John Lewis Partnership, said: ldquoBy insisting on the wearing of face coverings, over and above the social distancing measures we already have in place, we aim to make our shops even safer for customers.Aldi chief executive Giles Hurley also said: ldquoThe safety of our colleagues and customers is our number one priority.ldquoWearing a mask is mandatory for everyone that shops at Aldi, except for the small number of people who have a medical exemption.While a number of supermarkets have clamped down with stricter regulations around wearing face coverings, some are yet to take a tougher stance.When askedCo-op would be taking similar measures, chief executive Jo Whitfield said that all customers ldquomust take responsibility for wearing a face mask.She said: ldquoWersquove increased our in store messaging to remind customers and government guidance does state that the police can take measuresmembers of the public donrsquot comply with this law.Additionally, Lidl also said that it would ldquoremind those not wearing a face covering of the government guidelines and their own responsibility to keep themselves and others safe.The renewed dedication to ensuring shoppers comply with government rules regarding face masks comes after supermarket staff revealed the abuse theyrsquove faced for challenging customers for not wearing a face covering.A Tesco worker from Gloucestershire said she was ldquohorried by responses she had received after challenging customers, adding: ldquoI find, and so do my colleagues, that itrsquos not as strict as the first lockdown.ldquoWe have people refusing to wear masks, customers not social distancing.ldquoI asked a customer where his mask was and he hit the roof, telling me [Covid-] is not real, and itrsquos the government making it all up - I was horried.An Asda staff member at a store in north-west Meryside added: ldquoI was put as a safety marshal on the front door, asking people to hand sanitise andthey need a mask.ldquoThe amount of times the response is lsquoOh, I canrsquot wear one of thosersquo, or lsquoIrsquom exemptrsquo, and show no proof.ldquoI used to ask people on the front door for proof of exemption and the abuse I got was mostly from the younger generation.ldquoMy manager told me we have to offer them a mask, but canrsquot enforce it, so I feel itrsquos a waste of time.ldquoMost people donrsquot even bring a mask with them, so have no intention of wearing

our essential efforts to suppress it.\"And however technical the changes may sound, I know that all of them involve further restrictions on our essential liberties.\"The decision comes as Covid cases across Scotland continue to stay at a high level, with the National Records of Scotland today revealing that , people have died with confirmed or suspectedcoronavirus.The First Minister has said thatfastfoodtakeaways, including many big-name chains, will face tighter restrictions as customers will no longer be permitted to go inside tocollect takeaway food or coffee.Any outlet wishing to offer takeaway will have to do so from a serving hatch or doorway.This reduces the risk of customers coming into contact indoors with each other, or with staff.At the moment, dferent parts of Scotland have dferent laws in relation to the consumption of alcohol in outdoor public places.However, from Saturday, it will be against the law in all level  areas of Scotland to drink alcohol outdoors in

Yet there is another natural resource that could be as important in helping Scotland achieve net zero carbon emissions by  ndash our woodlands and forestry. The sector contributes an estimated pound billion to the Scottish economy, with ambitions to double this over the next decade.A great deal of planning has gone into developing a sustainably managed set of forests and woodlands in Scotland ndash land cover of just five per cent at the beginning of the th century has increased to % today, totalling . million hectares.There is signicant local demand for the sectorrsquos products, not least in housebuilding, where % of new homes in Scotland are built with timber ndash almost three times as many as in England and Wales. Thatrsquos before we look at the materialrsquos potential use in public sector or commercial projects.The opportunities are vast, yet, in  the UK was the worldrsquos second-largest net importer of forest products ndash including timber ndash behind only China. The use of homegrown timber has largely been restricted to non-structural applications in construction, such as repair, maintenance and improvement, as well as fencing material or pallets.There is inevitably a considerable carbon cost associated with importing any goods and greater use of a naturally renewable, low carbon-embodied material can only boost sustainability in the built environment and we are on the verge of this change.Edinburgh Napier Universityrsquos Centre for Offsite Construction and Innovative Structures has led on research to determine the viability of using homegrown timber for the production of mass timber products and systems. The centrersquos work has proven that, with drying and processing, Scottish timber can indeed be used for a iety of higher-value purposes.Following these efforts, a number of Scottish-sourced timber products have been pilot manufactured, tested, and analysed for use. Along with a consortium of partners, Construction Scotland Innovation Centreis trialling homegrown timber in a live environment.The project will manufacture the first Scottish-sourced cross-laminated timber and nail-laminated timber housing unit using the UKrsquos only vacuum press at CSICrsquos innovation factory. The show home will be presented at COP United Nations conference on climate change in Glasgow later this year.Although one piece of a larger puzzle, the demonstrator could lead to the mainstream use of home-grown timber in construction in the UK. It could also prove the investment case for the development of Scotlandrsquos first engineered timber manufacturing plant, offering an alternative to imported products.If a \"green recovery\" is the way forward in the post-Covid- world, the materials we use to build will be key ndash in terms of how they are produced and from where they are sourced.

Shortly before Christmas a weary-looking assistant in Tesco told me that he gets regular abuse from customers. ldquoYou wouldnrsquot believe it, he said. Before reaching me, he had been serving a woman who appeared to be anticipating Armageddon rather than lockdown. Her elderly companion in a mobility scooter was helping her to pack, setting each item as carefully into the bags asit were a Ming vase. Despite the queue building up, the till assistant was a model of patience and cheer, and the feel-good effect rippled down the line, putting everyone in a better mood.As customers grow lax about safety, and shops grow overcrowded, staff are starting to protest against the daily health risks they are obliged to run. With people abandoning masks, refusing to sanitise and licking their fingers before counting out money, you understand why they might be anxious. :Country Le with Rosemary Goring: Snow brings cold comforts Stores are among the riskiest places you can be, in terms of catching Covid. Before the virus had begun spreading as fast as it presently is, a study in England last November showed almost a fth of infections were linked to a shopping trip.With the new iant now galloping across the British Isles, it is sobering to reflect that every outing for groceries is like running a gauntlet. Whether you emerge unscathed depends on factors completely out of your hands ndash namely, other people. Most of us are now schooled in donning a mask, wiping trolleys and sanitising our hands on entering, but once over the door, the threat multiplies.: Country Le with Rosemary Goring: Snow brings cold comfortsSome remain oblivious to social distancing, seeming determined to encroach on your patch. Filthy looks over the rim of a mask make no impression whatsoever. What can you do but step back  Yet while I try to stick to the rules, occasionally I struggle with one-way systems, and find myself backtracking at speed. Taking a wrong turning and discovering yoursquore going against the flow reminds me of the day when, oblivious to a no-entry sign, I drove down an Edinburgh street to find a tram heading straight for me.In shops, the people Irsquove seen who donrsquot follow the prescribed route around the aisles are not usually deliberately breaching the code or ignoring the signage, but are elderly and a little bewildered. Being vintage does not, of course, mean you cannot be carrying the virus, but such slip-ups do not inspire the same outrage as the aggressive attitude of wilful rebels. In this category I include folk taking children around the store, asthey were on a trip to a theme park.Recent announcements by Morrisons and Sainsburyrsquos that they will bar anyone not wearing a face covering, without proof of medical exemption, have been swtly followed by Asda, Tesco and Waitrose. This is to be welcomed, above all by their staff. It is one thing for most of us to do a swt weekly raid for essentials, quite another to be in contact with the public for hours on end. Nor should shop workers have to act as law enforcers.:From a winter wonderland to an ice-bound hell In light of the Selkirkincident, itrsquos understandable why someone would hesitate to confront a customer without a mask, or urge them to keep a distance. Some shops say they tell staff not to challenge those who wonrsquot wear face coverings, since it might be for valid medical reasons. Presumably they also donrsquot want them to run any risk of verbal or physical abuse. Sadly, that is little comfort for shoppers in their vicinity, and even less for the checkout operative who, despite screens, masks, visors and gloves, has no alternative but to be uncomfortably close to them for as long as it takes to ring through their goods. Since supermarkets have done well during this crisis ndash and eventhey had not ndash they should have trained security personnel at every branch, to enforce the rules.Given the level of contact shop staff have with the public, should they be prioritised for vaccinations  All who fall into the higher risk categories, whether by age or medical vulnerability, will already be among the first to receive it. But what about the rest  If staff in care homes and the NHS are getting the jab, should not supermarket workers too  Thatrsquos certainly the argument of Usdaw, the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers, whose concerns on this front have been heightened by the recent deaths from Covid  of two staff from Tesco in Greenock. Usdaw is also urging ato the stricter protocols of the original lockdown in March, when, among other measures, the numbers of customers was closely monitored.In an ideal world, shop workers would be protected ahead of those who can continue to work from home or in isolation until the pandemic is under control. Realistically, in the current race to deploy supplies of vaccine most effectively, I donrsquot see them being bumped up the queue. Defining who would be eligible would be a mammoth task in itself.Nevertheless, therersquos no doubt that supermarket staff should be recognised in the same breath as those who work in the NHS. Ask someone what they do, andthe answer is a nurse or doctor, peoplersquos faces tend to light up. If they say they work in Asda, the response tends not to be so enthusiastic. Yet it should. They might not be dealing with patients in intensive care, but now, more than ever, the shelf stackers, online order processors, delivery drivers and those at the tills deserve utmost respect and admiration.

Cute, but see-through.But the first part of that manesto section is very dferent. This is where the SNP was onto something.There is nothing inevitable about independence becoming the clear and sustained preference of most Scots.That is a specic sht, not a nebulous formula, and it has the potential to deliver a referendum not because it was in an SNP manesto, but because it offers a British Prime Minister an escape route.At the moment, the UK Governmentrsquos take on Indyref is, You canrsquot loseyou donrsquot play.But therersquos another way not to lose. You canrsquot loseyou canrsquot win. You canrsquot losetherersquos no contest. You canrsquot loseitrsquos a foregone conclusion.Take the  referendum on devolution. Decades in the making, the landslide result was always in the bag.The new Tory party leader, William Hague, campaigned against it, but there was no question of him resigning when the results came in. He lasted four more years in the job.While another No campaigner, Brian Monteith, became a Tory MSP in the parliament he opposed barely  months later. Voters and political colleagues can be rather forgiving when it comes to lost causes.The reason Indyref is off the cards at the moment is because the outcome is uncertain. It would be a real contest.Any Prime Minister would be obliged to fight for their political le.If the result went against them, they would be judged to have lost where a better, more credible campaigner could have won. Theyd be out.Butsupport for independence had long been the clear and sustained preference of the Scottish people, those judgments would not apply and nor would the consequences.If the result had been obvious to the rest of the UK, and to English voters in particular, a British Prime Minister could survive a vote for independence.Naturally, they would sigh and mourn the passing of the Union, but their career need not die with it.For years, the SNP has been told what it needs to do is reach out to No voters to win the next referendum.But just as signicant are those who didnt have vote in  - the English.Convince them independence is surely coming, that itrsquos not personal just the juggernaut of history, and their MPs can start to contemplate it too.When most of Westminster is,not happy, but reconciled to a defeat, granting Indyref becomes possible.You cant loseyou cant win.It may be a fair wait. But no PM, not just this one, is about to grant a referendum until they feel the fallout from losing is manageable for them, their party and what is left of the UK."},{"url":null,"title":"celtic-right-back-neil-lennon-says-stiliyan-petrov","story":":Peter Lawwell issues apology to Celtic fans for Dubai tripCeltic are currently  points off the pace of Rangers and with a squad that has  players self-isolating as well as Lennon and assistant John Kennedy, the game against an in-form Livingston side this weekend will be viewed with some trepidation. Indeed, such has been the kamikaze nature of the defending this term that all games have come with a sense of anxiety given the propensity to gt cheap goals.The circus around the club was exacerbated by the draw against Hibs on Monday night with one of the accusations towards the board from the club support being that they sat on their hands too long during a dismal opening half of the season.ldquoTo be honest, it was the right thing to do to wait and not make a decision before Christmas, said Petrov. ldquoThere was still the game against Rangers to play and there was the chance of a quadruple Treble. With the games in hand and the trip to Ibrox, there was still a chance of reducing the points gap to make it plausible to fight for the title. I think Neil deserved that chance and had earned that bit of time.:Celtic skipper Scott Brown hits back at criticism over Dubai poolside picture with Neil LennonldquoI have always believed that managers deserve the opportunity to get it right and get to survive a period when results are not good. But ultimately anyone involved in football knows that everyone is judged on results and over the past few months the results havenrsquot been satisfactory for Celtic. When it gets to that stage then it becomes accepted that change is almost always coming. I think we can all say that the league has gone and the chance to win -in-a-row has gone given the way everything is standing now.Petrovrsquos inaugural season at Celtic was the ill-fated brief John Barnes chapter at the club. Barnes was sacked after an ignominious Scottish Cup defeat to Inverness Caledonian Thistle and after a -game league run where Celtic had fallen  points behind Rangers. Lennonrsquos side have played the same number of games albeit three games fewer than the Ibrox side. The very real danger for Celtic now is that they risk a collapse that could bring humiliation in terms of the final league table. Celtic had intimated in January that Lennon would be given the duration of the campaign and whatever comes next in the long-term, for now he still somehow needs to get a reaction from his dressing room.ldquoIt is a dficult time, said Petrov. ldquoI know from my own time when things were not going well and we had the police outside the ground and you can feel the anger. It gets very hard in the dressing room when you are in that kind of environment because it is not just about the football then.:SFA confirm compliance officer investigation into Celtic Dubai picturesldquoIt is about everything round about it too. It is about the fans, the results, the performances and with so many issues and so much noise you feel the fragility in the dressing room. You have players looking at one another and thinking where are we going  How do we get out of this  There are lots of doubts in everyonersquos minds. That then makes it dficult to come together. ldquoMentally it is very challenging because the games are still coming. It is a tough situation when you feel like the league has gone away from you but as a footballer you still have professional pride.Celtic last felt compelled to act to ward off a Rangers resurgence when they brought Brendan Rodgers in to replace Ronny Deila after a Scottish Cup defeat to the Ibrox side. Whether the same resources are there for a manager of similar standing remains to be seen but Petrov believes the job requires a signicant personality to assuage the wounds of this season.ldquoThe big challenge going forward is changing the mentality now within the dressing room, he said. ldquoIf the call is made to bring in a new manager then I think you canrsquot be rushed into it. It is a huge appointment because anyone who is going to the manager at Celtic needs to be a personality. They need to be a leader. To demand the best, to demand high standards and a certain philosophy. ldquoMartin OrsquoNeill came in and made an impact immediately after a season that had been full of anger and disappointment. He ticked all those boxes but he was also given the resources to make changes to the squad. The biggest change, though, was belief and mentality.ldquoThere is a decision to be made now about the direction the club is going to take. The fans want to see some leadership and some common-sense. Dubai, in the middle of a pandemic when everyone is being asked to make sacrices, was always going to be hard to convince people of. I know it was planned a few months in advance but by the time it came around the restrictions for everyone had changed. Footballers are seen as privileged at the best of times but when you are seen to have more freedom than anyone , there is always going to be anger. It was the wrong decision to go."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-independence-support-independence-51-per-cent-new-poll","story":"The SavantaComRes poll, in partnership with The Scotsman, paints a \"virtually unchanged picture\", say pollsters, with findings showingthe SNP are on course for a majority at the Scottish Parliamentary elections in May.On the question of whether Scotland should be an independent country, the poll found that % would vote lsquoyesrsquo tomorrow, % would vote lsquonorsquo and % said they did not know.The #indyref voting intention is virtually unchanged:Yes % No % Undecided % w o UndecidedYes % No % - Jan@TheScotsman pic xLkKskhahNot counting the undecided votes, support for independence rises to %, with % against.The results come from a total of , Scottish adults aged  or over, who were surveyed online between January  and .Our second poll in partnership with @TheScotsman shows a virtually unchanged picture in the Holyrood VI, with the SNP on course for a majority.Constituency VI:SNP % Conservative % Labour % LD % Other % - Jan pic LWWmrMBMeanwhile, Nicola Sturgeonrsquos handling of the pandemic has led to an \"improved perception\" of the First Minister.A total  per cent of voters ndash of which  per cent voted for Scottish Labour and  per cent voted Scottish Conservative in  ndash now say they are ldquomore likely to vote for the SNP due to the handling of the pandemic.Signicant proportions of  Conservative and Labour voters have an improved perception of Sturgeon following her management of the pandemic.

How could you not  The scale of the decline has been monumental as neutrals and rivals alike have watched on in horror and uttered, lsquothere but for the grace of God go Irsquo.The campaign has been an unmitigated disaster from start to finish. Neil Lennonrsquos side have plummeted in the league, tumbling down the standings all the way from first into second. They didnrsquot even qualy for the Champions League this year, instead having to make to with its less fashionable younger brother, the Europa League, where they got to compete against also-rans like Italian minnows AC Milan. And asthings werenrsquot bad enough already, itrsquos almost been a whole month since they last won a trophy.:Chris Jack: Rangers can welcome the chase after Old Firm power shtYep, there really isnrsquot a fan of any club in Scotland that would happily trade places with Celtic at the moment. How dficult it must be, possessing the best squad in the country and with enough money in the bank ndash not to mention the valuable assets that can be sold in the playing squad ndash to completely overhaul the squad on a whim, should things stop going entirely their own way for the first time in a decade.Itrsquos for this reason that Peter Lawwell, the clubrsquos chief executive, won widespread admiration and universal acclaim for his brave message to supporters on Tuesday afternoon. As Rome burned all around him, this brave man stuck his head above the parapet to say what wersquod all been thinking: poor Celtic. There probably isnrsquot another club around to have suffered through so much over the last year or so.Hersquos got a point. Watching the Premiership champions elegantly negotiate the ious hurdles of adversity placed in front of them this campaign has been truly inspiring. The way they skilfully side-stepped common sense to fly out to Dubai during a pandemic was like watching Odsonne Edouard in full flow with the ball at his feet, and the clubrsquos bullish refusal to accept responsibility or issue an apology until days after the fact is the sort of combative display that Scott Brown would be proud of.:Peter Lawwell issues apology to Celtic fans for Dubai tripI jest, of course. To be fair to Lawwell, he deserves credit for finally admitting that the club got it wrong. And in the five-minute video message to supporters on the club site, he made some valid points. The problem, though, is that those points have been lost, buried under the controversy of a throwaway line.ldquoThis horric pandemic has affected the whole of society, the chief executive told fans. ldquoItrsquos affected people here in Scotland, itrsquos affected our supporters, itrsquos affected our football, itrsquos affected our club ndash probably our club more than any.For a club that have been accused of arrogance in recent weeks, is there any other argument that could have been made that underlined the assertion quite so heavily  If Lawwell truly thinks finishing second in the league and not winning a trophy for the first time in ten years is an unprecedented catastrophe, evidence of some grave ine injustice that makes Celtic deserving of the publicrsquos sympathy, then he is sorely mistaken.When Celtic eventually released their apology, another club in Glasgow made a similar proclamation to their fans. Rather than saying sorry for a self-inflicted PR s***-show, though, Partick Thistle were informing their supporters that due to the decision to postpone all football below the Championship until February, they would start placing their playing staff on furlough so they could ride out the impending financial crisis. Maybe itrsquos just me, but Irsquod argue that one scenario is a little more serious than the other.: Celtic were right to back Neil Lennon, says Stiliyan PetrovIn the interest of full disclosure I should admit that Irsquom a Thistle fan, so the following should be accompanied with a healthy dose of salt. Butwersquore searching for a club that have had a dficult time over the past year or so, there are few with a claim as strong as the Maryhill club.When the Championship was curtailed last season and football brought to a shuddering halt, the Jags were two points behind Queen of the South with a game in hand ndash a game in hand, I might add, against an Inverness team they had beaten on both occasions they had met that season. The league fixture was postponed to accommodate a Scottish Cup tie for the Caley Jags but it mattered little in the end as Thistle were relegated on a points-per-game basis. Or to be specic, by . points. And thatrsquos without even getting into the whole Dundee vote controversy.Not to worry, though. The Jags were given assertions that other SPFL sides would enter into reconstruction talks in good faith. Naturally, the discussions broke down quickly and nothing changed.:Rangers eye move for Coventry City midfielder Gustavo HamerAnother swing and a miss. Rather than iding the cash based on the financial commitments of each club, how much money a particular club received was based on the league they found themselves in. The result  Thistle and Falkirk each got pound, to mitigate the losses of playing behind closed doors, while the likes of Alloa and Arbroath ndash part-time clubs in the second tier, with substantially lower operating costs ndash were granted a cool pound,.Irsquod suggest to Mr Lawwell that straight off the bat, my beloved Thistle have been affected more than Celtic by the pandemic. As have plenty of other teams lower down the SPFL pyramid too numerous to mention. What about Brora Rangers and Kelty Hearts, respective winners of the Highland and Lowland leagues last year, two ambitious and upwardly-mobile clubs that were denied their chance to compete for a place in the professional set-up when the League Two play-off was scrapped  What about the level below that, the West of Scotland Football League, where all football has been postponed for the second time in less than a year and clubs are forbidden from even training If Irsquom being charitable, therersquos an argument to be made that Celticrsquos finances have been affected more than any other side in Scotland over the last year or so but thatrsquos about as far as my sympathy stretches. Given the scale of the clubrsquos business operations, I imagine the loss of earnings since the pandemic began will be truly eye-watering. Thatrsquos a fair complaint.:SFA confirm compliance officer investigation into Celtic Dubai picturesLawwell can also rightly feel aggrieved by Boli Bolingolirsquos inexplicable Spanish sojourn and the host of international players that have had to self-isolate upon theirto Glasgow, limiting the options Neil Lennon has available to him and in turn damaging the clubrsquos title bid. These are just criticisms but ultimately leave me thinking of that line about how cynics know the price of everything but the value of nothing.Yes, Celticrsquos bank account will have suffered heavily over the last year or so. But when other clubs harbour genuine fears that they could go to the wall before supporters are allowed back to stadia in their droves, is that really our biggest concern right now  A financial behemoth ndash one that will undoubtedly remain so after the pandemic ndash losing a few quid while others fear for their very existence The arrogance is staggering. At the absolute worst, Celtic are comfortably the second-best side in the country. The financial reality of Scottish football makes it virtually impossible to imagine the drop-off ever getting any starker. This nightmare campaign that has seen the Premiership champions slip to the lowest ebb imaginable still has them in second, with an excellent chance of lting the Scottish Cup in May and a place in the qualying rounds of next seasonrsquos Champions League is all but certain.As a supporter of a club that has suffered permanent, irrevocable damage over the last year, Irsquod like to think Irsquove got a decent idea about how the pandemic has affected sides towards the lower end of the pyramid. And let me tell you: Celtic are the last team in Scotland that we should be concerned about. They will be fine, and they will get through the other side of this crisis relatively unscathed and in one piece.Thatrsquos a helluva lot more than just about any other team in Scotland can say, and Lawwell would do well to remember that fact before pleading with the public as we get our microscopic violins out."},{"url":null,"title":"scots-should-not-drinking-alcohol-gardens-others","story":"Constitution SecretaryMichael Russell said new rules banning the consumption of alcohol in outdoor public places were designed to stop people gathering together.But he added: \"If you wish to have a, shall we say a glass of prosecco in your garden, nobody is going to come round and stop you and seize the glass from your hand and dash it to the ground.\":Nicola Sturgeon tightens lockdown rules including on takeaways and alcoholFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced a tightening of lockdown restrictions yesterday, including a crackdown on alcohol.She said it will now beagainst the law in all level four areas of Scotland to drink alcohol outdoors in public.This will mean, for example, that buying a takeaway pint and drinking it outdoors will not be permitted.Dferent parts of Scotland currently have dferent rules around drinking in outdoor public places.Mr Russell was quizzed on the change while giving evidence to HolyroodsCovid- Committee.Scottish Liberal Democrat MSPAlex Cole-Hamilton askedit was a prohibition on all drinking outdoors, and referenced drinking in gardens.Mr Russell said: \"I dont think socialisation is to be encouraged, soyou were planning to have even a one-to-one party in your garden I would strongly counsel you against it.\":John Swinney warns lockdown restrictions could be tightened furtherHe said restrictions against alcohol in public places already exist in many areas.Mr Russell said the new rulewas specically designed to prevent crowds gathering outside pubs selling alcohol at the door.He said: \"It is, again, the purpose of it that is really important: to stop people gathering together.\""},{"url":null,"title":"uk-government-u-turns-compensation-pledge-fishing-firms","story":"An urgent debate on the issue was held this morning in the House of Commons, led by the Liberal Democrat MP Alistair Carmichael.George Eustice, environment, food and rural affairs minister, told MPs that the government was looking at support for firms which had suffered problems with exports ldquothrough no fault of their own.However he said that the Prime Minister had announced ldquojust before Christmas that we would invest pound million in the UK fishing industry.Yesterday Boris Johnson told MPs that businesses \"will be compensated\".Read more:SNP call for fisheries minister to quit after nativity trail admissionWhen asked repeatedly by other MPs throughout the debate about details of this compensation scheme, Mr Eustice dodged the question.SNP MP Dierdre Brock asked directly how firms could access it, and even suggested that she could give businesses Mr Eusticersquos mobile phone number for more information.Downing Street last night said the government was considering feedback from the sector alongside data reflecting industry performance, and was continuing toreview the need for more targeted actions, but did not guarantee firms would be compensated.Mr Eustice described the problems firms were having as ldquoteething issues and said that exports have been held up due to problems including the colour of ink used to fill out forms, as well as the number of pages of paperwork being presented to EU customs officials.He said: ldquoI am aware that there have been some teething issues as businesses get used to these new processes.ldquoAuthorities in the EU countries are also adjusting to new procedures, and we are working closely with both industry, and authorities in the EU to iron out these issues, and to ensure that goods flow smoothly to markets.Liberal Democrat MPs Mr Carmichael and Jamie Stone urged the minister to agree to a round table discussion with other politicians and industry members, however Mr Eustice said the government was already talking to industry about their experiences.It comes after junior Scotland office Minister David Duguid was asked on BBC Good Morning Scotland today about how long it would take to resolve the export issues, to which he replied ldquohow long is a piece of string.Fishermen across Scotland have told of how they have not been able to export their produce on time, with tonnes of fish and seafood going to waste.

Citizens assemblies in other countries have addressed one specic issue they could influence, for example abortion in Ireland, fully understanding the issue and implications.The post-war generation in Scotland expected to work hard for what they wanted but successive Scottish governments, no matter their political background, have sought to bribe the population with freebies in order to stay in power, with no tax implications for the vast majority. It is little surprise then that those brought up to expect freebies would wish for more at no expense to them.Yet another example of the Scottish Government wasting money whilst core public services are starved of resources.Bill Eadie, Glasgow G.PUBLIC MUST HAVE A ROLEI READ with interest Alan Simpsons column in which he expressed his negativity regarding Citizens Assemblies opinion is waste of taxpayersrsquo money\", The Herald, January .The reason Citizens Assemblies are so important is because it has been shown time and time again that centralised government does not work. Ordinary people must have the opportunity to make their opinions known, to make sure that policy makers take the lives and experiences of citizens into consideration when putting anything into law. For example, I believe that tax haven loopholes must be closed. I believe that we should have a second governing chamber which is elected.It is the responsibility of our elected representatives to govern for the benefit of every citizen, not just the rich and powerful.The people who take part in Citizens Assemblies should be given expenses to cover any loss they might experience I do not believe they should be paid a salary. But I totally disagree with Mr Simpson when he says \"the majority of us have no real interest\" in influencing what goes on in the Scottish Parliament. There are millions of activists in this country, of which I am one, who are sick and tired of the rich and powerful trashing our society.

Itrsquos a ruse he used to avoid answering the question about why Brexit has been a disaster for many fishermen on Scotlandrsquos West Coast.The First Minister displays her concern about the pandemic at almost each daily briefing. Polls show that, by a signicant margin, she is the most trusted political leader in the UK, and I doubt that a fair-minded person would question her sincerity. Unionist criticism of the running of an election in May is more to do with their concern about the result than the timing itself. Many elections across the world have gone ahead during the pandemic.

To see what not accepting the result of a democratic vote looks like, we need only look at the United States and the reaction of Donald Trump and his followers to the result of the Presidential election. The SNP did not suggest that the vote was rigged, its leaders did not say that they had won, they did not march to Holyrood as an armed mob demanding that MSPs reverse the result. That would have been not accepting the result. What they did do was continue to argue their case. I suspect that that is what Councillor McCartin will also continue to do.

This comes on top of £m already committed for education recovery since the start of the pandemic, bringing the total additional support provided to more than £ million since the start of the pandemic.#I appreciate only too well the additional burden home learning is placing on many of our children and their families,# Mr Swinney said.#After the last period of school building closures we commissioned an Equity Audit, published today, to better understand the impact on children’s learning and health and wellbeing, particularly disadvantaged pupils.“Since the start of the pandemic our funding has led to an additional , teachers and over  support staff being appointed. The new funding can be used to recruit further staff # which might include teachers, classroom assistants, administrative staff, home school link workers or other support workers — as well as the resources that families and schools need to support home learning, including additional digital devices where there is any remaining unmet need, and other home learning resources.#Mr Swinney has also asked HM Inspectors of Education to commence with a national review of the quality and effectiveness of remote learning across the country with the first report published next Friday, January .He said: “The quality and effectiveness of remote learning across the country will be reviewed by HM Inspectors of Education. A programme of ‘national overviews’, will commence immediately and last for the duration of remote learning.##These will seek to identy what is working well and where further improvement is required. These overviews will be published weekly to ensure they are available for everyone to learn and build from, starting week ending  January.#Private and third sector day care of children settings are also set to receive almost £ million in temporary financial support.The education secretary added: “I am aware that remaining open for very small numbers of children creates pressure for some childcare providers, and I can therefore confirm we will make temporary financial support of up to £. million available for each four week period of restrictions to day care of children providers and childminding settings caring for  or more children who remain open for vulnerable and keyworker children during these restrictions.#We will confirm details as soon as possible.“If the evidence tells us we can get some pupils back safely, we will do that, and we will ensure the package of mitigations in schools remains robust and tailored to the circumstances we face. As part of that work, we expect that pilots of two dferent testing models – one using in-school testing with Lateral Flow Devices, and another involving at-home testing using PCR tests – will begin in a small number of schools from next week, helping to inform options for wider rollout.“I am grateful to our hardworking, dedicated teaching professionals for their intense work to plan, organise and deliver learning. The virus will be beaten, and schools willfully to intensy our efforts to achieve excellence and equity for all of Scotland’s children.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

As ordinary folk, none of these three ‘coves’ come with the egotism associatedwith this level of stardom. Their down-to-earth attitude, gentle humility and self-confessed naivety of the wider music industry is part of their unique charm and connects them to their fans across the generations who reward them with unwavering loyalty.“The Barrowlands was booked but that sold out just as quickly. Suddenly all the venues sold out, including gigs in London and Manchester. It was unbelievable.”“We are not the type of band that can sit down and invent new materials,” said Innes.“Everything comes out of Boydie’s head and, until it’s ready to be released, it’s not coming. You don’t ask him to do anything. He has a heart of gold and means well to everyone but,you ask him to do something, and he’s not ready for, it will not get done. We are waiting to see what happens with live gigs next year.”Innes confesses to feeling nervous about the uncertainty of the future of live performances. He said: “Over the summer, a lot of people believed the situation with the pandemic would be better but I realised things were getting worse for live music. I really wondered whether Peat  Diesel would ever play live again.“I am, however, a positive person who always sees good things in bad situations. Watching pre-Covid TV programmes where people are sitting closely together does put fear through us though. Until maybe everyone takes this vaccine and Covid goes away, I think live music is really going to struggle.“When we are playing, the crowd sucks up the atmosphere we have created.“If that atmosphere is not there, I don’t think people will enjoy it. For the  tour, I am not sure whether people will be ready to gather or whether they would rather wait that extra while to attend a gig. We will have to wait and see how it goes.”The  tour has been rescheduled for next year, with a gig booked for Skye in the autumn.Innes says he is looking forward to coming back to Skye: “We have played on Skye before and were not sure how they would get us. It was an amazing experience for us, though, as people sang along to the words and really enjoyed the performance.“Despite the sea between us, Skye people are very like us and understand our music.“We decided the tour had to include a venue on Skye as we feel they are our friends and family and a place where we feel at home to be ourselves and enjoy our time there.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/XMAS-HAMPERS-PORTREE-1-scaled.jpg","title":"skye community response well","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineSCR chair Ross Cowie

but we are better prepared having had that experience and we are ready to help with whatever is required in supporting the community — whether that#s picking up prescriptions, delivering food, fuel, any practical support or just advice.Commenting on the group#s work following the initial lockdown, he added: #We put contingencies in place because we were aware that a second phase was likely, so we have a huge store of personal Protective Equipment for the health care sector or anyone  who requires it.“This time it has been a lot easier than the first time, we were reacting to the situation then and learning as we went along, but now we are well prepared.“We are here, we have the phone line, it#s open five days a week but we can scale it up to seven days a weekneeded.”He added: “We have a great bunch of people on board and we connect with all the other operations throughout the island.”A number of food share and emergency food provision initiatives are in operation throughout the island and are advertised locally —you need further advice you can call the helpline.Prior to Christmas Skye Community Response volunteers provided  festive hampers and  presents to members of the community mainly around the Portree and Braes area but also island-wide for Women’s Aid.“Nobody should hesitate in getting touch, the food shares are there to be used, and we are here to help.“We have

aiming to make a clean sweep across","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineSkye Lockdown Litterpick was set up to encourage people to clean up their local area during the tier  lockdown from Christmas into the New Year, and to date more than  people have become members of the Facebook group.With the conditions of lockdown now tightened until at least the end of January, Dunvegan resident Jennie Chapman, who set up the group, believes that the virtual community of litter pickers is empowering people on Skye to do their bit inidually for a collective cause.: “The Facebook group provides a virtual community where anyone living on Skye can get involved in picking up litter in their local area during this — now extended — lockdown period.“We will then collate all the information about quantities collected and map the areas covered so that we can see an ever growing picture of community involvement in making the island cleaner.“You will see, on the page announcements, a map that is updated every couple of days at least.” Commenting on the response to the group, she said: “At the time of writing there are  members of the group.“Many of these are people who I am sure have been concerned about this issue for some time and may well have already been regularly picking up litter on walks.“However, it can feel like a bit of an uphill battle when you do it on your own so this virtual community is so encouraging when you begin to see how many others care and are also wanting to do their part.”Highlighting the scope of the problem, she added: “We are certainly finding that across the island some of the worst spots for littering include along road verges, especially on the larger roads, around parking areas and lay bys and in popular walking spots.“The range of things that we are collecting includes absolutely huge numbers of drinks bottles, cans, coffee cups and snack wrappers — especially those thrown from car windows along verges — and random items such as huge builders bags, car exhaust pipes and even dirty nappies and used condoms.”Addressing the tightened restrictions now in place, Jennie said: “Everyone taking part is doing so either on their own or in accordance with all now further tightened legal requirements for meeting outside — so from now that will be only with one other person at most and remaining at full social distance.“We have found that two people working to collect from either side of a road verge works well.“All collections are then reported into the group on Facebook for mapping.“At the time of writing we have so far logged  large bin bags full of rubbish being removed from  dferent locations around the island as well as at least  large objects – and we have at least all of January to go!“You will see from the map that the project has now spread to all four corners of the island.”While Jennie acknowledges that the group itself is not a stand-alone solution to the issue, she does hope that it might have a positive effect and persuade people to think twice about littering.She said: “Although this is a short-term project the longer-term issue is unlikely to go away anytime soon so we hope that at least the project raises awareness of the issue.“And maybe it will encourage some people to take their rubbish home rather than littering the countryside and encourages everyone who takes part in trying to keep their local area clean.“There are lots of us out there and we are all part of a bigger picture.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3582333.jpg--.jpg?1610614734000\n","title":"new rapid test for emergency departments","story":"A new rapid test for

This rapid test will enable emergency departmentsto very quickly identy patients who do not have Covid-, enabling faster decision-making in relation to patients’ care and treatment. A negative result will also enable ED staff to make faster decisions regarding the appropriate placement of patients in hospital wards.“The pressures on our hospital system have been well publicised. One of the areas currently experiencing signicant pressure are our EDs, where patients with COVID- and those with other medical conditions both arrive seeking help. Being able to identy more quickly that a patient does not have the SARS-CoV- virus will benefit staff in the ED and our system as a whole.”Expert teams within the Belfast Trust have been working to test and trial this rapid testing technology, as one of only five early adopter sites across the UK. The Lumira DX testing technology has been validated locally by scientists in the Regional Virology Laboratory in Belfast Trust working collaboratively with staff in the RVH Emergency Department, supported by the Trust’s Point-of-Care Team.The Minister concluded: “Lumira DX testing kits have now been delivered to all Trusts who are finalising arrangements for their use and I look forward to seeing this testing technology used to support care of ED patients in the coming week or so. I commend everyone who contributed to the Lumira DX trial locally.

These are his words. “I voted for Brexit in  along with the overwhelming majority of my constituents, North Antrim was in the top ten vote leave constituencies in the U.K. and I don’t regret it for one minute. “What I do regret is the blatant betrayal of the British people by two Prime Ministers who told us all they were unionists and then negotiated a backstop and then a protocol at the behest of the EU and political pressure from the Republic of Ireland - who wrongly threatened the peace process is in jeopardy. “The brace of Prime Ministers should have been stronger for the Union - I fear they have a very English view of it. “It’s not the first time this has happened to Northern Ireland. Margaret Thatcher did it in  when when she agreed a form of joint authority with the Republic of Ireland and subsequently regretted it. Indeed, in this centenary year of our wee country we are reminded of Sir Edward Carson’s words that we are “treated like a rung in the ladder” for people to climb to high office only to kick us away. “I and Brexit voters are not responsible for the betrayal of the Prime Minister. In fact I helped take one from office!“I on your behalf voted against the protocol and the back stop. Let’s be clear, the protocol belongs to the Secretary of State, the SDLP, Sinn Fein, the Alliance Party, the Dublin government and those foolish trade bodies who acquiesced in it. “If I was responsible for it I would shoulder that responsibility and argue for it,I was convinced it was correct.“In the protocol it has a clause number  that allows for either the U.K. or EU to unilaterally stop implementing any part of it that is causing unintended economic hardships or society dficulties. “Within the first week of it operating we see the economic catastrophe ahead.“I and my colleagues warned this would happen and so it has come to pass. Hauliers from here are inundated with a mountain of paper work, a blockade to trade, delays at ports, food stuff shortages. Small businesses unable to get parcels, consumers choice limited. The economic and society impact is obvious. So much so that the republic’s revenue commissioners have already stopped implementing the protocol because of the damage to Dublin Port. Yet here, as Rome burns, Government fiddles! “If it can be changed, and it can, then I am calling on all those parties who supported the protocol to recognise it can be changed to set aside their politics of opportunism and agree that it should be removed smoothly so as Northern Ireland can trade like the rest of GB.“It is up to the EU to protect its single market in the south, its not up to you and me members of the U.K. to do that for them. Yet this protocol is about protecting the South and nothing to do with supporting Northern Ireland. So for those who ask for the alternative - there it is ! “You see folks there was a deliberate attempt by some to punish the U.K. for Brexit and the most obvious place to punish was NI. Well we must not be a whipping animal for any political objective. We demand the Government takes action on this protocol and invokes article . “Normally unionists are accused of shooting “”.

Mrs Foster said quite a large number of travellers may have entered Northern Ireland via the Republic over Christmas and added the forms are important to monitor the extent of this. Ministers have asked us to elevate the matter and raise it again urgently with the Taoiseach, she said, calling for an end to the long-running saga at a press briefing in Dungannon. The common travel area does serve us well and has done for years, but we need heads of government to come together so we have agreed to pursue meetings with the Taoiseach, the prime minister and ourselves and that needs to happen as a matter of urgency, said Mrs O#Neill.

This means that anyone arriving into Northern Ireland who has been outside of the common travel area within the previous  days must have evidence of a negative test in the last  hours, said Mrs Foster.Mrs Foster said the requirement for these travelers to self-isolate for  days on arrival in Northern Ireland remains in place.Meanwhile, the reproduction rate of Covid- has been reduced to between . and . in Northern Ireland, thanks to the efforts of people from all walks of le, she said. It gives us time to push ahead with our strategy and roll out our world class testing and vaccination programmes, she said. To date, , people have been vaccinated and almost three quarters of care homes have had second doses.In the community, , in the over- age category have been vaccinated by GPs. It#s now expected that by the end of the month all care homes, health and social care staff and over s will have received their first dose. It makes us one of the top-performing countries across the globe, Mrs Foster said. But Mrs Foster said she does not have a crystal ball when it comes to predicting when restrictions will ease.None of this is inevitable, she said, adding that ministers will be advised by the medical and scientic advice.The deputy First Minister Michelle O#Neill said she wanted to commend the teams behind Northern Ireland#s Covid- vaccination programme, some of whom are working seven days a week. She says % of care home residents have been vaccinated with their first dose and % have received their second dose.I think that#s really remarkable, she said. Earlier, Mrs Foster said it was incredible and frankly unbelievable that some people continue to host house parties and social gatherings during the pandemic. Speaking at the briefing, Chief Constable Simon Byrne said the PSNI continues to issue in the region of  penalty notices a day. He warned thatpeople continue to flout restrictions by having house parties, they can expect firm and swt enforcement. We won#t turn a blind eye when people break the rules, he said.

It expects the unemployment rate to increase to an annual average of .% in , peaking at around % in the second quarter.Mr Lambe added that trade frictions arising from the NI Protocol, and the implementation of the UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement, would not help the pace of recovery.Firms across the UK will need time to adapt to these changes, which will act as a drag on the pace of economic growth, he added.He said sectors such as the arts, accommodation and food, which had greater reliance on contact with the public, would see a rise in output of %, assuming the vaccine rollout permitted restrictions to be lted.But sectors such as professional, scientic and technical services and information and communication, where people and businesses have been able to adapt to remote working, were projected to have experienced less striking falls in output in . Such sectors are tipped for growth of up to .% in .Belfast Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Executive introduces pre-departure testing for international arrivals as  further deaths reportedThree people taken to hospital after car plunges into Strangford LoughHeartbreak and shock as fire devastates Belfast Multi-Cultural Association building£m retail voucher scheme to aid economic recovery in Northern Ireland put on hold Robin Swann: My worst moment  There#s one of those virtually every dayLatest Northern IrelandBelfast multi-cultural centre damaged in fire#Being an Ulster Protestant is something to be proud of, I can#t believe that so many are ashamed of their background#Uncertainty for NI#s steel industry as #surprise# % tarf to be imposed on non-GB importsUsed car dealers urge clarity over #new fees# for cross-border trade Northern Ireland produce can feed m, Poots told after his #no food# warningsLatest from Belfast UK fraud office closes British American Tobacco corruption probeEngland captain Joe Root celebrates a century against Sri LankaBus left dangling from overpass after New York crashBelfast multi-cultural centre damaged in fireBiden unveils .tn dollar plan to stem Covid- and steady economy,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

What makes this dferent from Wikipedia and other things is that they are authored entries, and they do convey the viewpoints of the author writing it. But at the same time, as it is an historical dictionary, it needs to stick to the facts - what happened, what he did and what he said - that type of thing.Obviously there is interpretation in them, but it has to be of a more lofty, overview kind than partisan.The entry on Martin McGuinness is interesting because it was written by Chris Ryder, who passed away in October. I think it is the last thing he wrote before he died, it was written in August.Chris was very much the choice of our advisers as being someone who knew the subject. He was deeply engaged in following McGuinness throughout his career but he also had that objectivity, and he wasn#t going to be laying down his own political standpoint.Other local entries are David Bleakley, the Northern Ireland Labour politician and trade union member and Sir John Blelloch, the Scottish-born civil servant who served at the Northern Ireland Office.Dr May added: The only thing that brings these people together is that they died in the same year - . We do find that, year by year, things can be quite dferent. For example, in one year we had seven Nobel prize winners, whereas normally you might get one or two at most.That is the case here in a sense - it is kind of coincidental that there are quite a few major figures from Northern Irish politics that died in the same year.Other notable entries are Christine Keeler, who died in  aged . She became famous for her part in the  Profumo Affair, which shook Harold Macmillan#s government. At the height of the Cold War, the then teenager claimed she had an affair with Conservative cabinet minister John Profumo.

Mr Gibson said a steady market was likely this year. He added: I don#t think we#re looking at a property price fall because of the amount of cash people have built up in their savings for those whose livelihoods haven#t been disrupted because of Covid.For young people who#ve regrettably missed a year of socialising and spending, and the cash that car sales figures tell us people haven#t been spending on new cars, all of that cash has to find its way somewhere. That may mean people accelerating their housebuying plans by two or three years and finding themselves with enough saved for a deposit.Mr Gibson also expects changes in lestyle brought by the pandemic - the need to work from home for example - would also continue to boost demand for new homes with space for a study, or with a garden. And he said the strong performance of the market in  was likely to increase confidence. But factors such as the risk of rising unemployment when the furlough scheme ends would hold back a full boom.He argued some parents would be feeling in a better cash position to help their grown-up offspring out with a deposit, and that the plight of older people during the pandemic could inspire some grown-up offspring to want their parents to live closer by.Robert Mulligan, director of Farleigh Property, said it had four housing developments either on site or in planning, including on the north coast, on Belfast#s Malone Road and in Moira, Co Down.He said the developments were being amended to reflect changing demands, adding: On those which we have been able to tweak, we have incorporated ideas which help working from home, such as making areas downstairs more open by taking walls down in the kitchen area, allowing for people to maybe sit in the kitchen on their laptop while looking out on the garden.We#ve split some bedrooms upstairs to create a home office and given buyers the option to convert a room into a home study with built in desks.Estate agent Simon Brien said the housing market had bounced back after the first forced lockdown. You could see huge levels of enquiries for dferent properties - people deciding after having time on their hands that they wanted a bigger garden, a fourth bedroom or a study, he said. That was evident across all locations. The stamp duty holiday helped but was by no means the only driver, it was lestyle as well, all very human decisions. We had a massive increase in people ing to NI from England, perhaps those in their late s or early s.House prices are not racing away, and nor do you want them to. Houses are selling steadily and there are no indications that there will be a house price fall. They will probably rise by between -% this year. There#s no rationale for massive growth, houses selling because of people#s decision to move.Estate agent John Minnis said: When the pandemic first struck we were looking at headlines saying that the bottom had fallen out and the whole picture was pretty bleak, but as soon as we got back to work after three months it became obvious that things were going very, very well and we were very, very busy.Mr Minnis said uncertainty over Brexit up until October  when the NI Protocol was agreed had also held up movement, and people ing from England accounted for about % of their family home sales.He added: The cat#s out of the bag that people can retain their higher English wage, work remotely and get a house that before would have been way above their radar, all while getting their kids into a great education system. He said that, overall, transactions in his agency were up by about % in  compared to , but predictions were dficult.

The Glenullin man looked back on the special year. Michael McMullan writes... *** Its the Friday before the  All-Ireland minor final and Gerard OKane waits impatiently for the final bell in St Patricks College Maghera. Like a child on Christmas Eve. As the clock drags its way towards four oclock, ious teachers drop by to wish him luck on the Everest of Sundays in Irelands sporting calendar. A genuine warmth, willing him to bring back the silverware. Exactly  months earlier, OKane was a spectator in Croke Park as the Tyrone minor team that handed Derry a - to - hammering earlier in the summer were held by Dublin. The Red Hands won the replay by  points, a side that produced eight All-Ireland senior winners, including Sean Cavanagh, Joe McMahon and Martin Penrose, who OKane marked. googletag.cmd.push When the next season swung into action, Tyrone ran Derry to a point in the Ulster Final. It was the closest anyone came, as Derrys unstoppable force romped to the All-Ireland with an average winning margin of  points across their six-game odyssey. It was the first year of the back door and it included a -point mauling of Munster finalists Tipperary in the All-Ireland Quarter-Final. OKane remembers a message from Dermot McNicholl, his club mate and fellow All-Ireland winning captain. “He called to the house around that time and was just saying we had to beat what was in front of us,” OKane states. googletag.cmd.push One of the final knocks on OKanes classroom door on that everlasting Friday afternoon was from McNicholl. Standing outside in the corridor, the message was two-fold. First, came the wish of good luck. It was followed by a word of advice. In , McNicholl was left all alone in the Hogan Stand presentation area while the rest of the squad danced a jig of delight on Croke Parks hallowed turf. “If you are lucky enough to win,” was the theme of McNicholls warning. “There will be a guy come on the pitch and his job is to get the winning captain for the presentation of the cup....dont go to him.”     The man was head Croke Park steward John Leonard and as result, McNicholl missed the two minutes of joy with his team mates. “I was conscious of that,” OKane now knew. “The fella wouldve been just looking for the Derry number three.” Thankfully for OKane and Derry, the prophecy came to pass. He got offside long enough to embrace manager Chris Brown and his father Gerard – then the County Chairman – before bouncing around Croke Park with the squad. The bliss of success. “There is usually a rush to get the minor teams off the field,” OKane says. “But it didnt seem to be like that for us. We had half an hour after the final whistle. We had that time to spend with ourselves and do a lap of honour.” They soaked up every lasting memory of an afternoon that saw Armagh wrestle their way past Kerry in an epic encounter to win their first senior title. The following afternoon, the teams victory cavalcades would coincide at the Carrickdale, among thongs of fans and the sirens of the Garda escort, as both cups passed into the six counties, in the same year, for the first time. “Both teams were in big Chambers buses and when we arrived the Armagh people thought we were the Armagh team,” OKane recalls. Both Kieran McGeeney and OKane, with the respective cups, flanked by owner hotel John McParland, a huge GAA man, they exited through a fire escape and onto a flat roof above the fans outside. A moment to remember. “There were literally thousands upon thousands of people,” OKane adds. It was a moment worth waiting for. *** The unique aspect of that minor team was the spread of clubs. OKane and goalkeeper Eoin McNicholl hailed from Glenullin, but the rest were from across the county. “The  outfield players were from dferent clubs, so we had a better balance,” said OKane. Paul Young was the only survivor from the  Ulster winning team. OKane was one of a handful on the  squad. The rest were assembled by Chris Brown and his management team of Paddy Crozier, Charlie OKane, Bernie Henry and the late Aidan OBrien. In February, St Patricks Maghera exited the MacRory Cup and  players were called up for county duty, as Derry began their assault on Ulster. Mickey Drumm, as OKane recalls, was very unlucky, having dislocated his shoulder and missed out. It was never said, but the group knew they had the tools to give Ulster a shake. The management kept their powder dry and the squad grounded. After a convincing - to - win over Antrim in Casement Park, thanks to - from Barry McGoldrick and a Ciaran Mullan goal, they were up against Cavan who were hotly tipped after a seven-point victory over Down. Ciaran Mullan in action against Joe Ball of Tyrone in the Ulster final  “Cavan had a strong team, with Seanie Johnson, Mark McKeever, Anthony Gaynor, Paddy Brady and Sean Brady,” rolled the litany of names effortlessly off OKanes tongue. It was the first season of the back door. Getting to a provincial final offered a safety net, guaranteeing a passage into the All-Ireland series. “I remember Paddy and Chris saying to me,we got over this game we wouldnt be far away from the All-Ireland. “Cavan was a tough one, even though we only beat Tyrone by a point in the final,” Gerard offers. It was a standalone tie on a Saturday evening in Enniskillen, due to GAAs accommodation of the Leaving Cert examinations. In a tight encounter, Derry pulled away and ran out four-point winners, - to -. It was their passport to the summer. Waiting in the final was a Tyrone team Derry had beaten in a challenge match in the lull before their Cavan showdown. “They knew us inside out,” OKane states. It was a game Derry looked like leaving behind them, with Tyrone five points ahead entering the final  minutes. “We looked dead and buried, we didnt play well, but something just clicked. We clawed back one or two points,” said OKane. Aaron Cassidy came of the bench to kick a beauty, one of the six unanswered points as Derry clawed to victory, - to -. There was another moment, the key one. Seated in the dugout, beside Gerard senior, was Derry selector, the Aidan OBrien. “One of the points came after a turnover by Paul Young. He made a block on their full-back on his way out and won a free,” states Gerard junior. “It wouldnt have been Pauls style and Aidan turned to Daddy and said we were going to win it... that was the turning point. We were probably the better team, but didnt show it in the first  minutes.” By the time the giddy Derry squad filed out of the minor dressing rooms in Clones, the senior decider was under way and Armagh had the ball in the back of the net after an early error by Donegal goalkeeper Tony Blake. The Derry players took up their seats and watched Joe Kernans Armagh team of gladiators pick up the Anglo Celt Cup, a group that became the main billing ahead of Derry in Croker later in the summer. Before celebrating with the team, later that night in Magheras Walshs Hotel, it was back home to Glenullin for OKane. “My father was heavily involved and our house was a ceili house anyway,” Gerard states. “I can remember Danny McNicholl was there...and a few others waiting on me and the cup was there.” For now, it was time to swap the tracksuit for the disco clothes and meet with the squad in Maghera. On the way home from Walshs Hotel, in the wee small hours, there was a stop off in Slaughtneil to finish off the celebrations. “Id say, and Im not exaggerating,  of us stayed in Patsy Bradleys house that night,” he laughs. “They have a third or fourth floor and his mother had blankets for us. I remember Mickeyand three or four aul hands sitting around the kitchen table.” Derrys battles for supremacy were over, but they only just getting into their stride. It was time for their All-Ireland victory procession. *** Tipperary were the first victims of that Derry machine in a - to - hammering in Navan, with Paul Young hitting -. Longford beat Meath in the Leinster Final, with - from dangerman Michael Hussey who was the championship top scorer that year, with a tally of -. He got no change from Michael McGoldrick in defence, as Derry ran out winners by another big margin, - to -. “It left us feeling a bit undercooked going into the final, but minor football is a bit like that where you can build up big scores on a team,” said OKane “We were still quietly confident thatLongford could beat Meath and we beat Longford by the margin we did, we would give Meath a game.” Eoin McNicholl celebrates the semi-final win over Longford  The Royals were a more imposing team. None more so than at full forward, where OKane was tasked with marking man mountain Joe Sheridan. “I was ” and luckyI was ten stone and he was built like a man. Theyd a couple of boys at midfield who were the same and a strong half back line,” OKane adds. “Maybe the wide open spaces suited us, we were full of footballers and had a lot of speed on our team.” Time and time again, OKane would play in front and cut off the supply. It wasnt a tactic of the management. It was OKanes natural game and he had the experience of playing there for Glenullin seniors who reached the last four of the championship that season. Earlier in the year he played at centre back in the MacRory Cup, in front of full-back Mark Lynch. When Conleth Moran came back to fitness after the Ulster championship, he forced his way back into the attack for the All-Ireland campaign. The unlucky man to lose out was Glenullin man Neal Mullan. “I think theywere toying with the idea of putting Mark to full-back, but I was playing well there,so they let it be and put Mark at six.” Ciaran McCallion moved from centre back to the wing and Derrys formula was complete. As with any final, comes the sideshow of free gloves and boots, getting measured up for suits and the arrangements for the banquet. In the background, Paddy Croziers eye for detail picked up a distraction seeping into the squad. On the Monday before the final, he called the captain to one side. It was time for a quiet word, one that would have a greater impactit didnt come from the management. Another small detail in their quest for glory. “In some ways it was a bit manufactured,” OKane admits. The squad headed to a corner of Owenbeg. “We went and did our own stretching. We said we could buy all the tracksuits and suits, but you cant buy a medal. Is it about a night out in Dublin, or going down to win an All-Ireland  It meant more coming from us than the management.” All the pieces were in place as the squad departed for their Burlington Hotel base on Saturday afternoon. It was packed with people and a strange change from their semi-final base out in Portmarnock. Any background noise didnt filter into a group on a mission. A goal from Ruairi Convery put Derry into a position of strength and with Sheridan starved of possession, Meath moved him outfield to get him into the game. It was a mark of Derrys defence and in particular their full-back line of OKane, Michael McGoldrick and Joe Keenan, who didnt concede a score from play on their way to the final. “I sort of let the side down,” Gerard jokes about the final. “I conceded a point of Brian Farrell, who was moved across to me when they took Sheridan out.” By that stage, Derry had one hand and four fingers of the other on the Tom Markham Cup. Title number four was in the bag. “I remember standing with my back to the Hill in the second half and I could hear people I knew shouting behind me,” said OKane. “We were comfortable in the last five or ten minutes, you were able to take in the atmosphere rather than being in the zone all the time.” Referee Michael Ryans final whistle made it official. Derry were champions and Gerard remembered to escape the clutches of John Leonard. It was celebration time. The Derry players celebrate victory over Meath in the All-Ireland Final  Back at the Burlington, the staff had a guard of honour in place and upstairs, their suits were all laid out for the banquet. After leaving the Carrickdale on the Monday evening, the squad were ferried up a packed Maghera street on an open top bus. A tradition that began with the  minors. At Glen club, Gerard senior took the microphone to introduce the entire  and management. A homecoming befitting of All-Ireland champions. The following night, the cup was taken back to Derry City, before ing to Glenullin, the first club to host the squad. It was the start of a whistle-stop tour of every club in the county. “We did every club in the county for the next four or five nights,” Gerard adds. “Wed get on the bus in Dungiven around half four or five oclock and wouldnt be back til around . Looking back on it now, it was a bit mad with boys having to go back to school.” It was striking while the iron was hot and inspiring the next generation of players. The Derry squad joined Armagh for a civic reception at Stormont. John Dallat took the young Oakleafers on a tour of the building. “I remember meeting Mark Durkan at the banquet in Dublin, and these were boys you saw on TV,” OKane adds. “The week before the final, MrsOHagan handed me a letter in class, addressed to me at the school from Martin McGuinness who was the Minister for Education at the time. “I have pulled out that letter and have got it framed during lockdown, as well as the photos and all the jersies. Im thinking how lucky I was. I have great experiences out of it and made great friends out of it...you instantly click with them straight away.” A team that swatted all in its path to an All-Ireland title.

In an feature interview in this weeks County Derry Post, the Glenullin man – who also captained St Patricks Maghera to MacRory and Hogan Cup glory – looks back on  and the countys last of their four All-Ireland minor wins. OKane made his debut, under Mickey Moran, in a NFL league clash with Waterford at Ballinascreen in , with his first championship coming later in the season against Wicklow in Round  of the qualiers as Derry went all the way to the All-Ireland semi-final where they lost to eventual champions Kerry. googletag.cmd.push His last outing was a substitute appearance, replacing Kevin Johnston, in Derrys  Ulster SFC defeat to Tyrone at Celtic Park under Damian Barton. “All our boyswere playing club senior football,” OKane points out. “I got called into the squad towards the end of  and I still had a year of school to do at that stage. It didnt suit and I remember Dublin ending Derrys summer down in Clones. “I remember Mickey and Harry Joecalling me in for a ween of training games and with my A-Levels, it just didnt suit. “I came in the following year and I was still only , but by that time I had three years of senior club championship football, at first isionduring my minor days.” googletag.cmd.push In OKanes opinion, it prepared him for a -year career at inter-county senior level. He feels that some players are coming onto the inter-county senior scene with no club senior championship football. “I think you need that two or three years playing senior club football,” he states. “Nowadays their senior club career only begins at  or  andyou give them two or three years it would mean they are not ready for county senior until they are  or , then so be it.” After Derrys  All-Ireland success, it took  years for the county to win an Ulster minor title. Conor Glass was the next winning captain and OKane feels he needs to be given time to grow into round ball game after five seasons with Hawthorn and that a lot of pressure has being put on the Glen mans shoulders.     “He needs to find his feet in thatenvironment. I had three years behind me. I remember marking Paul Young, Enda Gormley and Glenullin beat Bellaghy. I was marking Joe Cassidy, who was a Derry senior at that time,” OKane points out. OKane was joint captain of QUBs Sigerson winning team of  and coaches the university Freshers team, another avenue he said also helps players develop. “I know fellas are being plucked from minor squads into senior squads as a development pathway, but there is no better pathway than playing club senior football regularly. “You have to impress at club senior level, before you play county and I dont know that it is happening at the minute.” OKane continued by saying that while it might sound harsh, players are being picked because so much time has been invested in them through development squads. “The same boys might not play senior football for their club regularly, yet they are in and around a county senior squad. “If you take an American tourist, its quite simplistic, and took them a club senior game in Derry and ask him to pick out the county senior players, he should be able to do it.” On the night OKane and his teammates took the Tom Markham Cup back to Maghera in , he made a grand statement that a senior title would follow in six or seven years. “I remember standing in Maghera – and I cringe looking back on it,” he recalls. “It just wasnt going to happen like that. I didnt know that as a  year-old, but once I stepped into the environment I realised its not that easy.” The former Derry defender does see the countys stock rising. In his role with Queens he has been taking a wide look across underage in Ulster in recent time. “Now one of the first questions I am always asking is what is Derry like this year ” he admits. “For years, it was Tyrone and Cavan, but Derry are now seen as one of the teams that people in Ulster are looking to straight away and Im sure Derry minors wouldve given it a good push this year. “That Lavey team is one of the best minor teams I have seen, I saw them playing Glenullin and winning Ulster last year, and you take the otherteams in around them.”   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Although only detailed family history research will confirm the actual Irish origins of your ancestors, surname histories can provide clues and insight into family origins. The  Foyle Community Directory lists , unique surnames in Derry city. Each of these surnames bears a distinctive history and taken as a whole they are a record of population movements into the Derry area over the past  years. Derry’s dynamic history can be seen in the richness and iety of her surnames. googletag.cmd.push The three commonest names have Donegal origins with Doherty heading the way with  entries, followed by McLaughlin on  and Gallagher with  entries. By way of contrast,  surnames occur only once.  Ireland was one of the first countries to adopt a system of hereditary surnames which developed from a more ancient system of clan and sept names. From the th century each family began to adopt its own distinctive family name generally derived from the first name of an ancestor who lived in or about the th century. The surname was formed by prefixing either ‘Mac’or ‘O’to the ancestor’s name. googletag.cmd.push Surnames in Ireland, therefore, tended to identy membership of a ‘sept’. A sept can be identied as ‘a group of persons who, or whose immediate and known ancestors, bore a common surname and inhabited the same locality’. As a consequence, Gaelic-Irish surnames are still very dominant and numerous in the very districts where their names originated. By tradition, many of the prominent surnames of Gaelic origin in Counties Derry, Donegal and Tyrone today trace their descent from either Eoghan or Conal Gulban, two of the sons of Niall of the Nine Hostages, King of Tara who was slain in  AD.     Those tracing descent from Eoghan include: Brolly, Carlin, Devlin, Donnelly, Duddy, Duffy, Farren, Gormley, Hegarty, McCloskey, McLaughlin, Mellon, Mullen, O’Hagan, O’Kane, O’Neill, Quinn and Toner. From Conall Gulban: Doherty, Friel, Gallagher, McCafferty, McDaid, McDevitt and O’Donnell. By tradition, Eoghan and Conall Gulban conquered northwest Ireland about  AD, and in the process captured the great hill-top fortication of Grianaacuten of Aileach in Inishowen, County Donegal which overlooks the city of Derry and the surrounding countryside. Although Gaelic society was one of the first to adopt a system of hereditary surnames it was also one of the last to perpetuate fixed surnames. People in these societies, in the early th century, were often designated by their genealogies stretching back five or more generations. For example, Shane O’Neill of Shane’s Castle, County Antrim, styled himself on the family vault, which he built in , as ‘Shane McBrien McPhelim McShane McBrien McPhelim O’Neill Esq’. Here is family history in one name stretching back over  years. The last-named Phelim was Felim ‘The Lame’ who was Prince of Clanaboy from  to . The Genealogical Office manuscript collections in Office of the Chief Herald at National Library of Ireland, Dublin are the most important source for the genealogies of Gaelic families and of those families entitled to bear arms either by hereditary right or by grant. On th July , Dr Ramon Salvador O’Dogherty of San Fernando, near Cadiz, Spain was inaugurated as the th O’Dochartaigh, chief of Inishowen, County Donegal. The inauguration ceremony took place on the original ‘crowning stone’, known today as ‘St Columb’s Stone’, inside the walled garden in the grounds of the former Belmont House School, Racecourse Road, Derry, using the ancient ceremonial ritual of the clan: the claimant to the title of ‘The O’Doherty’ standing barefoot on the stone, holding a white wand of hazel wood. By tradition, the crowning stone, blessed by Saint Columba, was carried to Belmont from Grianan of Aileach. By tradition, Grianan is identied as being the great “royal fort” of Aileach, the citadel of the northern Ui Neill from the th to the th century. With the Genealogical Office manuscript collections a family chart can be constructed which, on the male line, records the ancestors of Ramon O’Dogherty, “Chief of the Name”, back through  generations to Niall of the Nine Hostages, th century High King of Ireland Ramon O’Dogherty is descended from Sean, brother of Sir Cahir O’Doherty , who fled from Inishowen to County Cavan and whose descendants settled in Spain, as nobility, in the th century. The founder of the Spanish branch of the O’Doghertys was John who, on the death of his father Eoghan in , came out with his brothers Henry and Clinton Dillon to pursue a career in the Spanish Navy, the most exclusive branch of the Spanish armed forces. Entry required them to show their genealogy, proving noble origin. In  the King of Arms in Dublin Castle confirmed the three brothers as being “descended in a direct line from Shane or Sir John O’Dogherty, Chief of Innish-Owen”. In the th century substantial numbers of English and Scottish families settled in the northern part of Ireland during the so-called Plantation of Ulster. These settlers came to Ulster, by and large, in three waves: with the granting of the initial leases in the period  to  after  and Cromwell’s crushing of the Irish rebellion and, finally, in the fteen years after  and the Glorious Revolution. Famine in Scotlandfrom -, together with landlords in Ulster actively seeking new tenants, resulted in a massive influx of Scottish settlers to Ulster in the s. Substantial numbers of Scottish families entered Ulster through Derry and settled in the Foyle Valley which includes much of the fertile lands of Counties Donegal, Londonderry and Tyrone. The lands along the Firth of Clyde in Ayrshire the Clyde Valley Wigtown, Kirkcudbright and Dumfries in Galloway and the Border Lands of Berwick, Peebles, Selkirk and Roxburgh were home to many of these Scottish settlers. Hence surnames such as Anderson, Arbuckle, Armstrong, Barr, Beattie, Bell, Buchanan, Burns, Campbell, Carruthers, Colhoun, Craig, Cunningham, Dunlop, Elliott, Ferguson, Finlay, Fleming, Frazer, Gillespie, Graham, Grant, Hamilton, Hanna, Haslett, Henderson, Holmes, Houston, Irvine, Irwin, Johnston, Kennedy, Kilgore, Lindsay, McAllister, McCartney, McClean, McClelland, McClintock, McCorkell, McCormick, McDonald, Miller, Mitchell, Montgomery, Moore, Olphert, Orr, Parkhill, Patterson, Patton, Rankin, Robb, Rosborough, Ross, Scott, Starrett, Stewart, Thompson, Wallace, Wilson and Young have been established in northwest Ireland for well over three centuries. More recent arrivals from outside the British Isles have also contributed a small but interesting collection of surnames in the Derry area. An Italian community with surnames such as Battisti, Caffola, Cassoni, Centra, Corrieri, Del Pinto, Fiorentini, Forte, Macari, Vaccaro and Yannarelli settled in Derry in the s. A Jewish community with names such as Schenkel, Szilagyi, Spain and Watchman settled in Derry and worshipped in a synagogue in Kennedy Place, and a thriving Indian Community, represented by surnames such as Chada, Singh, Vig and Vij, has been established in the city since the s, most of whom originate from the Punjab in northern India. The family histories associated with surname histories in Derry will, in many instances, be recorded in the database of Derry Genealogy at www.derry.rootsireland.ie.  The database of Derry Genealogy contains the bulk of pre- civil birth and marriage registers for the city and county of Derry, the early baptismal and marriage registers of  churches , gravestone inscriptions from  graveyards, and census substitutes and census s dating from  to . Starting in Mondays Derry News, we look in depth at the history of our local surnames. First up are the four most common - Doherty, McLaughlin, Gallagher and Kelly.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In this, the first of a series of articles on the most common  local surnames, he explores the background of the names Doherty, McLaughlin, Gallagher and Kelly.  - DOHERTY The surname Doherty, which is by far the most popular name in the city of Derry and the Inishowen peninsula, County Donegal, illustrates the very close links between these two areas. As Derry developed an industrial base in the th century in shirt making, shipbuilding and distilling it attracted much of its workforce from Inishowen. googletag.cmd.push The Doherty sept trace their lineage to Conall Gulban, son of the th century High King of Ireland, Niall of the Nine Hostages, who ruled from the Hill of Tara, County Meath. Conall and his brother Eogan conquered northwest Ireland, ca. AD, capturing the great hill-fort of Grianan of Ailech which commanded the entrance to Inishowen between Lough Swilly and Lough Foyle. Ireland was one of the first countries to adopt a system of hereditary surnames which developed from a more ancient system of clan or sept names. The surname was formed by prefixing either Macor Oto the ancestor’s name. googletag.cmd.push The Dohertys take their name from Dochartach, twelfth in lineal descent from Conall Gulban and were thus in Gaelic O Dochartaigh. The word dochartach means ‘hurtful’. The original seat of the Doherty clan was at Ardmire or Ard Miodhair, a district to the west of Ballybofey near Lough Finn, County Donegal. In  Donnell Carragh O’Doherty was styled ‘Royal Chieftain of Ardmire’. As the original homeland of the Cenel Eoghainin Inishowen became more and more a northern outpost, as they expanded south and east, the O’Dohertys, a powerful branch of the Cenel Conaill , forced their way into Inishowen.     When Conor O’Doherty died in  he was styled ‘Chief of Ardmire, and Lord of Inishowen’. The Dohertys remained the chief family of Inishowen until their influence was broken after the rebellion of Sir Cahir O’Doherty in , which included the ransacking of the city of Derry. The defeat and execution of Sir Cahir O’Doherty marked the end of Doherty power and paved the way for the th century Plantation of Ulster with English and Scottish settlers. In the centuries that followed the name was anglicised with many iant spellings and in nearly all cases the O prefix was dropped. By  only  per cent were still using it. However, in the th century, many resumed it and by  half of the Dohertys in Ireland had become O’Doherty again.In the th and th centuries many descendants of the old Gaelic order in Ireland emigrated, as the so-called Wild Geese, to Europe, and, in particular, to Spain and France. Dr Ramon Salvador O’Dogherty of San Fernando, near Cadiz, Spain was inaugurated in July  as the th O’Dochartaigh, chief of Inishowen. Ramon O’Dogherty is descended from Sir Cahir’s brother John who fled from Inishowen to County Cavan and whose descendants settled in Spain, as nobility, in the th century. The inauguration ceremony took place on the original ‘crowning stone’, which tradition states was carried from Grianan, in the grounds of the former Belmont House School in Derry, using the ancient ceremonial ritual of the clan: The claimant to the title of ‘The O’Doherty’ standing barefoot on the stone, holding a white wand of hazel wood.   – MCLAUGHLIN  The surname McLaughlin, which is second to Doherty in both Derry city and Inishowen, County Donegal, illustrates the very close links between these two areas. As Derry developed an industrial base in the th century in shirt making, shipbuilding and distilling it attracted much of its workforce from Inishowen. Today, % of Donegal McLaughlins are still concentrated in the Inishowen peninsula. The McLaughlin sept trace their lineage to Eogan, son of the th century High King of Ireland, Niall of the Nine Hostages, who ruled from the Hill of Tara, County Meath. Eogan and his brother Conall Gulban conquered northwest Ireland, ca. AD, capturing the great hill-fort of Grianan of Ailech which commanded the entrance to the Inishowen peninsula between Lough Swilly and Lough Foyle. Eogan, styled ‘King of Ailech’, established his own kingdom in the peninsula still called after him Inishowen . Eogan was converted to Christianity by St Patrick, when he travelled to Ailech, ca.  AD. His descendants, known as the Cenel Eoghain , became the principal branch of the Northern Ui Neill . The Cenel Eoghain in the next five centuries expanded to the east and south from their focal point in Inishowen. Ireland was one of the first countries to adopt a system of hereditary surnames which developed from a more ancient system of clan or sept names. The surname was formed by prefixing either Macor Oto the ancestor’s name. The McLaughlins take their name from Lochlainn, which in turn was derived from a Norse personal name, and were thus in Gaelic Mac Lochlainn, i.e. son of Lochlainn. The McLaughlins were initially the senior branch of the Northern Ui Neill and their territory was in Inishowen. In the th century the McLaughlins, ruling from their royal palace at Ailech in Inishowen, were High Kings of Ireland and patrons of the monastic settlement in Derry. Domhnall Mac Lochlainn, styled ‘King of Ireland’, died at Doire-Choluim-Chillein . After a decisive battle in  at Caimeirgethe O’Neills of Tyrone ousted the McLaughlins as the leading power in Ulster. Brian O’Neill was now ‘installed in the lordship of the Kinel-Owen’. In the th century the Dohertys ousted the McLaughlins as Lords of Inishowen. Some McLaughlins in Ulster, particularly Antrim, may derive from the Argyllshire clan known in Scotland as MacLachlan. The O’Melaghlins of north Leinster have also changed their name to McLaughlin.   - GALLAGHER  Gallagher is the third most common name in Ulster and two-thirds of the Ulster total are in the sept’s homeland of County Donegal where it is the most numerous name. Although it is only the thirteenth most common name in County Derry, it is the third most numerous in the city of Derry. This name illustrates the very close links between the city of Derry and County Donegal. As Derry developed an industrial base in the th century in shirt making, shipbuilding and distilling it attracted much of its workforce from Donegal. The Gallagher sept trace their lineage to Conall Gulban, son of the th century High King of Ireland, Niall of the Nine Hostages, who ruled from the Hill of Tara, County Meath. Conall and his brother Eogan conquered northwest Ireland, ca. AD, capturing the great hill-fort of Grianan of Ailech in County Donegal which commanded the entrance to Inishowen between Lough Swilly and Lough Foyle. Conall, styled ‘King of Tir Conaill’, established his own kingdom in County Donegal called after him Tyrconnel, i.e. the ‘Land of Conall’, which was the ancient name of Donegal. His descendants, known as the Cenel Conaill , formed one of the principal branches of the Northern Ui Neill . The septs of the Cenel Conaill firmly established themselves in County Donegal while those descended from Conal’s brother Eogan expanded to the east and south into Counties Derry and Tyrone. Ireland was one of the first countries to adopt a system of hereditary surnames which developed from a more ancient system of clan or sept names. The surname was formed by prefixing either Macor Oto the ancestor’s name. The Gallaghers take their name from Gallchobhair, and were thus in Gaelic O Gallchobhair, i.e. descendant of Gallagher. This name is derived from gallchobhar, meaning ‘foreign help’. The O’Gallaghers claim to be the senior and most loyal family of the Cenel Conaill. Their territory extended over a wide area in the baronies of Raphoe and Tirhugh in the east and south of County Donegal. The O’Gallaghers, from their bases at Ballybeit and Ballynaglack, were chief marshals and commanders of O’Donnell’s military forces from the th to the th centuries. The O’Gallaghers also provided many wives for the O’Donnell sept. As well as being a military family the Gallaghers have produced many churchmen. Six O’Gallaghers were bishops of Raphoe in the th and th centuries, and Redmond O Gallagher, the th century Bishop of Derry, befriended the survivors of the Spanish Armada. Today the name is found widely in Scotland where it often takes the form Gallacher. It also occurs in the English cities of Liverpool, Manchester and Leeds where it is pronounced ‘Gallocher’.   – KELLY  Kelly is the second commonest family name in Ireland, after Murphy, and part of the reason is that, at least seven and possibly as many as ten distinct septs of the same name arose in dferent parts of the country. Kelly is the sixth most common name in Ulster, and the third most numerous in Counties Derry and Tyrone. The Kelly sept of County Derry trace their lineage to Eogan, son of the th century High King of Ireland, Niall of the Nine Hostages, who ruled from the Hill of Tara, County Meath. Eogan and his brother Conall Gulban conquered northwest Ireland, ca. AD, capturing the great hill-fort of Grianan of Ailech in County Donegal. Eogan, styled ‘King of Ailech’, established his own kingdom in the peninsula in County Donegal still called after him Inishowen . His descendants, known as the Cenel Eoghain , became the principal branch of the Northern Ui Neill . The Cenel Eoghain in the next five centuries expanded to the east and south from their focal point in Inishowen. Ireland was one of the first countries to adopt a system of hereditary surnames which developed from a more ancient system of clan or sept names. The surname was formed by prefixing either Macor Oto the ancestor’s name. Kelly is derived from Gaelic O Ceallaigh, the root word possibly being ceallach meaning stre. The O’Kellys were one of the leading septs of Clan Binnypossessing territory on the banks of the River Foyle near Lford in County Donegal. The first outward thrust of the Owen clan was that of Clan Binny in the th century AD who thrust southeast into County Tyrone, bypassing a hard core of resistance in County Derry of the Cianachta, as far as the river Blackwater on the borders of Tyrone and Armagh. Clan Binny eventually ousted the Oriella clans from the district lying west of the river Bann from Coleraine to beside Lough Neagh, and drove them across the river. In the course of time the O’Kellys moved eastwards into County Derry and were based in the barony of Loughinsholin in south Derry. The most powerful Kelly sept was that of Ui Maine, often called Hy Many, who ruled O’Kelly’s Country in Counties Galway and Roscommon. This sept claims descent from the th century Colla da Crioch, King of Ulster and first King of Oriel. Other O’Kelly septs originated in Counties Kilkenny, Leix, Meath, Sligo and Wicklow. Kelly was known as a surname in Scotland long before th century Irish immigration really established the name there. There was, for example, a Kelly sept attached to Clan Donald.

It was announced last night that the AQE transfer test for primary seven pupils in Northern Ireland, which had been scheduled to take place on February , has been cancelled. AQE have also said that no test will take place this school year. The single test was scheduled after the three tests due to take place in January were cancelled. Post-primary transfer tests are used to select pupils by the majority of NI grammar schools. A number of grammar schools had already said they would not use the test to select pupils this year. googletag.cmd.push Grammar schools who were planning to use the AQE test will now have to find alternative arrangements to admit pupils in . After the announcement was made last night, Education Minister Peter Weir tweeted: “AQE have decided, due to COVID-, that the transfer tests cannot proceed this year. This severely limits parental choice  children’s opportunities, with disappointment for many children  parents. I will continue to work with all stakeholders in these dficult circumstances.” However, his comments were taken by some as criticism of non-grammar schools. In response, Katrina Crilly, principal of Oakgrove College in Derry, wrote: “What a limited comment! This may be your perspective Minister narrow as it is, are you not the Education Minister for all our children and all our schools ” googletag.cmd.push Deirdre OKane, principal of St Patricks and St Brigids in Claudy, wrote: “Mr Weir. As principal of an exceptional non selective school, I an saddened by such a disgraceful, insensitive remark. Having attended a non- selective school myself, I was not, limited.” Martine Mulhern, principal of St Cecilias College in Derry, wrote: “This year we were named ‘UK Secondary School of the Year’ but here in N Ireland our education system will always deem us ‘second class’ because we are a secondary school and not grammar! Described by our own Education Minister as ‘limiting children’s opportunities’ - HOW DARE HE!” Mr Weir later tried to clary his comments by tweeting: “Great opportunities exist throughout our education system, thru both selective and non selective schools, all of which have produced the best of Northern Ireland. Once opportunity to be considered for entry to any school is denied,in any sector, it is a denial to opportunity  all.”      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The upgrade at the station, situated at Richill Park off the Crescent Link road in the Lisnagelvin area, includes  custody cells, offices, briefing rooms, catering, changing, storage and ancillary services as well as  parking spaces.The refurbishment also includes a fully automatic addressable fire alarm and detection, public address bomb alert system, fully integrated security, CCTV, perimeter detection, security lighting, electronic access control and staff alarm systems.As a result, nine custody suites at the PSNIs headquarters in the city on Strand Road will close on completion of the Waterside development. The work follows a review by the PSNI of its facilities across the North which will also see the closure of cutody suites in Bangor and Armagh.The PSNI said it had reviewed its custody suites because some were under-used and several needed to be updated to ensure they met health and safety requirements.More than , people are held in police cells every year, many of whom suffer from addiction and mental health problems.The PSNI say the aim is create a more effective and efficient custody service consisting of a fewer number of better-equipped suites, each of which will see the introduction of embedded healthcare and support services to help keep people safe. The PSNI estimate the closures will save around pound million in maintenance costs.It had been hoped to have the Waterside scheme completed later this year but no date has been put on a finish of the local work due to Covid-.. googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Minister McConalogue said: “I am looking at what options might be available to address the situation. “Essentially, this situation is one of the signicant implications of the Brexit negotiations. However, we could have been in a much worse, a much more challenging scenariothere had not been a deal on Christmas Eve past. “It was a possibility access for Irish boats to British waters, which are obviously very close to the Donegal coast, could have been blocked off to our fishermen, and we catch one third of the national catch of fish in British waters. googletag.cmd.push “Also, in that scenario the Northern Irish-registered boats, which are the vessels we are talking about here, would not have had access or permission to come into Irish waters at all. Thankfully, as a result of the deal, that very stark scenario was avoided for our fishing sector,” said Minister McConalogue. Admitting the outcomes were “challenging”, Minister McConalogue they had to be “examined and addressed”. He added: “This [the situation in Greencastle] is one of those outcomes, which has resulted from the international legal status of Britain no longer being a member of the EU. “It requires any boats which are British-registered or Northern Irish-registered to land into designated ports in the Republic. I am very much aware of the issue this creates for local fishermen who fish using Northern Ireland boats. However, Northern Ireland boats now come under the UK fisheries policy rather than the EU Common Fisheries Policy. googletag.cmd.push “I am looking at what options might be available to address the situation. I am looking at them, obviously, with urgency. What we are talking about is the designation of ports, which would meet international criteria and any regulatory infrastructural requirements around that. I am currently investigating what would be required and what it would be possible to do. “I have been taking to many of the fishermen involved and very much understand the implications for them being able to carry out their livelihoods as they had done up until Brexit,” said Minister McConalogue.        --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Derry News has learned that it has become such an issue that Northern Ireland Waterhas recommended that no further connections be made to the networkuntil the necessary work has been carried out to increase thecapacity. This will impact on any planning applications for new properties in the Culmore area. Details of the issues at Culmore Road have emerged after plans were put forward to build  new propertieson a site at  Culmore Road. At present, the site is home to one property, which is called Derrianna. googletag.cmd.push However, the owners of the site want to knock this house down and build  new propertieson the land. The plans for the Culmore Road site were lodged with Derry City and Strabane District Councilsplanning department in November . As part of the planning process, the council contacta range of agencies to ask for theirinputon the proposals. One of the agencies contacted was NI Water. In their response to the council about the plans for  Culmore Road,Robert O’Hare, from Ni Waters Developer Services, said they would have issues with the sewage system in the area. There is a mm diameter public foul sewer which is located on Culmore Road, that is adjacent and near the boundary of the proposed development site, Mr OHare wrote. googletag.cmd.push However, due to the sewer network being at capacity in the Culmore catchment and sewer flows spilling from CSOsinto the environment, NI Water is recommending to council planners that no further connections should be made to this network or a condition should be incorporated which requires an alternative drainage  treatment solution for the proposed site. It is understood that the owners of the site at  Culmore Road are now in discussions with NI Water to look at alternative ways of dealing with sewage from the proposed housing development. However, the fact that the sewage network in the area is at full capacity will continue to have an impact on proposed developments in the area.     The problems being caused by the restricted sewage system in Derry were discussed at Northern Ireland Executive level last year. In March last year, Foyle Sinn Fein MLA Martina Anderson asked Infra- structure Minister Nichola Mallon what stepsshe would be taking to ensure sewerage and wastewater capacity issues did not put building planning applications in Derry on hold. In response, the Minister said NI Water was progressing a Drainage Area Planin the Culmore area. The current forecast completion date for the DAP is summer autumn , she said. NI Waters role in the planning process is that of a statutory consultee. “It has been engaging with Derry City and Strabane District Council on wastewater system capacity issues over several years Over the last two years, substantial survey  investigative work has been undertaken throughout Derry to inform the DAP process, including flow survey, network asset surveys and CCTV investigations. At this point, NI Water will have a more detailed understanding of the capacity issues and as such be better positioned to provide outline solutions. Ms Mallon added: As Minister, I aim to ensure that my Department will do all it can to assist in tackling these capacity issues.However, my budget is subject to a number of competing priorities. “I have, therefore, engaged with the Finance Minister to highlight the critical need to secure the funding that I require to ensure sewerage and wastewater capacity issues do not put building planning applications in Derry and across the north on hold,” the Infrastructure Minister added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The club have confirmed the news tonight, bringing the -year-old back to his home town club. Parkhouse spent the entirety of the  season at Derry City and finished as the club’s top scorer in his first season in senior football. He made  appearances in all competitions, and scoring  goals as well as chipping in with  assists. The -year old has ed to his hometown club after a dficult year in England, which brought disappointing loan spells at both Stevenage and Hartlepool. He is eager to put that all behind him however as he focuses on hitting the heights he achieved with the Candystripes back in . googletag.cmd.push “It’s something that was in the pipeline and I’m just glad that it’s over the line now,” he said. “I know I had two loan moves and they didn’t work out quite how I would have liked them to, but that’s in the past now and I’ve signed a deal now with Derry and I want to go on and showcase myself now and go on and do the best I can for myself and the club and for my team mates.” Parkhouse remains as ambitious as ever and having burst onto the scene at the Brandywell two years ago, he is hoping to have a similar impact to repay Declan Devine’s faith in him. googletag.cmd.push “The first time I was here I set out goals that I wanted to achieve and I never expected to do that well,” he explained. “I went there originally to get a few games and a few goals and I came out of it with a bagful. I’m back again now and I just want to build on that first year. I know the club well, I know it inside out and I know where the club wants to be. “Decky is arguably the best manager I’ve played under in my career. He is somebody I look up to. He has faith in me and he has shown that and I have faith in him in taking the club where it needs to go.”     Declan Devine is delighted to get his man. “I’m delighted to be bringing David Parkhouse back to this club and I’m especially pleased that the player is happy to commit himself to Derry City for at least the next three years, he said. “We’ve made no secret of the fact that we want the players who come here to know the club, know the league and be a good fit for Derry City and David brings that in spades.” “Everybody at this football club knows what ‘Parky’ brings to the team. He has a real energy and tenacity in his approach to the game. He is well got by the players already here and it will be the same with new players coming in.” “It was clear in our discussions with him that he wants to strive to get better and that is something we intend to do as a whole club.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

While all of this is well rehearsed, it is no less important because it has been said so many times before.ldquoOne of the first things for me is about all of us behaving aswe have Covid, in terms of social distancing, hand washing and minimising contacts.She appealed to people to only come to hospital when they need to and not to turn up when they donrsquot need to.ldquoWe know that there are instances where it is absolutely vitally important that people present themselvesthey have chest pain orthey think they are having a stroke. It is really important to emphasise that the service is still here for you, continued Ms Patterson.ldquoBut equally for those who do not require an emergency service or hospital at this point in time, we are appealing to you to make these measured judgements.The nursing director said as the coming weeks are going to be dficult, hospitals are not going to be able to care for everyone in the way they normally would, insisting that everyone will do their very best across the organisation to help and support staff to do their best.Ms Patterson added: ldquoWe want to thank those people who have complied with all the guidance. There are many people who have been very good, especially those who are vulnerable and face challenging conditions. What we now need is for more people to follow public health advice to help stop the spread of the virus.Mr Charlie Martyn, the health trustrsquos medical director, said people needed to do more to contain the virus.ldquoWe have all seen people out walking, congregating and meeting up. What we are seeing now around the mixing that has occurred and people meeting over Christmas and New Year is pressures on the wider health system, he said.ldquoWe all need to do better as iniduals and ask people to look at their inidual and collective compliance because we need to get out of this. None of us has faced this situation before.

It is also something that we must get right given that this is the last remaining town centre site available for development, he continued. ldquoI firmly believe that this eagerly-awaited regeneration scheme can provide a boost for existing businesses.It has been reported that several High Street retailers have expressed an interest in opening stores at this part of the town and it remains to be seenthis interest remains in the light of the continuing coronavirus pandemic.Cllr Curran hopes these leading retailers remain committed to Downpatrick to trade alongside existing businesses, many of them family-owned.He continued: ldquoThe Irish Street redevelopment proposal offers great potential and can provide a vibrant retail hub that will benefit the business community increasing footfall.ldquoAs I have previously said, the redevelopment of this large, town centre area provides a unique opportunity, the like of which is simply never going to be available again. The project has the potential to help transform Downpatrickrsquos economic fortunes and we need to get this right.ldquoPeople want to see progress and it is important that we keep the public as informed as possible about progress on this eagerly-anticipated scheme.Cllr Curran said the completion of the development brief was key to moving forward and he was keen to see work commencing to transform the Irish Street and boost Downpatrickrsquos economic fortunes..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13th January 2021 Megan.jpg","title":"Megan’s amazing eight and a half stone weight loss  ","story":"MEGAN Rice walked through the doors of Slimming World ready to change her le around.She knew it was going require commitment and working alongside her consultant and group support.Megan was ready to do so and is glad she did as she has lost an amazing eight-and-a-half stones.ldquoMy downfall was takeaways, she admitted. ldquoI just loved them and they were an easy fix.ldquoBut at Slimming World I learned to adapt and make my own lsquofakeawaysrsquo, swapping fried rice for boiled rice and making SW chips at home.ldquoIrsquom a vegetarian and use a lot of Quorn.

Ardnabannon is the ideal location for this with the Mournes looking down on you and the sea on on the other side. The site really lends itself to what we are planning to do, added Mr Cunningham.Local politicians say they are fully supportive of MYMYrsquos proposal for the Ardnabannon site and are keen to see the former outdoor education centre redeveloped for community use.They also appreciate the work the charity carries out across the district and are in no doubt that the current education property and surrounding land can be fully utilised for the good of the communityMYMY is allowed to proceed with its proposal..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13th January 2021 Relief.jpg","title":"Relief and frustration at cancellation of exams  ","story":"SCHOOL principals and students have spoken of their relief and frustration over the cancellation of GCSE and A-Level exams over the coronavirus pandemic for the second year running.Education Minister Peter Weir announced his intention last week as secondary level students resumed remote learning after the Christmas break.Schools are waiting on receiving guidance from the Department of Education on how grades will be calculated and next steps are required for students and teachers.Mr Joe McCann, principal of St Patrickrsquos Grammar School in Downpatrick said that while he recognised that it was a dficult decision, he welcomed the clarity.He added: ldquoNew questions are raised and students will now be wondering how their grades will be calculated and what procedures and processes will be put in place to ensure that awarding is a fair refection of their effort and attainment to date.ldquoYear  in particular had seen no real reduction in the course content needing to be covered this year. This will be a relief to them though a disappointment that the GCSE English and Maths modules scheduled for January  and  were cancelled at such short notice.However, he warned that the mistakes from last summer when controversial A-Level grades had to be amended must not be allowed to happen again.ldquoMany of the dficulties experienced in the summer of  must be avoided and the lessons learned used to inform the way ahead.ldquoWe have to resist the use algorithms to calculate inidual pupil results and awarding bodies must trust teacher professionalism coupled with rigorous checks and balances put in place by school leaders to ensure consistency.Down High School principal Mrs Maud Perry said: ldquoPupils are fully engaged in remote learning. Education is so much more than preparation for an exam and pupils will need to be well equipped for their next steps.She said that a DENI circular on remote learning was also received by schools last week which draws together key learning points from the last period of lockdown.Mrs Perry added: ldquoIt was reassuring to read that research confirms that we are on the correct path. The effectiveness of remote teaching is determined by the same factors as effective live classroom teaching. Keeping in touch is so important for pupil wellbeing.Mr Peter Dobbin, principal of Assumption Grammar School in Ballynahinch, said he was relieved that the ldquoinevitable decision to cancel GCSEs and A Levels had been been made.ldquoWe now await guidance as to how grades will be awarded this year, he remarked.ldquoWhen this information is received it will give staff, students, and parents clarity as to the way forward for schools to see us safely through the rest of this academic year, he added.Ms Jenner King, vice principal of St Colmanrsquos High and Sixth Form College in Ballynahinch, described the decision as ldquosensible, but said she was disappointed it had not been made sooner.ldquoThe main premise for all examinations is fairness and with the number of pupils missing out because of Covid-related absences, running the examinations as standard was never going to be fair, she saidldquoOur staff and pupils have been preparing and working hard towards this eventuality, and our hope now is that the Minister and CCEA act swtly to issue detail on the alternative. Any further delay will only serve to disadvantage our young people even further.Pupils from a number of schools also commented on Mr Weirrsquos announcement.Down High Head Boy Jack Martin, who is from Newcastle, said: ldquoI will be missing at least  weeks of in-school learning this school year alone in addition to the time missed from March last year.ldquoI know many have missed much more. Thus, I agree with the decision to cancel exams as some pupils have been disproportionally disadvantaged.Down High Head Girl Anna Clements, who is from Ballynahinch, said: ldquoI greatly appreciate what the teachers have been going through in these dficult times and I hope this decision eases the pressure on them.ldquoWe have been in a state of limbo since the start of our Upper Sixth Year. What I would appreciate now from external agencies is clarication with regard to how our grades are to be assigned.Assumption Grammar Head Girl Lucia Orsi, from Crossgar, said: ldquoI am relieved that examinations have been cancelled as I feared that our courses would not have been completed in time, due to the current lockdown.ldquoHowever, I am anxious that there has been no decision on how our grades will be calculated..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13th January 2021 Towns.jpg","title":"Towns could be in line for public realm scheme boost  ","story":"SAINTFIELD, Killyleagh and Castlewellan could be in line for ambitious new public realm and environmental improvement schemes.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is seeking financial support from the Department for Communities to carry out work in each of the locations which could cost several million pounds.Traditionally, the government department provides cash to upgrade towns which have a population in excess of , people, but local authority officials believe that there may be a future opportunity to finance schemes in towns where the population is greater than ,.Members of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee were told on Mondaythat council officials plan to ask the government department to include the local areas in a capital works forward plan.Councillors were told that in order to inform the capital works forward plan, the council commissioned research in each of the areas, asking people for their views and coming up with short, medium and long term proposals.Reports on the future vision for each area were tabled at Mondayrsquos committee meeting and in addition to detailing what work could take place, they focus on the negative impact of doing nothing.Moving forward, council officials have confirmed that they are to work with their Department for Communities colleagues on a capital works programme for each area.In Killyleagh, suggested improvements include enhancements and improvements to the seafront between Seaview and Cuan Beach, new lighting between Shore Street and Seaview and a new slipway at Seaside Road.Other suggestions include improving the Sir Hans Sloane memorial space and Frederick Street car park and replacing a current public toilet block at the top of High Street in front of Killyleagh Castle,Elsewhere, repainting the townrsquos library is suggested, alongside utilising the top floor of the building for community use, addressing derelict buildings and the introduction of a so-called shopfronts scheme.The recent consultation highlighted the need for improved welcome and directional signage, new pavings and footpaths and support for the Hans Sloane Centre.Similarly in Saintfield there is a focus on upgrading shop fronts alongside new paving and footpaths, resurfacing a section of Main Street, addressing the derelict buildings issue and the provision of a pelican crossing between High Street and the townrsquos new community centre.Additional open spaces are also highlighted with calls for the main car park at Downpatrick Street to be upgraded, alongside the provision of additional spaces.The upgrade of public toilets at the New Line is also highlighted, alongside their potential relocation and steps to tackle a flooding issue between the Fair Green and Main Street.Other suggestions include the need for a ldquospend local campaign which could include the development of a mobile app, allowing shoppers to upload a personal spending balance which could attract discounts when purchases are made in the town.In Castlewellan, issues highlighted include better use of the space around the townrsquos market House at Upper Square, the provision of additional litter bins, better use of vacant and derelict space, enhanced car parking and traffic management and the townrsquos general landscape with flower beds and new trees, particularly at the Lower Square area.Improving signage to direct people to the peace maze at Castlewellan Forest Park and other buildings of interest is suggested..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/12223470.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Hospitality businesses would have joined them on pm Christmas Day, with a level four lockdown coming into place on Monday, December . The five day lsquorelaxationrsquo period would have still been in place according to these rules, but a change from three households mixing to two.But on Saturday, December , all this changed as prime minister Boris Johnson held a press conference to update the UK on the rapid spread of the new strain of coronavirus and announcing that the South East of England, including London would be moved into tier four.Tier four means residents must stay at home with some limited exemptions ndash which includes workunable to do so from home, however, working from home is strongly advisedit is possible. Non-essential services must also close. People also must not enter or leave a tier four area.This also saw a change to Englandrsquos Christmas restrictions, with households banned from mixing, apart from single households, which would be allowed to form a bubble to avoid isolation.Areas in the lower tiers were still allowed to continue to mix with up to three households ndash however, only on Christmas Day.So, what did this announcement mean for Wales The announcement by the prime minister was focused specically on England, but it was followed by Walesrsquo first minister making an announcement of his own the same evening. He announced that the tier four lockdown would come into place from midnight on Saturday, December , meaning businesses had a matter of hours to come to terms with the news and people rushed out to do some last-minute Christmas shopping before all the non-essential retail closed.Some of the supermarkets across Wales have now taken their lsquonon-essentialrsquo items off sale.The festive period bubble rule has also changed, with a maximum of two households allowed to mix on Christmas Day.MORE NEWS:Mr Drakeford said in a statement on Saturday evening that the pattern of transmission in London and the South East of England, which is linked to the new iant of coronavirus, is ldquoremarkably consistent with the rapid acceleration of transmission in Wales in recent weeks.Also in the statement, the first minister said that latest evidence had suggested the new strain is present throughout Wales and that it needed an ldquoimmediate response.After meeting with the Welsh Governmentrsquos Cabinet on Saturday and taking into consideration advice from senior medical and scientic advisors, he said: ldquoThe situation is incredibly serious. I cannot overstate this.ldquoWe have therefore reached the dficult decision to bring forward the alert level four restrictions for Wales, in line with the action being taken in London and the South East of England.Dr Chris Williams, incident director for the Novel Coronavirusoutbreak at Public Health Wales said in a statement: ldquoAs indicated by the Welsh Government, the immediate introduction of new restrictions is related to the identication of a new more transmissible iant of Coronavirus. Public Health Wales has been working with UK partners to investigate and respond to this iant.ldquoIt is normal for viruses to undergo mutations, and we expect this to happen. Although the iant is easier to transmit, there is currently no evidence that it is more severe.ldquoWe are reminding people that all current guidance relating to Coronavirus continues to apply to the new iant, including advice relating to symptoms, social distancing, self-isolation, and vaccination.ldquoThe new iant shows up as positive in Public Health Walesrsquo existing Coronavirus tests, and people must continue to seek a test in the usual waythey develop Coronavirus symptoms.ldquoIf you or a member of your household develop a cough, fever or change in sense of taste or smell, you must self-isolate immediately and book a free Coronavirus test by calling .ldquoPublic Health Wales urges everyone to follow the rules, to avoid transmission of Coronavirus and to protect everyone in our communities, including the most vulnerable. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

As a result, Cllr Baxter’s proposal passed with  votes in favour, eight against and one abstention recorded.However, upon discussion of the committee meeting’s minutes at December’s meeting of full council, Councillor Liam Mackle proposed that Council did not accept the recommendation put forward by the committee.This proposal was seconded by his party colleague Councillor Paul Duffy.Councillor Pope said it “was very important” that the occasion is marked and noted the need for education and cultural events to be spread throughout the borough.He also expressed his concerns about budgets and the idea of a large event taking place giving the current pandemic.“I would propose we accept the original recommendationfrom the November committee that listed the programme, including the £, budget,” said Cllr Pope. This proposal was seconded by his party’s group leader, Councillor Eoin Tennyson.Speaking about the issue, Cllr Tennyson said the programme had been discussed atand explained, from his perspective, initialdiscussions were constructive.“All parties engaged with a view to marking the centenary in a way that was inclusive and respectful,” said Cllr Tennyson. “I think the original recommendation that was presented by officers to the committee was one that did that.“It would allow us to mark the centenary in a way that was inclusive and reflective of the entire borough and also balanced against the need to be prudent in terms of the financial situation we as a council and indeed many of our rate payers are in.“I can’t in good conscience support a proposal that would see this council commit to an additional £, unbudgeted spend. The reality is that money is going to have be found through the estimates process.“We could end up in the situation where that money will have to be found through a rates hike or cuts to services. I think Councillor Pope’s proposal is an eminently sensible one and I hope all parties can see it in themselves to support that approach.”DUP councillor Darryn Causby sought clarity on what was being proposed andthe proposals tabled complied with standing orders.“Under standing order .. there should only be one amendment moved and discussed at one time, the same applies for proposals on the floor,” said Cllr Causby.“There was one on the floor, Cllr Pope then put a second one on the floor but can I please get clarity on the first one [Cllr Mackle’s proposal] it seems to be a direct negative of what is in the papers and under standing orders I am not clear on whether that is acceptable.“The other point I would raise is the budget was actually agreed at the November council meeting and we just ratied that a short time ago.“If someone is not happy with that, I suggest they look through standing orders and bring a rescinding motion to change that decision.”At this point Council’s Lord Mayor, Councillor Kevin Savage informed members he needed to speak with Council’s Chief Executive Roger Wilson and muted his microphone.Following his confidential discussionwith Mr Wilson, the Lord Mayor confirmed the budget had already been agreed before putting Councillor Mackle’s proposal, to reject the recommendation put forward by the committee, to the floor.All unionist councillors present voted against the proposal as did the three members of the Alliance Party. The members of Sinn Fein and the SDLP voted in favour of the proposal.With the votes totalled, the proposal was defeated with  members voting against the proposal and  voting in favour.The Lord Mayor then explainedthat as the recommendation of the committee stands, a rescinding motion would be requiredbefore Cllr Tennyson’s proposal could be heard.Councillor Tennyson said he was not sure he agreed with this interpretation.“The proposal was that we proceed with the programme originallyproposed by officers not the budget,” said Cllr Tennyson.“The budget may have been agreed, the programme has never been agreed therefore a rescinding motion is not required.“We have proposed that we proceed with the originalprogramme as proposed to the economic development and regeneration committee, it just so happened to be at a cost of £,.“I would be quite keen for that to be voted on as I do not share the analysis that a rescinding motion is required for a decision that has never been taken.”Councillor Baxter then said that as a matter of process given that Cllr Mackle’s proposal has fallen by “default the recommendation goes through”.“I do note Alliance are quite clearly trying to claw back as they could not bring themselves to vote for the celebration of Northern Ireland at the last committee meeting,” said Cllr Baxter.“By the very fact Cllr Mackle’s proposal has failed this recommendation from the committee is going through.”The Lord Mayor said that was his understanding as well and the recommendation as it stands has now gone through.A proposal to accept the minutes of the committee was put forward by Councillor Brian Pope and seconded by SDLP group leader, Councillor Thomas O’Hanlon.Editor’s message:Thank you for reading this article.

NoticesNewsPoliticsSunday trading hours decision deferredA decision on whether to extend Sunday trading hours for essential retailers across Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council area has been deferred until the end of the month.By The NewsroomThursday, th January , : pmUpdated Thursday, th January , : pm  \"       \"  The matter was discussed at January’s meeting of Council’s economic development and regenerationcommittee.Members were reminded that at December’s committee meeting, members agreed to allow longer Sunday trading hours, from am to pm, for large food and non-essential retailers until Sunday, December .However, the retail sector is now under additional restrictions and non-essential businesses are not permitted to open.\"Craigavon Civic CentreCouncil’s strategic director of place, Olga Murtagh, confirmed requests have been receivedfrom major food retailers requesting Council’s permission to open for longer on Sundays.The officer’s recommendation was for members to permit the facilitation of longer Sunday trading hours from am to pm during the COVID- pandemic until March  and to give delegated authority to the Chief Executive on this matter.Speaking about the recommendation, SDLP group leader Thomas O’Hanlon said he was uneasy with the recommendation and suggested an alternative resolution.“I suggest we allow it [the extension of Sunday trading hours] until the end of the month and review the issue again at our full Council meeting at the end of the month,” proposed Cllr O’Hanlon.“I am mindful of non-essential retailers who are forced to remain closed at present and the impact this decision could have on smaller businesses in our town centres.“We need to be mindful of smaller retailers in our area and the high levels of the virus in the community.”Sinn Fein councillor, Catherine Nelson, said she could understand Cllr O’Hanlin’s position and indicated her party would have “no issue with that”.The proposal was seconded by Councillor O’Hanlon’s party colleague Councillor Grainne O’Neill who said it was important members were “mindful of our town centres and small businesses”.Alderman Stephen Moutray said he could not support the proposal and would not be in favour of allowing the bigger stores to open earlier on a Sunday “at all”.“I would question what has happened in the first two Sundays of this year,” said the DUP representative.“The message here for the non-essential retailer is that the gap is getting wider.“If they can’t open at all are we going to throw the doors of larger retailers open for longer when some of them already open to midnight, six nights a week.”His party colleague, Councillor Paul Greenfield said he was in agreement with Alderman Moutray.“The message we are supposed to be sending out is stay at home and only venture outit is necessary,” said Cllr Greenfield.“We are in the middle of a pandemic, not that long ago we had a curfew but by doing this we would be encouraging people to spend more time in shops.”Alderman Jim Speers said he believedthe large retailers already have an “unfair advantage” based on what they are allowed to sell at present.“The situation is very unfair on the small trader in clothing or hardware,” said the Ulster Unionist representative.“The reality is these larger shops are open and get a long day as it is. To allow them to open from am to pm on Sunday would be unfair to the smaller local trader that has been forced to close their doors and I will not be supporting the proposal.”DUP group leader, Councillor Mark Baxter then queriedthe committee had the power to give delegated authority orthe decision would be required to come before full council at the end of January anyway.Ms Murtagh confirmed that to be the case but saidthere had been a unanimous agreement, members’ decision could be taken forward to permit the longer opening hours on Sundays.Councillor O’Hanlon said his proposal was designed to limit theof time the extended hours trading would apply for but given that there was not unanimous support for it, he was more than happy to see the matter deferred until the end of the month.The Chair of the committee, Councillor Brian Pope then put it to members that the matter should be deferred until the full council meeting at the end of the month and the committee voiced its agreement.Man confesses to rape - read hereEditor’s message:Thank you for reading this article.

A spokesperson said: Due to the very high levels of COVID- transmission across our community, the four UK Chief Medical Officers have advised that we now move into alert level , which requires the strictest of social distancing given the threat that health and social care services could become overwhelmed and therefore impacts on visiting to all care settings across Northern Ireland. Subsequently the Western Health and Social Care Trust have assessed all elements of risk and in order to protect patients, visitors and staff, the decision has been made to temporarily suspend visiting on all sites and facilities within the Western Trust. This suspension will now apply from midnight on Thursday, January . While we recognise that restriction to visiting is a very emotive and dficult issue, often causing distress for families, patients and residents, it is essential that these updated visiting restrictions are effectively applied to help bring the transmission of COVID- under control. There will becertain exceptional circumstances which will continue to apply. If you are permitted to visit hospital or a care facility under any of the special circumstances above you MUST wear a face covering, thoroughly wash your hands or use sanitiser when entering and exiting that facility. PLEASE DO NOT visityou are feeling unwell, especiallyyou have a high temperature or new persistent cough or have a sudden loss of taste or smell, the spokesperson continued. Children are not permitted to visit. The Trust acknowledges that this is a very dficult time for the public and we ask you to work with us and appeal to patients and visitors to respect our staff and the guidance they give you at all times. The Trust operates a ‘Zero Tolerance’ policy and we will not accept any form of abuse towards our staff. You can also continue to arrange a ‘virtual visit’ with your relative or friend on a smartphone or tablet. Our hospitals have access to free Wi-Fi and our staff can help set this up. Please be patient. Our staff will have to prioritise clinical work and patient care. We are very sorry to have to move to this position of suspending visiting to all our hospitals and facilities as we understand how important this is for people, but we must immediately apply this in the best interest of the health and safety for everyone until such time as the transmission of COVID- reduces. The Trust said the guidance will be kept under constant review. A breakdown of all exceptional circumstances included as part of the temporary suspension of visiting to Western Trust facilities is available to view on the Trust website.  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cbefffbebbebf   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_eeaadcabfedbabfad   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
