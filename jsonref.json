The group – which included co-founder Bobby Seale and Ericka Huggins – was on trial for over a year, which exacerbated racial tensions in the US leading to protests.Seale and Huggins were acquitted, along with four others and 50 years on, Artspace New Haven has been inspired to create a new group exhibition exploring a difficult time.“The prompt was, ‘How have the events of 50 years ago inspired you today, and what does it look like today to be a part of a liberation movement?’” says Artspace New Haven’s executive director, Lisa Dent, of Revolution On Trial: May Day and The People’s Art, New Haven’s Black Panthers @ 50. “There’s also talk about the need for artists and the idea to reveal the joy in liberation, and what that looks like.”Co-curated by La Tanya S Autry and Sarah Fritchey, the exhibition traces the fight for racial justice over the past half-century, leading us to now, as Black Lives Matter protests have stormed the country, fighting back against police brutality since the killing of George Floyd in May. “A lot of black curators are thinking about other moments of liberation, action and protest,” says Dent. “It made us understand how timely it could be.”The work of six artists is shown alongside one youth organization called Ice the Beef, and though this exhibition was supposed to open on May Day, it was pushed back due to the pandemic. Some artists used archive material as inspiration, while others draw a parallel to protests today, showing how art is a form of action.There are colorful, empowering paintings of local protesters standing proudly, created by the New Haven artist Kwadwo Adae, who has been active in anti-police brutality marches over the past five years. “I consider these people powerhouses and the champions of the movements against injustice, racism and state-sanctioned violence that black and brown bodies have been subject to by law enforcement for generations,” says Adae.The works include paintings of protesters, like Addys Castillo, an anti-racist organizer Norm Clement, who works for the CT Bail Fund and Vanesa Suárez, an organizer with Connecticut Immigrant Rights Alliance. “We are at an unprecedented time in history where we are unable to ignore the systemic racism and discrimination inherent in every facet of life for people of color in America,” adds Adae.The New York artist Melanie Crean looks to the New Haven courthouse where the trial went down in 1970. She couldn’t help but notice the murals in the hallway, which feature only white figures, “including Moses, meant to represent ancient law, and a young white woman, symbolizing modern law, freeing a young white man from bondage”, says Crean.“The disconnect of presenting a vision of justice that never existed, in a city where the majority of the population are people of color, in the court where the Black Panther party trials were held, is an unfortunately common example of everyday violence that needs to be addressed.”Crean, in a way, is updating the age-old symbol of Lady Justice. “If justice is commonly represented as a woman, how would female-identifying people, working with the justice system in New Haven, choose to represent it?” she asks.The answer was a group of nine local women, who nominated other women who have been affected by the justice system.“We chose four themes: power, struggle, resistance and hope or healing, and compiled stories from the women’s lives with those themes to inspire compositions for four new murals,” says Crean. “These would feature the women in tableau, to be photographed inside the courthouse.”The Northampton-based artist Alex Callender shows a collage-based wallpaper that highlights the patterns of systemic racism in New Haven’s property laws and urban design. “Looking through state and local New Haven archives, I wanted to assemble a longer spatial narrative to connect these histories of community displacement, state surveillance, land speculation and resistance that have been formed from the colonial era to the present day luxury condo real estate industry,” says Callender.“I wanted to create a de-colonial pattern, drawing on local histories of land and housing development interwoven with community resistance to tell a narrative through time.”Among the archival material in the exhibition, there are photos by David Fenton, a former photojournalist who followed the Black Panthers in the late 1960s and early 1970s. He shot protests, rallies, Black Panther clothing donation gatherings, book sales and food drives. “I photographed the Black Panthers a lot,” recalls Fenton. “They were disciplined, organized, focused on their community programs. They were a positive force.”He remembers the Black Panther demonstrations in New Haven being filled with hippies, university students and intellectuals. “It was a demo and it was also Woodstock I have photos of hippies with long hair smoking pot, rubbing each other’s backs on the grass, playing guitar – it was celebratory,” he said. “Young white people were really supportive of the Black Panthers.”But nothing compared to the power of the party rallies as he remembers them. “There was a lot of chanting, singing, it was unifying,” he says, “it was hopeful.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64c838ac05ef433de9803d3bb96b99f13e0d6a8f/0_82_2644_1585/master/2644..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e6b2b738b0dd560622542d6c1e490aa0","title":"bet against the banks but dont bet against the insurance companies","story":"Legal \u0026amp General paid out £36m in Covid-19 related life insurance claims but also made a £32m gain There is a grim calculus for insurers handling coronavirus claims, laid bare by Legal \u0026amp General’s half year results. It paid out £36m in life insurance claims to the families of those who sadly died from Covid-19 – but made a £32m gain from mortality, as it will pay out pensions for fewer years than expected as the elderly pass away.In late March, the Bank of England strong-armed banks into halting idends and bonuses, and made it clear that insurers should consider doing the same too.But while the guidance made sense for banks, facing huge losses from bad debts, for insurers coronavirus has turned out very differently – with some parts of their business doing rather well.Take Direct Line’s results earlier this week. It pocketed a huge gain on its motor insurance book as shunts, prangs and whiplash virtually disappeared during the lockdown.In the first half of 2020, Direct Line paid just £402m in motor claims, down from £519m in the same period last year, more than offsetting the £35m paid on travel and business interruption claims.Home insurance claims have also collapsed as we stayed home and kept burglars away, as Aviva’s results shortly will doubtless show. It’s only insurers focused on business interruption, such as Hiscox, who are at significant risk.L\u0026ampG remains robust and it appears to retain enough cash to fund its activities and future growth. When it defied regulators and paid out a idend in early April, it looked like a risky gamble, just as the virus was taking grip and the economy was in freefall.It turned out to be probably the right thing to do idends don’t just go to the rich – they are also the lifeblood of income funds used by the elderly to finance their retirement. Now, L\u0026ampG has decided to maintain its idend, and the only note of disapproval comes from fund managers who wanted it to pay out even more.But equally there’s the huge pool of savings built up by households that couldn’t spend during the lockdown, inflows from auto-enrolment, and an ageing society. All these forces play into L\u0026ampG’s hands. By all means bet against the banks, but don’t bet against the insurance, life and pension companies.Sweden adopted a different approach to Covid-19 than most of the rest of Europe. Stores and restaurants stayed open, for the most part children continued to go to school. The assumption by the government was that a full lockdown of the economy was not needed because Swedes would behave responsibly.So was it worth it? Despite all the social distancing that has been going on, Sweden’s death toll from the pandemic has been far higher than neighbouring Denmark and on a per capita basis exceeds that of the United States. That said, the number of new cases has been on a sharply declining trend, at least until recent days.Of course, the crisis is by no means over yet. Sweden might have developed herd immunity. Its anti-lockdown approach could pay economic idends in the event of a second wave. All that can be said at the moment, though, is that it has paid a high price for being the best of a bad bunch."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/780b987a2aeabc488ab676347a730a8cec73465e/0_154_3373_2024/master/3373.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ce7aa442e9b0d8123c820ecc5713bec","title":"uk office workers slower to return to their desk after covid","story":"British office workers have returned to their desks at a much slower pace than staff in France, Germany, Italy or Spain, as they continue to work from home following the lockdown.In England, companies have been urged to encourage employees to return to their workplaces from this week by Boris Johnson, although early reports suggest only a relatively small number have heeded the call thus far. The recommendation in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland is for staff to continue to work from home where possible.It is unclear whether the UK’s slower return to the office could be related to the earlier impositions of lockdown and subsequent easing of restrictions in the four other European countries.In all five European countries, office workers have continued to work remotely for longer than employees based in other kinds of workplaces.Technology, including high-speed internet and video conferencing apps, has enabled successful working from home for many companies which usually occupy offices, and as a result firms have been more reluctant to ask their employees to return.Workers in London are much more likely to continue to work remotely than their counterparts in other European capitals including the Paris region, Madrid, Berlin or Rome.The Morgan Stanley survey was conducted in mid-July, before the government updated its guidance for businesses.Boris Johnson told companies in England it would be up to them to decide from 1 August when and how to bring back staff and also scrapped the previous guidance to avoid public transport.However, recent analysis by the  showed that several of Britain’s largest office occupiers have not heeded the government’s call.Many companies cited uncertainty about asking their employees to use public transport and the need for childcare during school summer holidays as reasons not to end remote working before September at the earliest.The government is keen to get workers back into corporate buildings to support smaller businesses in many towns and cities, from sandwich shops to dry cleaners, that provide services to the country’s army of office workers.High street retailer WH Smith announced on Wednesday it would cut 1,500 jobs because of struggling sales in its travel business, which includes branches at airports, as well as small kiosk-style stores in bus and railway stations.Sandwich chain Pret a Manger said in July it would permanently close 30 outlets and could cut 1,000 jobs after sales plummeted as a result of continued working from home.Workers across mainland Europe have similar views on where and how they will work in future.Yet employees’ desire to work remotely does not necessarily spell the end of the office."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f00f7288bb592a9ffeae18b530fc2798d60d13d6/0_267_4181_2510/master/4181.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ccf533cac9c2dac2da590dda9030d487","title":"covid 19 job losses sees record numbers seeking temporary work","story":"People looking for permanent jobs was highest since 2008, says recruitment lobby groupRecord numbers of people in Britain are looking for temporary work as job losses across the country mount, according to recruitment firms that have been flooded with CVs.The Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) and the accountancy firm KPMG said the number of people signing up to find temporary work rose in July at the fastest pace since records began in 1997.The lobby group for the recruitment industry said the record increase in available candidates was largely driven by redundancies stemming from the pandemic, as rising numbers of companies across the country cut jobs.For permanent staff, availability grew at the second fastest rate on record – with growth in the number of people looking for work in July only surpassed to November 2008 during the depths of the financial crisis.The temporary staff availability index compiled by the REC surged to 85, up from 48.5 in February before the pandemic struck. A figure above 50 indicates a rise in available workers from the previous month.It comes as employers across Britain are inundated with job applications, including a restaurant in Manchester receiving more than 1,000 applicants for a receptionist role and an All Bar One in Liverpool receiving more than 500 CVs for a single bar job.Unemployment is beginning to climb as the government scales back its furlough wage subsidy scheme, while new job vacancies have collapsed during the pandemic as the British economy slides into the deepest recession for 300 years. According to the Institute for Employment Studies, as many as eight people are now claiming unemployment benefits for every job opening, compared to just 1.5 people per job in March before the pandemic struck.Neil Carberry, chief executive of the REC, said: “There are far fewer vacancies in the market than before March, and more people looking for jobs. Recruiters will be key to helping people build confidence and find work – but the reality is that government needs to help kickstart hiring.”Despite the gloomy outlook, the REC and KPMG said there were some encouraging signs from the jobs market in July, as the rate of decline in employment slowed.James Stewart, vice chair at KPMG, said unemployment was however likely to rise further as the furlough scheme is wound down: “We are still a long way from being out of the woods, with hiring plans remaining on ice and the uncertain outlook still weighing heavily on business’ recruitment decisions.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ef85fcbef2d05e89b68ecc61a71a3705af3404b/0_105_1840_1104/master/1840.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=20eea7fb2b5f45c5522e9525c501ba42","title":"modi brutal treatment of kashmir exposes his tactics and their flaws","story":"A year after a ferocious crackdown, I see the region facing nothing less than cultural erasure• Arundhati Roy is a novelist, writer and political activistAt midnight on 4 August 2019, phones in Kashmir went dead and internet connections were cut. On 5 August 2019, a year ago today, 7 million people were locked into their homes under a strict military curfew. Up to 10,000 people, from young children and teenage stone pelters to former chief ministers and major pro-India politicians, were arrested and put into preventive detention, where many of them still remain. On 6 August, a bill was passed in parliament stripping the state of Jammu and Kashmir of its autonomy and special status enshrined in the Indian constitution. It was stripped of statehood, downgraded into two union territories, Ladakh, and Jammu and Kashmir. Ladakh would have no legislature and would be governed directly by New Delhi.The problem of Kashmir, we were told, had been finally solved once and for all. In other words, Kashmir’s decades-long struggle for self-determination, which has cost tens of thousands of lives of soldiers, militants and civilians, thousands of enforced “disappearances” and cruelly tortured bodies – was over.In India’s parliament, home minister Amit Shah went further. He said he was prepared to lay down his life to take over the territories of what India calls Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (POK) and what Kashmiris call Azad Kashmir, as well as the frontier provinces of Gilgit-Baltistan. He also threw in Aksai Chin, once part of the erstwhile kingdom of Jammu and Kashmir, now a part of China. He was wading into dangerous territory, literally as well as figuratively. The borders he was talking about lie between three nuclear powers. Amid the unseemly celebrations on India’s streets, the extra wattage generated by Kashmir’s humiliation intensified the glow of prime minister Narendra Modi’s already god-like halo. Provocatively, the Indian meteorological department began to include Gilgit-Baltistan in its weather reports. Few of us in India paid attention to the Chinese government when it urged India to “be cautious in its words and deeds on the border issue”.In the year that has gone by, the struggle in Kashmir has by no means ended. In just the past few months media reports say that 34 soldiers, 154 militants and 17 civilians have been killed. A world traumatised by coronavirus has understandably paid no attention to what the Indian government has done to the people of Kashmir. The curfew and communication siege, and everything else that such a siege entails (no access to doctors, hospitals, work, no business, no school, no contact with loved ones), lasted for months. Even the US didn’t do this during its war against Iraq.Just a few months of Covid lockdown, without a military curfew or communications siege, has brought the world to its knees and hundreds of millions to the limits of their endurance and sanity. Think of Kashmir under the densest military deployment in the world. On top of the suffering coronavirus has laid on you, add a maze of barbed wire on your streets, soldiers breaking into your homes, beating the men and abusing the women, destroying your food stocks, amplifying the cries of humans being tortured on public address systems.Add to this a judicial system – including the supreme court of India – that has for a whole year allowed the internet siege to continue and ignored the 600 habeas corpus petitions by distraught people seeking the whereabouts of their family members. Add further a new domicile law that opens the floodgates by allowing Indians a right of residence in Kashmir. The precious state subject certificates of Kashmiris are now legally void except as backup evidence to bolster their applications to the Indian government for domicile status in their own homeland. Those whose applications are rejected can be denied residency and shipped out. What Kashmir faces is nothing less than cultural erasure.Kashmir’s new domicile law is a relative of India’s new blatantly anti-Muslim Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) passed in December 2019 and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) that is supposed to detect “Bangladeshi infiltrators” (Muslim of course) whom the home minister has called “termites”. In the state of Assam, the NRC has already wreaked havoc. Millions have been struck off the citizens register. While many countries are dealing with a refugee crisis, the Indian government is turning citizens into refugees, fuelling a crisis of statelessness on an unimaginable scale.The CAA, NRC and Kashmir’s new domicile law require even bona fide citizens to produce a set of documents approved by the state in order to be granted citizenship. (The Nuremberg laws passed by the Nazi party in 1935 decreed that only those citizens who could provide legacy papers approved by the Third Reich were eligible for German citizenship.)What should all this be called? A war crime? Or a crime against humanity?And what should the collusion of institutions and the celebrations on the streets of India be called? Democracy?A year down the line, these celebrations over Kashmir are distinctly muted. For good reason. We have a dragon on our doorstep and it isn’t happy. On 17 June 2020, we awoke to the horrifying news that 20 Indian soldiers including a colonel had been brutally killed by the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in the icy reaches of the remote Galwan Valley on the Ladakh border. Over the next few days reports in sections of the Indian press suggested that there had been several points of ingress. Army veterans and respected defence correspondents have said that the PLA has occupied hundreds of square kilometres of what India considers to be its territory. Was it just naked aggression as portrayed by the Indian media? Or have the Chinese moved to protect what they see as their vital interests – a road through the high mountains of Aksai Chin and a trade route through Pakistan OccupiedAzad Kashmir? Both are under threat, if the belligerent statements made by India’s home minister were to be taken seriously, and how can they not be?For a ferociously nationalist government such as ours to concede what it thinks of as sovereign territory has to be its worst nightmare. It cannot be countenanced. But what can be done? A simple solution was found. Just days after the Galwan Valley tragedy, Modi addressed the nation. “Not an inch of land has been occupied by anyone,” he said, “no one has entered our borders” and “none of our posts have been occupied by anyone”. Modi’s critics fell about laughing. The Chinese government was quick to welcome his statement, because that’s what they were saying, too. But Modi’s statement isn’t as stupid as it sounds. While army commanders of both countries are discussing withdrawal and the “disengagement” of troops and the social media is full of jokes about the art of exiting without entering, and while the Chinese continue to hold territory they claim to be their own, to the vast, uniformed majority of India’s population, Modi has won. It was on TV. And who’s to say which is more important? TV or territory?Whichever way you slice it, in the long-term, India now requires a battle-ready army on two fronts – the western frontier with Pakistan and the eastern frontier with China. In addition, the government’s hubris has alienated its neighbours Nepal and Bangladesh. We have been reduced to boasting that in the event of war, the US – reeling from its own crises – will come to India’s rescue. Really? Like it rescued the Kurds in Syria and Iraq? Like it rescued the Afghans from the Soviets? Or the South Vietnamese from the North Vietnamese?Last night a Kashmiri friend messaged me: “Will India, Pakistan and China fight over our skies without seeing us?” It’s not an unlikely scenario. None of these countries is morally superior or more humane than the other. None of them is in this for the greater good of humanity.Narendra Modi, India\u0027s Prime Minister since 2014, has triggered several major controversies in 2019.Modi authorises limited airstrikes across the “line of control” in Kashmir. He acted after the Valentine’s Day massacre by Islamist terrorists based in Azad Kashmir that killed 44 Indian paramilitaries. The attack was celebrated in India, but it was unclear whether anything significant had been struck by the fighter jets. Pakistan said the war planes made it up to five miles inside its territory before they were rebuffed, dropping their payloads without casualties or damage.Modi\u0027s party shocked the political establishment by nominating Pragya Singh Thakur, a Hindu nun accused of involvement in a terrorist attack targeting Muslims, for a seat in the state of Madhya Pradesh. Thakur handily won the seat in the May elections and was appointed to a parliamentary committee on defence - from which she was sacked eight days later for describing Gandhi\u0027s assassin as a patriot.Modi is sworn in as prime minister for the second time after his Bharatiya Janata Party won 303 seats, further increasing their substantial majority.Modi\u0027s government pass the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act which confirmed the Superem Court of India\u0027s 2017 ruling that the triple talaq, which enables men to instantly orce their wives, is unconstitutional.Delhi formally revokes the constitutional autonomy of Kashmir in an attempt to integrate it fully into India. The state was formally taken under direct federal control and split into the territories of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh, bringing an end to decades of semi-autonomous rule. The decision to tighten the government’s grip over the region stoked anger and resentment.Modi\u0027s right-hand man, home minister Amit Shah, tells parliament he will seek to have every Indian prove their citizenship in order to root out illegal migrants. The citizenship checks are modelled on a process that took place this year in Assam state which has left 2m people in legal limbo and was criticised by the UN as an enormous blow to global efforts to eradicate statelessness.A new citizenship bill provides a path to citizenship for religious minorities who have immigrated into India from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan before 31 December 2014. It explicitly lists Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians as being able to take advantage of the new provisions, excluding Muslims. Street protests begin as a result.The first week of August comes with some other milestones, too. Despite the ill-planned, draconian, back-breaking lockdown, despite woefully few tests compared with other countries, confirmed cases of coronavirus in India are now growing at perhaps the fastest rate in the world. Among its victims is our sabre-rattling home minister, who is spending the anniversary in a hospital bed. Not for him the cures being peddled by the quacks, godmen and members of parliament in his party – drinking cow urine, a magic potion called Coronil, blowing conch shells and banging pots and pans, reciting the Hanuman Chalisa, chanting “Go, Corona, Go!” in the flat intonations of a Sanskrit sloka. Oh no. For him the most expensive private hospital and the best (allopathic) government doctors on call.And where will India’s prime minister be?If Kashmir had really been “solved” once and for all, he would be there to be feted by adoring socially distanced crowds. But Kashmir isn’t solved. It’s shut down again. And Ladakh is almost a battlefront. So, Modi has wisely decided to retreat from those troubled borders to a very safe place to make good another long-standing election promise. By the time you read this, he will, accompanied by prayers from priests and people across the country, as well as the blessings of India’s supreme court, have laid a silver slab that weighs 40kg as the foundation for the Ram Mandir, a temple that will rise from the ruins of the Babri Masjid, a mosque that was hammered into the dust by Hindu vigilantes led by members of Modi’s Bharatiya Janata party in 1992. It’s been a long journey. Let’s call it a Triumph of the Will.Lockdown or no lockdown, as I write, I can sense the very air trembling in anticipation of the historic moment. Only the naive or the hopelessly indoctrinated can still believe that hunger and joblessness will lead to revolution – that temples and monuments cannot feed people. They can. The Ram Mandir is food for millions of starved Hindu souls. The further humiliation of the already humiliated Muslims and other minorities only sharpens the taste of victory on the tongue. How can bread compete?Perhaps, as the Chinese suggest, in this matter we should proceed with caution. Think a little. Why did Modi decide to inaugurate the Ram Mandir now? After all it’s not the festivals of Dussehra or Diwali, and the date has no particular relevance in the Ramayana or the Hindu calendar. And there’s a partial lockdown in most parts of India – many of the priests and policemen preparing and securing the site have already tested positive for Covid. So why now? Is it to rub salt into Kashmir’s wounds, or is it to put balm on India’s? Because, whatever they tell us on TV, there’s been a tectonic shift on the borders. Big plates are moving. The world order is changing. You can’t bully people and act like the top dog in the neighbourhood when you’re not top dog. That’s not a Chinese saying. It’s just common sense.Could it be that this August anniversary is not actually what it’s being cracked up to be? Could it be instead the little limpet of shame clamped to the soaring cliff of glory?When and if India, China and Pakistan fight over Kashmir’s skies, the least the rest of us can do is to keep our eyes on its people.• Arundhati Roy is a novelist, writer and political activist.

This adaptation of Fassbinder’s own play, now considered a queer classic, featured an all-female cast orbiting around the manipulative titular protagonist. However, Vera wants to recast the crucial role of Karin with a male star, which would entirely change the sexual dynamics of the story. Whether she’ll manage to pull it off looks increasingly doubtful as agencies, TV commissioners and producers jostle over the final casting decisions, and a series of moderately known (in Germany) female actors come in to screen test for the role of Petra, each one mildly put out that they’re being asked to audition in the first place instead of being offered the role on her reputation alone.Gradually it emerges that the protagonist of this particular subplot is not one of these grand dames but actor-for-hire Gerwin (Andreas Lust), a gay man hired to read the lines for the KarlKarin character. Something about the cliquey vibe of the film set, the evenings boozing with the straight tech dudes and the proximity to making art again lures Gerwin back in. Vera is impressed with some of his screen-test performances and there’s a chance she might just hire him instead of the young star they all thought was locked in.Writer-director Nicolas Wackerbarth (with co-screenwriter Hannes Held), best known for his own work as an actor, certainly captures the fetid atmosphere, fragile and bullish egos and comic-tragic gamesmanship of film sets. The choice of this particular Fassbinder story, with its abundant backbiting and bitchiness, is all the more apt. Nevertheless, Wackerbarth is no Fassbinder and the drab, handheld realism here lacks the flair of the film to which it alludes – although Lust gives a complex, layered performance at the centre."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b0a541042f6b8822bdb236ecfaca090709fa8d5/235_0_3598_2160/master/3598.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=316af9b7bb4a692c34981b0e0f764f00","title":"echo review","story":"Universal themes are enlivened with local detail in this poignant, painterly compilation of 56 single-shot vignettesDon’t waste time looking for a narrative thread or common character in Echo. The third feature from director Rúnar Rúnarsson is a series of single-shot vignettes (56 in total), connected only by their setting: Iceland, around Christmas and new year.The brevity of these scenes doesn’t prevent them depicting nuanced emotions: a teenage girl visiting her father is shown up at the piano by his new girlfriend’s daughter. Or delivering political commentary: a man listens to a radio broadcast about a union dispute while toiling in his workshop. Echo also takes full advantage of each new scene-setting opportunity by presenting us with an abundance of aspirational interiors, impressive landscapes and meticulous mises en scène. The cumulative effect is like strolling through a Reykjavik gallery where each painting moves within its well-chosen frame.Foreigners get a slice of Icelandic life, but the balance between universal themes and local detail is well struck in gently comic scenes, such as the one where a librarian takes a call from his mother to discuss food at the upcoming family get-together: “No, I’m not eating whale meat … Because I don’t eat whale meat … If Dad and you want to eat whale then you do that and we’ll come later … Yes, tell him that.”The scenes that leave the most lasting impression, however, are those featuring a display of storytelling virtuosity.

Cesc Fàbregas, Héctor Bellerín and Gabriel Martinelli are among the young players he unearthed, and he has been instrumental in numerous other high-profile deals in the past two decades.But while there is surprise and considerable anger internally regarding the redundancies, there is also a certain sense the scouting department had been considered ripe for targeting. Arsenal’s hierarchy is perceived to have chosen a more agent-led approach to earmarking players over the past 18 months, with Kia Joorabchian’s influence coming under increasing scrutiny, and disquiet about their processes has been growing.Staff in other areas will also be affected. A joint statement from the managing director, Vinai Venkatesham, and head of football, Raúl Sanllehí, argued the proposal to cut jobs was necessary because Arsenal, whose largest shareholder is the American businessman Stan Kroenke, have suffered severe drops in commercial and matchday revenue as a result of Covid-19. They are the first Premier League club to announce major job losses.Venkatesham and Sanllehí promised the cost-cutting measures would allow Arsenal to keep investing in their squad. The club, who qualified for the Europa League after winning the FA Cup, are trying to convince Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to sign a new contract and hope to bring in Willian on a three-year deal when his Chelsea contract expires this month. Mesut Özil, their best-paid player, earns £350,000 a week.“Our main sources of income have all reduced significantly,” Venkatesham and Sanllehí said. “Revenue from broadcasters, matchday and commercial activities have all been hit severely and these impacts will continue into at least the forthcoming 2020-21 season.“We all hope there will be no ‘second wave’ but we also need to accept that is one of the many uncertainties ahead of us and plan accordingly. Over recent years we have consistently invested in additional staff to take the club forward but with the expected reduction of income in mind, it is now clear that we must reduce our costs further to ensure we are operating in a sustainable and responsible way, and to enable us to continue to invest in the team.“Our aim has been to protect the jobs and base salaries of our people for as long as we possibly can. Unfortunately, we have now come to the point where we are proposing 55 redundancies. We do not make these proposals lightly and have looked at every aspect of the club and our expenditure before reaching this point. We are now entering the required 30-day consultation period on these proposals.“We know this is upsetting and difficult for our dedicated staff and our focus is on managing this as sensitively as possible. These proposed changes are ultimately about ensuring we take this great football club forward, creating the right organisation for a post-Covid world, and ensuring we have the resources to return to competing effectively at the top of the game here and in Europe.”The club continued to pay staff in full during football’s lockdown instead of falling back on the furlough scheme. The club’s 14 executives agreed to a one-third salary cut for the next year.In a statement the Arsenal supporters’ trust criticised the cuts: “AST is sad to see the news that 55 members of staff are to be made redundant. Arsenal players have contributed to savings at the club by taking voluntary wage cuts. We had hoped these savings would be used to ensure all Arsenal staff are looked after in these difficult times.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f0689c3fe963e5d3da9f06c8682f233d2252fb5/0_547_3907_2346/master/3907.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=484c793acc1d6e63b7558ed82567df15","title":"casemiro zidane real madrid defensive midfielder manchester city","story":"Real Madrid’s indestructible defensive midfielder on how a lie helped him to the top, reading minds and facing Manchester CityThe day Carlinhos Casimiro went on trial at São Paulo, coaches gathered the hopefuls and asked what position they played. From the town of São José dos Campos 150km north-east, about 11 years old, he was one of maybe 300 kids of which 50 might make the cut – if they were lucky. He was also a striker, the most popular position, so when they were called he did what he had to do: he lied. A familiar cherubic smile creeps across his face and fills the screen as he remembers the moment almost two decades on.Fifty, 60, hands went up, maybe more, so his stayed down. Casemiro – the spelling changed years later when a shirt was printed wrong – didn’t much like those odds. Next, they asked who was a No 10, his other position. More hands went up. Again, his didn’t: it was still a lot of kids. When they asked for defensive midfielders, he remembers there being eight or nine. Seeing an opportunity, he raised his hand. “Me,” he said, “I am.”Turns out he was a defensive midfielder too, given time. Once he started, he didn’t stop and Casemiro may well be the world’s best now: the man his coach never rests or rotates – his apparent indestructability is a running joke – he is a title winner with a claim on being La Liga’s most important player this season. The Brazilian now travels to Manchester seeking to make progress towards his fifth European Cup. There’s something in that decision that defines him, the ability to read what is required.“Since I was a kid, I always thought and that day it came off,” he says.That’s thought. Not fought. Although there’s plenty of that. Casemiro is 6ft 1in, more than 13 stone, and plenty of footballers have felt the force of his physique. “I like to think,” he says, gently delivering his midfielder’s manifesto. “It’s not the legs, it’s the mind that’s in charge. You have to be strong, aggressive: I like challenges, contact. But you play with your head I always thought the key was thinking: being better positioned, seeing the move before it happens.”That day, he saw it. He had to. He once told Jorge Valdano that he fights for every ball as if it were “a plate of food”. Casemiro’s mother Magda, a cleaner, brought him, his sister Bianca and brother Lucas up alone. They were poor, there wasn’t always enough food and their tiny home was cramped, forcing him to spend nights with his grandparents or staying with teammates to sleep properly before playing. He recalls Nilton Moreira, who ran the club a six-mile walk away, paying fees he couldn’t: about €3. Being given boots and food. And how joining São Paulo meant finally getting fed properly. “Football,” he says, “is an escape valve, a way of achieving something in life.”“That’s especially true in Brazil where maybe we have more difficulties in education and culture,” he says, “but it’s not only there.” Casemiro recently watched Marcus Rashford’s campaign – “I really admire him, not just because he’s a great player but for how he used his position” – and links his own commitments at Save the Children Spain to a growing, welcome social conscience among footballers, insisting: “People suffering, ill, hungry, unclothed, doesn’t get seen raising awareness is the right path.Easy to say, but it has the ring of authenticity. Even among ultra-professionals he is different. “Casemiro does the work others won’t,” Sevilla’s Brazilian midfielder Fernando told El País. There’s the hyperbaric oxygen chamber, electric recovery boots, extreme abstinence, and morning sessions before training – teammate Rodrygo says Casemiro is always dragging him to the gym – together with constant videos and analysis: good decisions are not guesswork, nor are they all intuition.Rafa Benítez called him a “listener”. Julen Lopetegui describes him as “a joy to coach”, whose “secret is the desire to improve, his willingness to adapt”. It is born perhaps of an awareness that he may not be a natural virtuoso, some sense maybe that his place is at the service of others: he describes his role as “filling gaps, helping teammates”. It is manifest in his performances. When he arrived at Madrid, he didn’t look that good. He didn’t look this good, anyway.So, you’ll have spent recent days watching Manchester City then, Friday’s opponents in a tie Madrid begin 2-1 behind? Casemiro smiles, as if it’s a stupid question. “Man, since the day the league ended,” he says. “It’ll be a very, very hard game, but we go with hope. This shirt obliges you to win every game – even friendlies.”Last summer Casemiro cancelled a family trip to Disney World, instead heading to pre-season early because Madrid had lost 7-3 to Atlético in a pre-season game in New Jersey. There was duty to be done, teammates to defend. No wonder Lopetegui insists: “Centre-backs love him.” Everyone does. Zinedine Zidane calls him “fundamental”.The same Zidane who was Casemiro’s idol. “Even today I get a little nervous talking to him,” he says, smiling. “I tell him he doesn’t know what he meant for us, for me.” But he took a World Cup off Brazil? Casemiro laughs. “Yeah, I tell him that: you took ‘98 away but it didn’t change anything. Also, knowing him now, I can say he deserves it. He’s incredible: the humility, how he expresses football. He treats us with so much affection and love.”As Casemiro talks, it’s startling how quiet he is: soft, almost sweet. There’s something of that even in how he plays, a contradiction in him. Before every game he prays no one gets hurt – “yes, both teams” – but he committed more fouls than anyone last season and he doesn’t hide that being hard is part of his game. Yet there’s an angelic smile and something oddly undemonstrative. There’s no bid for attention, no hint of vindication. In fact, he retracts one line, concerned it risks sounding presumptuous. It doesn’t. A silent leader, he never seems to shout.“Well, there are moments,” he says, grinning.“It’s just my personality,” he continues. “I am very, very, very calm, even if my playing style is aggressive and everyone can see that. It’s my mum’s values: be polite, treat everyone the same. You can’t lose that, ever. You don’t need to shout to lead you can be quiet too. People might think I don’t say much but I talk to the younger players. Often, it’s better to speak alone, look someone in the eye, than before a big group. They understand better, and that’s what matters.”Another cliche collapses. And another: nor is he just a defensive midfielder, even as he seems reluctant to make a claim for more. Although Casemiro made more recoveries than anyone this season, only four players completed more passes and he scored five goals.“Maybe,” he concedes. “That’s Zizou. He’s very insistent he always, always says: ‘Case, you can do more: arrive from the second line, feed midfielders, bring the ball out cleanly.’ This year, maybe I’ve had more protagonism with the ball, but I still know my job: rob the ball, give it to my teammates. But Zizou is pesado, heavy going: always talking to me, wanting more. He says: ‘I’m not asking you to do something you can’t do I’m asking you to do something you can.’ He trusts me a lot.”Casemiro didn’t always think so. One day early in Zidane’s first spell, the midfielder knocked on the manager’s door. He hadn’t played yet and couldn’t understand it. Wasn’t Zidane supposed to be the manager that rated him, finally making him a fixture? What do I have to do, he asked: name it, I’ll do it. Relax, Zidane told him: you’ll start playing soon and when you do you won’t stop. And that’s exactly what happened."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b01ab0ac054376a957851283b9af57e699dfc4a0/130_100_2688_1613/master/2688.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e93aa132f63c41b7ee25376c3a988f64","title":"manchester united lask europa league last 16 second leg match report","story":"Manchester United stuttered while keeping Lask at arm’s length in a last-16 second leg that was the very definition of a non-event given their five-goal advantage from the first game. They will not care, though, as thoughts for Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s side turn to Monday’s quarter-final against Copenhagen, the Danish champions, in Cologne.That is a straight knockout tie, as will be the remainder of the Europa League competition United won three years ago in Stockholm. For the manager and his emerging sideit now represents a golden chance to claim their first trophy and that will be the focus when they arrive in Germany.A talking point was the substitution of Jesse Lingard after 63 minutes, a little after he equalised for United – and the player later admitted unhappiness. “I felt like I could score more today but obviously it’s the manager’s decision and I stand by that,” he said. This was put to Solskjær. “He has to stand by the manager whatever decision he makes. I’d be disappointed if he was happy,” he said.There were nine changes from the side who clinched third place in the Premier League at Leicester but only two from the 5-0 win at Lask in March. Solskjær said this was the reason for United’s disjointed play. “It is that sharpness you lack when you don’t play regularly, some haven’t played since lockdown. For me it was a good exercise, it’s job done, minutes under the belt and on to Cologne,” he said.Timothy Fosu-Mensah, whose combination with Juan Mata along the right showed flashes of promise, hit one ball straight out for a goal-kick that was United in microcosm for the opening hour or so as they sleepwalked: a Peter Michorl free-kick smacked at Scott McTominay was as much a wake-up call as some clumsy Harry Maguire defending – an air-header – moments before in his area.The captain’s aerial prowess in the opposition box also faltered when Mata dropped a rare United corner on to his head – he failed to force Alexander Schlager into action in Lask’s goal. Soporific was a fair adjective to characterise the game as the interval neared. That the Austrian side had not made United pay showed how toothless they were in attack. For a team assembled on a budget akin to a League Two side it was understandable.A Fosu-Mensah burst behind the Lask defence just before half-time was his side’s best moment, though his cross only found Schlager’s gloves. As the second half began, United had their first attempt on target though Odion Ighalo’s shot again found only Schlager.There was surprise when Lask did, at last, score. This came after Fosu-Mensah scrambled Reinhold Ranftl’s cross out for a corner. Fosu-Mensah again cleared but only to Philipp Wiesinger, who fired a 20-yard bullet past Sergio Romero.Stung, United equalised instantly. A Juan Mata pass sprung Lingard, who after taking a relative age finished with the aid of a Philipp Wiesinger boot as the No 6’s attempt to help Schlager misfired badly. Solskjær then took off Lingard and Fred for Andreas Pereira and Paul Pogba.Lask were 6-1 behind on aggregate and were left with 25 minutes chasing a United side finally on top.Tahith Chong was given the last 20 minutes by the manager, the 20-year-old replacing Brandon Williams in a first outing at left-back. As might be expected a contest that had never truly started petered out – a definition true, too, of the United career of Alexis Sánchez, who is to join Internazionale imminently on a free transfer.By the end the 18-year-old Teden Mengi had made his bow in United colours and a fellow substitute, Anthony Martial, scored his 23rd goal of the season to clinch victory."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/929ec0d3305be22574c3cd26e5c9cee0d820f84a/0_0_4999_3000/master/4999.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da51e6ac4c389858dc3282db595f1406","title":"the teacher the baker and the snack box maker meet the small firms going online for the first time","story":"Since lockdown, websites have become the main source of income for many small businesses and microbusinesses. Over the next month, we’ll follow two company owners, and the mentors we’ve paired them with, as they find their feet in the digital worldDespite never selling online in the 10 years since he cofounded his artisan bakery Bread Source, Steven Winter was left with little choice when the coronavirus lockdown was announced in March. As restaurants closed, the wholesale arm of the business disappeared, and he had no idea what was going to happen to his four shops or his market stalls across Norwich and Aylsham. “At that point there was no furlough scheme. All I was trying to do was pay my 30 staff,” Winter says.The response to the new website, which launched at the start of April, blew him away. “In the first week or two, we were up to 200 orders a day,” he says. “We sold 10,000 loaves, 25,000 pastries and 10 tonnes of flour online over two months.” The team expanded their range to include other staples such as eggs, milk, butter and coffee, which were dropped off to customers across Norfolk using the bakery’s two delivery vans.Winter was also mindful of making good food available to his hospitality colleagues, many of whom had lost their jobs. He introduced a National Loaf scheme, inspired by a product conceived by the Federation of Bakers in 1942 to keep the country fed during the second world war. Today, Winter is selling the nutritious loaf for £1 and he is now hoping to expand the initiative nationwide.Sakshi Anand, senior director for GoDaddy UK, says Covid-19 has provided many small businesses with the impetus to get online, driving what’s becoming known as a second digital revolution: “One of the biggest barriers is people think it’s really complicated”, she says about launching a website. “Most microbusiness owners run finance, the technology and marketing, they’re doing everything. But once you start seeing sales coming or you see other businesses who are thriving from it, you realise it’s something you definitely need. And with GoDaddy’s drag-and-drop marketing tools, you can have a fully functioning website online in 24-48 hours.”For Winter, it’s been transformational – the online demand covered the sales the bakery would have made if it had been business as usual. He’s keen to make the business’s digital channel a permanent feature, and will be using this opportunity to develop an email marketing campaign for the 5,000 customers on the bakery’s database, experiment with pay-per-click (PPC) advertising, and explore widening its audience beyond the local market. He’ll be supported by Rosie Mills-Smith, Bread Source’s marketing lead, GoDaddy Guides – a 6,000-strong team providing bespoke support to small business owners – and a suite of digital tools. He and Mills-Smith are mindful of the need to scale their new retail channel in a sustainable way. “I think probably the hardest thing has been going from dealing with three or four enquiries a day on social media and via email, to literally thousands more,” says Mills-Smith.In Bath, yoga and meditation teacher Lucy Stone has been inspired to launch her new website because of the popularity of her free guided meditation videos, posted on Facebook during the pandemic. “When I started there were 10 or 15 people and then each video was getting 1,000 views. It was amazing,” she says.She’ll now work with GoDaddy’s Guides to design and launch a dedicated website for Meditation Rocks. She plans to provide guided meditation for children and adults via free videos, and to offer more in-depth courses, for which she’ll charge. She’s also open to the idea of launching a blog and adding an online shop to sell merchandise.One of the challenges she knows she’ll face in growing her brand is attracting new customers, and dealing with the image of meditation. “Yoga has come a long way in the past 15 years or so, it’s become very cool,” she says. “Meditation is still playing catch up … there’s a lot of misunderstanding about what it is and what it does.”But she won’t be alone as she makes plans for Meditation Rocks. To help Stone and, indeed, Steven Winter at Bread Source to nail their digital futures, we’ve paired each of them with a mentor who can offer expert advice.Stone will be supported by yoga and meditation teacher Nadia Narain. With a client list that has included Rachel Weisz, Kate Moss, Jools Oliver, and the Arsenal football team, Narain has been teaching yoga since 1996. She was one of Triyoga’s original teachers when the studio opened in London in 2000. She is also an author, has a range of DVDs, developed her own perfume and aromatherapy candles, and recently launched an online course promoting self care during lockdown, with her sister Katia.“I always think of yoga as my love,” says Narain. “And I’m so lucky that I get to do it.” She enjoys mentoring other teachers and says monetisation is something a lot of people ask her about.The mentor paired with Winter is Anthony Fletcher, chief executive of Graze. He has led the healthy-snacks company for the past seven years, as it expanded into markets such as the US, Ireland and the Netherlands, and into UK retail outlets including Boots, WH Smith and Waitrose.“The wonderful thing about digital is it’s intuitive,” he adds. “So go and spend £20 on marketing. If it works well, spend £40 the next day. If nothing resonates, maybe you change things around and try something a bit different ... The obvious advantage that small businesses have is agility, and the ability to set off in a new direction. But I think we’ve crossed the Rubicon with Covid-19. People want to buy local, people want to know who’s behind the business. They’ll back you if they buy into who you are and what you’re trying to do.”GoDaddy launched the #OpenWeStand initiative offering a number of free tools, widgets, resources and blogposts at OpenWeStand.org to help small businesses keep their digital doors open while their physical doors are closed.

Here, three businesses share what they’ve discoveredGiven the way that we shop is changing, it has never been more important for retailers to get online. In a survey for the website builder GoDaddy, a fifth of micro businesses said they had gone online for the first time during lockdown and nearly half that their use of digital and social media tools had increased.For some, e-commerce has always been part of the plan. The artisan hot chocolate company Knoops opened its first store in Rye, East Sussex, in 2013, and went on to open a London store in February this year, with more planned. But head of marketing Anna Chapman says that having an online presence was always a key part of the company’s strategy. “Chocolate has a broad appeal, and we wanted to be able to reach people in their homes, especially those who didn’t live near our stores,” she says.\u0026nbspThe company’s website centres around its hot chocolate maker, the Knoopifier, with owners getting access to online subscriptions for pouches of “Knoopifier” chocolate buttons delivered to their home. The website has always been an important part of the company’s strategy, but Chapman says that lockdown emphasised this further.\u0026nbsp“While our doors were closed, it was obviously the only way we could take any revenue at all, and we were able to focus our efforts entirely on our website and social media channels,” she says. “This importance will remain – the majority of retailers now accept that an omnichannel approach is vital. Our current situation has been an extremely stark reminder of its importance.”For other SMEs, while a website may have been part of their business, using it to sell is a recent addition. Rob Wilson, “chief toaster” at Toast Ale, a craft beer brewer that uses bread which would otherwise be wasted, says that despite having an online presence, it wasn’t really part of the business’s strategy.\u0026nbspBut when those sales channels were cut off during lockdown, Toast Ale, which donates its profits to sustainability charities, was forced to shift its sales online. “We started to rebuild our website and have far more focus on a more functional online shop. It has massively transformed our business and helped us survive – it’s become a huge opportunity to reach a whole new audience. We just hadn’t thought about it as a sales channel and now we’ve suddenly realised its potential.”Similarly, Chris Fryer, founder of the vegan pie business Magpye, hadn’t really explored e-commerce, instead selling pies from his converted horse box at events and supplying local pubs in the north of England. “We had a full calendar of events booked. We were supplying pubs with pies and had just expanded, dropping off to four or five pubs twice a week. Then our income stopped – it was a cliff-edge.”\u0026nbspLike Wilson at Toast Ale, Fryer realised quickly that he would have to shift to e-commerce and has been similarly amazed by the effect it has had.\u0026nbsp“At the moment we’re just doing local deliveries across the north east but we’re looking into expanding. Our plan potentially is to sell our horsebox and become a web-based pie shop,” he says.When it comes to setting up an e-commerce site, there is an increasingly wide range of tools available to business owners from a range of sources. They include web hosting companies such as GoDaddy, which has created Open We Stand – a portal of resources for small businesses during lockdown. Fryer says that while he has some experience building websites, it was quicker and easier to turn to readymade tools with GoDaddy.“I had the domain registered with GoDaddy but had done nothing with it. Once it became clear we would have to move online I started looking into it. I could have gone down the route of coding it from scratch but it would have taken a week or two, especially things like payment options. With the GoDaddy tools it took half a day, then I spent a day or two testing and it was ready to go. Although we didn’t use the option, I knew GoDaddy would build the site for you for free if you needed,” he says.“They do a free three-month trial, so there’s really nothing to lose by having a go. The admin side, monitoring it, doing the orders is all quite simple, so even if you’ve got no skills whatsoever I don’t think many people would struggle with it.”At Toast Ale, the switch was led by COO Louisa Ziane, who has experience of managing websites. Wilson is adamant that the work has paid off, with e-commerce proving an “amazing opportunity”, not just now but, he believes, in the future. “I would say that at current rates we’re looking at probably half a million pounds of revenue coming from our online shop. Last year as a business we took around £1m in total, so that shows that it is very quickly becoming a significant part of our business.”GoDaddy launched the #OpenWeStand initiative offering a number of free tools, widgets, resources and blogposts at OpenWeStand.org to help small businesses keep their digital doors open while their physical doors are closed.

Here, three stars of social share what they’ve learnedMost businesses these days will have some form of social media presence, but many may not be making the most of the opportunities it provides. Not only does it open up a huge potential customer base – half the world’s population is now on social media – it also gives companies the perfect opportunity to build and retain loyalty among existing customers.Like all aspects of technology, social media is constantly evolving. So while a small business may have set up a Facebook or a Twitter account a few years back and thought that was a case of “job done”, new social media platforms such as TiKTok have been developed since then, while Instagram and YouTube have become vital parts of a holistic social media ecosystem.\u0026nbspBeyond the platforms themselves, trends have also changed in terms of what users want, how they interact with brands and what’s important to them. Customers have now become fans, emotional ties to brands are a thing and thought-leadership can make you an influencer. Content is still king, and shareability is vital.\u0026nbspBut as well as all this modern stuff – the basics are still important too.\u0026nbsp“On the high street you wouldn’t have a shopfront with a broken window, peeling paint, rubbish everywhere and goods randomly thrown on displays, and expect to thrive,” says PR and social media expert Mike Crutchley.As someone who helps businesses improve and overhaul their social media strategies, he says first impressions count.\u0026nbsp“Social media channels must be up to date with everything from posts to contact details and opening hours,” he says. “High-quality images and videos, as well as good grammar and spelling are as vital as creating engaging posts.”The tools that allow businesses to make this happen have never been more accessible, and there is now an opportunity to try some of them out free of charge. Customers of the website builder GoDaddy are currently receiving a complimentary 90-day premium subscription to the mobile app Over, which gives them access to simple templates for creating sleek and effective social media content.Sometimes the things that work best on social media are the simplest. You can have all the metrics and dashboards in the world, but if people don’t engage and share your original posts then you’re missing a huge potential source of customers.\u0026nbspWhen Dutch-born Londoner Annemarie Plas saw people in countries throughout Europe clapping for their healthcare workers she was inspired to help set up something similar in her adopted home, and so created clapforourcarers with GoDaddy.Scaling up quickly could well have proved a challenge, but with the astute use of social media things have gone from strength to strength.\u0026nbsp“I just put together a small image and posted it on my socials such as Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter, and sent it to all my UK friends by WhatsApp, I also made a small website and an Insta page,” says Plas.\u0026nbspHer efforts to spread the word were given a huge boost when her campaign was picked up by influencers such as the Beckhams and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, who shared it to their followers.\u0026nbspThe first clap happened on Thursday 26 March at 8pm and became a weekly event, being covered by the national media and circulated widely on social media too, right up to the final clap on 28 May.Although Plas has a background working for media agencies, she had neither the time nor staff support that other organisations might be able to draw upon. So she decided to keep things simple and made shareability a big part of her strategy.\u0026nbsp“I understood the importance of having simple and engaging messaging. I used a hashtag and made the image easy to share on any social channels.”Her simple and consistent messaging has resulted in the #clapforourcarers hashtag being shared more than 139,000 times on Instagram alone.\u0026nbsp“Some influencers get a bad reputation,” says Masha Zvereva, founder of Coding Blonde. She set up her blog back in 2015, when she was trying to learn some coding skills to make her more employable. She originally registered it with GoDaddy, which she then also used as a hosting provider.Through that blog, as well as Instagram and YouTube, Zvereva has amassed a loyal following and is now regarded as an influencer in the field of women in tech, entrepreneurship and personal growth.\u0026nbsp“Influencers can be perceived as fake, superficial, salesy etc, but what people don’t see is the hard work that goes behind being able to make a living off of this business model and growing your business,” she says.Quality content is paramount according to Zvereva. Whether you’re filming a video for YouTube or writing a thought leadership piece, it has to add value beyond simply advertising your skills to the wider world.\u0026nbsp“Anyone can become an influencer if they want to, but I’d recommend approaching it from the standpoint of adding value to an audience,” she says.\u0026nbsp“What’s the purpose behind your blog? How will you be impacting people’s lives and who is your target audience? And finally, why should it be you?”Many people might still associate social media in a business context purely with selling, but its importance when it comes to building a brand can’t be overstated.\u0026nbspThis is something Zaffrin and Brian O’Sullivan, co-founders of the vegan skincare company Five Dot Botanics set out to do well before their company launched.Establishing it on Instagram even before they had products to sell, they were able to develop a loyal audience.\u0026nbsp“Social media has allowed small brands like mine to build a brand. Historically it would not have been possible to launch a beauty brand without millions of pounds to acquire customers through marketing,” says Zaffrin.\u0026nbspBefore setting up those social channels though, their first move was to register a domain name and get a URL through GoDaddy. Then it was time to get the ball rolling with social media.\u0026nbspThe stories the O’Sullivans shared weren’t all about success, but about the challenges they were facing. This honesty helped create a situation where people were rooting for them. The couple were also able to get 600 people signed up to their newsletter email list so there was already an eager customer base waiting for when the products were ready.Once the social channels were up and running, the O’Sullivans set up an internet landing page using GoDaddy’s services – and they were in business.Social continues to be at the heart of their marketing. As well as using Instagram for brand-building, Zaffrin posts to Pinterest and Facebook, although she says the latter works best for business if you’re willing to put money behind it – paying for targeted ads, for example. Otherwise the other platforms can be effective without budget, simply by skilful use. Zaffrin uses LinkedIn to raise her business profile and publish articles, and is curious about TikTok, saying it is “one to watch”.\u0026nbsp“Our audience are our fans,” she says. “They root for our success, and our customers on social tell us every day what they think and what they want. We are constantly listening to them, whether they’re letting us know how they are using our products or coming up with ideas for new ones.”GoDaddy launched the #OpenWeStand initiative offering a number of free tools, widgets, resources and blogposts at OpenWeStand.org to help small businesses keep their digital doors open while their physical doors are closed.

The three were cleared of murder.Lissie Harper intends to call for a change in the law in high-profile meetings with the prime minister, Boris Johnson, and the home secretary, Priti Patel.She said: “I pledge to my late husband to never stop until I have made the difference that this country clearly needs. I vow to stand strong and firm with so many other honourable people in our country to make the changes that we clearly know to be justified.“I hope that by creating a new ‘Andrew’s Law’ – that sees any person who commits a crime that results in the death of an emergency worker being jailed for life – that those that have to go through what I have been through in the future get the justice that they rightly deserve.”PC Harper’s mother, Debbie Adlam, launched a similar campaign on Wednesday for a “mandatory” 20-year minimum prison term for killers of police officers.She said: “We’ve come to realise that, with the outcome of the trial as it stands, something needs to change.“He is worth much more than this and we’ve been thinking for some time that something needs to be brought in to protect our police officers.”The Thames Valley officer became entangled in a tow rope attached to his killers’ Seat Toledo and was dragged at “breakneck” speed for more than a mile along country lanes before he was dislodged, having sustained horrific injuries.The three teenagers claimed the incident was a “freak event” that none of them could have planned or foreseen. The prosecution said the defendants must have been aware Harper, who was over 6ft and weighed 14 stone, was being dragged to his death.Lissie Harper previously condemned the murder acquittals and later wrote to Boris Johnson to ask for a retrial."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7affb76762bb956b25436daf1fd3e02cdb4f4c1/0_379_5906_3546/master/5906.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=85dd147973c8758f9999716db637227c","title":"how the world is coping with coronavirus six months on","story":"From Portugal to Pakistan, the ’s international correspondent Michael Safi looks at the different ways countries have been affected by the virus and the impact that is having on the lives of people thereIt’s six months since Covid-19 was registered as an urgent threat, and although the panic at the scenarios that filled imaginations in those first weeks – of millions of imminent deaths, medical systems buckling and food supplies running scarce – has largely abated, the virus has not.

He said: “Now our focus must turn to earning the trust of people looking for a positive and credible alternative for Scotland, and who want a fresh start for our country. I hope you’ll join us.”One of the few Scottish Tory MPs to hold his seat in the Scottish National party revival in last December’s general election, Ross will work in tandem with Ruth Davidson, the former leader, who will act as his de facto deputy at Holyrood.In an unorthodox move, Davidson will return from the backbenches to face Sturgeon at first minister’s questions until the Scottish parliament is dissolved next March before the Holyrood elections in May.Davidson is stepping down as MSP for Edinburgh Central in March before joining the Lords as a life peer. In a sign of the Tories’ anxieties about Sturgeon’s soaring popularity during the coronavirus pandemic, Davidson has deferred her appointment to the Lords until then.Ross and Davidson are expected to try to reassert the centrist, one-nation Tory policies Davidson championed before she resigned suddenly in August last year, partly in protest at Boris Johnson’s election as UK leader.In a joint article for the Scottish Daily Mail on Tuesday, which made no mention of Brexit or the prime minister, the pair said their goals were defending the UK, attacking Sturgeon’s domestic record and promoting economic recovery.“For us, unionism is not an end but a means – to a fairer and more prosperous Scotland,” they said.Ross and Davidson said their alliance was based “on a genuine belief, born out of experience, that SNP rule isn’t as inevitable as some people feel. We abhor the sense of defeatism that has crept into some quarters and we want to show the fight is there for the winning.”The SNP and other opposition parties are likely to attack Ross and Davidson over their unusual parliamentary roles, and Ross’s continuing part-time job as an assistant football referee. Although he expects to win a Holyrood seat in May, Ross is currently an MP, with no direct say over devolved policymaking, and Davidson has announced she is quitting Holyrood.The SNP signalled its intention to attack Ross’s politics on Tuesday by posting a tweet accusing him of having “a long history of racist views” because he called for tougher enforcement action against Travellers in his constituency in an online interview in 2017.Accused of defamation by senior Tories, the SNP later deleted the tweet Ross had apologised for that remark and withdrawn it in a BBC interview on Monday, saying his stance then was “wrong”.Party sources believe Ross will keep the party’s Holyrood frontbench in their current posts, including his official deputy, Annie Wells, a Glasgow MSP."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89c1388fee73287181c612679ec321a6c83cc205/0_117_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3acc1562de192a635c71ab7b6a8de197","title":"just another very quiet day in the home office of dedicated contact tracers","story":"After people working for England’s test-and-trace system told the  they were making a handful of calls a month, John Crace imagines the secret diary of a contact tracer29th May: An email arrives. “Dear Sir, I am delighted to offer you a job as one of the UK’s ‘world-beating’ test and tracers.

Together we can beat the coronavirus and bring the country back to normal by Christmas. Yours, Boris Johnson and Baroness Dido Harding.”7th June: Another email arrives. “Congratulations on completing your training.” I reply that I have yet to receive any training. Hear nothing back.9th June: I email the head of training at Serco to remind her of my existence and to say that I am still awaiting instructions. This time she replies promptly to say that the training was targeted to help workers get used to long periods of doing nothing and that I need to be focused a great deal more on being patient. The less we do, the more effective we are being.23rd June: I have yet to make a single test-and-trace call, despite having sat at home with my phone at the ready and the TV switched off for the past 14 days. I ring my local Serco HQ to check that they actually have the right number for me. They do so, and confirm that I am in the weekly draw for the most productive member of staff over the course of the last week.1st July: Sod’s law. Have just invited some friends over for a barbecue, when I get an alert from the test-and-trace centre to call someone. Go indoors to prepare to give the bad news they will have to self-isolate for 14 days only to find it is a non-existent number.4th July: I’m now on a roll. I get a second alert and call the number, which goes straight to voicemail. I don’t let this go as I don’t want to be responsible for a super-spreader slipping through the net. Eventually a man picks up and starts yelling at me. I am the 12th person to have contacted him over the past few days and would I please stop interrupting his quarantine?10th July: The call centre emails to ask me what my favourite flower is. I give this a few minutes’ thought and reply. “On balance, I think I like bluebells the best. Why do you want to know?” An hour or so later I get an out-of-office reply saying “To be honest, we don’t give a shit one way or another what your favourite flower is. It was just a way of finding out how many of you were still monitoring your phones.”18th July: I have seldom felt so desperate. I submit my own number to the test-and-trace database just so that someone will ring me to tell me to self-isolate. Even then no one calls. I ring the Serco human resources department. After half an hour the line goes to voicemail. “If you are a test and tracer who feels their life might be entirely futile, please try calling the self-help group Test and Trace Anonymous.”19th July: “My name’s Simon and I’m a test and tracer,” I say. “Join the club,” says a woman. “Try not to worry too much. There are thousands of us who feel the same. Some people have been doing this for months without talking to anyone. Why don’t you sign up for one of our daily quizzes?” Finally I feel like I am getting somewhere.21st July: Totally psyched for the quiz. “Question 1: Name the woman on the Jockey Club board who was responsible for giving this year’s Cheltenham festival the go-ahead, thereby risking the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.” Easy. Dido Harding. “Question 2: Name the former chief executive of TalkTalk whose utter ignorance of the company was famously described as a lesson to all.” That would be Dido again. I’m beginning to think there may be a theme here.24th July: Am given a number to ring by one of the other test and tracers. Big mistake. I get through to a Liam Fox who thinks I am from the World Trade Organization. “I’m sorry about all my hacked emails on the US-UK trade talks,” he says. “But am I still in line to be director of the WTO?” I suggest that’s unlikely. But on the upside I tell him he doesn’t have to self-isolate for 14 days. He starts blubbing and I put the phone down gently. 26th July: I finally get to make a call that isn’t a fake number, doesn’t go to voicemail and hasn’t been rung countless times before. As a result, I am given a €50 voucher to spend anywhere in Spain over the course of the next month.27th July: All non-essential travel to Spain is stopped and a 14-day quarantine imposed on travellers returning from the country. Try to flog my voucher to friends stuck in Spain for €20. Get told to bugger off.1st August: Receive a message from Boris Johnson saying all those working from home should now be working in the office. Worried, I ring the No 10 switchboard to let them know I don’t have an office. A bored receptionist says not to worry as Boris is working from his country house for the rest of the summer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/318dfe95b31fbb92944d775ead52162210c35d73/0_50_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=85d8aab3538e10e156152959d196af73","title":"tell us how have uk childrens services been during the pandemic","story":"There have been fears around the wellbeing of vulnerable children throughout the coronavirus lockdown across the countryThere have been fears around the wellbeing of vulnerable children throughout the coronavirus lockdown in the UK, with schools, GPs and other settings where they might be referred to other services largely closed.The mental health charity Mind has said that referrals to children’s mental health services have gone down significantly during lockdown, meaning treatment providers could face a significant backlog.

Two ripping short balls that pushed him back in his crease and a zippy full one that knocked his off-stump right out of the ground. So, around a quarter-to-12 Chris Woa … and how about that opening spell from Stuart Broad? Six overs, two maidens, 10 runs, he was starting up right where he left off after he won man-of-the-series against West Indies.Anyway, around a quarter-to-12 Chris Woakes came on … and how about Jimmy Anderson? Is it just me or is his bowling beginning to lose a little of its edge? But, yes, right around a quarter-to-12, Chris Woakes came on to bowl.Woakes isn’t a short man but he is the sort who is ever so easy to overlook. In fact, if Ben Stokes was fit to bowl, you guess England’s selectors may well have done exactly that when they sat down to pick the team for this match.If Stokes was fit, they would not need a fourth quick, so they could bring Zak Crawley back in the middle order. The alternative to dropping Woakes, after all, would have been to stand down one of Anderson or Broad, England’s two most prolific bowlers, or Archer, one of their very fastest. It’s Woakes’s lot to be stuck, at the age of 31, playing fourth violin behind three virtuosos. Of course, being the man he is, he does it uncomplainingly.Well, at quarter-to-12, Woakes was wonderful. He started with an outswinger that whizzed past Abid’s outside edge, followed it with a string of deliveries more that wobbled this way and that way, so that the batsmen were poking and prodding and grasping after them, scrabbling around for messy little singles.In his fifth over, he got Azhar Ali for a duck with a delivery that slid in towards his pads and hit him flush in front of middle stump. Azhar reviewed it, possibly because he thought he had got an edge on it, or perhaps just because he was so baffled by what had happened he wanted to watch it back on the big screen.That brought in the princely Babar Azam, sixth in the ICC’s Test batting rankings, maybe the best, certainly the most handsome, batsman on either side. Woakes’s first ball to him came beetling in along that same line towards off stump but straightened after it hit the pitch and whizzed away from him again.Babar got himself in such a terrible tangle trying to play it he ended up square on and the ball only just missed his outside edge.It was a brute of a delivery, in the middle of a hell of a spell, the sort that, if Anderson had bowled it, would have everyone purring about his wizardly skills and the way he moves the ball at will.But it wasn’t Anderson. It was Woakes. The old joke goes that Ringo Starr wasn’t even the best drummer in the Beatles and Woakes maybe isn’t the best seam bowler in this England team but he is still a mighty fine one. In fact his record in England is better than the three men he is playing with here. He has taken 82 wickets in 22 Tests, at an average of only 22, and a strike rate of 43.Among the English quicks who have taken at least 50 Test wickets in this country, only three have got them cheaper – Sydney Barnes, Fred Trueman and Alec Bedser – and only one has taken them more frequently, Barnes again.He has already taken 12 wickets at 16 this summer. As Broad said at the end of the third Test against West Indies, Woakes is bowling beautifully: “He is in the best rhythm of his life.”It was only fair of Broad to make a point of saying it, since he had just stolen all the headlines from him again. Woakes took his fourth fifth-wicket haul earlier that same day but then Broad’s four wickets had included his 500th, and, well, Woakes ended up a way down the page among the also-rans. It is Broad’s theory that Woakes has added “niggle” to his bowling lately, that “there’s a bit more aggression there” than there has been in previous years.Woakes is, famously, such an affable and unassuming bloke that it is not immediately obvious exactly what form that “niggle” might take. Maybe he is developing a fine line in passive-aggressive chat. Possibly his “good morning” greetings are a little more curt, his “good shots” a little less frequent.In the longer term, what he really needs to do is learn to bowl overseas, in conditions where his particular brand of fast-medium seam and swing has turned out to be a pretty blunt weapon. Away from England, he has taken 25 wickets in 14 Tests, at an average of 52. He is not the first English bowler to have that problem, there is another right alongside him in this side. Woakes says he has figured it out now, just like Anderson did, if he is right about that he may yet end up leading this attack after all and winning a few headlines of his own before he retires, too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e69c4e2973668d859082f6324edc458ba7c19365/0_206_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4a687f6b21dbdfd50b93ecd957a64a81","title":"andrew scott delays performances in old vic play for second time","story":"Live-streamed production of Three Kings rescheduled for second time as actor is ‘still not well enough to perform’A live-streamed theatre production starring Andrew Scott has been delayed for a second time due to the Sherlock and Fleabag actor undergoing minor surgery.Scott had been due to perform Three Kings, a new hour-long monologue written for him by Stephen Beresford, at the Old Vic theatre in London from 29 July to 1 August. The Old Vic postponed that run of five performances, saying that Scott was in hospital but that the visit wasn’t serious or related to coronavirus and that he was expected to make a speedy recovery.The dates were rescheduled for 7-8 August but on Wednesday the theatre tweeted that Scott was still not well enough to perform and, in order to “give him the time he needs to fully rest and recover”, the performances will be once more rescheduled. The theatre’s statement continued: “Together with Andrew we want to send our heartfelt thanks to all for your well wishes and for being so incredibly supportive and understanding at this really difficult time.” New dates will be confirmed soon.One of the most eagerly anticipated live theatre events during lockdown, Three Kings is part of the Old Vic’s In Camera series, which launched last month with a production of Lungs, starring Matt Smith and Claire Foy. It was performed in an empty theatre and streamed on Zoom.Three Kings is billed as exploring “fathers and sons, the gifts and burdens of inheritance, and the unfathomable puzzle of human relationships”. It will be staged by Matthew Warchus, the artistic director of the Old Vic.This week, Scott’s performance in Black Mirror earned him an Emmy nomination for outstanding guest actor in a drama series."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/159d0726864307e4e5caff4bd6d4730361235233/0_953_3388_2032/master/3388.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1a3af6e98eeffdde547c109b1622df9b","title":"hamlet branagh rylance rickman in pictures tristram kenton","story":"In a new series, we delve into  photographer Tristram Kenton’s amazing archive of stage photos.

Among her favourite guests are the Swiss man who she nicknamed “James Bond” for his flash white sports car (which looked a tad out of place in the hamlet of Specchia Gallone, especially alongside her Mini ) the interior designer from London the couple who asked her to witness their wedding and the six lesbians from Canada who she hung out with by the pool, chatting and laughing.“Those women were such great fun,” said the 61-year-old. “The most beautiful thing about this job is getting to know people.”But this year, owing to the coronavirus pandemic, there are few people to chat to.“It is a strange year, and sad to see something that was so lively now so quiet. We were like one big family,” said Gilda, whose two daughters help her manage the business when they can.“We were fully booked for the season by January: many people were returning guests, but then they cancelled their bookings because of the pandemic,” said Gilda.For Palazzo Siena, as with other hotels that have reopened, trying to stay afloat has meant reducing prices. The season began late because of the national lockdown. The pricing strategy prompted a trickle of bookings in June and July August is looking more promising. Another selling point is that Salento and the wider Puglia region have been fairly unscathed by Covid-19, with fewer than 5,000 confirmed cases since the onset of the pandemic in February.The majority of Palazzo Siena’s guests usually come from the UK, the US and Canada. This year, the foreign visitors who have made the journey so far are from neighbouring countries. Austrian Sylvia Fragapane, her Italian husband Fabio, and their daughter drove 14 hours from their home in Switzerland and booked a three-night stay at Palazzo Siena. It was the family’s first visit to Puglia.“We chose Puglia because there are few Covid cases,” Sylvia said. “And we were careful when picking a place to stay – we could tell Palazzo Siena was a beautiful home to stay in, nice and spacious and unlike normal hotels.”Palazzo Siena is somewhat of an oasis amid a pandemic. The building, once owned by a family of rich merchants, had lain abandoned since the 1960s before Gilda caught wind that it was for sale during a conversation with a fellow diner at a pizzeria in nearby Otranto, while on holiday there in 2010.“It was destroyed, but as soon as the door opened it hit me how beautiful it was,” said Gilda, who had never undertaken a project of its kind before. After a brief tussle with another keen buyer, the property was hers.It took a year to restore. Customers soon started to arrive, mostly by word of mouth. The nine airy rooms are impeccably furnished, retaining the building’s original features. Guests fall asleep to nothing but the sound of chirping crickets and wake up to the sound of church bells. Centuries-old vines cover the ancient colonnade in the vast garden, which is home to fig, walnut and almond trees. The vegetable patch provides ingredients Gilda uses in local dishes, including pumpkin flower risotto with burrata, the mozzarella-like cheese from Puglia, and courgette tart. While there’s no restaurant as such, meals can be ordered in advance and served either on the terrace or in the dining room.The pool – which is cleaned by the same person who cleans the pool at the holiday home of actress Helen Mirren in Miggiano, about a half hour’s drive away – offers respite from the afternoon heat.“This is a holiday for people who want peace and to relax,” said Gilda. “Many wake up early, to swim and do some exercise. There are lots of quiet spots to read. There are walking and bike trails nearby. People don’t have to think about dressing up or putting on makeup. For me, this is the real Salento – simplicity.”Specchia Gallone is a neat hamlet of fewer than 500 people, with little entertainment beyond a bar and restaurant. It can be reached by car from Brindisi airport, or by once-daily bus from the baroque city of Lecce, from where you can catch a train to the nearby town of Poggiardo. However, a car is essential for exploring the pristine beaches and remote villages of the Salento.The closest beach to Specchia Gallone, a 20-minute drive away, is Porto Badisco, an inlet with a small sandy beach and rocks from which local youth plunge into the clear water. As legend would have it, the Trojan hero Aeneas made a stopover in Porto Badisco after his escape from Troy.On a recent Thursday morning, the beach was packed, with little social distancing in evidence.“Fewer people are coming but it’s still impossible to find a parking space,” said resident Gino Castaldi.The beachgoers are mostly locals and other Italians on holiday.“I usually like to travel abroad, but this year I’m discovering Italy more,” said Claudio Ressa, an IT specialist from Milan, in Lombardy, the region worst-affected by coronavirus. “The situation in Milan was so heavy. But here I feel relaxed, as there are not so many cases. The people are also welcoming.”More breathing space can be found in Alimini, north of Otranto, where a long stretch of beach is backed by sand dunes and pinewoods. Most of the beach is taken up by private establishments, with lounger and umbrella rental for about €8 a day. The beach businesses must follow strict coronavirus rules, including maintaining adequate space between loungers and disinfecting the beds between customers.Salento’s economy was once fuelled by the tobacco industry, but all that remains today of that era are abandoned factories. Olive oil is a major product, but growers have been badly affected by another infectious disease – Xylella fastidiosa – a plant pathogen that has killed tens of thousands of olive trees in recent years. That leaves the region heavily dependent on tourism. Villages would usually draw visitors through cultural events and sagre, food festivals showcasing local specialities. But these have mostly been cancelledthis year.“It all went up in smoke,” said Remo De Pascalis, a bakery owner in Giuggianello, close to Specchia Gallone. “All the women usually collaborate to make traditional dishes. Sagre bring small communities together but also attract plenty of tourists – they are the event of the year.”Restaurants, especially those with ample outdoor space, are managing to hold up.“We lost April and May in the lockdown but since we reopened in early June, there has been a steady flow of people,” said Barbara Vincenti, co-owner of Matisse, a restaurant in Uggiano la Chiesa, near Specchia Gallone and recommended for its seafood. “We have a garden so we manage to distance the tables well. For the moment, we are not doing too badly. But I worry about the winter, as people might not want to eat inside. Plus, we don’t know what awaits us with the virus.”The season at Palazzo Siena wraps up in October, when Gilda returns to her home in Bari. She’s not expecting much from the next few months, but hopes to see her friends return in 2021.“This year has been different,” she said. “I just hope that nothing else happens and that we can soon get back to normal.”• Palazzo Siena has a special rate of €190 a night for its comfort rooms in August and September (normal rates in August from €223-€366). In October, comfort rooms cost €139 and suites €179, palazzosiena"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4dbef32b8d36d0ffc932a1e3b754db7707f34c0/0_48_2840_1704/master/2840.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=590ff773572ff359b83c641c0599f059","title":"britons tv covid lockdown ofcom streaming netflix amazon","story":"Ofcom says 12m UK adults signed up to streaming services such as Netflix or AmazonThe typical person spent six hours and 25 minutes each day keeping informed and entertained at the height of the lockdown in April – almost a third more, about 90 minutes each day – than during the same month last year.The biggest driver of this increase in viewing was a doubling in the amount of time people spent watching subscription streaming services – such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and Disney+ – to more than a hour per day, according to broadcasting regulator Ofcom’s annual study of the nation’s media habits. Among younger audiences, those aged 16 to 34, streaming screen time jumped to two hours a day.Ofcom’s Media Nation’s 2020 report estimates that 12 million UK adults signed up to a new video streaming service during lockdown. About 7 million of those already use at least one service such as Netflix and decided to bulk up their entertainment options about 2 million had previously been signed up to a service but had stopped their subscription and 3 million were new to streaming.Before lockdown, about 15m UK homes were signed up to at least one of Netflix, Amazon Prime Video or Sky’s Now TV service.The lockdown provided the perfect launch conditions for Disney+, which debuted in the UK on 24 March, a day after Boris Johnson ordered the nation to stay at home.“It’s true that it has been almost perfect conditions for all the major streaming services,” said Richard Broughton, an analyst at Ampere. “Under lockdown there has been a lack of alternative entertainment options where you couldn’t see friends and cinemas, restaurants, pubs and clubs were closed. And with traditional TV there has been a relatively limited variety of shows, people were rapidly running out of things to watch.”Ofcom’s research shows that the UK’s public service TV broadcasters – the BBC, ITV, Channel 4, Channel 5 and Scotland’s STV – benefited from huge audience figures early during the lockdown but that boost proved to be short-lived.March provided the public service broadcasters with their highest combined monthly share of all broadcast TV viewing in more than six years. However, the popularity of broadcast TV peaked early in the pandemic, with daily viewing reaching three hours 46 minutes, the highest level since 2013, during the last week of March when Johnson announced the nationwide lockdown.With TV and film production halted due to the pandemic, broadcasters had to begin rationing dwindling stocks of staple hit shows such as Coronation Street and Eastenders while others were delayed or cancelled, such as Love Island and the European football championships, hurting viewing figures.Ofcom found that by the end of June while video streaming services held on to their uplift in viewing, including the BBC iPlayer, Channel 4’s All4 and ITV’s Hub, broadcast TV viewing had fallen by 44 minutes a day from its early pandemic peak.“The pandemic showed public service broadcasting at its best, delivering trusted news and UK content that viewers really value,” said Yih-Choung Teh, the strategy and research group director at Ofcom. “But UK broadcasters face a tough advertising market, production challenges and financial uncertainty. So they need to keep demonstrating that value in the face of intense competition from streaming services.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1da7c97c08ae6c48f6b31600cec298179e32944/0_498_2390_1433/master/2390.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f16156ac458dfed31e942fe6bc83a221","title":"press hounded caroline flack her mother tells inquest","story":"Paramedics were called night before TV presenter killed herself after friends thought she had taken overdoseFriends of Caroline Flack have told the inquest into her death that they thought she had taken an overdose the night before she killed herself, but the TV presenter refused paramedic advice to go to hospital.Long-time friends Louise Teasdale and Mollie Grosberg said they found Flack, 40, barely conscious on the sofa at her north London flat with tablets lying nearby, and called an ambulance.But, when paramedics arrived, Flack denied she had intended to kill herself, and refused to go to hospital, coroner Mary Hassell sitting at Poplar coroner’s court, east London was told.One of the paramedics, Tony Rumore, said Flack was “slightly lethargic” but able to stand up. He said: “We asked Caroline if her intention was to harm or kill herself. She said it was merely an attempt to sleep and escape from the stresses she was under.”The two friends stayed overnight but left the following morning after Flack was angry with them for calling paramedics.Flack was found dead later that day, 15 February. The Love Island host was facing trial for assaulting her boyfriend, Lewis Burton, a former tennis player and model, in December. She had learned the previous day that the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) was continuing with the prosecution.Flack’s mother, Chris Flack, said her daughter had faced a “show trial” and been “hounded by the press” in the weeks before she took her life. In a statement read to the court she said: “I believe Caroline was seriously let down by the authorities and in particular the CPS for pursuing the case.”The CPS’s original intention was to caution Flack, rather than charge her. That was overturned following an appeal from the politan police who felt Flack had not made full admissions in her police interview, Lisa Ramsarran, a deputy chief crown prosecutor, told the inquest.In December last year, Burton had dialled 999 claiming Flack was “trying to kill him” while he was asleep and that he had a cracked head after being hit with a lamp, which was bleeding “profusely”, she said.Flack admitted making a “flicking gesture” with her phone, which made contact with Burton’s head, after reading texts which questioned his fidelity, and that she was surprised to see an injury and blood, added Ramsarran.It was decided a caution was not appropriate, that there was sufficient evidence and it was in the public interest to authorise a charge of assault by beating. Flack was then charged, she added.It was never resolved whether it was a lamp, a desk fan or a phone that caused the injury, the inquest was told.Flack had self-harmed at the scene, and was taken to hospital for a psychiatric assessment and deemed fit for interview, the inquest heard.Family and friends painted a picture of the TV star falling apart in the weeks leading up to her death.Asked by the coroner Mary Hassell, sitting at Poplar coroner’s court in east London, whether Flack had said “she actually wanted to kill herself”, Flack’s friend Teasdale replied “yes”.Flack’s mother said the evidence in the criminal proceedings against her daughter was “disputed”. But the resulting media attention had “forced Caroline to leave her home which she loved, I believe eventually to take her own life”.Through it all, Flack was told not to “tell her side of the story”, her mother said in a statement. “The only person who was hurt that night was Caroline,” she said. “She lost the job she worked so hard at.”Flack had been called an “abuser” in the newspapers, her sister Jody Flack said. “Her life and reputation she worked hard to build was falling apart … because of a false accusation,” she added. Flack had “spent months hiding inside”.“Caroline seemed very sad the day before her death – she seemed to have lost her fight,” she said.She said Flack was in a “very anxious” state of mind. Ambulances had previously been called on four occasions.Tamsin Lewis, a psychiatrist and lifestyle practitioner, who was called by Flack’s personal assistant on 17 December, told the court she was informed Flack was “in the middle of a media crisis and could not sleep”.She was “incredibly distressed” and tearful, Lewis said in a statement. “She was scrolling the media reports on her phone.” She had a bandaged finger, which she explained was the result of a “lovers’ tiff” with Burton, “heightened by alcohol”.Lewis added that her mood appeared low and “she reported having panicky feelings all day – a sense of impending doom”. Flack did not say she had suicidal intent, added Lewis.“She said she had been drinking excessively to numb herself. She said sleep had been impossible.”Burton described Flack as “not in a good place emotionally”, “devastated” and said she sometimes talked of taking her own life.He said in a statement: “The media were constantly bashing her character, writing hurtful stories, generally hounding her daily.” He added: “What was worrying her most was the police case and losing her presenting job on Love Island, plus not being able to see me.” Burton had asked the CPS to drop the case.David O’Toole, a paramedic called to Flack’s flat on 15 February, said it appeared she had been dead for hours.

Demonstrators in downtown Beirut attacked the convoy of former Lebanese prime minister Saad Hariri and brawled with his bodyguards in the most overt display of wider anger that is building against Lebanese politicians in the wake of the disaster.The government said on Wednesday evening it was putting an unspecified number of Beirut port officials under house arrest pending an investigation into how the highly explosive materials came to be stored less than 100 metres from a residential neighbourhoods. The national cabinet also declared a two-week state of emergency, effectively giving the military full powers in the capital.The death toll climbed to more than 135 people according to the Lebanese Red Cross with another 5,000 wounded. Up to 300,000 people had suffered damage to their homes, leaving some uninhabitable, Beirut’s governor, Marwan Abboud, said. Dozens of people are still missing, feared buried under rubble.Residents across the city were sweeping shattered glass and other debris from their homes on Wednesday morning as blame for the tragedy started to be apportioned on social media and Lebanese TV channels.The Lebanese prime minister on Tuesday night had blamed the explosion on 2,750-tonne store of ammonium nitrate, a chemical used in bombs and fertilisers, that had been stored at the port. Media reports from 2014 claimed a Russian-owned vessel carrying that load was impounded at Beirut’s port that year, after making an emergency stop in the city and being denied permission to leave by customs authorities because it was deemed unseaworthy.The former captain of the vessel, the Rhosus, alleged in an interview with Russian journalists six years ago that the owner of the ship, reported as Igor Grechushkin, had abandoned it along with the crew, who were being “held hostage” by customs authorities. “The owner has abandoned the ship. The cargo is ammonium nitrate. It is an explosive substance. And we’ve been abandoned. We’ve been living for 10 months on a powder keg.” has not been able to verify the claims Grechushkin was the ship’s owner and has attempted to contact him for comment.In another letter published by a journalist in touch with the crew, the ship was described as “a floating bomb and the crew is a hostage aboard this bomb.”The mostly Ukrainian crew were held onboard the ship for nearly a year before they were released, their lawyers said in a 2015 note, and the ammonium nitrate was confiscated and held at the port in a warehouse.In an interview with Radio Free Europe on Wednesday, the ship’s captain denied there were problems with the ship and said it was detained for failing to pay port fees. The International Transport Workers Federation, which sought back wages and repatriation for the crew, confirmed that the ship was being held in part because it owed the port $100,000 in unpaid bills. In an interview with Radio Free Europe on Wednesday, the ship’s captain at the time, Boris Prokoshev, said he had been in direct contact with Grechushkin, whom he called the ship’s owner.Badri Daher, the director-general of Lebanese Customs, told broadcaster LBCI on Wednesday morning that in the years that folllowed, his agency had sent six documents to the judiciary warning that the material posed a danger. “We requested that it be re-exported but that did not happen,” he said. “We leave it to the experts and those concerned to determine why.”The news agency Reuters quoted an anonymous source close to a port employee saying a team had inspected the ammonium nitrate six months ago and warned that if it was not moved it would “blow up all of Beirut”. Another source said several committees and judges had been warned about the chemicals was “nothing was done” to dispose of it.Still unclear was what set off the ammonium nitrate, which requires extreme heat to ignite. Abboud said on Tuesday that the Beirut municipality had dispatched firefighters to the site in response to reports of a blaze, and that they were missing after the explosion – suggesting the fire had burned long enough for the crew to arrive at the scene.Several pieces of footage from the moments preceding the blast also showed thick grey smoke billowing from port, along with a series of small explosions that gave off red fumes, and then a massive blast involving more than 1,300-times the amount of ammonium nitrate used in the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing.Reuters quoted an anonymous source on Wednesday claiming the fire had started at a warehouse number nine, before spreading to warehouse 12 where the ammonium nitrate was stored. The source of the initial fire is not publicly known.Aerial and drone photographs showed a deep crater of blasted land where warehouse 12 stood, next to a row of destroyed grain silos and the surrounding area almost entirely razed.The Lebanese economy minister, Raoul Nehme, said damage to the silos had left the country with less than a month’s grain reserves, but claimed there was no risk of food shortage. “There is no bread or flour crisis,” he said. “We have enough inventory and boats on their way to cover the needs of Lebanon on the long term.”Abboud said damage from the blast extended over half of Beirut, with the cost of damage likely above $3bn.On Wednesday evening, the UK Foreign Office announced a British aid package for Lebanon, including up to £5m in emergency humanitarian funding, as well as deploying search and rescue experts, tailored medical help, strategic air transport assistance, and engineering and communications support.Much of East Beirut is no longer inhabitable, something that the few residents and shopkeepers picking through their wrecked businesses tacitly acknowledge. “I don’t know how we’re going to get through this,” said Issam Nassir, the manager of a tyre shop that stood incongruously amid what used to be a travel agent, a pizza parlour, and an upmarket bar – all destroyed. “Do you really think Hiroshima could have been worse than this?”The sound of mountains of glass being swept from balconies and cascading onto roads was a soundtrack to the day. Tired emergency workers trudged through the streets, some holding sledgehammers, others carrying water. A carpark in the Gemmayze district had been turned into a triage centre. Orange plastic stretchers, slick with blood were lined up from one side to the other.After becoming a byword for destruction and chaos in the 1980s, Beirut rebounded from its 15-year civil war to regain a reputation as a hard-partying playground for the wealthy and theatre for the Middle East’s political intrigues.Bullet holes still marked many buildings, electricity remained intermittent and the isions of the civil war went unreconciled, but Lebanon defied its doomsayers for three decades, attracting investment from across the region and millions of dollars in remittances from its diaspora that papered over the cracks in its institutions and infrastructure.That run appears to have ended in 2020, with its national accounts revealed to be stuffed with loans it cannot repay, and the bureaucratic inertia and negligence that dogs the lives of many Lebanese accused of contributing to one of the worst disasters in the country’s modern history.“What happened yesterday is the result of the incompetence of the so-called responsible people,” wrote Stéphane Bazan, a Lebanese consultant, in a widely shared Facebook post on Wednesday.“How many disasters are still waiting for? We run out of electricity, water is poisoned, food is suspicious, weapons are everywhere. They stole our money, our children’s future.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89dcce825da98adc77f56607eab0a60132038626/0_8_1701_1021/master/1701.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8680d9e05d3ee948dddaf4511b63973d","title":"meet david born in france raised in belgium facing removal to the drc","story":"He grew up in Brussels and dreams of a career in fashion, but hardline laws make him an asylum seeker in his own countryWhen David (not his real name) walked into the headquarters of the Belgian immigration department to apply for asylum, he looked at the other people in the queue and thought: “They don’t speak French, they had to flee their country, they have good reason for asking for protection. I’m going to be laughed at.” The officials at the reception desk did not laugh, but they did give him “a weird look”, David says. “When they heard my accent and saw my dyed blond hair, they seemed to think: ‘What are you doing here?’”David recounts that day last year with a flawless Bruxellois accent. Born on the outskirts of Paris to parents of Congolese descent, he arrived in Belgium when still a toddler. We meet close to where he lives, in Brussels’ university district. His outfit – black ripped skinny jeans, black polo shirt and two white wireless earbuds – is carefully chosen: David, now 22, is set on a career in fashion.In the same month he applied for asylum, January 2019, Belgium received 2,765 applications, mainly from Palestinians, Afghans and Syrians. Why does David, who grew up in Brussels and has never set foot outside the EU, have to seek international protection in what he feels is his home country? Because he is at serious risk of being deported to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, a country his parents left when they were children, following their own refugee parents.David’s mother was 17 when he was born. She soon separated from David’s father, who did not recognise David as his son. A few years later she left France for Brussels. The young, single mother entrusted her son to his paternal grandmother. “My mother wanted to live her life, my father was in jail by then,” David says. “But I had a happy childhood. I had a lot of cousins, uncles and aunts, I had my friends in school. I didn’t know anything about my immigration issues.”Estimates suggest between 100,000 and 150,000 undocumented people live in Belgium. No one seems to know how many of them are children, growing up with limited rights. “They have the right to education,” says Melanie Zonderman from the Platform for Minors in Exile, a network for migrant children’s rights, “and, like undocumented adults, the right to emergency medical services.” That is it.In Belgium, as in other European countries, the paths to legal status are confusing and difficult to navigate, let alone for a child. They can apply for a humanitarian permit to stay in Belgium under article 9bis of the Belgian aliens act, but whether this is granted or not depends on opaque criteria, which the Belgian immigration department does not make public. The process can take years, costs €358 (£325) for adults (it is free for children), and in the meantime children are at risk of deportation.David’s situation was complex. His best option seemed to be “family reunification” with a parent living legally in the country. But his mother, who suffered from mental illness and addiction, had not kept up her residence permit. His father, who was released from prison when David was about 10 years old, still had not recognised him as his son.With David’s 18th birthday approaching, his father finally agreed to a DNA paternity test. When he was 16, David received a five-year permit based on “reunification” with his father. Two years later, he was told there had been a mistake: as the child of a refugee, not a Belgian citizen, he was only eligible for a renewable one-year permit, which would become permanent after five years. David felt the blow, but told himself he just had to hold on for a few more years.Then he did something that blew it all: he came out. “When my father got out of prison, he soon realised I was not the son he would have wanted,” David said. “I have always been effeminate. He started making comments: ‘Why is he like this, why does he dance like a girl?’ And I thought: ‘I don’t even know you, and you want to change me … I don’t like this.’” During his adolescence David felt as if he had a split personality: “At school I was extrovert, sociable and good-humoured, while at home I was silent, almost embittered.”One day in January 2018, “I was fighting over the phone with my dad, and I just threw it in his face: ‘By the way, I’m gay!’ He hung up. I started packing my things.” In the following months, David felt relieved. “I started wearing makeup at school,” he says. But then October came, and he had to renew his residence permit. Among the criteria was that David’s father lived with his son and had a stable income. “When the official at the city council asked me for my father’s payslip, I realised my situation,” he says. “I told him I wasn’t even talking to my father.” David became undocumented, again.He tried applying for a permit under article 9bis, but his pro bono lawyer turned out to be not so pro bono: “He kept asking me for money.” The lack of transparent criteria also made this route risky. He went to France, his country of birth, to see if he could get papers there, but he was not eligible under French nationality laws.Until recently, a lot of families with children were rejected for asylum, says Selma Benkhelifa, a lawyer and activist from the Progress Lawyers Network. “The minors weren’t even mentioned in these decisions. They were literally treated like part of their parents’ luggage.” So lawyers started filing separate asylum requests for the children, arguing that reintegrating in countries they barely knew, after spending their childhood or adolescence in Belgium, would not only be impossible but would expose them to serious risks.On Benkhelifa’s advice, David decided to apply for asylum, based on the persecution he would face in the DRC because of his sexuality. Robin Bronlet, a colleague of Benkhelifa’s, is optimistic about David’s case. But he points out the absurdity of the rule by which children inherit the nationality of their parents. “As immigration lawyers, we must identify the risks David would be facing in case of ‘return’ to his ‘country of origin’, meaning the DRC,” he says, “even though David was born in Europe and never set foot in Africa.”Today, undocumented children are scattered all over Belgium. Some of them make the news when they suddenly disappear from school, are detained and sometimes deported. But most, like David, keep their worries to themselves and blend in with their classmates, hoping for some miraculous solution.None of David’s closest friends from school know he has lost his residence permit and has applied for asylum. “If I told them, they would worry, and it would be too stressful,” he says, “and I don’t want to be pitied.” Since leaving his grandmother’s house, David has moved around a lot. He stayed with friends and even spent a few nights in a hotel when had nowhere else to go. In September 2019, he moved into a flat with three other gay asylum seekers through Le Refuge, an organisation supporting isolated LGBTQI+ youth.At the end of 2019, David’s mother was arrested after an identity check and taken to Belgium’s only immigration detention centre for women, in Holsbeek. While he remains estranged from his father and grandmother, his mother has accepted his sexuality. She spent six months in detention before the coronavirus outbreak forced Belgian authorities to release many immigration detainees. David visited her several times. “To me, it was an extension of what I had gone through since entering the asylum system,” he says. “The human side is totally lacking. All they see in you is a sans-papiers.”David is eagerly awaiting his interview with asylum authorities. “I’m really sick of waiting. I feel stuck,” he says. And yet he is making plans for his future. He wants to start a YouTube channel offering advice on makeup, fashion, wigs and how to “boost the confidence of LGBT young people”. He wants to find a job to save money and enrol in fashion school. “Will the asylum authorities believe me?” he wonders. “I will tell them my truth. If it’s not enough, too bad. If it’s enough, so much the better. I just want to get it over with.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/858a6719b2f26b65a6720191b93a60c5ce609713/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=48db5f6281a006f0e7cf85a4bd4373a3","title":"papua new guineas massive ok tedi mine closes as covid cases spread to new areas","story":"Operation shuts for 14 days as coronavirus infections rise more than ten-fold in three weeksCases of Covid-19 in Papua New Guinea have spread to new provinces, forcing the closure of the massive Ok Tedi mine, and sparking warnings that a surge in infections, potentially in the thousands, could strike the country in the next few months.Seven workers at the Ok Tedi mine near the Indonesian border have tested positive to Covid-19. The mine has traced the infections back to a single worker who is believed to have contracted the virus from a person who had flown from Port Moresby to Kiunga on a commercial flight late last month.“The employee is currently working in our operations, travelling to and from work on buses. It is likely that more people have been infected, giving rise to an unacceptable risk of accelerated transmission within the Ok Tedi workforce,” the mine’s chief executive Musje Werror said in a statement.Ok Tedi mine – a hugely profitable gold and copper mine worth billions to the PNG government’s already-parlous finances – will be shut for “at least 14 days to limit further transmission and allow contact tracing, isolation and testing procedures to be implemented”.PNG has now recorded 153 confirmed cases – low by global standards – but a record jump of 39 in a day, and up from 11 just three weeks ago. There have also been two deaths.Professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at the University of Papua New Guinea, Dr Glen Mola, said PNG’s new case numbers were to be expected, and would worsen. Covid-19 was slow to reach PNG initially, he said, and the country is now showing the rising trends most countries were exhibiting two or three months ago.“In August we will have hundreds of positive test infections and perhaps thousands in September to December. But we must stay calm and handle things as best we can fear of the epidemic could be worse than the actual epidemic itself,” Mola said.“Let’s hope we can ‘flatten the curve’ sufficiently to allow our health system to not fall over, but without locking down the country so much that the whole country ‘falls over’ economically.”A significant number of cases have been recorded among health workers in the capital, Port Moresby, raising concerns that medical staff are not being given adequate protective equipment or that hygiene protocols are failing.Workers at the country’s dedicated Covid isolation ward – a converted netball centre in Port Moresby – have gone on strike because they haven’t been paid. The country’s health department has promised they will be paid by Friday.Port Moresby is in lockdown, including a night-time curfew, mandated mask-wearing and the closure of schools, businesses and public transport. But cases are spreading from the capital to previously Covid-free parts of the country including Sanduan province, near the porous border with Indonesia. There are also cases in Western province, East New Britain and in the Eastern Highlands."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ced2c704e664950358a777bd4f27113ef711479b/0_107_5368_3221/master/5368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9fc00cb0fb79c4668b9d54aa9f1a7545","title":"beirut explosion aftermath lebanon in pictures","story":"Lebanon is in mourning and surveying the damage to its capital, Beirut, after a massive explosion ripped through the city’s port and surrounding areas on Tuesday.

It has been an incredibly painful 24+ hours for Beirut, which remains in ruin and plunged into uncertainty.Here are the main developments:A Russian plane carrying relief teams, doctors and medical equipment has landed in Beirut, according to the Associated Press.The aircraft has delivered a mobile hospital along with 50 emergency workers and medical personnel, it said, citing Russia’s Ministry for Emergencies. Another three Russian flights are scheduled to arrive within the next 24 hours. They will carry equipment for a coronavirus testing lab and protective gear, among other relief supplies.More details from my colleague, Jessica, on the UK aid:The Foreign Office has released details of aid the British government will send to Lebanon, including up to £5m in emergency humanitarian funding, announced earlier by Dominic Raab, as well as deploying search and rescue experts with specially trained dogs to help find those caught up in the blast.Raab, who spoke with prime minister Diab, said the UK would provide tailored medical help, strategic air transport assistance, and engineering and communications support. The UK offered to send an emergency clinical advisory team who could provide initial assessment and coordination with search and rescue teams.“This was a devastating explosion which has caused enormous suffering and damage,” Raab said. “The UK is a long-standing friend of Lebanon and the Lebanese people, and will stand with them in their hour of need.”It’s not just governments that are donating. In just over a day, this fundraiser has raised more than £3 million, and it is growing.The page was set up by the not-for-profit, Impact Lebanon, which describes itself as a “social incubator for driven Lebanese around the world”.Cities around the world have been lighting up their buildings with the red, white and green colours of the Lebanese flag.Here’s the Burj Khalifa tower in Dubai:City Hall in Belfast:The Sheraton in Doha:And even City Hall in Tel Aviv:Here’s the statement from the tribunal.It says the decision to delay was “out of respect for the countless victims of the devastating explosion that shook Beirut on 4 August, and the three-day of public mourning in Lebanon.”The Special Tribunal for Lebanon has postponed a Friday verdict in the trial over the 2005 bombing that killed former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri.Now, the landmark ruling for four accused men will be delayed until 18 August, following the huge explosion in Beirut. It has been a source of immense friction in Lebanon.US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo has spoken with Prime Minister Hassan Diab, Washington said in a statement.“Secretary Pompeo expressed his condolences to the Lebanese people for the horrible explosion at the Beirut port, which killed and injured so many and caused devastating destruction to the city,” it said. “The Secretary reaffirmed our steadfast commitment to assist the Lebanese people as they cope with the aftermath of this terrifying event. Secretary Pompeo further stressed our solidarity with and support for the Lebanese people as they strive for the dignity, prosperity, and security they deserve.”My colleague, Molly, has heard from a Beirut resident, who has given a distressing account of the minutes after the blast:“We heard the first sonic boom - it was actually a smaller explosion but sounded like a sonic boom - and I knew something was deeply wrong,” she said. Timi, who lives in the Achrafieh district of Beirut, said she grabbed her fiancé seconds before “everything exploded around us”. “We get blasted from the couch with glass and doors flying all around us. We were in an old Lebanese house next to hospital St George in Geitawi, the house was totalled,” she said. “I really thought I was going to die.”Timi said she “huddled in the corner of the room”, which was covered with glass and blood, and began to pray. “I never pray, but I didn’t know what else to do to calm down,” she said. “My fiancé’s mother was bleeding profusely, I also had gotten a cut on my arm from the broken glass. We were in complete shock and fear,” she said. “We wandered out of the house like lost ghosts. Going nowhere and mumbling and trembling, covered in dust and blood.“It was unreal. It felt like I was in a bad dream where I was on mute and I couldn’t help anyone or myself,” Timi added. “Complete mental shock and disorientation. I didn’t take pictures because I was still under shock at the time, but at least we were overall ok (no major injuries). Some people were wounded very badly in the hospital. My heart goes out to them and their families.”Lebanese news channel, Al Manar TV, is quoting the country’s health minister as saying the toll has now risen, with tens of people still missing.More and more shocking videos of the blast and its effects are coming in. BBC Arabic journalist, Maryem Taoumi, was filming an interview when the shockwave hit.This video of a woman in Beirut playing Auld Lang Syne on the piano in her blasted-out living room is being circulated online.The government has also approved the spending of 100bn Lebanese pounds to deal with the crisis. That is worth around $13m (nearly £10m) as the unofficial exchange rate has gone into a virtual freefall.The Lebanese government has declared a two-week state of emergency, effectively giving the military full powers in the capital.The government announced the measure during a cabinet meeting, according to the Associated Press.It confirmed earlier reports that the government was putting an unspecified number of Beirut port officials under house arrest pending an investigation into how 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate came to be stored at the port for years.Here are two astonishing videos from the blast.The first captures a priest ducking from what appears to be plummeting stained glass windows.This one, meanwhile, shows a bride posing as the shockwave hits the area.Our graphics team have worked up this excellent visual guide to give you an idea of the magnitude of the blast:Another charity working in Lebanon, Islamic Relief, has warned that the country was already in a very precarious position before Tuesday’s blast.“This is yet another tragedy for a country that is already deep in crisis on multiple fronts,” said Nidal Ali, the group’s Lebanon director.He adds: “In October last year, we had to put all our long-term programmes on hold and prioritise food parcels as the economic crisis became a humanitarian emergency.“This was all before the coronavirus pandemic brought the world to a standstill earlier this year. Lebanon has seen a spike in cases over recent weeks, and hospitals are overrun.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4323013.1596660229!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irishman in malta not surprised by green list change","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIrishman Shaun McCarthy normally  likes to travel home to Dublin at least once  a year. Photograph: Courtesy Shaun McCarthy Shaun McCarthy should have flown into Ireland to visit family and friends on Wednesday morning. He should also have been at the weddings of his son and daughter over the weekend but, in the end, everything was postponed. Originally from Walkinstown in Dublin but now living in Malta, any return trip home seems unlikely for some time to come. Added to general Covid-19 frustrations, Malta was one of five countries removed from the Irish “green list” from where travellers do not have to self-isolate for two weeks on arrival.“There is no way I would go now if you had to spend 14 days quarantining,” Mr McCarthy said just a few hours after his Aer Lingus flight would have touched down in Dublin. “My own personal view is that you don’t travel unless you have to.”Mr McCarthy (77) said he was half expecting the removal of Malta from the list and, following the news on Tuesday evening, it came to pass. As an Irishman abroad, he hopes to return home in 2021 instead. On Saturday his son Stephen was due to marry, followed by his daughter Tara on Monday. Both weddings in Manchester were postponed until next summer. As for life on the Mediterranean island, Mr McCarthy said that while until very recently they felt they had things under control, Covid cases had shot up to more than 200, fuelled by an increase in crowded events. Asked about the removal of Malta from the green list, the country’s ambassador to Ireland Leonard Sacco said the matter was “a sovereign decision of the Irish Government, which Malta respects”.Low infection rateGibraltar, another of the five countries removed from the list alongside Cyprus, Monaco and San Marino, pointed to its low infection rate. A Gibraltar government spokesman said “currently only four residents are infected. However, it is not currently possible to get from Gibraltar by air to Ireland without going through the UK or Spain, which would require a quarantine anyway”.Official statistics from the country show a total of 189 confirmed cases of Covid-19 from 22,601 tests, representing a 0.8 per cent positivity rate. Active cases in the country are made up of four residents and two visitors. Meanwhile, the Irish Travel Agents Association (ITAA) said the removal of the five countries would not have a material effect on the sector as there was little demand for international travel amid low levels of consumer confidence. It noted that bookings to Malta and Cyprus in particular were “not significant”.“Although consumer confidence in international travel is expected to remain low for the rest of the year, there is evidence to suggest a large pent-up demand for travel in 2021 which could work to repair some of the damage suffered by the Irish travel industry as a result of the worldwide pandemic,” it said.

Photograph: CollinsAcross the world, in countries wrestling with a resurgence in Covid-19 cases, local lockdowns are increasingly forming part of the response by governments.In Ireland, too, there have been calls for a regionalisation of approaches so that the pain involved in continuing with, or even reimposing, restrictions would be felt by fewer people. This might allow pubs in Dingle to open, for example, but not in Donnybrook or it might impose a curfew in one county, but not its neighbour.But could such an approach work in the Republic, a small state with good internal travel links that are heavily used (particularly in holiday time during the summer)? And even if it would work, is it the appropriate response when up to now the job of suppressing the virus has been a collective effort based on community spirit and an understanding that the pain involved was being shared?In Australia, lockdown restrictions – known there as phase four – were imposed on Melbourne last Sunday. Residents are permitted to go outside only for essential trips such as food shopping or exercise, mask-wearing is mandatory in all public settings and an 8pm curfew has been imposed.Stage three restrictions, the next most severe category of measures, are being imposed in the wider state of Victoria from Thursday.In the UK, meanwhile, restrictions were reimposed on millions of people in northern England in recent days following a spike in cases, while Aberdeen in Scotland has also been put back into lockdown.In most cases, administrators have justified the lockdowns by saying harsher medicine now will work better than a gentler response over time. The Victorian premier, for example, said the alternative to stage four restrictions for six weeks was stage three measures for six months.Here in Ireland, public health officials have considered introducing local measures at various points over the past six months, but have on each occasion backed off such a move.Their reasons varied at different stages of the pandemic. There was no need for local measures during the lockdown, which was national and enjoyed widespread public support.Aside perhaps from Dublin, there doesn’t seem to have been huge variations in the incidence of the disease in different areas of the country, though the data published is incomplete.Ultimately, Co Cavan has ended up with a higher cumulative incidence of Covid-19 than Dublin, due possibly to outbreaks in local nursing homes and the local hospital.The total number of cases in an area, whether cumulative or in the previous 14 days, is less important, arguably, than the proportion of cases which involve community transmission.Co Kildare, for example, is recording the highest incidence in the country, but most of its new caseload relates to two outbreaks in local factories. The figures don’t tell us what the relative risk is of walking down the main street of Naas compared to, say, Newbridge.‘Internal green zones’Irish scientists calling for a zero-Covid national policy have suggested that “internal green zones” could be created out of counties that have effectively suppressed community transmission. These counties would benefit from lighter restrictions while other counties with higher rates of infection would be subject to greater restrictions until their figures improved.Prof Anthony Staines of DCU, who advocates this approach, acknowledges that Dublin poses a challenge – should it be limited to the county boundary or should it cover the greater metropolitan area?The World Health Organisation says there is a role for regionalised approaches to limit the spread of the virus while allowing for economic activity to continue as much as possible. However, it says, you first have to look at the amount of mobility between areas, as well as the availability of localised data and response capacity.It hardly needs stating that Ireland is a small country, with a highly mobile population internally and that county boundaries, while important on the GAA field, count for little in terms of people’s movement. And that’s before you even start to consider the national Border on the island.Singling out a particular county, or even HSE region, for restrictions could also undermine the spirit of national solidarity that has sustained the country through the pandemic. For these reasons, this approach is likely to be one of the last measures adopted to tackle any specific outbreak.Or, as acting chief medical officer Dr Ronan Glynn has said, “in a small country, where people are moving across boundaries, it’s not as simple”.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4322560.1596648320!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"donohoe does not commit to specific compensation for pubs","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tClosed pubs in Dublin’s Temple Bar. Publicans had hoped they would be able to reopen on August 10th. Photograph: Collins Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe has not committed to any specific compensation package for publicans who will have to keep their pubs closed for at least another three weeks.Mr Donohoe said on Wednesday afternoon he would look at support for particular parts of the country and the economy that were affected by Covid-19 and Tuesday’s Cabinet decision, but did not refer specifically to pubs. He was speaking after the announcement of the Government’s latest exchequer figures. His comments which did not mention a specific plan or compensation for public houses will bring little comfort to vintners who have said the second delay to their reopening plans has led to a “full-blown crisis” in the industry. “My first priority is to implement the July jobs plan and that has many measures that will help,” said Mr Donohoe when asked. “I am going to be engaging with (Minister for Public Expenditure) Michael McGrath and Minister for Media, Arts and Culture, and the Gaeltacht) Catherine Martin on the consequences (of Tuesday’s Cabinet decision).He said he would be working with Mr McGrath and Ms Martin on “further measures that will be needed for some parts our our country and other parts of our economy”. He said many of measures in the July stimulus plan could have a “really positive affect on a really difficult problem”.He added: “Work is underway to what else may need to be done.” Following the Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, Taoiseach Micheál Martin and other senior Ministers indicated at a briefing that the Minister and others would be looking at solution to address the challenges facing pubs. Asked about the decision on RTE Radio’s Drivetime, Mr Donohoe said the Cabinet had looked at doing things geographically by county or by region. “We’re a very small country with high levels of mobility within it,” meaning options open to larger countries aren’t open to Ireland, he said. Alcohol and coronavirusEarlier public health expert Dr Gabriel Scally said that alcohol is the “best friend” of the coronavirus and the only safe option was to keep those pubs not serving food closed. Dr Scally drew a clear distinction between pubs that only serve alcohol and those that also serve food.“They are like chalk and cheese. I’ve never had to shoulder my way to the counter to get a drink in a restaurant.”NPHET recommended a closing time of 10.30pm for the restaurant and cafe sector except for take-out and delivery and the mandatory wearing of masks for staff. The Government opted instead to implement a closing time of 11pm.Speaking on RTÉ Radio One’s Today with Sarah McInerney Show, Dr Scally pointed to Scotland where pubs had reopened and 32 people were infected with Covid-19 having all been in one pub.He said keeping the virus under control was not good enough, and said the aim should be to have zero cases. Keeping the pubs closed was the way to do that.A “zero Covid” strategy would require co-operation North and South, no domestic cases, and putting controls in place to ensure no cases were imported, he said.When asked about Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon’s proposed Four Nations Elimination Strategy, Dr Scally said he admired her and the plan but said he was pessimistic about the response from Whitehall. Dr Scally was speaking following a Cabinet decision on Tuesday evening to delay the already-paused phase four of reopening society for a further three weeks. Pubs which do not serve food and nightclubs will remain closed until September at least, and the current strict limits of 50 on numbers congregating indoors, and 200 outdoors, will remain in place. Face masks are set to become mandatory in all shops and retail centres from Monday, and pubs serving food and restaurants will be required to close at 11pm.Separately, the Cabinet also decided to remove five states or territories from the “green list” of 15 from which passengers arriving into Ireland would not need to quarantine. They are Malta, Cyprus, San Marino, Gibraltar and Monaco.Earlier, Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly said while he was disappointed the restrictions were not being eased the decisions were made with the safety of citizens in mind. Mr Donnelly said the Government had to take a cautious approach to lifting coronavirus restrictions and said keeping people safe, opening schools and restarting the economy was the priority. He said the Government would look closely at the possibility of having regional or county decisions in the future. The concern, the Minister told Morning Ireland, was that things were finely balanced and could get out of control. Ireland is in a dynamic situation and the Government must respond dynamically, said Mr Donnelly. Meanwhile Independent TD Michael Healy-Rae said the Government was treating publicans and their customers with contempt and he claimed reopening pubs would protect the public’s health. The dangers that might arise in bigger pubs could not be compared with smaller rural pubs where there might be just six or seven customers, he said.The decision to retrench the current phase of lockdown came after a further 45 confirmed cases was confirmed by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) on Tuesday.Mr Martin justified the decision in light of recent coronavirus figures which have seen the 14-day incidence of cases triple in the last month.“I know that this will come as a blow to pub owners and I want them to know that I have enormous sympathy for their plight,” said Mr Martin.“This virus is taking away their ability to earn a living.”He said: “International evidence shows very clearly that pubs and nightclubs reopening too early leads directly and inextricably to increased community transmission. Tánaiste Leo Varadkar said Ireland had lost some ground in its battle with coronavirus. “The truth is the pandemic is blazing around the world. In fact it is worse than ever,” he said.In a joint statement on Tuesday, the Licensed Vintners Association (LVA) and the Vintners Federation of Ireland (VFI) said publicans were now in “fury and despair”, and called for “immediate” aid.“This is Groundhog Day for the trade as twice now the reopening of pubs has been postponed,” said VFI chief executive Pádraig Cribben. “The Government has effectively denied pubs the ability to trade. As a result it will have to provide substantial supports to our members, many of whom are deeply agitated at what they feel is the State abandoning a vital part of the hospitality sector.”Donall O’Keeffe, chief executive of the LVA, said pubs have been abandoned: “We’re repeatedly being told that opening the pubs ‘could lead to an increase in the virus’. Well, when will that not be the case?”The 25,000 people working in pubs now faced “intolerable pressure”, said the bodies, who complained about a lack of guidance from the Government or reassurance about the future."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"TD Jackie Cahill seeks extraordinary meeting of Fianna F\u0026aacuteil Oireachtas membersGuidelines were drawn up by F\u0026aacuteilte Ireland ahead of expected August 10th reopeningSome Ministers privately voice concern at endangered pubs and handling of pandemicAs a small state with a highly mobile people, a local approach may undermine community spiritIndustry group says it has put proposals to the Government to avert any shortagesGarda\u0026iacute and Coast Guard attend scene after incident on Wednesday afternoonNumber of offenders dealt with by the service rose marginally in 2019, annual report showsMourners line route to cemetery as coronavirus restrictions close cathedral grounds to publicPope Francis, the Clintons and the Dalai Lama united in praise of former SDLP leaderSome Ministers of State say they were promised advisers, and do not believe pooled system worksClontarf school is piloting the cycling initiative in effort to minimise coronavirus risksThe recommendation is included in guidance on resuming on-campus activityPatrycja Wyrebek from Poland was found dead at her home i on Sunday morningIrish Travel Agents Association says there is little demand for international travelChild and Family Agency says pandemic had noticeable impact on ability to visit children at homePriority must be to control the spread of the virus in communities - NPHET\u0026lsquoIt\u0026rsquos like a death.

Photograph: Andrew MilliganPA WireLongford-born journalist Peter Geoghegan was sitting in a train carriage in Newcastle just before the Brexit referendum in 2016 when a quest began to unravel a mystery about the Democratic Unionist Party’s role in winning it.Flicking through a “well-thumbed copy” of the  newspaper, Geoghegan, who works now in Glasgow and London, saw the free newspaper’s front page “wraparound” advertisement.In it, British voters were urged to “Take back control”, the slogan of the official Vote Leave campaign,” Geoghegan recalls in his new book, Democracy for Sale, which is published by Head of Zeus on Thursday.“I turned the paper over. An imprint on the back said that the advert had been ‘paid for by the Democratic Unionist Party’,” says Geoghegan, a journalist with opendemocracy.net.“This was very curious. Since its foundation in 1971, the Democratic Unionist Party had never run a single candidate outside Northern Ireland, ” he writes.It was a little epiphany that ultimately led him down a number of other tracks and has resulted in the book.It is filled with the likes Steve Bannon, Donald Trump, Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and a former head of Saudi Arabian intelligence, Prince Nawwaf bin Abdul Aziz al Saud.Right there, too, is the DUP, which spent £435,000 “on a massive ad campaign promoting Brexit in England. I knew that election spending in the UK is tightly capped.”“I also knew, having worked as a reporter in Belfast, that political donations to Northern Irish parties were kept secret under anachronistic local laws. Perhaps this was a way around campaign limits?”So, would he solve the mystery?Geoghegan contends in Democracy for Sale that the money was channelled to the DUP through the official Vote Leave campaign because Vote Leave had almost used up its permitted spending of £7 million.Vote Leave and the DUP have denied the claim.Uncommunicative groupOther organisations on both sides of the campaign were allowed additional spending of up to £700,000. The author recounts how he discovered that an uncommunicative organisation called the Constitutional Research Council (CRC) donated £435,000 to the DUP to support the Leave crusade.To prop up his Vote Leave-DUP connection conviction, Geoghegan writes, “Two months before the referendum, Matthew Elliott, Vote Leave’s chief executive, wrote in an email to senior staff: ‘The DUP also have a £700k spending limit, which can be spent nationwide!’ ”“At that stage the DUP had yet to register as a referendum participant,” Geoghegan writes. “It only did so in late May. When the CRC started giving money to the DUP, Vote Leave had almost completely exhausted its spending allowance.”Geoghegan writes how the DUP’s Brexit “spending spree began on June 9th, exactly two weeks before the vote, when the DUP bought £100,000 worth of placards, bags, window stickers, T-shirts and badges from a small branding agency called Soopa Doopa”.This company was based in the Cambridgeshire cathedral town of Ely. The location and the company was a “surprising choice” for the DUP, thought Geoghegan. The fact that it published more than £800,000 of material for various Leave-supporting groups reinforced his belief that this was part of the alleged Vote Leave-DUP nexus.Two days before polls opened, Geoghegan writes, the CRC donated a further £334,993 to the DUP, much of which was spent on the wraparound ad in the  – a paper that does not circulate in Northern Ireland.He also says the DUP spent £32,000 on digital advertising through a Canadian company called AggregateIQ (AIQ) which had “bought millions of pounds worth of Facebook ads on behalf of a suite of pro-Brexit campaigns clustered around Vote Leave”.The Westminster “fake news” inquiry that began in 2017 and concluded in 2019 heard that AIQ had links with Cambridge Analytica, the political consulting firm founded by US billionaire Robert Mercer and US president Donald Trump’s former chief strategist Steve Bannon, although this has been denied by AIQ co-founder Zack Massingham.Cambridge Analytica got in serious trouble over allegedly misappropriating digital information, including acquiring the personal data of tens of millions of Facebook users.Front organisationGeoghegan, following the money trail, writes that “according to Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Chris Wylie, the DUP were simply a front organisation to allow Vote Leave to go beyond spending limits imposed by election laws” – again a charge that Vote Leave and the DUP strongly deny.Geoghegan explores how the only publicly known person associated with the CRC – the group that gave the £435,000 to the DUP – is Scottish businessman Richard Cook, a Conservative Party activist and Glasgow Rangers supporter.He is depicted as a colourful figure, who in 2013 jointly founded a company called Five Star Investments with Prince Nawwaf bin Abdul Aziz al Saud, a former director general of the Saudi intelligence agency who died in 2015. Cook held 5 per cent of the shares, the prince 75 per cent, and a third man, Danish national Peter Haestrup, held the other 20 per cent.Haestrup was allegedly linked to an Indian gun-running case known as the Purulia Arms Drop. Haestrup told Geoghegan he was never charged, had a “100 per cent clean record” and had done nothing wrong. He also explained how the wealth management business did not get off the ground and was dissolved in 2014 after “a lot of good dinners”.Despite these intriguing connections, Geoghegan portrays Cook as a man who would not have £435,000 to easily hand over to the DUP. He is convinced the CRC money came from other sources. Former Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy told Geoghegan that Cook, his long-time political adversary in East Renfrewshire, was “a bizarrely unlikely middle-man for this sort of money”.In addition to the £435,000, the author writes about how the CRC made two further contributions to the DUP after the Brexit referendum, totalling more than £13,000 – the DUP very generally and impenetrably saying it had used the money to “further the cause of unionism at home and abroad”.Geoghegan writes that Cook refused to reveal the source of the cash and said that, although he had administered the massive DUP donation, he had never received any money from his involvement in the CRC. “I just run a small consultancy company, doing some waste energy stuff internationally,” he said.Elusive truthGeoghegan does a lot of mining to find the other CRC backers but, as he admits, the gold seam proves elusive, his work not helped by electoral law in Northern Ireland or the DUP’s refusal to answer questions.Under previous electoral legislation in the North, political donors during the Troubles did not have to disclose their names or the size of their contributions because doing so could endanger their lives.In July 2017 that changed when then northern secretary James Brokenshire decided that life had moved on and donation details could be published.It could have been the moment that changed everything. However, it was not to be. Brokenshire could have backdated that legislation to January 2014, but decided not to.This led to allegations that he had done a “side deal” with the DUP – a charge bolstered by the fact that this was at a time when the DUP had signed up to a £1.5 billion confidence and supply deal to keep then UK prime minister Theresa May’s Tory government in power.It prompted former head of the North’s Electoral Commission Seamus Magee to deduce: “The deal on party donations and loans must be part of the DUPConservative deal. No other explanation.”This was denied at the time by DUP MP Jeffrey Donaldson.Geoghegan, still chasing, writes how, in mid December 2017, 17 MPs met in a Westminster committee room to consider a legal order that would bring donor transparency to Northern Ireland.During a “truncated and bad-tempered” debate, DUP MPs Sammy Wilson and Ian Paisley, who were observers, insisted that their party had been wholly transparent about the £435,000 donation.Saying that the failure to backdate the legislation “stinks”, Labour MP Ben Bradshaw added: “The only conclusion that any reasonable person can draw is that the DUP was used, with its knowledge, by the CRC to funnel money to the Leave campaign in a way that to this day keeps the source of that money secret. By refusing to make this provision retrospective, the government are effectively complicit in covering that up.”In his book Geoghegan addresses many fascinating issues in relation to “dark money”, Brexit and political funding but in the end admits his investigation into the DUP and CRC does did not answer the big question.The wall of silence could not be penetrated. He concedes, “Just how much control the DUP had over its record donation and how it was spent remains unclear. And who was behind the money is still a mystery.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches. See more here.

Photograph: Niall CarsonPA Wire On first thoughts it all seemed so wrong that so few were in St Eugene’s Cathedral in Derry for John Hume’s funeral.Yet on just a little bit more reflection it was clearly right. This was always the way that John and his wife, Pat, and the family did business it was about respecting your neighbour, about self-denial and prioritising the needs of others above your own.That was John Hume’s life in a nutshell.This was a time of Covid-19 and that threat must and would be respected, was the insistent line taken by Pat. No exception was made even for one of her own sons, Aidan, living and working in Boston, although his reflection about his father, read by his sister Mo, carried a transatlantic impact.It was a day for the Hume family and also for the SDLP, particularly for some of its veterans from the late 1960s and 1970s.There was something poignant about the likes of Bríd Rodgers, Joe Hendron, Alban Maginness, Gerry Cosgrove, Austin Currie, Tommy Gallagher, Joe Byrne and Sean Farren reminiscing outside the cathedral about past battles on the long road to political resolution.They and Hume created the idea of how to escape from what seemed to be an endless cycle of bloodshed and violence, and in the end succeeded in their ambition, only to see the political prize handed to Sinn Féin.Denis Haughey, who is retired now but for years worked in Europe with Hume when the latter was an MEP, and who himself served for a period as a junior minister at Stormont, recalled a book about John F Kennedy containing an anecdote about someone saying at his funeral, “I don’t think I will ever laugh again.”A colleague responded, “Oh yes, we will laugh again but it is sad to think we will never be young again.”For Haughey it was the loss of a great friend, the end of an era, a sense of vibrant, exciting days fading into the past. “He was the big figure in all our young lives,” he said.More cheerfully Sean Farren beside him thought it oddly comforting that the funeral was taking place the day after Ireland had a sensational one-day cricket victory over England, both teams wearing black armbands in Hume’s honour.“John would have enjoyed that he was a mean left-hand spin bowler, you know,” said Farren.And then adjusting their face coverings, they all trooped into the cathedral behind the Hume family, the President, the Taoiseach, First Minister, Deputy First Minister and other political leaders.Hume would have been happy that Arlene Foster and Michelle O’Neill, who have had their differences over Bobby Storey’s funeral and other issues, sat together, socially distanced, in the same pew, and left the cathedral together.Bridge builderOn the altar were chief celebrant Fr Paul Farren Fr Dinny McGettigan, a cousin of Pat Catholic primate Archbishop Eamon Martin and Bishop of Derry Donal McKeown. Hume, a bridge builder and reconciler, would have been glad too that in the sanctuary of the cathedral were Church of Ireland representatives, Archbishop of Armagh John McDowell and Bishop of Derry and Raphoe Andrew Forster.The Hume children and grandchildren participated in the readings and prayers of the faithful, with Pat looking on proudly.In his tribute John Hume jnr was mindful to say how “eternally grateful” the family were for how people looked out for his father when his great intellect was taken over by dementia. “The kindness shown to him by the people of Derry and Donegal, who stopped to talk to him in the street every day, guided him to protect his independence, and received him with gentleness if he was agitated, was a profound gift to all of us.”And had his dad been alive and in the fullness of his health, and considering the tensions of the world, John jnr knew how “he wouldn’t waste the opportunity to say a few words”.“He’d talk about our common humanity, the need to respect ersity and difference, to protect and deepen democracy, to value education and to place non-violence at the absolute centre.”And, inheriting some of his father’s social justice concerns, he added: “He might also stress the right to a living wage and a roof over your head, to decent healthcare and education. If he were here now, he might quote his friend, Congressman John Lewis, who sadly passed away a few weeks ago, appealing to the ‘goodness of every human being and never giving up’.”John jnr provided a glimpse too of how Hume engaged with his fellow residents when he was admitted to the Owen Mor nursing home in Derry two years ago. “He continued to sing songs every day, to teach them all a wee bit of French, to tell his jokes, to demand more buns, and to question everyone daily about where they came from, their origins and their families.”He also spoke about how his dad “kept the Irish chocolate industry in healthy profits for many years” and how he made the family “laugh, dream, think, and sometimes look at him and scratch our heads in amazement, and on rare occasions bewilderment”.Trembling voiceTributes were read from Pope Francis, the Dalai Lama, Bill Clinton, Boris Johnson and Bono, who more than 22 years ago campaigned with Hume and David Trimble to get the Belfast Agreement referendum over the line in 1998.“We were looking for a negotiator who understood that no one wins unless everyone wins ... and that peace is the only victory,” wrote the U2 frontman.“We were looking for joy and heard it in the song of a man who loved his town so well and his missus even more. We were looking for a great leader and found a great servant. We found John Hume. ”Mo Hume read her brother Aidan’s poem To Da, which outlined in reference to his great friend Seamus Heaney how Hume managed to make “hope and history rhyme”.She held it together but her voice quavered with emotion when she came to the last four most personal lines,I don’t ever think I have said aloud How you made us all so incredibly proud All you ever wanted was to make the world a better place And in that goal you found your ace.At the end of the Mass, Phil Coulter played The Town I Loved So Well. As the family cortege left the cathedral grounds for Derry City Cemetery, there was loud applause from the few hundred people who had gathered quietly outside the cathedral. “You could feel it as well as hear it,” one colleague said of the applause.Bishop McKeown put it well when he said of Hume, “because of his past we can face the future”, but probably the strongest lines of the day came from Fr Farren, who in his homily captured both the power and the latter-stage vulnerability of the Nobel laureate.He described how the cathedral was something of a haven for Hume towards the end of his life, how he would attend, often arriving late, daily evening Mass, sitting and praying quietly at the back of the cathedral.Fr Farren told the congregation how the Gospel reading of the Good Samaritan stopping to assist the man attacked by brigands, as others passed by, was Hume’s favourite reading.Neither did Hume pass by, said Fr Farren. “Even in the darkest moments, when people would have been forgiven for having no hope, John made peace visible for others,” he said.He had a message too for the academics: “When the history of Ireland is written, if Pat Hume’s name is not beside John’s, it will be an incomplete history.”And Fr Farren added: “If ever you want to see a man who gave his life for his country, and his health, that man is John Hume. The world knows it.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"nphet calls for ban on non essential travel from countries with high covid 19 rates","story":"The State’s public health team has asked the Government to consider implementing a ban on non-essential travel from countries with high rates of Covid-19.In a letter to Government, the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) said it had previously recommended mandatory quarantine for all passengers travelling to Ireland from overseas.“While this remains NPHET’s preferred recommendation, if this is deemed unworkable or disproportionate, the NPHET again recommends that consideration is given to the introduction of a travel ban on non-essential travel for those countries with particularly high incidence rates.”Currently, there are no travel bans, or “red list” of countries from which visitors would be prohibited. Rather, passengers from all countries, except those on the “green list”, are advised to self-isolate for 14 days on arrival.The team said 7.8 per cent of cases notified over the last fortnight are associated with travel. They recommended in their letter that “all measures be utilised to discourage travel from overseas to Ireland at this time”.The team also warned the Government that “behavioural and message fatigue” was a risk “as the population disengages from Covid-19-related news”.Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly was also alerted about the increased risk of community transmission.“Ireland is no different to other countries and there remains a continuing and heightened risk that the already evident increase in cases could potentially lead to increasing levels of community transmission in the coming weeks.”NPHET recommended a closing time of 10.30pm for the restaurant and cafe sector except for take-out and delivery and the mandatory wearing of masks for staff. The Government opted instead to implement a closing time of 11pm.NPHET said that while the vast majority of restaurants and gastropubs had adhered to guidelines, there should be “continued robust inspection and enforcement arrangements and the enhancement of these arrangements where necessary.”The team said pubs and bars “pose a particular risk to the spread of Covid 19 as alcohol can make people less aware of social distancing and hygiene and respiratory behaviours, loud atmospheres can increase particles emitted and many pubs and bars can be small spaces with poor ventilation”.A paper was given to the team which detailed international evidence of outbreaks associated with pubs.NPHET said it had “significant and growing concerns” around the increasing case numbers reported each day and incidence of the disease nationally. The public health team also had concerns about the increasing number of cases in vulnerable groups, workplaces and increased levels of cases in younger people and in particular those aged between 25 and 34 years.There was also an “observed shift” in the location of the majority of cases from the greater Dublin region to other counties over the past seven to ten days. “The majority of cases are no longer predominantly limited to the greater Dublin region.”The positivity rate for all tests processed nationally in the last week was 0.7 per cent which had increased over the previous week.NPHET said that 47 new cases and four new clusters were notified in the last week in relation to direct provision centres. There were also ten Covid 19 outbreaks involving the Irish Traveller community, involving 89 casesFour outbreaks open in meat processing plants also been associated with 94 cases.Some 49 per cent of all cases have occurred from “close contact with a confirmed case”.“The proportion of cases that are noted as being attributable to community transmission appears to be stable.” The team said it was critically important that there be low levels of community transmission in order to protect vulnerable people, open schools and resume healthcare.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4323110.1596658082!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"unpublished pub reopening guidelines remove time limits for customers","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGary Cusack, owner of Mulligan’s pub, Poolbeg St, prepares for reopening. Photograph: Tom HonanDraft guidelines prepared for the planned reopening of pubs would have seen no limit on the length of time drinkers could spend in a pub.Nor would customers have been required to prebook a time slot as long as physical distancing was observed.The guidelines for so-called “wet pubs”, seen by The , were drawn up by Fáilte Ireland in expectation of the August 10th reopening date going ahead.The Government this week decided against moving to phase four of its reopening plan, meaning pubs that do not serve food will remain closed.The draft guidelines state that prebooking and time-limited slots of 105 minutes\u0027 duration would not be a requirement “if physical distancing of two metres is strictly maintained”.If physical distancing was reduced to one metre, prebooked time-limited slots must be in place for customers, which are a maximum of 105 minutes\u0027 duration plus a minimum of 15 minutes between bookings in order to allow for cleaning and to ensure customers could leave and enter without mixing.In terms of physical distancing, customers would also be asked to stand at least two metres away from other groups of people who were not from the same household.A designated employee should also be stationed at front of house to control physical-distancing measures, the document states.“It is the responsibility of supervisors and managers to ensure that customers do not congregate in groups. Customers should be seated at a table except when using the toilet, paying and departing.“Prominent signage must explain current physical-distancing practices. This must be accompanied by clear and visible markings that illustrate the safe distancing protocol throughout the premises.”In terms of smoking areas, the capacity must be reviewed and the amount of seating and stools would have to be reduced to ensure the recommended physical-distancing measures were adhered to.Action planThe guidelines state that before reopening, bars and public houses would need to “review how they work and introduce new practices and procedures to ensure everyone stays safe”.Pub owners would also be told to create an action plan, once pubs reopen, that “must reassure employees and customers that safeguarding their health and safety is of the utmost importance”.They must also “appoint at least one lead worker representative charged with ensuring that Covid-19 measures are strictly adhered to in their workplace”.The guidelines also recommend phased shifts and small teams that have the same combination of people. “This will assist should contact tracing be required.”Employers would also be asked where possible to identify an area on the premises where any customer or employee showing possible Covid-19 symptoms could be isolated from other people.In terms of cleaning, the following items must be cleaned after every use: tables, stools, chairs and seating, trays, bill or tip trays and pens.The guidelines have not yet been published as there have been discussions with industry representatives about customers being allowed to sit at the bar.However, in its advice to Government, the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) said all customers in pubs would have to sit at tables, and not the bar, when pubs eventually do reopen.NPHET also said the wearing of face coverings should be mandatory for members of staff in bars unless there was a partition between the employee and member of the public.NPHET also recommended that, when pubs were eventually reopened, all premises would have to close daily at 10.30pm.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4323122.1596658920!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"hammer blow pub reopening delay alarms rural tds","story":"A Fianna Fáil TD has called for an extraordinary meeting of his party’s Oireachtas members during the Dáil recess to discuss the Government decision to keep pubs closed until September.The Tipperary TD Jackie Cahill was one of dozens of rural parliamentarians who expressed alarm about small country pubs’ chances of survival following a second delay in their reopening schedule.Mr Cahill said he had written to Government chief whip Jack Chambers requesting him to convene a special meeting of the parliamentary party within the next week.It came as Ministers privately expressed concern about the Cabinet’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic, with some questioning the messaging coming from the Department of the Taoiseach.One source said there were growing fears that the pandemic would become “increasingly political” amid tensions over the way in which plans are being announced.Some Ministers singled out the decision not to reopen pubs and said a plan should have been devised to support the sector and it should have been announced alongside the news of pushing back the roadmap to reopening.Rural TDs and Senators from across a range of parties, and Independents, have expressed concern at the three-week delay, the second in a row.The Rural Independent Group wrote to the Taoiseach seeking an urgent meeting for what they described as a “hammer blow to the heart of rural Ireland”.“It’s not enough for the Government to say pubs can apply for the restart grant, as many of these pubs simply will not make it that far, said its leader, Mattie McGrath.Rural isolationNiamh Smyth, a Fianna Fáil TD for Cavan-Monaghan, said many rural pubs had already been on a knife edge and the continuing delay might undermine their future existence.“These pubs are dotted around the countryside and are a focal point for a particular generation who would otherwise suffer from rural isolation. These are family businesses that depend on the pubs being open to help rear their families.“Some might now decide to call it a day unless there is some incentive or compensation to remain open.”Fergus O’Dowd, a Fine Gael TD for Louth, said there was a need to support publicans with ongoing costs that they have no income to meet.“They do play a key part of our social life. They do accept that health is wealth, but they are suffering. They are huge employers locally,” he said.Ciarán Cannon, a Fine Gael TD for Galway East, owns a pub in Athenry but said he agreed with the decision.“I think it was the right decision. If you assemble a group of experts and they say it’s not safe for people to congregate in these settings, it is not safe.“For me the first priority is to get children back to school,” he said.Senator Eugene Murphy of Fianna Fáil said there were ided views but all agreed it was a huge crisis for rural publicans. “They are very disturbed. I will be pressurising government to come up with something, otherwise many will not be reopening.”His constituency colleague, Michael Fitzmaurice, argued that the reopening of pubs in a responsible manner would lessen the problem of house parties taking place across the country.“While I understand the concerns of the health experts, I believe that pubs can reopen safely,” he said.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"\u0026lsquoWhat frightened me the most was how we got used to the piles of dead bodies\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash survivorIndia\u0026rsquos supreme court handed site to Hindus last year in culmination of complex disputeChina says attempts by Washington to engage more closely with Taipei \u0026lsquodoomed to fail\u0026rsquoCountry\u0026rsquos move closer to China set to be confirmed after unusually subdued pollThree men stuck on tiny Pikelot Island after boat ran out of fuel spotted by military aircraftAustralian state to deploy military, impose hefty fines to enforce Covid-19 isolationNorth Korea subject to UN sanctions since 2006 over nuclear and ballistic missile programsAt least 29 killed in terror group\u0026rsquos assault on prison in eastern city of JalalabadPolice officers and government officials suspended following deaths in Punjab stateInfections surge in Latin America while China reports highest total since MarchPro-democracy opposition, which was seeking a majority, says move politically motivatedCountry records first Covid death after finding virus lurking in tourist city of DanangInternational lawmakers condemn move as \u0026lsquounacceptable obstructions of democratic process\u0026rsquoAustralian state reports daily record of 723 new infections as PM calls for patienceNajib convicted of all seven charges in first trial linked to multibillion dollar scandalHarry Harris\u0026rsquos facial hair had offended some South Koreans with reminder of Japanese ruleGood-natured crowd witnesses Chinese officials moving in as US consulate closesExperts say unfolding disaster exacerbated by mistimed lockdown ordered by Narendra ModiMove is seen as a retaliation for China\u0026rsquos removal from its consulate in Houston, TexasThere is a real fear in China that things are starting to spin out of controlStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4321862.1596554372!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"citizens in brexit britain clamour for german passports study shows","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAn anti-Brexit demonstrator waves a Union flag alongside an EU flag outside the Houses of Parliament in London in 2018. Photograph: Tolga AkmenAFPGetty Images Britons have rushed for the exits of Brexit Britain, a new study suggests, sparking a brain drain on a scale last seen during the 2004 EU accession of central and eastern European countries – but in the opposite direction. The joint research report, by Berlin’s Social Science Centre and the University of Oxford’s new Berlin outpost, shows that post-Brexit immigrants in Germany are prepared to accept higher risk and even lower pay and conditions to start a new life outside the UK.Outward migration from the UK to EU neighbours has jumped 30 per cent in the last four years, to around 17,000 people annually, with about half attributable to what researchers term the “collective uncertainty” Brexit vote.That uncertainty is visible, too, in naturalisation applications. Compared with pre-Brexit figures, UK citizen applications for another EU passport have jumped 500 per cent – and 2,000 per cent for Germany.“We’re observing a new social migration phenomena and a redefining of what it means to be British-European,” said Daniel Tetlow, a co-author of the study. “In 2019, Brits came in just behind Turks in numbers receiving German citizenship – way ahead of Poles, Romanians, Iraqis or Syrians.”During the same period migration among other EU member states showed no comparable spikes and, in many cases, stagnated.As well as migration data, researchers Daniel Tetlow and Dr Daniel Auer conducted 46 qualitative, semi-structured face-to-face interviews with British migrants across Germany – a popular destination for a erse cohort of UK emigrants in the last decades.The interviews, covering arrivals from 2007 to 2019, showed a clear ide between pre- and post-Brexit arrivals. Two-thirds of the latter group were prepared to accept a pay cut, or a pay freeze as part of their UK escape plan. They were also significantly greater risk-takers than earlier arrivals: a 40-something male IT consultant said he was still hunting for work in Germany but that “the advantages still outweigh the uncertainty that Brexit brought on my family”.Brexit pushA third of the post-Brexit arrivals conceded they would not have moved had the UK voted to remain in the EU in June 2016. Within 12 weeks of that vote, half of them had departed the UK, compared to the 12 months a majority of pre-Brexit arrivals spent planning their move.“The referendum happened in 2016 – and we immediately changed our minds about buying a house in Bristol,” said one interviewee, a 40-something male academic. “Our whole emigration decision hung on the referendum result.”One-third of the recent group said Brexit had caused direct mental health problems or depression and, in what researchers called an “irony” of Brexit, new arrivals expressed a greater determination to integrate into German society, in particular by learning German, than in the past.A 30-something female translator who arrived in 2015 said, in her subjective experience, many UK citizens in Germany “do not recognise Britain any longer, and feel ashamed to call themselves British, drawing instead on regional and local identities like Scottish, Welsh, Lancastrian, from Yorkshire.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Now it is the Italians who regard the likes of the US and Brazil with anguish and sympathy.Italy has avoided the kind of second wave – or prolongation of the first wave – that has caused such concern in other countries, including Spain, France and Germany.For the past few weeks, Italy has registered around 150-300 new cases each day, many of them imported by migrants or workers returning from abroad.Deaths are down to single digits each day, a dramatic reduction from the dark days of March and April.On Monday, there were just 159 new cases and 12 deaths, while on Tuesday there were 190 new cases and five deaths. The country’s death toll is just over 35,000.Consensus is emerging as to how the Italians managed to control – the word defeat is far too premature – a virus that went onto ravage so many other countries.There were two key factors: a strict nationwide lockdown which prevented the virus from spreading from badly-affected northern regions to the rest of the country and the rigid enforcement of health protocols such as the wearing of face masks and social distancing.The lockdown, imposed in early March, averted the diffusion of the virus to the dysfunctional south of Italy, where underfunded hospitals lack the resources of those in the wealthy north.  Experts said this would have been a catastrophe. The lockdown was tough, interminable and yet largely respected. For weeks, Italians were not allowed out of their homes unless they had unavoidable work commitments, had to shop for food or buy medicine.Police cars patrolled the streets, relaying messages through megaphones ordering people to stay at home.People caught riding their bikes for pleasure rather than to get to work were heavily fined passengers on buses who did not wear masks were promptly kicked off by the drivers.Italy had one of the world’s toughest lockdowns, according to the Government Response Stringency Index, which compares the measures taken by nations around the world to combat the virus.All of this came at a heavy price – Italy’s GDP is predicted to drop by at least 10 per cent this year as a result of the closure of industry and businesses.But it seems to have worked, and a report released this week showed the extent to which the lockdown shielded the centre and south of Italy from the pandemic.The report, by the Italian health ministry and the national statistics agency, found that nearly 1.5 million Italians have come into contact with the coronavirus – six times more than the official figure.It revealed sharp regional differences – in the northern region of Lombardy, which was hardest hit by the pandemic, 7.5 per cent of the population tested positive for coronavirus antibodies.In Sicily, which was barely touched by the virus, just 0.3 per cent have antibodies, and in half a dozen other southern regions less than one per cent of residents had virus antibodies.Dr Franco Locatelli, a key government adviser on the pandemic, said the geographic variability in the results showed that the lockdown was absolutely crucial in sparing central and southern Italy from the same epidemiological wave that hit the north.The report “confirms that the establishment of red zones in the northern regions and then the national lockdown broke the chain of transmission, separating the north from the south and the islands (of Sicily and Sardinia),” said Roberto Speranza, the health minister.Since the lockdown was eased, anti-coronavirus protocols have been maintained. On buses, trains and ferries, it is compulsory to wear masks and compliance is close to 100 per cent.There has been a remarkable level of consensus over the need to keep wearing masks and they have become part of the fabric of life, with people looping them over their elbows or slipping them into a handbag when they are not needed.Office workers who have returned to work have their temperature tested on arrival and are required to wear masks in communal areas of their offices.Bottles of hand sanitiser and pedal-operated dispensers are ubiquitous and companies have cut the number of people allowed to occupy offices.As Italians flock to the coast for their holidays, even beach bars require people to wear masks as they line up for a cold Peroni or a café macchiato in their bikinis and board shorts– and the majority comply.“It’s clear that we won’t return to normal living until we have a vaccine. It will be found, but it will probably take two years before it is available to everyone,” said Giorgo Palu, a professor of virology at Padua University and a former president of the European Society for Virology.The popular stereotype of Italians being unruly, undisciplined and resistant to following rules and regulations has been turned on its head in the last five months.There may have been cultural factors at play. Italians tend to be anxious over their health – children are told not to run around and sweat too much in the summer and ordered not to swim within an hour or two of eating adults obsess over the dangers of catching a chill or worse from air-conditioning or draughts.Angst over personal health may have encouraged widespread respect of the anti-virus measures.“The trend is positive, thanks to the containment measures that were taken,” Marcello Tavio, the president of the Italian Society of Infectious Diseases, told La Repubblica newspaper.But the hard-won gains of the last few months could easily be lost if people drop their guard and start relaxing.Health experts and ministers are constantly warning that disaster lurks around the corner if Italy becomes too complacent.There is alarm over young people going out at night, crowding into piazzas to socialise, drink and flirt.“We are seeing too many gatherings, with people not taking the necessary precautions,” said Dr Tavio.The holiday island of Capri, near Naples, was so alarmed at the number of tourists congregating in its piazzas that it ordered masks to be worn outside as well as inside.The colder temperatures of the autumn and winter could lead to a dramatic spike in contagions unless health protocols are maintained, said Dr Tavio.“We have to be very careful in the autumn, when the favourable climate conditions of summer will end. The health system will need to intercept new cases at the earliest possible stage.”There is also concern over immigrant workers from Eastern European countries like Romania, and Asian countries like Bangladesh, bringing new cases into the country. A new wave of illegal migrants arriving from Tunisia and Libya is also causing alarm, with some of them found to have Covid-19.Mr Speranza, the health minister, says Italy is by no means out of danger yet.  “We cannot lower our guard. We may be out of the storm, but we are not yet in a safe harbour.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"beirut explosion chemicals abandoned russian businessman triggered","story":"The timer was ticking from six years ago, when 2,700 tonnes of ammonium nitrate were taken from an impounded ship and stored in the port of Beirut. It was a massive bomb just waiting to go off a disaster equivalent to an earthquake measuring 3.5 on the Richter scale.At least 100 are dead and an astonishing 4,000 are injured in a catastrophe in one of the Middle East’s greatest cities. About 300,000 more are homeless.And all because Igor Grechushkin, the Russian owner of the Rhosus ship, carrying the deadly cargo from Georgia to Mozambique, declared bankruptcy on an unscheduled stop, and was forced to abandon it there. It left the authorities with a fearsome problem, and one they appear to have dealt with by crossing their fingers and hoping for the best.  Not for nothing was ammonium nitrate, used in farming as a powerful fertiliser, the explosive  of choice for the IRA during the Troubles. The high-profile mainland bombings at the Baltic Exchange and Bishopsgate in the City of London in 1992 and 1993, and the blast at Canary Wharf in February 1996, bringing the first IRA ceasefire to an end, were all fuelled by it. Even the most potent of those devices contained just one five-thousandth of the ammonium nitrate which exploded in Beirut on Tuesday. It was also used by Timothy McVeigh in his two-tonne bomb that claimed 168 lives in Oklahoma City in 1995. And it is the Taliban’s preferred option too. For all that, ammonium nitrate can be safely stored. It is stable, under the right conditions. There are international protocols on how much can be held, where, and under what security precautions. It must be kept away from fuel and sources of heat, and many countries require carbon carbonate to be added, which makes it safer.Leaving it dumped in one place since 2104 and in such quantity was always likely to end badly, said Stewart Walker, associate professor in Forensic, Environmental and Analytical Chemistry at Flinders University in South Australia. Philip Ingram, an explosives expert and former military intelligence officer, said: “Ammonium nitrate can degrade over time, all the more so if it is stored badly. If it starts to degrade, it gives off heat, and that tends to self-perpetuate. Pressure builds.”All it needs then is an appropriate spark, serious enough ignition. The IRA used small amounts of Semtex. Here, according to reports, it came when a welder was making repairs to improve the security at the warehouse. It is suspected that the building contained fireworks. When the explosion ripped through the port, the firefighters trying to contain the initial blaze are believed to have been incinerated. Jeffrey Lewis, a missile expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in Monterey California, said the footage supported the firework-as-ignition theory: “Some of the videos show munitions, what I call popcorning, exploding like ‘pop, pop, pop’. It’s very common to see fires detonate explosives. If you have a fire raging next to something explosive, and you don’t put it out, it blows up.” First, the video footage shows a fire with white smoke, consistent, says Professor Walker,  with ammonium nitrate burning. Then, there is a massive blast, orange and brown in colour, consistent with nitrous dioxide, given off when ammonium nitrate explodes.  And finally there is a massive white mushroom cloud, which evoked comparisons to Hiroshima, when the Americans dropped the nuclear bomb that ended World War Two in August 1945. In fact, according to Mr Ingram, it is water condensation, common in massive explosions in humid climates, created by the explosion’s massive supersonic waves.  Those waves then blasted out through Beirut, causing apocalyptic scenes of damage up to 10km away. According to reports, the blast could be heard 150 miles away in Cyprus, while the info-graphic below shows the destruction felt across the city:Mr Ingram explains: “With high-end detonations, supersonic pressure gets magnified, and the bigger the explosion, the more it gets magnified. There are two effects: blowing and sucking.“The over-pressure wave blows everything over in its way, and then there’s a big following dip in pressure. That sucks everything back in. “The bigger the over-pressure wave, the bigger the under-pressure one. Floors rise on the over-pressure wave, and fall on the under-pressure, and it explains why high-rise buildings can collapse.”Mr Ingram says: “It really does depend how close. But as the over-pressure wave passes over, the inidual would feel the air being sucked from his lungs. And if very close, it is possible that his organs would explode. The effect is similar to being in a major car crash.“But that will be very, very few. Most of those who have died will have been hit by falling buildings or debris, and it is the glass and shrapnel that are responsible for such a massive toll of injuries The big shortage at the hospitals will be for blood supplies.” The nitrate came from the Rhosus cargo ship, which was carrying the explosive chemical from Georgia to Mozambique in 2013 when it made an unscheduled stop in Beirut, according to reports from the time. While commonly used as an industrial fertiliser, ammonia nitrate is also a component in mining explosives. Mozambique has significant mineral and mining industries.Mr Grechushkin declared bankruptcy and was forced to abandon the ship there after Lebanese authorities prevented it from sailing on, crew members said. Several sailors were stranded in the country for months.“Owing to the risks associated with retaining the ammonium nitrate on board the vessel, the port authorities discharged the cargo onto the port’s warehouses,” a shipping report from 2015 said.“The vessel and cargo remain to date in port awaiting auctioning andor proper disposal.”Lebanese customs officials repeatedly asked for the matter to be handled but said they had received no reply. The  attempted to contact Mr Grechushkin for comment.Lebanon has not tied the Rhosus’s cargo to the blast.Port General Manager Hassan Koraytem told OTV on Wednesday that the material had been put in a warehouse on a court order, adding that they knew then the material was dangerous but not to this degree.It is negligence, an official source familiar with the findings of early investigations told Reuters, adding that the issue on storing the material safely had come before several committees and judges and nothing was done to order the material be removed or disposed.Professor Walker told The : “There were a host of circumstances which should never have been allowed to happen: there was too much in one place it needs to be compartmentalised to leave it there for so long is bad practice, and, of course it was a place with a high population density. It could and should have been avoided.” More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"beiruts explosion years making","story":"Lord knows the Lebanese have suffered. They stumbled out of one of the most brutal civil wars in modern times and into a conflict with Israel. Just as it was recovering from that, neighbouring Syria exploded in protest - sending a wave of refugees its way.Lebanon miraculously buffered the storm, only to be hit by an economic crisis so deep it has plunged most of the country into poverty. Trauma - its citizens often grimly joke - has become part of the national psyche.Yet Tuesday’s explosion was something else. I fear it is more than anyone - evenly the famously resilient Lebanese - can bear.I spent more than four years in the capital, Beirut, as a Middle East correspondent for The . It’s a complicated and tumultuous place where tempers and passions run high. If you don’t fall in love with it, you’ve misunderstood it. If you don’t hate it, you’ve probably done something wrong.Anyone who has ever left it - which I did in February - knows you leave a piece of your heart behind.Checking in on Wednesday on friends and old neighbours who had become more like family, there was no good news. Most live in and around the historic entertainment district of Gemmayzeh, which is so close to the port that it was effectively a ground zero.One friend took shards of glass to her head and needed stitches, while one was found badly concussed by the site after he had raced down on his motorbike to report on the initial fire.My “Lebanese mother” Christina broke her arm when she was thrown by the blast’s force. Beirut’s health minister urged people to leave the city in case of any residual noxious fumes, but the 52-year-old mother of three - like most others - had nowhere else to go. She swept up the window fragments and put the broken frame back on her broken bed and tried to sleep.Another sobbed down the phone to me as she walked through a hole in her apartment where her front door had been: “Kil shi, kil shi (everything, everything) my whole life is gone.”  There’s little left of the places we used to frequent: Anise bar where we used to drown our sorrows after a tough day reporting the little fruit and veg shop on the corner and the New York Times reporter’s French mandate apartment where I had my farewell party.It is hard to overestimate the damage done to a country half the size of Wales. More than 300,000 people - a fourth of Beirut’s population - have been made homeless overnight. The anaemic state, without serious international help, is incapable of rebuilding. Many in Lebanon had predicted an explosion, though few could have imagined it would come in the form of the 2,750-tonne blast that would devastate half the city.It’s hard to pinpoint exactly where it all went wrong for Lebanon. The country - described in better times variously as the Paris of the Middle East for its glamour and the Switzerland of the region for its exemplary banking sector - had looked to be thriving in recent years.Tourist numbers were up, the beaches along its beautiful Mediterranean coastline were packed. The middle classes appeared more comfortable than they had ever been.For those who had money at least, Beirut was a pleasant enough place to live. But it belied a much more complicated reality.Lebanon had borrowed up to its eyeballs and it was only a matter of time before the bubble burst. Corruption and greed among its ruling class - warlords who had gripped onto power since the end of the civil war in 1990 - had helped bleed the country dry. The politicians didn’t even bother trying to hide it, simply blaming one another.Constant spats between the competing religious sects over who would be awarded the spoils had left them virtually incapable of governing.The problem with Lebanon, as Marwan Muasher, vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, put it, is that “corruption has been democratised, it’s not sitting centrally with one man. It’s all over”.Beirutis on Tuesday began cursing their politicians before an official investigation was even underway. Experience had taught them that either incompetence or negligence would be behind the disaster, which has claimed the lives of at least 100 people and injured thousands more.Initial reports suggested that authorities had seized several-thousand tonnes of highly combustible ammonium nitrate and had been storing it at the port. The blast was suspected to have been triggered by a fire started by a welder.Questions will soon be asked as to who signed off on keeping such a large quantity of a volatile and explosive substance stored in a densely populated civilian area. “What exploded today in Beirut is not just ammonium nitrate. It is above all corruption, mismanagement, incompetency and cynical disregard for the security and lives of people,” wrote one local, Dyab Abou Jahjah, who expressed the thoughts of many of his countrymen.Karl Sharro, a well-known Lebanese architect and satirist, tweeted: “Negligence, incompetence, complacency, corruption, nepotism this immoral and parasitical political class has destroyed Beirut and the whole country.”By Wednesday, the phrase hang up the nooses was trending on Twitter in Lebanon.Lebanon had for months been teetering towards ruin.By the time I left Beirut in February there were daily street protests against government corruption. Saad Hariri, the prime minister (the son of a previous premier), stepped down only to be replaced by another equally loathed businessman.Then coronavirus hit. Lebanon had the sense to shut down - fearing that its already beleaguered hospitals would not be able to cope with a major outbreak. But the lockdown sent its poorest - rendered jobless - spiralling into even deeper poverty.At the same time, the country was beginning to feel the full effect of its free-falling economy. The country’s currency lost up to 80 per cent in value in a matter of weeks. Last month it became the first in the Middle East in history to experience hyperinflation.Its once proud and thriving middle class have been forced to sell their possessions in online markets.There was no point looking to the government for help, it had been unable to provide the basics to its people - including water and electricity - even during the “good times”.On Monday, the country’s foreign minister resigned, warning that a lack of vision and a will to implement reforms risked turning Lebanon into a “failed state”. There is little to suggest it can do much now to avoid its wretched fate.Thousands in the Lebanese capital would have had a restless sleep in their dark, hot and windowless homes on Tuesday night. The windows may have been knocked out by the blast, but the darkness was of the country’s own making.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"officials long called chemicals behind blast removed beirut","story":"For years Lebanese port officials had called for the removal of dangerous chemicals stored in a waterfront warehouse that exploded in a blast that damaged homes of 300,000 Beirut residents and killed over 100 people, according to preliminary investigations on Wednesday.Tuesday’s blast was likely caused by the detonation of more than 2,700 tons of ammonium nitrate that had been stored at the dock since being confiscated from a cargo ship in 2014, according to Lebanese Interior Minister Mohammed Fahmi.The industrial chemical is commonly used as fertiliser and is not reactive on its own but it can explode when detonated by an ignition source.Reports suggested a fire started by a welding accident may have ignited fireworks, causing the stored chemicals to explode.The explosion was the most powerful in the history of Beirut, a city that lived through a 15-year civil war and is now suffering a devastating financial crisis borne of decades of corruption and economic mismanagement.The devastation came into sharper focus on Wednesday, as the death toll from the catastrophe rose to 135, with Hamad Hassan, the health minister, warning it could climb higher as dozens of people remained missing amid ongoing rescue efforts.At least 5,000 people were also injured.The UK will provide a £5 million aid package to Lebanon, Dominic Raab, the Foreign Secretary, said yesterday, and Britain has offered medical workers, and search-and-rescue experts with sniffer dogs to find survivors.The Ministry of Defence confirmed that an advance party of Armed Forces personnel would be deployed to assist with the fallout.The Defence Secretary said HMS Enterprise, a survey vessel currently based in Cyprus, would be sent to help Beirut prepare to rebuild.Mr Raab said he spoke to Hassan Diab, the Lebanese prime minister, who he said promised a “full, thorough and rigorous” investigation into the blast, and accountability for those responsible.Donald Trump yesterday continued to float the idea that the blast may have been caused by a bomb, despite his defence secretary Mark Esper saying it appeared to have been an accident. Mr Trump said: How can you say accident? Somebody left some terrible explosive-type devices around perhaps... Perhaps it was an attack. I don’t think anybody can say.The blast, which caused tremors measuring 4.5 on the Richter scale, left a crater some 150 metres across on the capital’s waterfront (see map below).Around half of the city was damaged, according to Marwan Abboud, the governor of Beirut, who estimated that 300,000 people had been left homeless.The nitrates blamed for the explosion likely came from a Moldovan-flagged cargo ship that made an unscheduled maintenance stop in Beirut in 2013 en route to Mozambique from Georgia. Reports at the time said the Rhosus cargo ship was prevented from leaving port due to its poor state.Its owner declared bankruptcy soon afterwards, leaving the vessel, its cargo and its crew stranded, according to a Lebanese law firm that obtained an order to have the ship arrested on behalf of unnamed creditors.Owing to the risks associated with retaining the ammonium nitrate on board the vessel, the port authorities discharged the cargo onto the port\u0027s warehouses. The vessel and cargo remain to date in port awaiting auctioning andor proper disposal,” the firm Baroudi \u0026amp Associates wrote in a 2015 article published by shiparrested.The head of Beirut port and the head of customs both said on Wednesday that letters were sent to Lebanon’s judiciary asking for the removal of the nitrates, but no action was taken.Port General Manager Hassan Koraytem told OTV the material had been put in a warehouse on a court order, adding that they knew then the material was dangerous but not to this degree.We requested that it be re-exported but that did not happen. We leave it to the experts and those concerned to determine why, Badri Daher, director-general of Lebanese Customs, told broadcaster LBCI.Another source close to a port employee said a team that inspected the material six months ago warned it could blow up all of Beirut if not removed.Two documents seen by Reuters showed Lebanese Customs had asked the judiciary in 2016 and 2017 to request that the concerned maritime agency re-export or approve the sale of the ammonium nitrate.One document cited similar requests in 2014 and 2015.It is negligence, an official source familiar with the findings of early investigations told Reuters, adding that the issue of storing the material safely had come before several committees and judges and nothing was done to order the material be removed.Lebanon’s cabinet said on Wednesday that it was placing an unspecified number of port officials under house arrest while it investigated how the explosive materials came to be stored at the port for years.It also declared a two-week state of emergency in the city and approved the allocation of 100 billion Lebanese pounds (£50 million) to deal with the crisis.That sum will only be a small fraction of the amount needed for reconstruction. The disaster will have a calamitous effect on Lebanon’s already collapsing economy.The port, through which much of the country’s imported food and goods arrive, was largely flattened, and much of Beirut’s commercial district was heavily damaged.Destroyed wheat silos near the epicentre of the blast held up to 85 per cent of the country’s grain, mountains of which could be seen spilling into the sea on Wednesday.It has left the nation with less than a month’s reserves of the grain, the economy minister said on Wednesday.The scale of the tragedy prompted a court in the Netherlands to postpone its verdict in the trial of four men accused of the 2005 assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri.The UN-backed Special Tribunal for Lebanon was due to give a verdict in the trial this Friday, but delayed it until August 18 “out of respect for the countless victims of the devastating explosion that shook Beirut on 4 August”, according to a statement by the court on Wednesday.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands exam result fiasco coming england","story":"The furore that has broken out over Scottish examination results – exams which the children did not sit because of lockdown – and the downgrading of teacher-assessed grades is likely to be dwarfed by the uproar that will follow the publication of GCSE and A-level results for England later this month.The system for results that has been arrived at in England is deeply flawed, devised behind closed doors with a minimum of transparency. It hits the schools the Government should be most proud of – the rapidly improving “turnaround” schools that have been on a steep upward curb in recent years. It is also contrary to natural justice, imposing a life sentence on children, with no effective right of appeal.The Government faced an unprecedented situation in March when it became clear that public examinations could not happen. It was inevitable that a knee-jerk response would produce a solution with weaknesses in it. The fault lies not so much in the original concept – results based on a combination of teacher-predicted grades and the historical performance of schools – but rather in the fact that, having made its mind up, the Government refused to change the system where it clearly needed to.Much of its thinking was influenced by the proven fact that teachers tend to overestimate their pupils’ grades. To counter this, the Government decided that predicted grades from teachers would be run alongside the three-year historical performance of schools – and if the Scottish experience is anything to go by, it is the historical performance of schools that will be most listened to, not the teacher predictions.This is a major problem for schools that have been under a process of rapid improvement in the past three years. GCSE pupils who started their course at the start of that period will often have had to challenge the pre‑existing school culture to succeed. Their reward? To be marked on the performance of earlier peer groups. The current system works fairly only for those schools whose performance has been static for three years. It is also grossly unfair to year groups who are unusually gifted. In effect, the system says to pupils: “You and your school will be judged on what your school was, not what it is now.”The Government’s response to these criticisms is laughable. It claims there is an appeals process in England, but a school or a pupil cannot appeal against what they deem an unfair result. They can only appeal on the grounds that the school did not follow due process in submitting its estimates, falling prey to another dominant illness of our time, the focus on process to the detriment of outcome.The other solution proposed by the Government, that there will be “resits” in late autumn, is equally useless. The majority of pupils in UK schools have missed a massive amount of schooling since March. How are they going to be ready for public examinations by late autumn? The only pupils who will be prepared for such examinations will be those whose parents have been able to afford expensive private tuition.Yes, the Government is putting money into “catch-up” schemes, but it is impossible for them to compensate for what has been lost in the time available, however well-meaning they are. It is no secret that the closure of schools has had the greatest effect on disadvantaged pupils. The current system for examination grades punishes this same group twice over.There was a simple answer to the problems created by a system that was dominated unfairly by historical precedent, and which coped with inflated grade predictions. There is an army of examiners and school inspectors out there, including the recently retired, who could have been used to create a fair appeals system, by looking at the work on which a school’s predicted grade was based and assessing whether or not it was fair in any given case.Expensive? Many of the people I know would have given their time free of charge in the face of national crisis. Too lengthy? The appeals process after conventional public examinations takes months to complete. Too much trouble? Only if we do not value the future of our children. These grades are a life sentence.Martin Stephen is former high master of St Paul’s School and chair of governors of an inner-city comprehensiveMore from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"swedens economy outperforms european countries pandemic","story":"Sweden\u0027s economy has fared better during the peak three months of the coronavirus pandemic than the European average, the country\u0027s statistics agency has reported, adding to growing evidence that the decision to avoid a full lockdown is paying economic idends. The country\u0027s gross domestic product (GDP) fell by 8.6 per cent in April and June, compared to the preceding three months, Statistics Sweden reported. The average drop of the ten member states who have so far submitted flash estimates for the three months is 11.9 per cent, the EU\u0027s statistics agency reported last week. Spain, France and Italy did still worse, with their economies contracting by 18.5, 13.8, and 12.4 percent respectively.   This is the biggest quarterly drop for Sweden since 1980, meaning the country has taken a bigger hit than in either its 1990s financial crisis or in the 2008 banking crash. Magdalena Andersson, the finance minister, nonetheless welcomed the figures at a press conference following the announcement.   It\u0027s a historic fall, but, at the same time, less than in many other countries, and actually less than I was expecting back in June, she said. Sweden kept open primary and lower secondary schools, kindergartens, restaurants, bars offices and shops throughout the pandemic, although both the government and the Public Health Agency have insisted this was not motivated by a wish to protect the economy.Robert Bergqvist, chief economist at the country\u0027s SEB Bank, said that the official figures confirmed trends his analysts had been seeing for some time.We could see that we had a substantial slowdown, but not of the same magnitude as we saw for other countries, and today we saw that it was correct to say, \u0027yes, Sweden will be affected, but the impact should be a bit less\u0027.He said there were three reasons for the milder hit.The first is this flexible attitude to lockdowns, the second is that we have a different composition to our economy - we\u0027re not very dependent on tourism - and the final reason is that the Nordic countries have a better digital infrastructure, which means we can move the economy into this digital world.Sweden\u0027s neighbours Denmark and Norway, which have yet to publish GDP figures for the second quarter, both imposed much more thoroughgoing lockdowns, but are, according to many forecasts, still expected to see a slightly lower fall in GDP than Sweden, largely because of Sweden\u0027s substantial iron ore, steel and forestry industries. A succession of Swedish companies have over the past three weeks reported better profits for the second quarter than expected, while Handelsbanken, which serves many small businesses in the country, has said the number of bankruptcies and bad loans it is seeing remains low.Mr Bergqvist said Swedish business leaders he spoke to were optimistic. They are saying that they are surprised by the quick recovery in demand, he said. We still have unutilised resources in the Swedish economy, but we have started the recovery, that is very obvious. The big question right now is how strong this recovery is and also, whether it is sustainable. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"travel news two cruise lines discover cases covid 19","story":"Holidays have resumed in Greece since it appeared on the UK\u0026#39s \u0026#39travel corridors\u0026#39 list last monthCoronavirus latest: Pubs and shops don\u0027t need to close, says ministerHow to get travel insurance should you choose to ignore FCO advice​The best options for a last-minute holiday ​Sign up to  Travel\u0027s newsletterGreeks and holidaymakers have been told to stick to rules aimed at controlling Covid-19, as cases creep up in the country. Greece recorded 121 new cases on Tuesday, which is the highest daily tally since April 22.

I moved to the coast seven years ago and quickly realised that the price we pay for living, quietly, in paradise for most of the year is that in summer we have to share it with the visitors. They bring a busy, buzzy energy and pour money into the local economy.I’m not a Nimby – indeed, I’m actually part of the tourist industry. As a volunteer tour guide for Southwold Lighthouse, I love to hear the excited “Wow!” as visitors finally get to the top. This year, the lighthouse is closed and the village fête has been cancelled for the first time since the war, yet we have more tourists than ever. A few weeks ago, as lockdown eased, beaches suddenly overflowed, roads were jammed with illegally parked cars and litter rained down on beauty spots like confetti – all of which prompted the anxious question: “If everyone who normally goes abroad this year staycations at home, what effect will that have on our tourist towns and coastal village destinations?”Now we know. The seaside village of Salcombe in Devon has increased its population by 1,000 per cent, and the mayor spoke this week more in sorrow than in anger: “Everybody is exhausted and overwhelmed. The businesses need the customers, but we would like a little respect for the town we love.”What does that mean? I think we all know. It’s summed up by the bestselling T-shirt, which reads: “Be Kind”. But we’re not always kind, are we? There’s a tension, a resentment, a frenetic bolshiness, from some visitors and locals. I admit I’m upset when our sand dunes are used as lavatories (even though the public lavatories are open) and the “dog waste” bins are crammed with disposable barbecues, bottles, nappies – and once even a mattress.And I turn into a “furious flagger” when car drivers seem to be under the bizarre impression that our village street is the M25, rather than a pavement-free thoroughfare filled with children, dogs, horses and cyclists for which the speed limit is officially a constipated snail’s pace. Let’s face it, we’re all on edge. We’ve been scared, confused and bored for months, veering between feeling gung-ho and guarded. We’ve locked down, ventured out, rushed back in again, washed our hands until they feel as silky as a Brillo pad, spent hours trying to get a refund on flights and holidays – or an online food delivery slot. We’ve danced the Food Aisle Fandago, as we dip and swerve round each other to get to the sliced ham or the curly kale. In our local Co-op we’ve had a number of “Maskgate” confrontations, diffused by the wonderfully patient staff. If locals seem unwelcoming and visitors tetchy, it’s because we’ve all been traumatised for months. And it’s not over. We’re all still scared – and when we’re frightened we tend to overreact.So, if you’re staycationing, let me say we want you to come and have a lovely time here. More than that, we need you to come, for the sake of our small businesses. But as a high percentage of our population are older and sometimes vulnerable, we would just ask that you tread softly and safely, with patience, good humour – and kindness. In return, we’ll be kind to you – unless you come into the Co-op without a mask.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/05/11/18/germany.jpg","title":"schools reopen coronavirus test trace system headteachers","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.All students are expected to return in SeptemberThe Independent employs reporters around the world to bring you truly independent journalism.

Simon Smith, who leads a primary school in Yorkshire, said test and trace was a “key element” in keeping schools safe. “Parents need to feel all the systems are there,” he told The Independent, ”and that if something does happen, things will happen very, very quickly in terms of the actions that schools will take”. Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“Track and trace is a key part of that,” the headteacher at East Whitby Primary Academy said.His comments come after a study has suggested the government must scale-up its test and trace system - which tells people if they have been contact with someone who has tested positive for coronavirus and to isolate for two weeks – to avoid a second wave of coronavirus infections as schools fully reopen. What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safelyOne of the authors, Chris Bonell, professor of public health sociology at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), said the current testing system has “about 50 per cent coverage”.A government minister said the plan for English schools to welcome all students back next month is “not up for debate” on Tuesday following the study’s publication. Speaking about test and trace, Mr Smith from East Whitby Primary Academy said: “As a headteacher, I feel very little confidence at the moment around the fact we would be informed, or everybody is being informed that should be informed.“It may be people are wandering around with the virus without knowing.”Pepe Di’Iasio, a headteacher near Rotherham, said a scaled-up test and trace system would help his school feel better prepared for the September return. “I think we would all feel better if we had confidence in the system and obviously with four weeks to go,” Mr Di’Iasio, who is also vice president elect of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), told The Independent. “We would rather have that confidence as quickly as possible.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Researchers from University College London and LSHTM simulated various scenarios to examine the possible implications of schools reopening in the UK coupled with broader reopening of society, such as more parents returning to the workplace and increased socialising within the community.The authors of the modelling study – published in The Lancet Child And Adolescent Health - found that “with increased levels of testing... and effective contact tracing and isolation, an epidemic rebound might be prevented”.“Reopening schools fully in September, alongside reopening workplaces in society, without an effective test, trace, isolating (TTI) strategy could result in a second wave of infections between two and 2.3 times the size of the original wave,” Mr Bonell from LSHTM said.“Currently, TTI is not achieving the levels that we modelled. Looking at the NHS reports from the TTI system, it looks like it’s about 50 per cent coverage,” he added.The NAHT, a school leaders’ union, said the new research showed “just how many factors there are to preventing a worsening Covid-19 outbreak, most of which are entirely outside a school’s control”.Efficient test-trace-isolate system needed to reopen schools- studyMinisters still planning to open all English schools in SeptemberMPs criticise school meal voucher scheme for covering M\u0026ampS but not LidlPaul Whiteman, the general secretary, said: “The success of September’s return to school rests as much on what happens outside the school gates as within.”He added: “The government needs to ensure that everyone knows what actions they should be taking to keep everyone safe – we’re all going to need to work together to be successful.”Meanwhile, Richard Bettsworth from ASCL said: “It is very clear that an effective test, trace, and isolate strategy is vital in suppressing the rate of infection, and keeping schools open.” The director of public affairs added: “The government has to make sure that this works at the scale that is necessary.”Schools are expected to fully reopen to all students in September.  A government spokesperson said: “We have rapidly built, from scratch, the largest diagnostic testing industry in British history. Over 16 million tests have been delivered so far and we have the capacity to carry out more than 330,000 tests per day, growing to 500,000 per day by the end of October.“Plans have been put in place to ensure schools can re-open safely. Local health officials, using the latest data, will able to determine the best action to take to help curb the spread of the virus should there be a rise in cases.They added: “The NHS Test and Trace service has now and contacted more than 218,000 people who have tested positive for the virus, or recently been in contact with someone who has tested positive – in order to break the chain of transmission.”Additional reporting by Press Associationtest and trace\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The Germans believed that royal navy ers had entered the vessel and had recovered crucial intelligence information, including a detailed map of German minefields.However, the University of Southampton investigation, led by archaeologist Dr Rodrigo Pacheco-Ruiz, has now assessed the wreck’s approximate depth in November 1917 (48-51 metres) – which suggests that er penetration of the vessel was extremely unlikely.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailMystery of missing Second World War submarine solved after 75 yearsHistorical accounts reveal that HMS P57 spent several days dropping depth charges on the wreck.It’s likely that this was done precisely because it was not possible to physically gain entry to the sunken U-boat. The only way to recover intelligence information was therefore to repeatedly depth charge her in the hope that additional holes in the vessel could be created – and that, as a result, important documents might then float to the surface.Although there are no surviving British records of any such intelligence-gathering coup, senior German naval officials did know about it (although they wrongly assumed that the crucial papers had been recovered by royal navy ers – rather than as floating debris).But how did they know? German historians, working in collaboration with the University of Southampton, are now planning to search the German archives to try to find an answer.It is conceivable that the German navy had obtained the information by listening to royal navy wartime radio communications – or they may have somehow obtained it from British naval sources after the war.During the First World War, it was notoriously difficult to sink German U-boats. However, in late 1917 and 1918, the royal navy developed a number of techniques to reduce the impact of German submarines and to increase the number being sunk.To reduce the German U-boat kill rates, they introduced the convoy system for UK merchant vessels – and to increase British success in destroying German U-boats, they fitted strengthened bows to royal navy anti-submarine vessels (to enable them to ram U-boats) and they developed the first effective depth charges.Both new technologies were employed in the sinking of UC47.And the repeated depth charge attacks on the sunken German submarine seems to have enabled the British to gain crucial intelligence information that would in turn have enabled them to locate and clear the mines that UC47, had laid (thus saving many UK merchant vessels from destruction).The Germans primarily used their U-boats to damage the UK’s war effort – by seeking to blockade Britain and by trying to prevent the UK transporting vital coal, steel, timber and cement (much of which had to be transported from northern Britain to southern Britain by coastal cargo vessels).It was in the second half of 1917 that the royal navy began to defeat the U-boat threat – and the sinking of UC 47 was an important part of that process – particularly so because that particular submarine was one of the most effective in the German navy. Prior to its sinking, it had sunk 56 UK and allied ships in just 13 months.UC47’s end came on 18 November, 1917. All 26 of her crew went down with her. The historical record shows that, through sheer chance, the British patrol boat spotted the German U-boat about 200 yards away, approximately one hour before sunrise. Within 15 seconds, the royal navy vessel launched a devastating surprise attack on the German submarine by ramming her. The impact, at 17 knots, tore through the German vessel’s hull, causing her to start filling up with water. The British vessel then dropped two depth charges on the stricken sub – and quickly marked the position with a buoy.Orkney’s shipwreck graveyard is bursting with lifeA third depth charge was then dropped on the sunken U-boat – and a fourth was targeted at the German vessel as she lay on the seabed at 4pm on 19 November. Large amounts of oil and air bubbles continuously rose from  the wreck to the surface. HMS P57 remained at the attack site for around three whole days. Even as late as 20 November, two days after the attack, personnel on board the British vessel saw very large air bubbles rising to the surface – so there were obviously still sizeable pockets of air in the sunken sub as she languished on the sea floor.The two unmanned ultra-high-tech modern submarines used in the University of Southampton investigation of the German U-boat are operated by the Swedish offshore survey company, MMT – and owned by the Norwegian firm, Reach Subsea.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.A study that judged the attractiveness of women who suffer from endometriosis has been pulled from a medical journal after sparking outrage.The women who contributed to the peer-reviewed research, titled “Attractiveness of women with rectovaginal endometriosis: a case-control study”, never provided their consent to be rated by their appearance and were unaware this was going on.Rectovaginal endometriosis affects roughly five to 12 per cent of women who have endometriosis – a common disorder that affects around 176 million women worldwide – and can put sufferers in severe pain with bowel movements.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesOne in 10 women of reproductive age in the UK has endometriosis, a condition when tissue similar to that which grows inside of the uterus grows outside of the uterus – attaching itself to other organs and causing a great deal of pain and leading to other issues such as infertility.The controversial study, published in the journal Fertility and Sterility, concluded: “Women with rectovaginal endometriosis were judged to be more attractive than those in the two control groups. Moreover, they had a leaner silhouette, larger breasts, and an earlier coitarche”. Coitarche is the age at which someone first engages in sexual intercourse.I spent 9 years battling endometriosis before I knew what was wrongLone Hummelshoj, chief executive of World Endometriosis Society, told The Independent: “The study was ill-conceived by an otherwise respected group of researchers, that have now recognised that their hypothesis and methods were unacceptable, not least because women apparently were not consented to partake in the study. “This is perhaps a stark reminder that too much research in endometriosis is not undertaken with a view to how this benefits those with the disease, ie how it would translate into improved management of the disease — but rather to ‘get another publication under one’s belt’. Journals need to heed this as part of their peer-review process before accepting manuscripts for publications: who will this research study and consequent publication benefit?”The study, which was funded by the University of Milan school of medicine, was first published in 2013 and has since been defended by both those who wrote it and the journal that published it, despite attracting fierce criticism from researchers and endometriosis sufferers.What is endometriosis and how can you spot symptoms?Researchers asked the women about their sexual history, calculated their body mass index, as well as measuring their waist-to-hip ratio and breast-to-underbreast proportion.Dr Jennifer Gunter, an American gynaecologist, hit out at the study when it was first published and said the Fertility Sterility journal should be “ashamed they accepted it for publication”.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We believe that our findings have been partly misinterpreted, but at the same time realise that the article may have caused distress to some people,” the authors said. “Women’s respect is a priority for us, and we are extremely sorry for the discontent the publication originated.”Faye Farthing, of Endometriosis UK, told The Independent the need for carrying out reliable research into endometriosis “cannot be overstated”.She added: “There’s been so little research in the past that we don’t know what causes endometriosis, and until we know the cause a cure cannot be developed. Diagnosis time for endometriosis is an alarming seven and a half years on average, and can have a huge detrimental impact on people’s health and wellbeing, and new research is critical to driving diagnosis time down.“We call on the government to invest in research to find the cause of the disease, better treatment and management options, and one day a cure. Without investment in reliable research, those with endometriosis will continue to face huge barriers in accessing the right treatment at the right time”.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

When you respond to someone who posts lies about you, that is not harassment.”The fall-out, which took place in July, began when Kweli responded to a tweet Moody had made in which she suggested rappers often marry light-skinned black women.Ellen Pompeo says white people get ‘defensive’ about black cultureRichard Bacon shares dramatic video of his car going up in flames“I mean, is any of this really any of your business?” replied Kweli, beginning a series of negative tweets to Moody that went on for weeks.Moody claimed that, at one point, Kweli was tweeting at her incessantly for “12 hours straight” and her personal information was leaked by fans of the artist.Rapper Noname criticised Kweli’s actions at the time, tweeting: “The silence from male rappers while talib kweli harassed black women for weeks, disgusting.”Kweli is best known for being one half of the hip hop duo Black Star, with Mos Def. Over the course of his 20-year career, he has collaborated with Pharrell Williams, Kanye West and J Dilla.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He has put lives at risk. Imagine if someone he has had contact with catches this and suffers very badly.”The 79-year-old Labour member added he himself liked a pint.Father dragged from side of dying daughter by police“But I’ve not had one since March,” he told The Independent. “And while there are people going in pubs with the virus, I probably won’t be going out for one for some time yet.”In a statement posted to Facebook, bosses at the Golden Fleece said: “An irresponsible customer who was showing Covid-19 symptoms (while awaiting their test results) decided to have a night out.”It added that staff were being tested and the pub deep cleaned but the place should be open again this week.Both the Cavalier and Ryhope Cricket Club said they planned on being back to normal by mid-week.Northumbria Police said they had not received any complaints about the episode and would not be investigating.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”. You can’t sit on them, but look at them. Aren’t they beautiful?Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.The European Research Group of Tory MPs which drove the UK to a hard Brexit is branded “a corruption of Conservatism” by a senior party figure, in a new book.The organisation – which wrecked Theresa May’s agreement, leading to Boris Johnson’s hardline EU exit – is made up of “climate change deniers” who “were quite happy to see Trump win”, a former colleague says.The book, by the journalist Peter Geoghegan, seeks to map the transformation of the once little-known ERG into an ultra-powerful player in Conservative politics, as the Brexit fight developed.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesDespite not taking a public stance at the 2016 referendum, it then campaigned for a clean break from Brussels and was instrumental in defeating Ms May’s attempts at compromise.Guto Bebb, a former Tory minister who stood down last December, told the author of Democracy for Sale: Dark Money and Dirty Politics: “It morphed into a no-deal Brexit sect.”Fears of dead chicks in lorries and 10 months of chaos after BrexitAnd Tom Tugendhat, the influential Tory chairman of the Commons foreign affairs committee, was damning in his verdict of the group, now led by the outspoken Mark Francois.“It’s a corruption of Conservatism. It is rampant libertarianism. It’s the very opposite of what it means to be a Conservative,” Mr Tugendhat said.The ERG – formed way back in 1993, to oppose closer EU integration – was attacked as a “party within a party” for its trench warfare against the former prime minister.It ran its own whipping operation to defeat her deal, prompting Anna Soubry, then a Tory MP, to say Jacob Rees-Mogg was “running our country. Theresa May is no longer in charge”.Created with Sketch.Brexit day: UK says goodbye to EU  Show all 66Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A message projected onto the White Cliffs of DoverBig Ben, shows the hands at eleven o\u0027clock at nightNigel Farage speaks to pro-Brexit supportersPro-Brexit demonstrators celebrate on Parliament Square The Union flag is taken down outside the European Parliament in BrusselsPro-EU campaigners outside the Scottish Parliament, EdinburghA pro-Brexit supporter jumps on an EU flag in Parliament SquareEU Council staff removed the Union Jack-British flag from the European Council in Brussels, BelgiumPedestrians pass in front of the Ministry of Defence Building on Whitehall, illuminated by red, white and blue lights in central London A Brexit supporter shouts during a rally in LondonPro-EU campaigners outside the Scottish Parliament, EdinburghPro-EU campaigners take part in a \u0027Missing EU Already\u0027 rally outside the Scottish Parliament, EdinburghA large pro-EU banner is projected onto Ramsgate cliff in KentPro-EU supporters light candles in Smith Square in WestminsterA man waves Union flags from a small car as he drives past Brexit supporters gathering in Parliament SquareThe five-year old Elisa Saemann, left, and her seven-year old sister Katie hold a placard during a rally by anti-Brexit protesters outside the Scottish parliament in EdinburghPro Europe supporters gather on Brexit day near the British embassy in Berlin, GermanyAnti-Brexit protester hugs a man while holding a placard A decorated, old fashioned fire pump in Parliament SquarePro Brexit Elvis impersonator performs at Parliament SquareAn anti-Brexiteers stands with his dog in Parliament SquarePaddy from Bournemouth wears Union colours as he sits next to an EU flag decorated bag in Parliament Square A pro-EU activist plays a guitar decorated with the EU flag during a protest organised by civil rights group New Europeans outside Europe House, central LondonPeople celebrate Britain leaving the EUA Pro Brexit supporter has a Union Jack painted onto his face at Parliament SquareMen hold placards celebrating Britain leaving the EUPro Brexit supporters dance in the street draped with Union Jack flags at Parliament SquareAn anti-Brexit demonstrator spreads his wings during a gathering near Downing StreetPro EU supporters display a banner \u0027 Here to Stay, Here to Fight, Migrants In, Tories Out\u0027 from Westminster bridgePro-Brexit supporters burn European Union flags at Parliament SquareA man poses for a picture on Parliament Square in a \u0027Brexit Day\u0027 t-shirtPeople celebrate Britain leaving the EUA man wears a pro-Brexit t-shirtAnti-Brexit demonstrators visit Europe House to give flowers to the staff on Brexit dayPro Brexit supporter wears a novelty Union Jack top hat outside the Houses of ParliamentCustomers Scott Jones and Laura Jones at the Sawmill Bar in South Elmsall, Yorkshire, where a Brexit party is being held throughout the dayA Brexit supports holds a sign in Parliament SquareA man carries an EU themed wreathAnn Widdecombe reacts with other members of the Brexit party as they leave en masse from the European ParliamentAnti-Brexit demonstrators in Parliament SquarePro EU supporters let off flares from Westminster BridgeBritish MEPs Jonathan Bullock, holding the Union Jack flag and Jake Pugh leave the European Parliament, in Brussels on the Brexit dayNewspapers and other souvenirs at a store, near Parliament SquareBrexit supporters hold signs in Parliament SquarePro-EU protesters hold placards in Parliament SquareSinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald with a Border Communities Against Brexit poster before its unveiling in Carrickcarnon on the Irish borderNational growers organisation British Apples \u0026amp Pears has renamed a British apple to EOS, the Greek goddess of dawn, to commemorate Brexit dayPro-EU protesters hold placards in Parliament SquareBritain\u0027s departure from the European Union was set in law on January 29, amid emotional scenes, as the bloc\u0027s parliament voted to ratify the orce papers.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.For almost seven years more than 2,700 tonnes of ammonium nitrate had been left in a warehouse Beirut’s portside, without adequate safety precautions, and no agreement on what to do with the potentially hugely lethal consignment.The authorities were fully aware of the risk: they had been writing to each other over the years, discussing various options. But nothing was done, the condition of the material in warehouse “hangar 12” continued to deteriorate, and then came the devastating explosion killing more than a hundred people and injuring 4,000 – a blast so powerful that it was felt in Cyprus 120 miles away.President Michel Aoun declared a three-day mourning period, and said the government will release £ 50.5m in emergency funding.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHe called the failure to deal with ammonium nitrate “unacceptable” and pledged the “harshest punishment” for those responsible.Lebanon’s cabinet announced later on Wednesday it would be placing all of Beirut’s port officials who were responsible for storage and security since 2014 under house arrest.Lebanon declares state of emergency over Beirut explosion – updatesThere will also be an investigation into what happened, but the denouement of that “harshest punishment” is likely to take a long time. A verdict is expected this week by a UN-backed court into the killing of former prime minister Rafik al-Hariri – 15 years after his death.The ammonium nitrate, a substance which can be used to make bombs as well as for commercial use such as fertiliser and mining explosives, had arrived in Beirut in September 2013 on board Russian-owned Moldovan-flagged ship the Rhosus, bound for Beira in Mozambique from Batumi in Georgia.It had docked in Beirut after reporting engine trouble. Lebanese officials prevented the ship from continuing its journey citing safety concerns by port state control officers. Most of the Ukrainian crew were repatriated on the grounds that they were in “imminent danger” due to the material on board. The vessel was eventually abandoned by its owners.The Lebanese authorities impounded the cargo and put it in the hangar, a large structure which faces the highway at the main entrance to the capital.There the material stayed for months. Then, leaked official documents show, the then-director of customs, Shafik Merhi, sent a letter to the “urgent matters judge” pointing the need to decide what to do with it. The name of the judge is not known.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailCustoms officials, according to these records circulating in Lebanon, sent at least five more letters between 5 December 2014 and 27 October 2017 stressing the need for the ammonium nitrate to be moved. The options proposed were exporting the material, selling it to the privately owned Lebanese Explosives Company, or asking the army to collect it.One letter sent in 2016 said: “In view of the serious danger of keeping these goods in the hangar in unsuitable climatic conditions, we reaffirm our request to please request the marine agency to re-export these goods immediately to preserve the safety of the port and those working on it or to look into agreeing to sell this amount” to the Lebanese Explosives Company.The letter recorded that there had been no replies from judges to previous requests. There was no reply to this letter either.A year later, in October 2017, a new customs director, Badri Daher, sent another letter to a judge asking for a decision in view of “the danger ... of leaving these goods in the place they are, and to those working there.”The Reuters news agency reported that the issue of storing the material had come before several committees and judges and “nothing was done”. It also stated that a team that inspected the cargo six months ago warned that it could “blow up all of Beirut” if not removed.Officials said a fire appears to have started at hangar 9 and spread to hangar 12 detonating the ammonium nitrate. The substance, however, is not an explosive by itself, but an oxidiser, drawing oxygen to a fire and making it rage faster and further.Beirut port officials to be put under house arrest following blastsTimeline of events leading up to Beirut explosionsBeirut explosion: Before and after pictures show extent of damagePriest dodges falling rubble as Beirut explosion hits during massPollutants would also add to the flames. “That’s what may have happened, the ammonium nitrate got something added to it accidentally, possibly oil or some other flammable compound. Ammonium nitrate smoke is more yellow, this is rather red.  An investigation would ascertain if that is the case and where contamination took place,” said Robert Emerson, a British security analyst.Ammonium nitrate has been used in explosive devices by military forces in many countries. It has also been used in several terrorist attacks, including the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995 by right-wing extremists Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols, which destroyed a federal building and killed 168 people.Donald Trump told reporters at the White House: “It would seem like it was based on the explosion. I met with some of our great generals and they just seem to feel that it was. This was not a – some kind of manufacturing explosion type of event... They seem to think it was an attack. It was a bomb of some kind, yes.”But there has not been any evidence to suggest that the explosion was a deliberate attack – something defence officials told several American media outlets following the president’s comments.The Pentagon refused to comment on Mr Trump’s claims, referring it back to the White House. Defence officials told several American media outlets that there was no evidence that the explosion was a deliberate attack. State Department sources said Lebanese officials had raised concern with US diplomats about the president’s choice of language.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.For hundreds of thousands in Beirut, the wreckage caused by Tuesday’s colossal explosion came as a shock that will take some time to process. For the former crew of a Russian-owned vessel abandoned in the docks in late 2013, it came as less of a surprise. On Tuesday evening, local media reported the blast was caused by the explosion of 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate that had been transferred from the Rhosus cargo ship in 2014. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Rhosus sailed under a Moldovan flag but was reportedly owned by Igor Grechushkin, a native of Khabarovsk in Russia’s Far East, and was manned by a crew of Russians and Ukrainians.According to contemporary reports, the Rhosus was scheduled to transport its cargo from the Georgian port of Batumi to Biera in Mozambique in late 2013. But along the way it fell into technical problems, and failed a safety inspection in Beirut. Some time later, the ship was seized after its owner apparently ran out of money or willingness to pay port fees. Search for survivors as Beirut wakes up to huge devastation – updatesIn July 2014, with his crew essentially hostages and running out of provisions, Captain Boris Prokoshev warned of the dangers of his cargo. “We’ve been here since October, with a cargo of ammonium nitrate, an explosive substance, in the hold,” he told a journalist of the Ukrainian Sailor newspaper. “We’ve been abandoned, living with no wage on a powder keg for the last 10 months.”A Russian newspaper that reported on the situation carried a headline that reads especially eerily today: “Crew of the Rhosus cargo ship are hostages aboard a floating bomb.” According to Capt Prokoshev, the owner of the vessel ended up owing the crew upwards of $200,000 in wages. Social media posts about the reported owner, Mr Grechushkin, and his company, Teto Shipping Ltd, contain several claims of non-payment.Natalya Klamm, director of the Odessa-based Assol foundation, which assisted the sailors at the time, told The Independent the situation the men found themselves was not unique.

Yes, people were happy when they were eventually released, but it was six years ago and frankly it wasn’t so unusual to remember an awful lot about it.” Following representations by Ukrainian diplomats, local authorities agreed to release five of the sailors. The Russian captain and three senior Ukrainian crewmen stayed onboard – and would only be allowed to travel home in September 2014. Around that time, authorities granted permission for the dangerous cargo to be disembarked for “safekeeping” in the Beirut port’s warehouse number 12. The transfer is recorded in an article written by two lawyers in Arrest News in October 2015.Lebanon president Michel Aoun described the failure to deal with the stockpile of ammonium nitrate as “unacceptable” and said those responsible would face “the harshest punishment”.A probe has now been launched, with the investigating committee expected to present findings within five days.Early reports suggest the explosion followed repair work to the warehouse, sparks from which caused unidentified pellets to explode – and following that, the ammonium nitrate.

The money is part of an emergency relief package announced on Wednesday that includes specialist medical teams and NHS experts, search and rescue crews and additional support for the Lebanese armed forces. It is unclear exactly when the relief package would be delivered, but according to Sky News an advance team of British military personnel will depart for Beirut within 24 hours to assess the situation.    Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFrance, the former colonial power in Lebanon,  has already sent planes filled with rescuers, medical equipment and a mobile clinic. Two planes departed Wednesday, and President Emmanuel Macron will follow them to Lebanon on Thursday to meet with his Lebanese counterpart Michel Aoun. The French presidency said in a statement that the aid would include 15 tonnes of sanitary equipment and a mobile clinic equipped to treat 500 people. Some 55 rescue specialists were due to arrive on Wednesday to help rubble clearing and rescue.  Beirut in mourning as families desperately search for loved onesOne day after the blast, which was caused by the ignition of some 2,700 tonnes of ammonium nitrate that was being stored at the port, rescue workers and residents picked through the rubble to find survivors. In one moment, as many as 300,000 people in Lebanon’s capital of Beirut were made homeless, according to Beirut\u0027s governor Marwan Aboud. An as yet unknown number of lives and livelihoods were extinguished in that same blast. Lebanon was already suffering from multiple crises when the explosions hit, including a crippling economic downturn, food insecurity, a worsening coronavirus outbreak and almost non-existent public services. In a statement announcing the UK aid, foreign secretary Dominic Raab said the UK had offered “immediate direct support.”“This was a devastating explosion which has caused enormous suffering and damage.

Britain maintains two large military bases on the island of Cyprus, just across the Mediterranean — the closest of which is around 150 miles away. There is currently no indication that forces at either have been mobilised to help with the disaster in Beirut. The United States, which has imposed sanctions on some Lebanese banks in an effort to squeeze the Lebanese Hezbollah movement, said it reaffirmed its steadfast commitment to assist the Lebanese people as they cope with the aftermath of this terrifying event in a statement from the State Department. Other countries also stepped up to support and have already sent supplies. Kuwait and Qatar dispatched were quick to dispatch aeroplanes full of medical cargo. Qatari officials told the Associated Press that cargo from Doha included two large air-conditioned tents, kits for 1,000 beds, generators and diesel tanks, 50 ventilators, emergency medical supplies like first aid kits, gauze and needles, and medicine. A search and rescue team was also being sent to support.Meanwhile, urgent medical and humanitarian supplies were being sent from the International Humanitarian City in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.Additional reporting by the Associated PressShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It must now look urgently at how it can use its substantial licence fee income to deliver for audiences of all ages, including by making efficiencies.The DCMS says the Government agreed a deal with the BBC in , which the director-general said provided financial stability.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The rule not to travel further than five miles away from your home has also been reinstated in the Aberdeen City Council area and residents have been told not visit each other in houses.Single adult households who have joined up in a support bubble with another household can continue to visit. Ms Sturgeon also told people not to travel to Aberdeen.It comes just days after the Queen arrived in Scotland to spend time at her Balmoral estate over the summer.Her Majesty is staying around  miles outside of Aberdeen, and flew into the citys airport from RAF Northolt.The new rules in Aberdeen are far tougher than local lockdowns in Greater Manchester and parts of northern England - where people are no longer allowed to visit indoors, but can still head to the pub.There were  new cases of the virus Scotland wide. Nicola Sturgeon announced today: She said this lunchtime: So, a precautionary and careful judgement is that we need to take decisive action now - dficult though that undoubtedly is - in order to try and contain this outbreak and prevent further harm later on.This high number of cases certainly heightens our concern that we are dealing with a signicant outbreak in Aberdeen that may involve some community transmission.Now, the main link identied in this cluster has been the Hawthorn Bar in Aberdeen city centre, however more detailed analysis by NHS Grampian and Test  Protect has shown that this one venue does not account for all of the positive cases.The First Minister said changes will be reviewed every seven days starting next Wednesday when she hopes the restrictions could be removed either entirely or partially. Staff suddenly out of work will be able to be re-furloughed under the job retention scheme. The harsh restrictions could be extended to parts of Aberdeenshirethey need to be, Ms Sturgeon said.She added that the outbreak was a sharp reminder of what happenspeople let their guard drop and start behind like normal again. She said:should serve as a warning to all of us. It comes days before all kids are set to go back to school in Scotland from August .Ms Sturgeon said she took the decision after being struck by comments from the Childrens Commissioner for England Anne Longfield demanding schools should be allowed to open at all costs - evenit means shutting pubs. She said: As I said earlier, this is also about doing everything we can to ensure our children canto school next week.Aberdeen schools are holding orientation sessions next Wednesday, with schools due to open fully the following Monday, th August.Acting now, we judge, gives us the time and space to protect the ability of our young people toto education.Ms Sturgeon said the decision to close hospitality venues was not taken lightly but extreme caution was necessary to tackle any growth in coronavirus cases. She said: Im also mindful of the need to act quickly and decisivelywe are to succeed in our aim of keeping transmission as close to elimination levels as possible.Local MP Stephen Flynn tweeted following the announcement: Restrictions being put back in place in Aberdeen is what we all feared.

No parole, no reductions.Currently defendants under the age of  receive lower sentences, but Mrs Adlam believes this should end.Debbie added: As far as their age and the reductions go, my personal thoughts are there is no sense whatsoever in being  or  and getting time off your sentence.My gut turns when I think about that because you can change your gender, you can get a mortgage, you can serve in the Army, and the thing that really bugs me is you can be on a jury - yet you are not treated as an adult until youre  in the judicial system.That cant be right.It comes as PC Harpers widow, Lissie Harper, has launched her own Andrews Law campaign for full-le prison terms for those who kill emergency services workers.She said: I pledge to my late husband to never stop until I have made the dference that this country clearly needs.I vow to stand strong and firm with so many other honourable people in our country to make the changes that we clearly know to be justied.Lissie shared a new picture of herself and PC Harper as she launched the campaign.Her cause is being backed by the Police Federation of England and Wales, which represents thousands of officers up to the rank of chief inspector.The three teenagers were convicted of manslaughter over PC Harpers death, after he responded to a reported burglary.They were found not guilty of murdering the police officer after the jury had deliberated for almost two days.Henry Long, , Jessie Cole and Albert Bowers, both , hugged each other to the sound of their cheering families as the verdict of not guilty to murder was read out in court.Bowers and Cole were instead convicted of the lesser charge of manslaughter - which Long had previously admitted.Long, who was driving the car when the Thames Valley Police officer was dragged to his death while responding to a quad bike theft on August , was caged for  years.Bowers and Cole were handed  years in prison and banned from driving for two years.But Attorney General Suella Braverman will now look into whether the jail time handed down was too lenient after a request to review the case.Lissie added: As a widow of a police officer - a title in which I would give everything to not have - I have witnessed first-hand the lenient and insufficient way in which the justice system deals with criminals who take the lives of our emergency workers.“I have grown close to our under-appreciated protectors ever more since the death of Andrew, I have been enveloped in love and support from not only the police and other emergency workers but so many of the general public too who I know fully support my feelings over the verdict and sentences in which Andrew’s killers have received.“The people responsible for wreaking utter despair and grief in all of our lives will spend an inadequate amount of time behind bars. These men who showed no remorse, no guilt or sorrow for taking such an innocent and heroic le away will find themselves able to live out the rest of their lives free and able to commit more crimes and continue to put people in danger when they are released in a very small number of years.”It came after the court heard a car driven by Long at breakneck speed swung PC Andrew Harper like a pendulum along a country lane on August , .PC Harper was in the process of apprehending the teen gang during a botched robbery near Reading, Berks.The jury came back with the verdict after deliberating for two days, which left his tearful widow Lissie in tears.Jurors were told how the traveller teens had tried to steal the £, bike from the home of Peter Wallis in remote Bradfield Southend, when they were apprehended by PC Harper.The gang had cased the property earlier in the day and later ed masked and armed with an axe, crowbars and aof pipe to use against anyone in their way. PC Harpers devastated widow Lissie wrote an open letter to Boris Johnson, Home Secretary Priti Patel and former Labour Home Secretary LordBlunkett urging them and others to right such a despicable wrong for our country.At sentencing, all three were warned they will not be eligible for release until they have served at least two thirds of their sentence - meaning leader of the gang Long could be back on the streets in just ten years.And his accomplices could be out in just eight yearsthey serve the minimum - despite Mr Justice Edis telling them the killing was very close to murder.The Attorney General has no power to order a retrial, and prosecutors would either need new and compelling evidence to apply for the acquittals to be quashed, or there would need to be proven interference with the jury.A spokesman for the Attorney Generals Office said: The Attorney Generals thoughts are with the family and friends of Pc Andrew Harper at this dficult time.I can confirm that we have received a request for the cases of Henry Long, Albert Bowers and Jessie Cole to be considered under the unduly lenient sentence scheme.The Law Officers have  days from sentencing to consider the case.In her letter to the Prime Minister Lissie Harper said she implored him to hear her request.She wrote: If there is even the slightest chance that this abominable injustice can be rectied then I will do everything I possibly can to ensure that it is.Lissie added: I implore you to hear my words, see the facts that are laid out before us, and I ask with no expectations other than hope that you might help me to make these changes be considered, to ensure that Andrew is given the retrial that he unquestionably deserves and to see that the justice system in our country is the solid ethical foundation that it rightly should be. Not the joke that so many of us now view it to be.The PMs spokesman said he would respond to Mrs Harpers letter formally once legal proceedings have concluded.”The killers families wept and gasped as the sentences were handed down, while Lissies mum Julie Beckett applauded.Sentencing, the judge said nothing he can do can “restore Andrew Harper to his loving we or family, adding: His devastating loss in terrible circumstances will follow his family for ever.”Describing the killers as young, unintelligent but professional criminals, he added none of them had shown anything resembling remorse.The soft sentences dished out to Long, Bowers and Cole were met with fury by social media users.One person wrote: Absolutely disgusting, no justice for him, his family or his beautul we. Another failing by the system.Another read: Disgraceful sentencing.One person fumed: So thats all his le was worth then  I feel sick at this verdict.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

At least , people were injured in the fireball which flattened buildings, ripped peoples clothes from their bodies and damaged properties up to six miles away.The blast was so large it could be heard  miles across the sea in Cyprus.It has emerged the powder-keg of chemicals was shipped by Russian businessman Igor Grechushkin who has been accused of abandoning it in Beirut.The killer cargo was confiscated in  from the Moldovan-flagged ship Rhosus while en route from Batumi in the ex-Soviet republic of Georgia to MozambiqueIt had stopped due to “a mal” in Beirut where sailors were forced to stay on board to ensure its safety.Sailors protested that Grechushkin claimed he had gone bankrupt and had abandoned the ship - going on hunger strike before finally being allowed to go ashore.Grechushkin was said to have paid a “huge penalty” for transporting the cargo without authority which led to him going bust - later moving to Cyprus with his we Irina.Neither the businessman nor his family have yet commented on the explosion, which had one fth the power of a nuclear bomb.The Russian captain of the ship Boris Prokoshev, now , warned at the time of the deadly nature of the cargo.He said: “The vessel’s owner abandoned it and we were abandoned too. We were living on a powder keg for ten months without being paid.Anger is mounting as Lebanons government and customs officials point fingers at each other as to who is the blame for the monstrous explosion.Reportedly the blast was sparked when a reckless welder caused a fire at nearby Warehouse  - which then spread to the explosive Warehouse .It is a white crystalline solid and is highly soluble in water - with the chemical formula NH₄NO₃.The chemical is applied in granule form into the soil and quickly dissolves under moisture, allowing nitrogen to be released.Another use of ammonium nitrate is in the food industry where it is used as a nutrient in producing antibiotics and yeast.In most countries, it is used to make explosives for mining, quarrying and civil construction because of its low cost and ready availability.It has been the cause of numerous industrial explosions over the last three decades, including the explosion at a chemical plant in Toulouse, France, in  that killed  people.Ammonium nitrate was also used to create the explosives used in the  Mumbai train bombings.By itself, ammonium nitrate is not regarded as dangerous but under certain conditions, it can become deadly.The chemical is classied as an “energetic material” meaning that it produces heat as it decomposes.If there is a signicant amount of ammonium nitrate it can generate enough heat to catch fire and continue to burn eventually causing an explosion. President Michel Aoun said the government was determined to investigate and expose what happened as soon as possible, to hold the responsible and the negligent accountable.Sources close to the investigation blamed the incident on inaction and negligence, saying nothing was done by committees and judges involved in removing the explosives.The cabinet ordered port officials involved in storing or guarding the material since  to be put under house arrest.Badri Daher, Director General of Lebanese Customs, told broadcaster LBCI that customs had sent six documents to the judiciary warning that the material posed a danger.He said: We requested that it be re-exported but that did not happen. We leave it to the experts and those concerned to determine why.Another source close to a port employee said a team that inspected the ammonium nitrate six months ago warned thatit was not moved it would blow up all of Beirut.Two documents revealed that Lebanese Customs had asked the judiciary in  and  to ask the concerned maritime agency to re-export or approve the sale of the ammonium nitrate.One of the documents cited similar requests in  and  - suggesting repeated warnings about the danger were overlooked by the authorities.Prime Minister Hassan Diab vowed those responsible will pay the price as rescue operations continue in Beirut.International aid is being mobilised across the world to help support the victims and search for those potentially still trapped beneath the rubble.Mr Raab said: I think the people of the Lebanon deserve no less - and that there will be full accountability.He added the the details of Brits caught up in the Beirut blast was still being established - with a number known to have been injured.HMS Enterprise will carry out survey work in the port to establish the extent of the damage.British engineering experts have found the blast was unquestionably one of the largest non-nuclear explosions ever to take place.The team from the University of Sheffield has calculated the strength of the blast based on the videos and photographs of the catastrophe.They believe the explosion was the equivalent of , to , tonnes of TNT.Beiruts governor Marwan Aboud said as many as , people may have been left homeless with many buildings reduced to an uninhabitable mess of rubble and glass.There are concerns of food shortages and unrest in the city, with the blast compounding anger stemming from a severe economic crisis and the coronavirus pandemic.Many nations have stepped up to offer aid alongside Britain, including France, Germany, Poland, the Netherlands, Russia, the Czech Republic, Iran and the US.US Pentagon sources also described the blast as a tragic accident - but President Donald Trump said he believed it was caused by “a bomb.Trump said his forces stood ready to assist after the terrible attack claiming his security advisors “seem to think it was an attack, a bomb of some kind.US defence officials later contradicted Trump and former White House aides claimed his remarks were wildly irresponsible.The Foreign Office confirmed several staff based at the embassy more than three miles from the port needed hospital treatment but declined to give any details.A spokesman said: “All Embassy staff are accounted for. A small number have sustained non- le-threatening injuries and where necessary are receiving medical attention.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Speaking as someone who was badly stung on location while filming Man Vs Wild a few years ago, I know how serious an attack can be.If you stumble upon a nest and the bees or wasps start to swarm, my first piece of advice is: Run.My second piece of advice is: Keep running. Run until you are out of the immediate area.While running, hold your breath so you don’t breathe any of them in.Try to cover your head and face with your hands, or ideally, a towel. If you are stung, try to remove the stingit is visible, wash the area, use ice to cool it and consider an ­antihistamine.If you are allergic to wasp and bee stings like I am, seek medical attention immediately.You are best off avoiding the nestat all ­possible. Change your route, give it a wide berth and move away.If you play outdoors, climb, hike, ride or ramble, at some point you will pick up bumps, grazes and cuts.In the outdoors, and particularly in the UK when walking and hiking, you will no doubt at some point veer off the path and have to climb a barbed wire fence. Avoid this at all costspossible butyou have no other option, try the tips below.If the worst has happened and you do suffer a bad cut, reach for the first aid bag and treat a bleeding wound.You must always ­remember the catchword “PEEPS”. It stands for . . . P – Position: Check where the injury is and ask your casualty to sit down.E – Expose and examine: Seeit is clean and free of foreign bodies.E – Elevate your limbthat’s where you are injured.P – Pressure: Apply it directly over the injury. Use a bandage, a hanky or even just your hand.Clean the wound­possible and bandage it.As soon as you can, seek medical attention for the casualty, as they may need stitches or a tetanus injection.Getting lost can happen so easily, even for experienced or trained walkers and mountaineers.The weather closes in, you lose track of the path or the features around you and suddenly you realise you are lost. You go for your GPS unit or even your phone, but guess what – there is no signal.Stop, don’t panic and take time to think what to do.Look around you. Are there big features to recognise, such as rivers, mountains, lakes or a forest If you can, retrace your steps to a place where you know where you are.Follow a river downstream. They usually lead to civilisation.If it’s getting dark, stay put. Don’t drink from rivers or streams as the water may be contaminated. If you are desperately thirsty find moving water, filter it through a sock and boil it.Pee is your last resort – it’s not nice and will likely adversely affect your ­overall hydration levels.Find overhead cover – a cave or tree – to protect you from winds. Stay warm and dry, using layers of clothing or stuff clothing with grass as insulation.Check food and water – and plan to be out all night.After watching BBC documentary Saving Lives At Sea, schoolboy Raviraj Saini, knew what to do when he was torn from his family by a riptide in the sea off the North Yorkshire coast this week.The ten-year-old followed the RNLI’s Float To Live advice – to float calmly until he was rescued – rather than thrashing about in the water.As Raviraj knew, the RNLI’s guidance says thatyou are drowning, fight your instinct to thrash around.Lean back, extend your arms and legs and gently move them to help you float. Stay bobbing on the water on your back until your breathing recovers.Rip currents can flow faster than an Olympic swimmer at mph and can drag unsuspecting swimmers out to sea. They are hard to spot but choppy water could be a sign.If you get pulled away by a rip current, the RNLI advises you don’t try to swim against the tide as you’ll exhaust yourself and could drown.Don’t swim towards the shore. First swim parallel to the current before heading for the beach.Some UK areas are remote and hard to reach for rescuers. So as we say in the Scouts: “Be prepared.”Always let someone know where you are heading. Perhaps make a route plan and leave it with someone. Take the correct equipment, such as spare clothes, food, water, an up-to-date first aid kit, map and ­compass, and know how to use them all.If you are injured, don’t panic, stay calm and don’t move unless you have to.Treat the injury, look at your resources and apply first aidyou can.If you don’t have a phone signal, you will have to wait to be rescued.While you wait, there are things you can do to attract help. Make an SOS sign out of clothing on the ground.Use a whistle and give a distinctive call. Wave both arms in the air to attract attention.Call or shout for help and use a mirror or shiny object to attract attention.Hot summers and warm water temperatures can attract jellyfish to Britain’s coasts – and with them comes the risk of a nasty sting. You might have heard that peeing on a jellyfish sting will help to soothe the pain.But I would try other options first, as stinking of wee doesn’t make for the best mini-break . . . I have been stung many times by jellyfish over the years, and mostly it is just irritating – a bit like a bee or wasp sting.Even so, do beware – some jellyfish that can be found on British beaches, such as the fearsome Portuguese man of war, can inflict some super- serious stings on unsuspecting holidaymakers. To treat a jellyfish sting, rinse the area in water or vinegar.Then remove any ­obvious tentacles with a pair of tweezers.Next, soak the site where you were stung in hot water for at least  minutes.And finally, apply a mild hydrocortisone cream to help with the pain and ease the swelling.Over the years I’ve eaten all kinds of wild food – from all sorts of plants to nasty looking and tasting bugs and worms.But it’s easy to get it wrong in a survival situation – and easy to make a mistake at home. If in doubt, never be tempted to try “foods” you might find in the wild, such as mushrooms or berries.If you’re not somewhere where you can call the emergency services, try to make yourself or your patient vomit by putting your fingers down the back of the throat.Swallowing a small ­quantity of cold charcoal from a camp fire can also act as an emetic – or vomit-inducer – and may prevent your blood from absorbing certain poisons.Crush the charcoal and mix it with some fresh water. Likewise, white ash mixed with fresh water can ease stomach cramps and is sometimes an antidote to hydrocyanic acid poisoning.Get any remaining part of the poisonous article out of your mouth or that of a child.Take the poison plant or berries with you to a ­hospital Accident and Emergency department.People get injured by cows every year in the UK, even though they are quiet and timid animals.We do a lot of filming around large game and the principles are basically the same for our home-grown cattle. Any time you present a threat to almost any animal, get ready for action in .A single cow is likely to be more scared of you than you are of it.Just stand your ground, make a lot of noise and it will likely run away.If the herd is running directly for you, you need to get to the edge of the field and out of there ASAP.Try to get something between you and the cows.You’re unlikely to be able to run faster than a cow, as they move at  to mph, sowalking through a field of cows, be respectful. You are in their domain, so remain calm, quiet and quickly try to pass by them.If you can avoid the field, do so. Butyou have to go through, don’t get between cows and their calves and avoid moving directly through the herd.This will only agitate them.Finally, keep your dog on a lead, close by you and under control.Even small rivers in non-extreme environments are prone to sudden and dangerous flooding.There is a river in Brecon where we do the Bear Grylls Survival Academy course, called the Lightning River – and for good reason. One minute it’s perfectly safe to cross, the next it’s fast-flowing white water.Wherever possible, you should avoid trying to cross flood waters.They move fast and are always much more powerful than you might have imagined.Even in knee-deep water you run a high risk of being swept away.Moreover, flood water often contains fast-moving debris – cars, boulders, even trees.Sometimes these are hidden below the surface, so you won’t even see them before they hit you.If you have to cross a flooded road, use a long stick to probe the ground ahead of you for hidden deep patches.Be particularly wary of downed power lines that could still be live and lethal.In general, your priority must be to head for high ground.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Clemmie Hambro was Princess Dianas youngest bridesmaid at her wedding with Prince Charles in July . Flight logs seen by the Mail show that she flew on Epsteins jet after visiting his ranch in New Mexico and his Little St James island, known to locals as Paedo island. Epsteins island of Little St James lies between St Thomas and St John, two of the largest islands of the US Virgin Islands in the Caribbean.The -acre island was bought by the financier in  for an estimated .million and was owned by him until his death in .Miss Hambros first flight, from Epstein’s “New Zorro” ranch in Santa Fe, New Mexico to Teterboro airport in New York, was taken on February ,  with two other women as well as Epstein himself. She said the New Mexico trip was a “work trip” to help the financier decide which art to buy for the ranch. The second trip, meanwhile, took place on March  when she flew from St Thomas - used by Epstein to reach Little St James island- to Teterboro airport.She said this trip was a “personal invitation, adding that she “didn’t know anyone there and “didn’t really enjoy myself”. According to the records, Epstein was present on both flights. Epsteins longtime associate Ghislaine Maxwell, who is awaiting trial for allegedly aiding Epsteins abuse, was also present for one of the trips.The now married mum-of-four was a -year old employee at Christies auction house in New York when she made the trips in .Miss Hambros contact details were also listed in Epsteins infamous Little Black Book, according to the Mail.A statement from Miss Hambro read: The first flight was a work trip with female colleagues to look at Epstein’s new home in Santa Fe to discuss what art he was going to buy.The second trip, to Little St James, was a personal invitation, which I thought would be fun to accept, but I didn’t know anyone there, didn’t really enjoy myself, and never went back. My heart breaks for all the survivors, now I know what happened on that island.In the course of those two trips, I was not abused, nor did I see anyone abused, or anything untoward happen, with minors or otherwise. I have been completely horried about the revelations of his conduct since then. I was clearly very lucky, my heart goes out to those who were abused by him, and I trust they get the justice they so deserve.She added: I was young and naive, and could not conceive of what was to unfold.There is no suggestion she was involved in any wrongdoing.Epstein bought the island of Little St James more than two decades ago, transforming it into a high-security private oasis.Court papers allege that prominent American politicians, powerful business executives, foreign presidents, a well known prime minister and other world leaders have visited the island before.It is alleged that the American lawyer and academic Alan Dershowitz was seen on the island - a claim he has repeatedly denied.Epsteins alleged madame, Ghislaine Maxwell, is also said to visited the island a number of times.Bombshell legal papers also claim that former president Bill Clinton once flew to Jeffrey Epsteins orgy island with two young girls, The Sun reported last week.In the documents Epstein victim Virginia Giuffre  says the former US president visited Epsteins infamous private Caribbean Island.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She askedall the family would go with her to court and we said, ‘Of course.’“I was then called on Saturday lunchtime to say Carrie had died. I believe she was heartbroken.“I know nothing will bring her back, but I do want people to know what a lovely, kind, generous person she was.“She never spoke badly of anyone and was totally loyal.”Christine said Caroline’s death was caused by the Crown Prosecution Service’s insistence on holding a celebrity “show trial” over a fight she had with boyfriend Lewis Burton.Police had been called to Caroline’s flat in December after the fight and arrested her.The CPS decided to make her stand trial for assault despite the fact Lewis did not want charges brought — and knowing Caroline was suffering mental distress.Caroline, , who had a history of depression, was clearly distraught at a magistrates hearing on December  at which she denied assault. Her crown court trial was fixed for March.On February  she was found dead in her North London flat.Her inquest yesterday heard that Caroline was distraught in the weeks after her arrest and tormented by the thought of a trial.Christine, in a statement read to the inquest, said: “My family and I are totally devastated by the untimely and unnecessary death of my beautul daughter.“I believe she was seriously let down by the authorities and particularly by the CPS.“I believe this was a show trial. I feel the prosecutor was unkind to Caroline and my family.“I was threatened with arrest when I tried to speak. Being well known should not allow special treatment but should not allow making an example of someone.”Christine, who could be seen weeping on a video link as her statement was read by coroner Mary Hassell, denied her daughter had been violent.And she denied claims that Caroline had hit Lewis with a lamp during the row.She said she had received a letter of apology from the former head of the CPS over its claims. Her statement said: “I received a written apology from Ed Beltrami about comments he made about my daughter and I find it amazing something like that has not reached the media.“A lamp was never involved in the assault. It was a phone.“There was disputed evidence read out in court and picked up by reporters. But it was disputed.“The result of the media attention of this hearing forced Caroline to leave the home she loved and eventually led her to take her le.“Through all of this Caroline was told not to speak, to tell her side of the story, she was told the CPS could not possibly take it to trial because she didn’t beat Lewis.“The only person hurt that night was Caroline. An awful picture was sold to the Press. Caroline was told not to speak while all the time her heart was breaking She lost the job she worked so hard at.”Caroline took her le a day after her final hopes of avoiding a trial were dashed by the CPS.Her legal team sent mental health reports to the CPS saying she was in bad shape and would deterioratethe trial went ahead.A psychiatrist warned about a “major depressive episode”.But the CPS rejected that plea and brushed aside the fact that tennis coach Lewis, , was not supporting the prosecution.Paramedics had already been called to Caroline’s flat the day before her death over a prescription drugs overdose — one of four previous attempts to take her le.Psychiatrist Tamsin Lewis treated Caroline ahead of her first court appearance. She said: “She was incredibly distressed and needed some sleeping aids.”Ms Lewis said the presenter told her the fight with Lewis was “nothing more than a lover’s tf, heightened by alcohol”.The psychiatrist added: “She reported having panicky feelings all day — a sense of impending doom.”Caroline’s sister Jody told Poplar Coroner’s Court, East London, the TV presenter had been in a bad way before her death and did not want to leave her home.She said: “Caroline seemed very sad the day before her death — she seemed to have lost her fight. She was in a very anxious frame of mind from the day she was charged with assault on her boyfriend Lewis. She was anxious about press coverage and the abuse she would receive from the public.”Jody also criticised the CPS, saying: “The shame of the charge against her, which did not match the reality of what happened, was too much to cope with.“A mistake which ended in a minor injury to her boyfriend requiring no medical attention and serious injuries to herself, resulted in national condemnation for being a physical abuser of men.“This was something she could not see ever going away. The CPS continued even though Lewis wasn’t behind it.“The Press and public found it an entertaining angle and the ­matter spiralled out of control and became more dficult for Caroline to comprehend.”TELLY star Caroline left a note ­saying she wanted to “find harmony” with boyfriend Lewis Burton.The handwritten message was found by paramedics in her flat on top of an open magazine.It read: “I hope me and Lewis can one day find harmony.”In a statement, tennis player Lewis, , told the inquest of her fragile state.He said: “The last time I saw Caroline she was very upset, in fact, devastated. She was not in a good place emotionally.“What was bothering her most was the police case and losing her presenting job on Love Island, the negative media attention plus not being able to see me.”Jody said her sister, who stepped down from Love Island days after her arrest, felt her le was collapsing around her.She added: “The le and reputation she worked hard to build was falling apart to the point of noover a  accusation.“Her mental state was very fragile at this time and it was widely agreed by those involved that it would not be happening to hershe were not in the public eye. Her punishment did not fit the crime.“At the least she was being made a spectacle of nationally. At worst her career and reputation, so precious to her, had been taken away.”Friend Mollie Grosberg said Caroline had been stunned when the CPS dashed her last hopes.She added: “The day before her death she had a meeting with her lawyers that she was looking ­forward to because she hoped to hear the case was being dropped.“But she heard the opposite and it really threw her.”Mollie raced to Caroline’s home after getting a WhatsApp message saying: “I am killing myself and you don’t know where I am.”It doesnt discriminate, touching the lives of people in every corner of society - from the homeless and unemployed to builders and doctors, reality stars and footballers.Its the biggest killer of people under the age of , more deadly than cancer and car crashes.And men are three times more likely to take their own le than women.Yet its rarely spoken of, a taboo that threatens to continue its deadly rampage unless we all stop and take notice, now.That is why The Sun launched the Youre Not Alone campaign.The aim is that by sharing practical advice, raising awareness and breaking down the barriers people face when talking about their mental health, we can all do our bit to help save lives.Lets all vow to ask for help when we need it, and listen out for others... Youre Not Alone.If you, or anyone you know, needs help dealing with mental health problems, the following organisations provide support:Mollie said: “She was unconscious on her sofa, there were tablets everywhere.“Caroline was askedit was a suicide attempt and she said no, she had a headache. But it obviously wasn’t true.”Mollie said Caroline refused to go to hospital. Paramedics had been called but they left.The next morning Caroline was furious her friends had dialled .Mollie said: “When she needed us most she pushed us away.“She pushed everyone away, she always did that.“She kept saying, ‘No one will ever understand what I’m going through’. She was so scared to go to prison and of the police and the Press. It was too much.”Caroline was found dead in her flat by Stephen Teasdale, father of one of her friends.Efforts to revive her failed. The hearing continues.CAROLINE had tried to take her own le on four previous occasions, her family revealed.Her sister Jody told the inquest the presenter had struggled in the past to overcome her insecurities.She said: “She battled suicidal thoughts in the past and depression and anxiety. An ambulance was called on four occasions after attempted overdoses.“Heartbreak was always something Caroline felt extremely dficult to deal with emotionally.”The inquest heard of two previous occasions, including one in her flat on the night before Caroline died.Close friend Mollie Grosberg said the star had apparently taken herbal sleeping tablets and paracetamol.She said: “We went in and she’d smashed up the TV and thrown her plant on the floor.“She was unconscious on her sofa. There were tablets everywhere.”Her friends were reluctant to call police or an ambulance because Caroline did not trust them.But Mollie said she eventually called  and was told an ambulance was on its way.She added: “After an hour it hadn’t come so I called  and they said they were trying to find us.“Caroline was coming round by this point and talking gibberish about India.Caroline was askedit was a suicide attempt and she said no, she had a headache.“But it obviously wasn’t true. Caroline was refusing to go to hospital but was still totally incoherent.“It was eventually agreed she wasn’t going and I got very angry and shouted. I said it was ridiculous — but the paramedics saidshe was refusing to go they couldn’t take her.”Paramedic Tony Rumore told the inquest he had no powers to force the star to go to hospital or detain her under the Mental Health Act.He said: “We asked Carolineher intention was to harm or kill herself.“She said it was merely an attempt to sleep and escape from the stresses she was under.”The inquest also heard Caroline overdosed in a London hotel room on December  — the day before her magistrates court appearance.Harley Street psychiatrist Dr Brian Wells said he found the presenter in bed and vomiting into a bin.He added: “She had become distressed about the court appearance and drunk considerable amounts of alcohol and what’s thought to be a mixture of medications.“Perhaps ten tablets in total.

Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick has claimed that this major overhaul of the planning system will speed up the housebuilding process and “cut red tape but not standards”. But campaigners are concerned that the plans will harm the environment and see Tories ditch or water-down a requirement for big developers to contribute to infrastructure around big new developments, potentially piling pressure on cash strapped councils. Mr Jenrick said the Conservatives’ latest reforms will protect green spaces while making it easier to build on “brownfield land”. The White Paper proposes a planning system with three categories of land – earmarked for growth, renewal and protection – but campaigners tonight said its risks creating a “disconnected landscape, one in which wildle continues to decline because nature doesn’t slot into neat little boxes”. Plans for the first time buyers discount, first revealed as part of the budget, are expected to feature in the White Paper. The government claims this will save buyers tens of thousands of pounds when getting on the property ladder. New homes earmarked for a discount will stay at a low price for all future owners also from the same area too. Key workers, such as nurses, police officers, firefighters, and teachers, as well as armed forces veterans, will be given priority in this scheme. A consultation on the plans is ongoing. Mr Jenrick said it takes seven years to agree local housing plans and five years just to get a spade in the ground, and the proposed changes aim to speed up the process. He added: “These once-in-a-generation reforms will lay the foundations for a brighter future, providing more homes for young people and creating better quality neighbourhoods and homes across the country. “We will cut red tape, but not standards, placing a higher regard on quality, design and the environment than ever before. Planning decisions will be simple and transparent, with local democracy at the heart of the process. “As we face the economic effects of the pandemic, now is the time for decisive action and a clear plan for jobs and growth. Our reforms will create thousands of jobs, lessen the dominance of big builders in the system, providing a major boost for small building companies across the country.” Matthew Fell, CBI chief UK policy director, said the reforms “will allow housebuilders to get to work”. But environmental campaigners expressed concerns. Tom Fyans, deputy chief executive of CPRE , said: “The key acid test for the planning reforms is community involvement, and on first reading it’s still not clear how this will work under a zoning system.

The Queen has Zoomed. Anne marked her th with a documentary about her le that did not involve a single complaint. Charles recovered from Covid-, and avoided criticism for importing it to Scotland. Camilla has spoken out, forcefully, about domestic abuse. And Wills and Kate have had an absolute banger - bingo, baby banks, and a curry with Peter Crouch. The things they do and say are amplied by their status. And by wearing masks in public, Camilla and Kate have done more to protect and promote public health messaging than the entire Cabinet.Harry and Meghan delivered food parcels early on, but even George and Charlotte did that. The Sussexes have since concentrated on sucking lemons and delivering speeches, which has not had the same impact since they gave up the status which gave them a loudspeaker. Prince Andrew, of course, hasnapost gone away, and nor have the allegations about his friendship with a billionaire paedophile. But they have become repetitive, and with alleged pimp Ghislaine Maxwell under lock and key some of the heat is off him, for now.The monarchyaposs popularity, and its usefulness, are in robust health. Andrew is its only weakness, and heaposs been hidden away on the Royal estates which Harry and Meghan felt didnapost hide them enough.The Sussex machine, meanwhile, is graunching its gears. Itaposs shown all the grace and timing of Ann Widdecombe spinning on her bum across the Strictly dance floor. As millions struggle to survive, physically and financially, these two gave the thumbs-up to a book that cemented their petulance in the public mind. A long list of complaints about this girl and her baggage, the sacrices they made which few of us can see, the sensible advice they ignored, and the bruised egos of a couple who thought they would inherit Dianaaposs sainthood, without having to earn it or die for it. Despite being favourable to them, it even indicates they may have lied to the world about their engagement. And the Queen comes out of it looking like she has better manners than either of them. Letaposs be frank - without Royalty, the Royals are nothing. Just an expanding group of well-fed, over-privileged, people who would not be able to earn, represent good causes or holiday for free as they do now. What Harry and Meghan are learning, the hard way, is that applies to them, too. Their star power as Royals was immense - but outside the monarchy, it is waning. They have less protection, higher costs, and the same, stratospheric expectations of the good they can do and the le they will lead.And with the book, theyaposve just burned the one-year probation period negotiated before their departure. How can they ever appear on the balcony again, with the world knowing the details of a common family ruckus, in a family thataposs not supposed to be common  The Royals hate the goldfish bowl too, but they trade the state benefits for doing things useful to the state. They hobnob with whatever nobs the Prime Minister tells them to, co-ordinate their Press appearances, share out the charity work. Their continued existence as Royals, however right or wrong it may be, is strangely socialist, and protected by that of all the others. The Sussexes left the goldfish bowl, and found themselves in a shark tank. Their only friends will be friendless celebrities, the staff less loyal, the public more sceptical, and thereaposll not be a single person able, or authorised, to protect them from what will necessarily be a nakedly capitalist descent towards, inevitably, a line of vegan lingerie.And itaposs all a damned shame, because the day that Meghan walked herself down the aisle to marry a prince with little purpose, it seemed like they would do wonders for us and each other.Instead, they were unhappy, they left everyone  unhappy, and they seem to still be unhappy. Their future holds infinite further amounts of unhappiness, with court cases that, eventhey win, will air more dirty laundry than any sane person would want, and a le that will be lived undercover."},{"url":null,"title":"sage experts call 250000 coronavirus","story":"NewsSAGE experts call for , coronavirus survivors to be considered for a flu vaccineEXCLUSIVE: The governments Scientic Advisory Group for Emergenciesmade the suggestion almost a month ago - but it doesnt appear its been taken upShare made the suggestion almost a month ago - but it doesnt appear its been taken up\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s Nurse-filling-a-syringe-with-flu-vaccine-at-the-Travel-and-Adult-Immunization-Clinic.jpg\" data-tracking\"facebook|share|\" made the suggestion almost a month ago - but it doesnt appear its been taken up\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s Nurse-filling-a-syringe-with-flu-vaccine-at-the-Travel-and-Adult-Immunization-Clinic.jpg\" data-tracking\"twitter|share|\" made the suggestion almost a month ago - but it doesnt appear its been taken up\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s Nurse-filling-a-syringe-with-flu-vaccine-at-the-Travel-and-Adult-Immunization-Clinic.jpg\" data-tracking\"whatsapp|share|\"ByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  AUG Updated:,  AUG NewsThe governments experts raised the prospect of extending the vaccine to a huge new group \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The Scientic Advisory Group for Emergenciesmade the suggestion amid fears previous sufferers might be more vulnerable to other illnesses in future. Minutes of the SAGE meeting on July , published this week, state: “It is unclear whether recovered Covid- sufferers have increased susceptibility to other winter viruses. “They should be considered for flu vaccination.” Despite the advice, Covid- survivors are not among those lined up to get a free flu jab this winter. Instead the jab is being extended to groups including over-s, shielded patients, all school groups up to Year , pregnant women and those with pre-existing conditions. Shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth told the Mirror: “ Labour have consistently urgent ministers to expand the flu vaccination programme for this winter. “If SAGE is making these recommendations then ministers should act on them.” Official statistics show more than , people have tested positive for coronavirus in the UK since the pandemic began. Just over , people with a positive test result died, suggesting more than , have recovered.  But the true number of recovered patients is likely to be far higher as testing wasn’t widely available early in the pandemic. It came as a meeting of MPs today heard harrowing stories from people suffering from aposLong Covidapos. Previously fit people told the All Party Parliamentary Groupon coronavirus their lives had been turned upside down. Claire Hastie described how she used to cycle  miles to work but can no longer walk  metres. She is now largely confined to a wheelchair with her children providing much of her care.

Holmes Chapel Comprehensive School in leafy Cheshire is making the navy blue, embroidered masks, part of the official unorm and admits it is contrary to Government guidelines.The academy, a secondary school and sixth form centre, says masks will form part of our unorm, CheshireLive reports.In a letter to parents, the school body stated: Everyone, students and staff, MUST wear a face covering whilst inside the school buildings. This includes classrooms and corridors. Masks will form part of our unorm. We have taken this decision as a precautionary additional measure to our expected safe behaviours. On the balance of probability, the wearing of face masks is likely to make our school safer thanwe don’t wear them. The school is understood to be requiring pupils to wear navy blue, reusable face masks.Parents are instructed to purchase these from local company Sam Dale and Son, for £.  These will have HCCS embroidered on them, according to a Facebook post from the company.The school is also reminding students of the need to wash their hands. Seventy five specially sourced dispensers have been fitted outside of classrooms, continues the newsletter. Every student and member of staff must clean their hands as they enter each lesson. There are no exceptions or excuses. At the time of writing, the Government says that face masks will not be necessary in schools in England. Wearing a face covering or face mask in schools or other education settings is not recommended,states the guidance. Holmes Chapel Comprehensive School headteacher Nigel Bielby admits the school is going against the guidelines.  He told the BBC: I think we’re going contrary to the guidelines because we want to keep a community that’s safe and protect those vulnerable members of our community as far as we possibly can. We felt it was an important step that, on the balance of probability, we were more likely to feel our children and our community was safer using a face covering as opposed to not using a face covering – and of course when the children are not in those lessons and they’re outside they can take that face covering off, so the misunderstanding that the children are in a face covering for six hours a day is incorrect. “I think most of our community and our children will understand why we’ve taken this temporary measure and I think most of them will understand this is about the safety of the community and the care of our children. Councillor Kathryn Flavell, Cheshire East Council cabinet member for children and families, said: “The academy, Holmes Chapel Comprehensive, is the only school that we are aware of that has implemented a temporary arrangement of mandatory face masks for pupils when theyto school in September. “Our education team has been supporting all schools, including Holmes Chapel, to implement the guidance issued by the Department for Education on full opening from September, which clearly states that children are not expected to wear face coverings at school. “The Department for Education position is based on the best scientic advice and Public Health England does not currently recommend face coverings use as pupils and staff are mixing in consistent groups, and because misuse may inadvertently increase the risk of transmission. There may also be negative effects on communication and children’s education.

Miss Bunker was walking home with her “trusted” childhood pal when he “forced himself on her sexually and strangled her in a park in Tamworth, Staffordshire, at around am on September  last year, the prosecution said. Just minutes earlier, aspiring schoolteacher Miss Bunker had told her best friend, Monique Riggon that she would be “safe” with Streete escorting her. He changed his story at least four times after he was arrested, initially telling Miss Bunker’s distraught family and police that they parted ways, and later claiming to jurors he accidentally killed her as they had sex in a park.He admitted dumping her body in a brook and covering her with branches at Wigginton Park, but insisted he did so in a panic. The jury rejected his lies as they found him guilty after a three-week trial. He ed to the site a number of times in the following hours to put more branches on Miss Bunkeraposs body. The barmaid, who had turned  just days earlier, was found dead that evening by her uncle, Jason Brown, after worried relatives, friends and police launched a search. Streete had met up with Miss Bunker after she and a friend had watched rapper Aitch perform at Birminghamaposs O Institute earlier that night.  The trio went clubbing in Birmingham city centre before taking a taxi back to Tamworth. Miss Bunkeraposs friend, Monique Riggon, offered her a bed at her home for the night, but Keeley declined, Stafford Crown Court heard. Miss Riggon tearfully told the court: “She said she was tired and wanted to go home. She would walk home with Wes. She said ‘I’ve got Wes, I’ll be fine, I’ll walk back with him, I’ll be safe’’.” The prosecution told the jury that Miss Bunker “trusted” Streete to get her home safe during the -minute walk from Miss Riggon’s home.  After she failed tohome, her family and friends became increasingly worried as she failed to answer her mobile phone and didnapost attend a job interview at a local infant school, which she had been excited about. Streete had lied to her worried dad Christopher, , who reported her missing to Staffordshire Police. Miss Bunker’s family and friends quizzed Streete, who insisted they had parted ways at a telephone box. However, he was later arrested. The court heard he changed his account at least four times between arrest and trial.  At one point he claimed Miss Bunker fell and hit her head on a gatepost, and he tried to massage her head and chest to save her. Giving evidence in court, he told the jury he accidentally killed Miss Bunker as they had sex in a park. He told the court: I put my arms around her neck and accidentally killed her. We were having sex. He admitted dumping her body in the brook and covering her with branches, but insisted he did so in a panic.  The jury heard he ed to the body quite a few times throughout the day to cover Miss Bunker with more branches. Streete also admitted to lying to Miss Bunker’s family, friends and police about what happened because he was scared and embarrassed. The prosecution said CCTV, mobile phone data and DNA all proved he was lying, with Miss Bunker’s blood, saliva and make-up found on his top. After her bag was found in the park, her uncle Mr Brown focused his search there and tragically discovered her body face-down in the brook.  He had spotted a “red object” and then hair as he moved closer to investigate. Mr Brown told the jury: Then I saw an arm with a bracelet. I knew what it was in front of me. I just started shouting ‘no’.” Dean Reynolds, an off-duty police officer who was nearby during the search, said in a statement that Mr Brownaposs agonising shouts were the most horrendous screaming I have heard in my le. Forensic pathologist Dr Brett Lockyer told the court a postmortem revealed Miss Bunker had injuries to her face and neck that were consistent with strangulation.

When Rishi announced the scheme he said: From September, homeowners and landlords will be able to apply for vouchers to make their homes more energy efficient and create local jobs. In his latest email, Martin has shared updates on exactly what this scheme will allow and why some people could be set to miss out. He said: The Government has now released more details on its Green Home Grant, including eligibility and what it covers. Those who just planned on getting double glazing will miss out.  Under the scheme the government grant will aim to cover at least two thirds of the cost of improvement, up to £, per household. However some low income households will be able to get the entire cost covered, up to £,. But to be able to claim any vouchers, property homeowners need to also be installing insulation or low carbon heating at the same time. Those who already have those features in their home can get top ups, such as additional loft insulation.

Mr Justice Warby said that both sides have been fighting a tit-for-tat PR battle outside the High Court courtroom. Todayaposs decision in the ongoing -month legal fight between the duchess and Associated Newspapers was a victory for Meghan, as the judge ruled that the identities of her five friends who spoke to a magazine should remain protected.But handing down his decision, Mr Justice Warby criticised both the claimant and the defendant. He wrote: It is... clear that neither side has, so far, been willing to confine the presentation of its case to the courtroom.Both sides have demonstrated an eagerness to play out the merits of their dispute in public, outside the courtroom, and primarily in media reports. Warning both sides he said: This will be a judge-alone trial, not a trial by jury. But to fight proceedings in court and through litigation PR or sensational reporting at one and the same time is not designed to enhance understanding of the legal process. For a party to file and immediately publicise prejudicial and partisan characterisations of the other’s litigation conduct in the media before a hearing certainly does not assist.  He said that the coverage has selectively highlighted aspects of the defendant’s case and features of the claimant’s case that are novel and interesting to the public. The focus is on sensational reporting of information that happens to be contained in the claimant’s statements of case. Meghan is suing the publisher of the Mail On Sunday and MailOnline over an article which reproduced parts of a private and confidential handwritten letter she sent to her estranged father Thomas Markle, , in August .  At a preliminary hearing in London last week, Meghanaposs lawyers applied for the five friends who gave an interview to People magazine to remain anonymous in reports of the proceedings. In a ruling on Wednesday, Mr Justice Warby said he had concluded that for the time being at least the duchess should be granted an order which protects the identities of the five iniduals. In the People article, published in February last year, the friends spoke out against the bullying Meghan said she has faced. They have only been identied in confidential court documents.  The duchess, , says her friends gave the interview without her knowledge, and denies a claim made by ANL that she caused or permitted the People article to be published. At a hearing last week, Meghanaposs lawyers argued that the friends - referred to as A to E - have a right to anonymity both as confidential journalistic sources and under their own privacy rights. In a ruling today, Mr Justice Warby said he had concluded that for the time being at least the duchess should be granted an injunction which protects the identities of the five iniduals. He described the ruling in favour of Meghan and her legal team as an “interim decision”. ANL won the first skirmish in the legal action on May , when Mr Justice Warby struck out parts of Meghanaposs claim, including allegations that the publisher acted dishonestly by leaving out certain passages of the letter.

Lissie Harper is calling for Andrewaposs Law, which would mean those convicted of causing the death of police, fire or emergency medical workers would spend the rest of their le in prison. The couple were married for just four weeks before her husband was killed. PC Harperaposs mother Debbie Adlam is also backing the campaign and said that something needs to change after the thugs who killed her son were handed sentences that could see them spend as little as eight years in jail. Lissie said: I pledge to my late husband to never stop until I have made the dference that this country clearly needs. I vow to stand strong and firm with so many other honourable people in our country to make the changes that we clearly know to be justied. The campaign is being backed by the Police Federation of England and Wales, which represents thousands of officers up to the rank of chief inspector. PC Harper was killed as he tried to stop three thieves fleeing after they stole a quad bike from a remote house in Stanford Dingley, Berkshire, on August  last year. Henry Long, , and -year-olds Jessie Cole and Albert Bowers were jailed for the -year-old newlywedaposs manslaughter after they were cleared of murder. Long, who drove the car that dragged PC Harper to his death, was sentenced to  years, meaning he may be out in less than .  Cole and Bowers, the passengers at the time, were each jailed for  years, so they could be out in eight. But the terms could be increased after they were referred to the Attorney General for review. PC Harper was on duty when he was caught in a strap and dragged for a mile behind Longaposs car after trying to stop the gang. Long swerved violently at speeds of up to mph. PC Andrew Harperaposs mother is backing the campaign to ensure all police killers serve at least  years in jail. Heartbroken Debbie, , is calling for a minimum term for all of those who take the le of an officer with “no parole, no reductions”. She said: We want to bring in something called Andrewaposs Law - we want to change this so that you are sentenced to a proper amount of time and that defines the crime that youaposve committed.

Bars, cafes and restaurants have been ordered to close by pm on Wednesday by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon following an outbreak of  cases in the city. The -year-old monarch and the Duke of Edinburgh, who is , arrived at Aberdeen International Airport on Tuesday for their annual summer break at the royal pile in Royal Deeside, Aberdeenshire. The lockdown had been rolled out again as a surge in cases has heightens fears the Scottish Government is dealing with a signicant outbreak in Aberdeen that may include some community transmission, Ms Sturgeon said. A five-mile travel rule has been put in place and residents are being told not to enter each otheraposs houses and indoor and outdoor hospitality venues must close.  The measures, which apply to the Aberdeen City area, will be backed by government regulations, the First Minister said, and will be enforcedthe rules are not followed. The Scottish Government later announced that visits to hospital and care homes from a named family member or friend will be stopped, with only essential visits being allowed. The decision was taken following a meeting of the Scottish Government Resilience Committee , which also included leaders of Aberdeen City Council, NHS Grampian and Police Scotland. Ms Sturgeon added the decision to reimpose some measures was taken to prevent further spread and to give the Test and Protect teams the best possible chance of successfully breaking these chains of transmission. The First Minister said people should not travel to Aberdeen, but those who are already there can remain. She added the changes will be reviewed next Wednesday, when she hopes they could be removed, either in entirety or in part. Ms Sturgeon said they could be extended beyond that seven-day periodnecessary.Speaking at the coronavirus briefing in Edinburgh on Wednesday, she said the rise in cases has contributed to a greater fear there has been a signicant outbreak in the city. NHS Grampian has named  bars and restaurants, three golf clubs and a football club as venues visited by people linked to the cluster. The bars and restaurants are The Bieldside Inn The Bobbin Brewdog Buckie Farm Carvery Cafe Andaluz Cafe Dag Cafe Drummond The Cock and Bull The College Bar The Dutch Mill Dyce Carvery East End Social Club Ferryhill House Hotel The Hawthorn The Howff, The Justice Mill, The Marine Hotel, McGintyaposs McNastyaposs Malmaison Moonfish Cafe, No  Bar OaposDonoghues Old Bank Bar Prohibition Soul The Spiders Web, and The Draft Project.

Compass jellyfish - Chrysaora hysocella - can give a nasty sting and swimmers are being warned to keep their distance. Devon Live reports swarms of thousands of jellyfish are drting in and out off the shores of South Devon. Explorer and wildle expert Darren Murray captured shots of the Compass jellyfish off Brixham, while in his kayak. The Compass jellyfish are a summer visitor to Devonaposs shores, coming in as the waters get warmer.  Their brown markings lend them their name but donapost let them fool you - they could pack a nasty sting and often leave a tentacle behind after stinging a person. Interestingly, the jellyfish can continue to sting using the tentacle even after itaposs disconnected from the rest of its body. The Wildle Trusts confirms this startling bit of information: Once they have stung something, jellyfish often leave the tentacle behind and can continue to sting using it even when not to connected to their body. Darren, who is also a photographer, said: Itaposs a definite bloom of jellyfish.There are dferent types and thousands of them but they drt in and out so I was quite lucky to drt in amongst them. Another common visitor to Devon are the large barrel jellyfish - sometimes known as dustbin lid jellyfish.  Last year, a professional er and wildle photographer encountered a jellyfish the size of a human in Falmouth Bay, Cornwall. Dan Abbott and wildle presenter Lizzie Daly were just a couple of hundred yards from the shore when they spotted the enormous sea creature on a e in July . Dan, a shark expert who has swum around the world with tiger sharks, bull sharks and Great Whites, said spotting the huge barrel jellyfish was one of the most incredible things heaposd seen in British waters.  In July this hear hundreds of harmless aposmoon jellyfishapos have been spotted around the Devon coast.The six most common types of jellyfish found in UK waters* According to The Marine Biological Association . Moon jellyfish– it has four white rings. The stings are not powerful enough to penetrate human skin. . Compass jellyfish– this one has dark compass markings and itaposs sting is like that of nettles.  . Lion’s mane jellyfish– the second longest recorded animal in the world, it has red and orange tentacles. Itaposs sting causes temporary pain and redness and medical attention is recommended because of the number of stings. The tentacles can be broken into small pieces by storms. . Dustbin-lid jellyfish– this can grow up to  cm across but it has a weak sting. They have been seen in large numbers in our harbours.

But as these never-seen-before sketches of Buzz reveal – released to mark the th anniversary of the first film – it could all have been so dferent. Instead of the space ranger we have all come to know and love, animators at Pixar experimented with a series of dferent faces, colours and designs. Pixar historian Christine Freeman said: “Buzz is one of our most popular characters and it’s fascinating to see the dferent ways that Pixar’s artists imagined him during the evolution of his design. “Even his name changed over time – from Tempus of Morph to Lunar Larry, to Buzz Lightyear. You can see the LL belt buckle for Lunar Larry in a few of these early designs.” Since the first ever full- computer animated feature hit cinemas in November, , the Toy Story franchise has made an incredible £.billion worldwide. But it very nearly fell at the first hurdle. Back in , then fledgling animation firm Pixar signed a £m deal with Disney to produce three fully animated feature films.The problem was they’d never made one before. “We didn’t have any production expertise except for short films and commercials. So we were all complete novices,” says retired Pixar president Ed Catmull. Straight away there were problems with production, technology and scripts. And Disney, who could kill the deal – and Pixar – at any moment were getting impatient. In November,  – a date Pixar insiders refer to as “Black Friday” – they showed a rough cut of the film. The reaction was not good. “Guys, no matter how much you try to fix it,” Disney animation chief Peter Schneider said, “It just isn’t working.”  Although the animation was impressive, the story was flat and the characters were unrecognisable – sarcastic and cruel with a strained relationship between Buzz and Woody. Tom Hanks, who voiced Woody, said: “At first they were saying, ‘we want you to improvise, we want you to get at each other, you could be sarcastic with one another’. “It turned into a sort of cynicism that wasn’t really part of what the original sense of the DNA was.” Disney shut down production and the Pixar animators and writers locked themselves away to try to save their movie – and their company. They thrashed out a new storyline – with the bickering but warm friendship between Buzz and Woody at its heart. Screenwriter Andrew Stanton said: “It’s the ugliest picture we will ever make, but you don’t care because you get wrapped up in the story to this day.” Disney were shown the new version of the film and liked what they saw.  In March, , the actors including Hanks, Tim Allen, and Annie Potts, ed to Pixar to record the new script. The relaxed atmosphere gave the actors more freedom and many of the most famous scenes from the first movie are ad libs by Hanks who was just allowed to go off script and mess around with props left in the recording studio. And changes to the script were happening every day as Pixar literally made things up as they went along. This was where Buzz went through his ious incarnations – until they settled on the name and look we know so well. Director John Lasseter, who has since left Pixar after accusations of sexual misconduct, said: “My favourite colour is bright green and my we’s is purple. Just like she and I, they go really well together.” Woody was originally supposed to be a ventriloquist dummy, but producers said it was “creeping people out” and made the change to a lovable cowboy with his trademark pull-string.

Parts of the country will be hotter than top holiday destinations in the Caribbean, including the Bahamas, Jamaica and Barbados. The sweltering temperatures are expected to continue until Sunday and are the result of hot air moving in from southern Europe. It means Britain could pass the threshold for a heatwave, which requires three days of temperatures over C across most of the nation and C in London. Temperatures in London and the south east on Friday may even surpass the .C recorded in Heathrow on July  - the hottest day of the year so far, and the UKaposs third warmest ever. Met Office forecaster Oli Claydon said: Thereaposs a strong likelihood London and the south east could see a heatwave this week, with four or even five consecutive days of incredibly warm temperatures reaching a high of C on Friday.It is the result of southerly winds moving from Europe and parts of northern Africa, which will push the temperatures up. Thursday is expected to begin overcast for most of the country, but will be a dry day for all, with the sun appearing through the clouds by the afternoon and temperatures pushing to C in the capital. However, rain is expected in the north west of Scotland and Northern Ireland on Friday, with highs of C. Wales and the north and south-west of England will be sunny, with temperatures reaching around C. Mr Claydon added: Saturday will likely be another hot day for southern and central parts of the UK, with heatwave conditions potentially continuing in parts of southern and south-east England.  Sunday should be the last of the heatwave conditions, before cold air moves in overnight leading to some thundery showers on Monday. UK  day weather forecast Today: Rather cloudy with outbreaks of rain moving east across central and northern Britain. This heavy at times over Wales, the Midlands and northern England. Sunny spells developing across southeast where it will be very warm Tonight: Outbreaks of rain and drizzle will gradually fade. Rather cloudy with some mist and low cloud. Feeling humid in south.

Tragic Seraphina Harrell was born after Crystal Kelley - who agreed to carry the infant for her biological parents - refused to have a termination in  in a landmark case. When the dispute turned ugly Crystal moved from Connecticut to Michigan in the US - where state law meant she could be recognised as Seraphinaaposs legal parent. The little girl was born with a rare condition called heterotaxy syndrome, which meant internal organs such as her stomach and liver were in the wrong place. She also suffered multiple heart defects and a brain condition called holoprosencephaly.  Shortly after her birth, Seraphina was adopted by the Harrell family in Massachusetts.Mum Rene Harrell said the little girl had a very, very meaningful and happy le, CNN reports.Her dad Thomas said: She had a lot of joy in her le and gave a lot of other people joy in ways that sometimes werenapost expected.

CCTV footage shows the heroic woman slowly vacuum cleaning as the little girl wanders across the play area just before one of the biggest non-nuclear explosions of all time. And within a matter of seconds, window blinds rock forwards before the glass windows burst into smithereens from the shockwave of the blast. But with an incredible piece of quick-thinking, the maid quickly leans over and grabs the girl and pulls her close to her chest. She abandons the cleaning and flees the room. More than  people - at least  - were killed in the huge blast which wrought devastation in the capital of Lebanon. The cataclysmic explosion, caused by , tons of ammonium nitrate, left , people injured and the city resembling a scrapyard of destroyed buildings. The explosion was a fth of the she size of the Hiroshima nuclear bomb and is thought to have been triggered by a fire was sparked by a welder. Shocking videos showed a huge mushroom cloud over the city. Lebanese rescue workers searched for survivors in the mangled wreckage of buildings and investigators today blamed negligence for the disaster.  Up to , were left without homes fit to live in after shockwaves smashed building facades, sucked furniture out into streets and shattered windows miles inland. The death toll was expected to rise. The damage is thought to have spiralled to more than billion, with thousands left homeless. Lebanese President Michel Aoun said , tonnes of ammonium nitrate had been stored for six years at the port without safety measures.  He declared a two-week state of emergency for Beirut and vowed the harshest punishments for those responsible. Ammonium nitrate is an industrial chemical commonly used in fertilisers and as an explosive for quarrying and mining. It is an oxidiser considered relatively safeuncontaminated and stored properly. But it is extremely dangerouscontaminated, mixed with fuel or stored unsafely. A large quantity of ammonium nitrate exposed to intense heat can trigger an explosion. Storing the chemical near large fuel tanks, in bulk in large quantities and in a poorly-ventilated facility could cause a massive blast. The larger the quantity, the more risk it will detonate.  On a scale, this explosion is scaled down from a nuclear bomb rather than up from a conventional bomb, said Roland Alford, managing director of Alford Technologies, a British company that specialises in disposal of explosive ordnance. This is probably up there among the biggest non-nuclear explosions of all time. Experts have noted the colour of the smoke and mushroom cloud seen in footage of Tuesdayaposs blast as characteristic of ammonium nitrate explosions.Video footage of the incident show initial white-grey smoke followed by an explosion that released a large cloud of red-brown smoke and a large white aposmushroom cloudapos. These indicate that the gasses released are white ammonium nitrate fumes, toxic, red brown nitrous oxide and water, said Stewart Walker from the school of Forensic, Environmental and Analytical Chemistry at Flinders University. If you make ammonium nitrate explosive, you shouldnapost get that brown plume. That tells me the oxygen balance was not correct - so it wasnapost mixed as an explosive, he said. The Beirut blast looks like an accident, unless it was arson.  Some of the worldaposs deadliest industrial accidents were caused by ammonium nitrate explosions. In , an explosion of ammonium sulphate and nitrate fertiliser at the Oppau plant in Germany killed  people. In , a fire detonated around , tonnes of the chemical aboard a vessel in the U.S. port of Texas City, causing a tidal wave. At least  people were killed and more than , injured.  In Toulouse, France in , an explosion at an ammonium nitrate depot killed  and injured ,. Ammonium nitrate stored at a Texas fertiliser plant detonated in an explosion that killed  and injured about  in . In , explosions at a warehouse storing ammonium nitrate and other chemicals in the Chinese port of Tianjin killed at least  people.  Andrea Sella, professor of Inorganic Chemistry at the University of Calornia, Los Angeles, said of the Beirut blast: The idea that such a quantity would have been left unattended for six years beggars belief, and was an accident waiting to happen. Ammonium nitrate can be mixed with other substances to make a bomb. It was used in Irish Republican Armybombings in London in the s, the  explosion that blew up a federal building in Oklahoma City, killing  people, and the  blasts in Bali nightclubs in which more than  died.

A state of emergency was in place as the death toll from Tuesday’s explosion hit  with more than , injured and , homeless. The blast had the force of a .-magnitude earthquake, according to German geoscientists, and was heard and felt as far away as Cyprus. Defence analyst Bruce Jones said: “This explosion was one of immense power that is comparable to a nuclear explosion.“Not only was the blast the power of a one-kiloton nuclear explosion but you could measure the horror by comparing it to Hiroshima. Hiroshima was virtually levelled but it was only around  times the strength of what we saw in Beirut.” Lebanon’s President Michel Aoun said in an address to the nation: “No words can describe the horror that has hit Beirut, turning it into a disaster-stricken city.” He said the government was “determined to investigate and expose what happened, to hold the responsible and the negligent accountable”. The explosion in the port area was the most powerful ever seen in the city, which has suffered a - civil war, Israeli bombing campaigns and terror atrocities. There was initial speculation that the blast was an attack. But Interior Minister Mohammed Fahmi confirmed it was most likely caused after a fire ignited , tonnes of ammonium nitrate fertiliser stored in a warehouse in the port area.  It was speculated workmen welding nearby sparked the disaster – and the probe will also be looking into Russian businessman Igor Grechushkin, whose ship the hazardous load was transferred to Beirut from in . The army is now in control of the city, which suffered an estimated £.billion of damage. The blast smashed buildings  miles away and threw cars through the air. Witnesses reported “mountains of glass” and hospitals are filled to breaking point. Bilal, a man in his s, said: “This is the killer blow for Beirut, we are a disaster zone.” And Marwan Ramadan added: “It was a horror show. I haven’t seen anything like that since the civil war.” There have been no reports of British fatalities so far. Brit Claire Malleson, , who was three miles from the blast, said: “I could see damage to buildings and a glowing red cloud. Everyone was walking in a daze. Everyone was saying they felt earthquake-like shakings.” Lebanon’s prime minister, Hassan Diab, appealed for help, saying: “We are witnessing a catastrophe.”And Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the UK is “ready to provide support”.Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab confirmed we will send £million of aid, along with teams of medical and search and rescue experts. He added: “We have a Royal Navy survey ship in the area which can assess damage to the port.” HMS Enterprise will set off from Cyprus next week.The British Red Cross has also launched an emergency appeal to support the relief effort. And the Queen sent a message to President Aoun to say she and the Duke of Edinburgh were “deeply saddened” by the disaster.  Meanwhile, Russian Igor Grechushkin, who lives in Cyprus, may face questions. His ship was abandoned after it was detained in Lebanon carrying the ammonium nitrate in . The cargo was later transferred to Beirut, where it had spent six years in the port.

So the idea of anyone causing harm or distress to a cute little pup is incredibly upsetting.But one family did just this to their dog, throwing the elderly animal out like rubbish when they decided to move house.The poor unwanted pooch, named Athena, was left tied up by a deserted café in Nikolaevka, Bulgaria, abandoned by those she loved most.To make matters worse, the cruel owners had also put a heavy chain around the dogaposs neck, meaning she was unable to go very far to find food or water. According to Paws  Hope, who shared her heartbreaking story, Athena survived off of scraps she was given by truck drivers who occasionally drove by her.Unsurprisingly she became extremely malnourished and her fur was soon riddled with fleas and ticks. Tragically while she was chained up, she also lost the sight in one of her eyes. However her sad story does in fact have a happy ending!  Laurica Nagel, who worked as a volunteer for a dog rescue organisation, heard a story about a dog tied up in the middle of nowhere and went to investigate. She found Athena and was horried as she took in the depressing scene before her. The dog was immediately taken for medical help and given food and drink as well as a much needed bath. Soon she recovered and it came time to find her a new, loving, place to live.

A white-hot blastwave pulsed across the city, obliterating any building within a five-mile radius. Some , died immediately and the mushroom cloud rained deadly radioactivity on those left. Another , died of horric injuries within days. The bomb was called Little Boy – the world’s first atomic weapon. Three days later another atomic bomb was dropped on the city of Nagasaki. Setsuko Nakamura, , was arriving for her first day as a codebreaker with the army in Hiroshima on August th. Survivors of the world’s only atomic attacks are called “hibakushas” – “person affected by a bomb” – and there are just , left. Setsuko, now  and living in Canada, joined The International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, accepting the Nobel Peace Prize for the group in . Here, she recounts what happened the day the world changed for ever... “It was Monday morning. We were on the second floor of the wooden building. The major was giving us a pep talk. At that moment I saw the bluest white flash outside and all around the building. “My body flew in the air. I was floating. I lost consciousness. I came to in total darkness. I couldn’t move. I was pinned under collapsed timbers and knew I was facing death. I was calm. I heard girls whispering. ‘Mother, help me, I am here’, ‘God help me’. Then a strong male voice told me, ‘Don’t give up. Keep moving, I am trying to free you, there is light ahead of you, crawl towards it.’ “I did and I escaped along with two other girls. I looked back and the building was on fire. About  girls with me in the room were burned alive. Outside, it was as dark as twilight.  “As my eyes adjusted, I saw a procession of human beings, they looked like ghosts. They were almost naked, their clothes in tatters, they were burned and blackened, swollen and bleeding, skin and flesh was coming off their bones. They were slowly shuffling from the centre of the city. Some people were carrying their eyeballs in the palms of their hands. Some fell and their stomachs burst open. Soldiers told us to join them and escape to a nearby hill. We walked over the bodies. “At the foot of the hill was a training field. It was packed with dead and dying. No one was screaming or crying. Just moans and whispers. Tens of thousands were begging for water. There was not a single doctor or nurse. The people were left there.  “With the other two girls, I worked all day trying to help. When darkness fell, we climbed the hill and I watched all night as huge balls of fire incinerated my hometown. My mind was empty. I sat there without any emotion watching the horror. Some envied the dead. To live in the aftermath was as hard or harder than dying. We were starving. There was no medical attention. The government was in chaos. “The next day people started to come from neighbouring cities, they tried to rescue survivors, started cremating the corpses. Those who came to assist started to get sick too. At that time, we had no idea what radiation would do. The rescuers became victims. I started losing my hair, there was internal bleeding.  “Before the bomb, about , other students from all the schools around were brought to the city to work. They died instantly, some vaporised. There were  from my school there. All those people were wiped from the Earth. “My own sister-in-law was a teacher supervising those students. We tried to find her body. We never did. The temperature was C. People melted. I lost nine two uncles, two aunts, two cousins, my sister-in-law, my sister and her four-year-old child. They survived the blast but were badly burned.  “My mother was rescued from a crushed building. My father was out of town fishing. From the boat, he saw the mushroom cloud. He got to where our house stood. It had been flattened. My parents found me and we went to look after my sister and her child. We spent days with them until they died. “The soldiers came, dug a hole, threw the bodies in, poured gasoline in and threw in a match. There was no human dignity. I watched without any feeling. I was stunned.

Our thoughts are with those affected, the emergency services and the people of Lebanon. A spokesman for the Foreign Office said: All embassy staff are accounted for. A small number have sustained non-le-threatening injuries and, where necessary, are receiving medical attention. It is a fast-moving situation and we are monitoring the situation closely. We stand ready to offer consular support to British nationals affected. People should check FCO travel advice, which is updated regularly and includes contact details for those requiring consular assistance.

Abbas Ibrahim, chief of Lebanese General Security, said the blast might have been caused by highly explosive material that was confiscated from a ship some time ago and stored at the port.But US President Donald Trump said US military generals had told him they seem to feel the explosion was the result of a terrible attack most likely caused by a bomb.It would seem like it based on the explosion, Mr Trump told reporters in Washington. Mr Gibb said the US President was premature to speculate.  The Lebanese government have announced that they are conducting an inquiry and we are ready to help support the Lebanese government with any technical support that they need, but this is a tragedy and the Lebanese authorities are, of course, investigating the cause of that tragedy and I think before we have the results of that inquiry, I think it is premature to speculate, he told Sky News. Mr Gibb went on: We are, as a Government, working urgently this morning on what support we can offer to the Lebanese government, whether that is technical support or financial support. He added that the Government donapost know yet how many British nationals are affected and that the prime minister of Lebanon has asked for assistance.

It’s been a long time coming. I can’t wait to get started and meet all the boys.“Now I’m here I want to prove to the manager and prove to the team I can help the club get where they want to be.“I know the league well, I’ve done well in the league before and I can see myself doing well at a club like this. It’s a massive club and the players here are top quality so I’m really forward to getting going.”The -year-old came very close to joining James McPake’s men back in January, only for time to run out at the end of the transfer window.And he says knowing the Dens boss has been an admirer for some time helped make the decision to sign up for the Dee six months later.He added: “It was really close, just didn’t quite work out, but I’m here now and happy to be here.“I think it’s half the battle being at a club that the manager likes you.”Mullen, who will wear the number nine jersey, will already have won over some fans after his play-off goal helped keep the Buddies in the Premiership at the end of season - at the expense of local rivals Dundee United.Meanwhile, former Dens loan ace Christophe Berra insists he is ready to revive his Hearts career after being unceremoniously axed by former boss Daniel Stendel.Berra, , remains baffled by the German’s decision to strip him of the captaincy and farm him out on loan to Dundee in January, emphasising that he was willing to fight for his place.He was excellent for James McPake’s side, who kept five clean sheets in six games featuring the veteran stopper.But Berra will go up against Dee with the Jambos in the Championship this season after reporting back for duty following the shutdown with renewed confidence.The defender, who is contracted to Hearts until next summer, is determined to battle his way into the plans of ing head coach Robbie Neilson, his ex-Tynecastle team-mate, and prove that age is no barrier.Reflecting on his enforced exile, Berra told the BBC: “I could understandI was a bad egg but I’m not.“I was happy to stay and fight for my place but the manager came in and you’ve got to respect his decision.“I went to Dundee and, looking back, that was a great thing for me. I played in six games, undefeated, kept five clean sheets and enjoyed my football.“I know I can still play at a good level. I don’t care about age #you are learning every day, putting in the sht and performing well then you can play far beyond your years.“I’ll do my utmost in training and, come the first game of the season,the manager decides to pick me, then great.“There are no guarantees in football no matter who you are. It’ll be down to me, in terms of how I perform in training and pre-season games.”Dundee and Hearts go head to head at Tynecastle on October , the Championship’s opening day, and Berra acknowledges the capital club are favourites for the title.However, he warned against anything approaching complacency.Berra added: “We have expectations as a club and, there’s not point hiding it, everyone expects us to go up.#We’re the hot favourites but in football, and sport in general, you need to earn the right to go up.“Every team we play against will be trying their hardest # and there are good teams down there good players. We need to have the right attitude and application.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Mr Ross, with the help of Ms Davidson and others, quickly secured enough support in the days after Mr Carlaw’s resignation late on Thursday afternoon.No-one  in the party made a meaningful bid to attract the required amount of support, although there had been speculation that education spokesman Jamie Greene might stand.The Conservatives have pinned their hopes on the Ross Davidson team to turn around the party’s fortunes and offer a meaningful challenge to the SNP next year and head off independence.Mr Ross becomes leader at a hugely challenging time for his party. A recent Panelbase poll put support for Scottish independence at a record %.  Other polls have put SNP support at % and the Conservatives at around %.Mr Carlaw resigned shortly after visits to Scotland by Boris Johnson and Michael Gove, when they were briefed about the Conservatives’ struggles north of the border.It is understood Mr Carlaw quit after he was confronted by senior figures in the Scottish party who were worried about internal polling that demonstrated he was not cutting through with the public.In his resignation statement, Mr Carlaw said he had come to the #painful conclusion# he was not the best person to lead the case for Scotland remaining in the UK ahead of next year#s Holyrood election.mdash Boris JohnsonAugust , Mr Ross was congratulated by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who tweeted: “I’ve just spoken to @DouglasMoray and congratulated him on becoming leader of the @ScotTories.“I look forward to working with Douglas to promote Scotland’s place in our United Kingdom.”SNP Depute Leader Keith Brown MSP attacked Mr Ross#s elevation, saying: #Douglas Ross is Boris Johnson#s man in Scotland.

Although firms have a plethora of guidance documents on making their premises Covid safe, many found it more challenging to source a point of contact or advice on actions to take based on a potential or suspected occurrence of coronavirus on their premises.#Clearer guidance on this area is going to be absolutely crucial as we look to control the virus in the months ahead.#The team at the chamber will continue to liaise with government, local authorities and our member businesses.#In the hours and days ahead, we would urge government to produce clear lockdown-specic guidance, rapid and clear communication with affected businesses and regular updates as we all work towards easing these restrictions as soon as is safe to do so.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t tMonthly n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

A total of  close contacts have already been traced, although we expect that number to rise over the course of today.#In the past  hours across the whole of Scotland, a total of  new cases have been reported. My provisional information is that  of these  new cases are in Grampian.#It#s not yet clear how many of these are connected to the outbreak in Aberdeen and let me be clear that some of these may already be counted in that most recent number for the cluster that I#ve just given you.#But this high number of cases considerably heightens our concern that we are dealing with a signicant outbreak in Aberdeen that may involve some community transmission.#The main link identied in this cluster so far has been the Hawthorn Bar in Aberdeen city centre however, more detailed analysis by NHS Grampian and Test and Protect shows that this one venue does not account for all the positive cases.#In total now more than  other licensed premises are part of the contact tracing picture.#What are the restrictions  NS: #Our travel guidance for Aberdeen today is: you should no longer travel more than five miles for leisure or recreational purposes.#You may continue to travel for work or education but we advise against other travel. We#re also advising people who are not in Aberdeen not to travel to Aberdeen. If you#re already in Aberdeen visiting family or on holiday, you can stay but, please, follow all of the guidance while you#re there and take extra precautions.#Secondly, from today, people in Aberdeen should not go into each other#s houses. Extended household groups can continue but, remember, these are situations that should only involve one other adult who is living on their own.#We will be introducing regulations requiring all indoor and outdoor hospitality in the city to close by pm today. That includes, all bars, restaurants, cafes and pubs. Hotel restaurants can remain open to provide food for residents only and takeaway services can continue.#These regulations and associated guidance and advice will be reviewed in seven days# time. By which time I hope we will be in a better position to judge the scale and the trajectory of this outbreak and at that point these restrictions can be removed we will remove them either in entirety or in part.#If it is considered necessary, we may extend them beyond the initial seven-day period.#Given the sharp rise in cases today, and some bars in Aberdeen are hearing of cases related to them but having no contact with health officials, have tracing efforts and enforcement kept up with the spread here and could you envisage further restrictions coming in in the future   NS: #Test and Protect is doing a very good job and they will make judgements about whether people need to be contacted because they are close contacts or not and we have to trust our experts to make those judgements or not.#The other purpose of Test and Protect is to give us early information about the potential sources of, and patterns of, spread. It#s because of Test and Protect that we know that there are more than  licensed premises that may not have had cases but where people have been identied as contacts may have been.#This is complex but I know the work being done locally is being done extremely well and this will be an ongoing situation for quite some time.#I#m not going to speculate about any further measures but suffice to say none of this is easy, none of this is action we want to be taking butwe judge, based on all the data, analysis and work that local teams are doing, that measures are necessary to keep this virus under control and protect the ability of children to get back to school, we will not hesitate to take those actions.#Are you confident that you will know enough in seven days# time to seethe measures taken today will make a dference then  NS: #No, I can#t be absolutely confident of that right now. That#s why I#ve said openly we will review them in seven days# time.#It may be that, in seven days# time, we have greater confidence that the Test and Protect effort has contained it but we may not have that greater confidence, maybe because we need time to assess that or we may have evidence to show it has spread further.#I can#t, unfortunately, look forward to seven days and predict with certainty what I#ll be standing here then reporting to you.#We have very deliberately here taken a very precautionary approach because I want,we can, to stamp on this outbreak before it spreads further in Aberdeen and perhaps gets out of Aberdeen and spreads more widely in the country.#You mentioned businesses can re-furlough staff. Is the Scottish Government looking at any additional financial support for those businesses that will be closing   NS: #The point about the ability for businesses to re-furlough staff is the key point, in the first instance, to make sure businesses are aware of.#Clearly the Scottish Government will be looking at whether or not there are additional measures we can take and additional support we can provide.#Not surprisingly, and entirely legitimately, it was a point raised by Aberdeen City Council at the resilience meeting this morning so we will be having further discussions around that.#We will be raising these issues with the UK Government because all four nations of the UK will be facing these situations and the furlough scheme, although it has been reined in a little bit now, in current UK Government plans that will not be the case so we need to continue to have this discussion on an ongoing basis.#On the point of review and perhaps how long these restrictions will be in place, what measurements will you be looking at  Is it the number of cases  Is it tracing all the contacts affected here NS: #It will be a mixture of all these things but, from my lay person#s point of view, my worry is, I chaired a meeting with NHS Grampian leads at pm last night.#My worry then, which was compounded when I had the meeting yesterday morning, is the rapid rise in the number of cases being identied right now.#Contacts are being identied and traced and we#re at almost  contacts that have been traced already but there is not yet any certainty that we don#t have wider community transmission and that#s the reason for caution.#I hope in a few days from now we will have a much greater sense of where these cases have come from, what their links are and that there#s no greater community transmission but when you#ve got, in a contact tracing exercise, more than  licensed premises, then the real risk of this spreading out from a very contained outbreak is very real and that#s why we#ve got to take decisive action.#Lots of people who will have been in Aberdeen during the lockdown will have travelled in from Aberdeenshire. What would you say to people who have been in the city and live in Aberdeenshire and may be asymptomatic  And what advice would you give to bars and restaurants on the border who may be worried about the risk of these people arriving in their premises and it potentially spreading NS: #The obvious linkages and intertwining of Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire was one of the issues we discussed this morning.#Right now the restrictions that we are announcing apply to Aberdeen city but there will be ongoing analysis of the Test and Protect data to find outit may be necessary to introduce restrictions in some parts of Aberdeenshire. But we will only do thatwe deem it necessary and we have not taken that decision yet.#Our advice to anyone who has been in Aberdeen, particularly in the night-time economy,you#ve had a night out, be extra vigilant.#For businesses in Aberdeenshire, in particular pubs and restaurants, be really rigorous in the application of the safety measures that the guidance says you will be complying with. That#s, absolutely, cleaning, staff wearing the appropriate protective equipment and taking the details of people who come in.#In terms of how the virus spread, has the incident management team identied any particular activities that might have caused this or any particular event, perhaps certain guidelines that weren#t being followed  NS: #The work of the incident management team is ongoing so I don#t want to get ahead of where they are but they certainly don#t have a complete picture of how the virus is transmitting.#In fact, that#s one of the reasons why we#re acting in the way we are because there isn#t as clear a picture of how it spread from one person to another as we would want there to be in an outbreak like this.#Interim chief medical officer Gregor Smith : #The incident management team are looking at this with a great deal of interest to try to understand what the major transmission might be in what is a really complex outbreak.#At this moment in time, we haven#t clearly been able to elucidate that from the answers they#ve got from people.#What we know in general is there are certain characteristics that make transmission much more viable, the further away you are from someone, the less likely you are to catch it. Two metres is better than one and one metre is better than direct contact.#We also know that indoor transmission is much more likely than outdoor transmission. Poorly ventilated indoor places that are crowded start to become an environment where the risk of transmission becomes much, much more likely.#Could you expand on why non-essential retail is being allowed to stay open  Why is going for a meal in a restaurant more dangerous than going into a shop  NS: #What we know in Aberdeen so far, and let me caution and caveat this with this is still under investigation, but at the moment, it appears to be it has been the night-time econony, pubs and restaurants which have perhaps been more susceptible here.#We#re also acting to ensure we minimise the risk of transmission indoors with other households mixing. That is a precautionary approach but we#re trying not to be disproportionate.#We want people, as far as possible, with those exceptions, to go about their everyday lives.#In non-essential retail, you must wear masks, of course.#Is it unrealistic that schools can reopen in the city in a week#s time and when can parents expect a decision on that NS: #Aberdeen City Council#s plans for the reopening of schools have already been communicated. We want those to continue as planned.#Don#t underestimate the factor here in the decisions we#ve taken today, which is protecting the ability of schools to .#This is about being more precautionary where so we can stamp on transmission so children#sto school is not compromised.#I#ve said for the past few weeks that getting children back to school is the priority. This is the hard edge of what that means in practice when we face increased transmission.#If it is a choice between choosing hospitality or choosing schools, we#re choosing schools right now and that is because we know it#s in the interests and well-being of children to get them back into education.#Are you confident it#s safe for Scotland#s pubs to remain open  NS: #We have balances we need to strike.  We need to get our economy going because not having our economy going is doing damage in many dferent ways to people#s health, living standards and their ability to pay for their lives but none of that will be possiblewe can#t keep this virus under control.#So we have to continue to strike these really dficult balances as well as we can, so we#ve always said we may have to go backwards.#Could you perhaps have acted sooner  Is there any evidence of this coming in from outside Aberdeen  NS: #There#s a lot of examination coming in on the cases in Aberdeen and whether some of the cases have come back from overseas or come back from other parts so that is the work that is under way.#Inevitably you will undoubtedly have cases with elements like that but does that mean it started it or not  We don#t know yet.#Should we have acted quicker  I probably for the rest of my time will agonise about the timing of decisions and do we get the balances right.#We#re trying our best here. The last case in this cluster was identied last Friday.  It#s the last  hours that there appears to have been a rapid acceleration so we#ve acted, I think, pretty quickly.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t tMonthly n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

Once again, the separatists# numbers simply don#t add up.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands wardSir,Exactly two years ago I was diagnosed with stage three, oestrogen positive breast cancer.I’d just come back from a week#s holiday in Spain with Isabel and Margaret. Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures june 26 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAvril Lockhart from Cairnbaan sent us this week#s photograph.Taken at Bellanoch, the photo shows the bike that Avril, as a key worker, has been lent by Alec Ohnstad of the Ardrishaig Bothy.

However, there are still numerous restrictions in place, including no operation of locks and bridges, limited services and limited staff available on the ground.

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through.

But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased.

It is now one of the most beautul drives in the place, and as a drive it would be destroyed.#The line from Glasgow to Oban took  years to build and finally opened in , proving extremely popular with holidaymakers for many years. The proposed branch line from Dalmally to Inveraray was never built, despite plans to #hide# the railway from the duke’s view. A plan from  shows a proposed tunnel to carry the line through the duke’s policies near to the castle.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry.

Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

Instead, they were directed at some national policies and how they impacted on rural development.Argyll and Bute Council had been #more than helpful# to local businesses in the recovery from lockdown, the company added.Mr MacLeod also suggested Scottish Water should be encouraged to allow small developments to be served by inidual septic tanks or bio-discs.In addition, the provision of water and electricity to remote rural locations should be subsidised by the Scottish Government, he added, which would help make projects more affordable.Furthermore, the cost of #impact studies# should not fall on the developer, he said.Another issue was the requirement of registered social landlords that housing is built to extremely high specications, he said.Mr MacLeod said: #That high standard does, of course, ensure the houses are well insulated and easily maintained. The standard, however, drives costs up dramatically and can make small, rural developments unaffordable.Careful planning of the specication could reduce building costs but still produce warm, highly insulated and comfortable homes.#While there is Scottish Government funding for affordable housing and funding through the Highlands and Islands Enterprise Agency for workshop units, there is no funding for #combined# units which incorporate a home and a workspace.This would allow young entrepreneurs to acquire a starter home or a home worker to relocate.Argyll and Bute Council has one of the highest approval rates for new planning applications in Scotland.It said: #Masterplans are rarely implemented in Argyll and Bute but they are used occasionally to enable the partial development of larger areas of land.#Infrastructure costs make up a signicant proportion of the cost of new build housing particularly in smaller scale developments.#"},{"url":null,"title":"a welcome awaits at kilmartin church","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsServices are scheduled to re-start at Glassary, Kilmartin and Ford Parish Church early next month.Trustees hope to open the modern and welcoming church building at Barr Mhor, Kilmartin, for worship from Sunday August , starting at am.Social distancing will allow for up to  people to attend and everyone is expected to wear a face covering.

Cycling has become ever more popular during lockdown and swimming in rivers and lakes is another wonderful way to get the blood pumping and improve your health. A survey taken at the start of lockdown revealed that one in four of us admitted that we were more active than before lockdown.This increased to one in three as lockdown continued, with combatting lockdown weight gain and helping mental health given as the top reasons many people are turning to some form of physical exercise.

Taking a holiday in the United Kingdom offers people the chance to uncover some stunning scenery, wonderful attractions and superb accommodation without having to jump on a plane. Here, we take a look at the type of places you can stay, the rules you need to follow and how to enjoy a great staycation.Scotland’s colourful countryside, breathtaking beaches and glorious gardens are ready to welcome visitors this summer.Many locations are reopening, but have restricted visitor numbers and pre-booked time slots, so we recommend looking at the official websites for attractions and organisations before you travel, so that you’re in the know before you go.The national tourist organisations of Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland have launched a UK-wide industry standard and ‘We’re Good to Go’ mark. The mark means businesses can demonstrate that they are adhering to the respective government and public health guidance, ensuring they can welcome visitors back with confidence.Do remember that our four nations have dferent guidelines, advice and timescales for reopening tourism. Please respect government guidance on social distancing and also any regional lockdown measures that are provided by the respective nation.Summer is here and Britain is beginning to reopen, providing everyone with the opportunity to start dreaming about a holiday. And this year a staycation could give you some much needed rest and recuperation, while also helping get the holiday industry back up and running. Hotels, campsites, bed and breakfast accommodation and other places to stay are now openingthey can follow the guidelines relevant to their locality to ensure that their guests will be safe to stay and spend days wandering our award-winning coastlines, exploring our green spaces and getting inspired in our cities. Each accommodation provider is unique and those that have reopened have had to adapt depending on the nature of their business, including the size and type of accommodation.But these changes mean it is safe for visitors to come and enjoy a change of scenery. But even when we are away from home, we still need to follow the guidelines.Speaking earlier this month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “As lockdown eases, we should focus on supporting the livelihoods of business owners and their employees up and down the country – all of whom are opening their doors for the first time in more than three months.“They are our local restaurants, hairdressers, libraries, museums, cinemas, and yes, pubs. They are also hotels, BBs, indeed much of our tourism industry.“All these businesses and their workers have put in a heroic effort to prepare their venues for this reopening, to work out a way to trade in a way that keeps their customers safe.“But the success of these businesses, the livelihoods of those who rely on them, and ultimately the economic health of the whole country is dependent on every single one of us acting responsibly. We must not let them down.”Mr Johnson emphasised that evenwe are now allowed to spend nights away from our own homes, we must still follow social distancing rules. When out and about, we need to remember to look after ourselves, one another and the environment around us. To make sure we’re all doing our bit to travel responsibly, just follow a few simple steps.When planning your trip, check that important facilities like toilets and car parks are open before you travel.  If you have an attraction in mind, check online to seeyou need to pre-book.Some places may be extremely popular, so get off the beaten track and discover a hidden gem.Stay socially distanced apart from anyone outside your household while walking, running, cycling, sitting and sunbathing.  Wear your face covering at all times when on public transport.  Make sure you have a bank card many outlets are currently only accepting cashless payments. Take hand sanitiser with you. Leave the car behind where possible and visit nearby attractions by walking, cycling or public transport.Heidi and Stuart Cordner have reopened their self-catering property on the shores of Loch Lomond and their family-run passenger cruise business, Cruise Loch Lomond.The -person rental property is set in self-contained grounds on the shore of the lake, and the Cordners hope guests will contribute to the local economy while being respectful.They have implemented virus prevention measures in both the property and on the boats, including increased cleaning and social distancing procedures.They have also invested in additional cleaning equipment and training for cleaning staff.Passengers are asked to wear face coverings and book in advance, and capacity has been reduced to allow for social distancing.“We live in a small community but we’re fortunate that there’s a lot of space and our main business is an outdoor activity,” said Mr Cordner.Cool Camping is a curated website of small, independently-run camping and glamping sites across Wales and beyond.  Marketing manager James Warner Smith said: “Having campfires, spreading yourself out, being able to chat with the owner of the business who’ll be able to recommend a local pub – they’re all big parts of the appeal of camping.“You’re much more likely to be pitching your tent among shrubs and long grass with a lot of space between you and your neighbours.” The company has been working closely with campsites in Wales to ensure safety guidelines are met. At the moment, only self-contained accommodation can open, so the website only allows those types of sites to be booked.  They’ve introduced a new feature on the website where each business can indicate what new safety measures they’ve put in place.  Among the most popular places among potential visitors is Pembrokeshire, with secluded spots outside of national parks all proving popular.·         Wales is open for camping from  July.Northumberland’s oldest castle hotel, Langley Castle near Hexham, has reopened to visitors, with all the appropriate “defences” in place. The castle, which has survived attacks by Border Reivers and a fire that left it as a ruin for centuries, has again been buzzing with guests who have been impressed by the sanitary and social distancing measures that Langley has already put in place. The management team makes many arrangements upfront, such as menu choices and payments, as part of the social distancing procedures that are required. Other changes affect check-in and check-out times, to enable the housekeeping team to carry out deep cleans.

But it has also been a time of positive change and reflection, prompting people to be more creative. Writing, be it poetry, song writing or short stories, for example, has given many a way of making sense of this time, of sharing their feelings and looking after their mental health.For those who have found it dficult to know where to begin, Seil author Kenneth Steven offers this advice to help you start your creative writing journey.For me, there are two essential ingredients when it comes to setting out as a creative writer: time and space. By creative writing I mean poetry, short stories, novels and children’s writing: everything involving the use of the imagination.When someone claims they don’t have time to write, I don’t believe them as it’s a question of making time.PD James started writing when nursing a dying husband: he needed care all through the day. There was a part of the night when finally he went to sleep and she had the chance to put pen to paper, so that was what she did. If we are serious about wanting to write, we will make time.For many years I lived in Dunkeld, close to the entrance to the cathedral. When friends heard my address they would roll their eyes and say: ‘What a place to be. And you’re lucky enough to be a writer.’Except it wasn’t that easy. The truth is the modern world invaded even that idyllic corner of Scotland.First, there were thousands of pilgrim feet and voices. I was driven mad by not being able to find sufficient quiet. My former we watched a great deal of television. It was a tiny flat and the distant murmur of low voices maddened me because I couldn’t concentrate.It was she who suggested # probably to stop the grumbling # that I should have a cabin built in my mother’s garden in Aberfeldy, a place where I could hide away to write. After considering the idea for a few days, I realised she was right.When finally I sat down to start working in that simple shed among the trees, the words poured from the pen. I will never forget those first days. Poem after poem appeared as though by magic on the page. For me # and after many years of leading creative writing sessions, I would suggest for the vast majority of others too # finding real quiet makes all the dference.But it doesn’t have to be a hideaway in a garden it can be a living room or a bedroom or an attic – just at a time when others in the household are asleep or absent.There are few rules for creative writers, but one I have discovered is that we are all larks or owls. We’re either attracted to early morning or late evening.I have yet to meet anyone who has said they’re drawn to the mid-afternoon # what I term # hammock time, though that’s when I wrote in the Aberfeldy cabin. I’ve come to believe strongly you will use the time you are given. If that’s what you have, you will adapt to that rhythm.But I quickly came to realise in my cabin that I couldn’t simply turn on good writing like a tap. We go into our creative space weighed down by the modern world. We live lives beset by emails, phone calls and text messages. We are all expected to respond quickly.I think creative writers are generally poor when it comes to practice writing. The creative lives of visual artists, actors, singers and musicians are dominated by practice. Why should it be dferent for those from the writing community What do I mean by practice writing  Describing the view out of the window going back into memory to capture a moment as evocatively as possible imagining a dialogue between two characters. There’s no end to the possibilities. What practice writing provides is creative grounding. It brings us from being all over the place in our minds to give us creative focus.What this practice allows us to do is to start, then to pour ourselves into what I like to call deep writing. It creates a kind of doorway so the real writing can begin.Kenneth Steven is best-known as a poet. Sixteen of his collections have been published and he writes and presents poetry-related programmes for BBC Radio. He is also a Scottish novelist and children’s author. He’s written two handbooks on writing and led workshops and worked as writer in residence at home and abroad. www.kennethsteven"},{"url":null,"title":"surge for ferry tickets expected today","story":"Ellis ButcherUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCalMac has today opened up bookings into October but has warned customers its telephone and websites will be #very busy#.Following discussions with Transport Scotland, the ferry company opened bookings at am for the period up to and including October .It said customer reservations made before bookings closed earlier this year are already in the system.But with the implementation of the latest physical distancing guidelines, capacity on ferries will still be less than it would be in normal circumstances, the company said.The company said: #Access to our website will be managed by a queue system, which is in place during periods of high demand to provide an improved booking experience.#When in the queue, customers will automatically be directed to our website when it#s their turn.

I was hooked straight away by the topics writer and broadcaster Emma Gannon covers in Olive, her first foray into fiction particularly, how its still a taboo for a woman to say she doesnt want children. The story follows the eponymous character and her three best friends, Isla, Cecily and Bea. Moving between their s and present-day - as they navigate their early s - we see how their lives have taken very dferent paths. Gannons characters feel comfortingly familiar, and their ious struggles many women will be able to identy with. I loved the exploration of how messy friendships can get, and how much warmth, empathy, and understanding Gannon displays throughout. My only criticism would be some plot developments felt a little rushed, the writing a little hurried. However, that doesnt take away from how enjoyable it is the fact I devoured it in one weekend says it all.GEORGIA HUMPHRIESIf I Had Your Face  by Frances Cha is published in paperback by Viking, priced pound. .If I Had Your Face is the debut novel from Frances Cha, which follows four women who live in the same apartment block in Seoul, South Korea. All of them placing unrealistic expectations of beauty, success and romance upon themselves. Plastic surgery devotee, Kyuri, works as a room salon girl where she entertains the ludicrously wealthy men of the city, Miho is an artist with connections to the upper echelons of Korean society, K-Pop obsessed mute, Ara, is a hairdresser and their pregnant neighbour, while Wonna, is stuck in an uninspiring and underpaid office job with fears over how she will afford to be a mother. Each chapter alternates between the four protagonists, told in the first person, the trouble is I had a hard time distinguishing whose voice I was hearing. All of them are struggling to get by in modern day Korea a place where birth, marriage and unemployment rates are at an all-time low. They are looking for a le as far away from their disadvantaged beginnings as possible and the s they are willing to go to achieve that are ruthless. The book ends a little prematurely and with multiple loose ends left hanging. Ultimately, this is an entertaining book you wont struggle to get through, but it might leave you feeling slightly unsatisfied.FRANCES WRIGHTThe Hungover Games by Sophie Heawood is published in hardback by Jonathan Cape, priced pound. Unexpectedly pregnant in Los Angeles, where she has been living in a bubble as a celebrity journalist, Sophie Heawood s to the UK to have the baby she had not planned for. What follows next is a frank memoir about shedding ones old le to nurture another, trying to date and hold down a freelance career while bringing up a newborn, with a few big-name interviews thrown in along the way. The brutal precision in which she describes prolonged singledom is so accurate it leaves the reader winded the love for her daughter, sublime. This is in turns gorgeous, unflinching, tender, sad, affirming and cackle-worthy. You dont need to be a mother, have one in your le or hope to become one, for the razor-sharp observations chronicled here to ring true.JEMMA CREWChildrens book of the weekThe Wild Way Home by Sophie Kirtley is published in hardback by Bloomsbury Childrens Books, priced pound. Sophie Kirtleys debut is a thoughtful and gentle musing on how to cope with change, and control the feeling of fear when it floods your system. Its Charlie Merriams th birthday, and his new little brother Dara has just arrived, but the baby is poorly, and Charlie doesnt know how to love him just yet. So, Charlie runs away to the forest, where he and his friends have built a whole world of their own. Except this time, the forest feels and looks dferent - and then Charlie finds a boy in animal skins face down in a stream. There are broad echoes of David Almonds Kits Wilderness, but The Wild Way Home is not so darkly complex and tangled. Charlies adventures lack a certain amount of peril, while the lives of those he encounters in this ancient version of his forest could do with more fleshing out. However, its a solid story about facing what terries you, feeling your feelingsand protecting the ones you love. Plus, it will make you desperate to get out into the forest.ELLA WALKER"},{"url":null,"title":"tv-preview-sensual-moving-daring-little-birds-feels-different-anything-else-tv","story":"\"They really affected me, and woke a sexual sort of fire that I didnt know I had\",\" notes the London-born star, who grew up in Somerset, and has been acting since she was a young teenager.Now,  years later, the quirky actress is playing the lead role - New York heiress Lucy Savage - in Sky Atlantics adaptation of Nins book.\"I made a lot of notes of little things that I wanted to add into the script, trying to get actual one-liner direct quotes from Little Birds, and I got a couple of them in there, which was really exciting,\" reflects Temple, star of films such as Atonement, St Trinians and Maleficent, plus Netflix series Dirty John.\"That was cool that everyone was open to me doing that.\"Little Birds is a six-part series, written by Sophia Al-Maria - an American-Qatari filmmaker and artist - and directed by Detroit-born Stacie Passon, whose previous projects include House Of Cards.When her husband Hugo does not greet her in the way she expected, she finds herself on a journey to freedom and independence.We see Lucy discovering the surprising, erse and degenerate world of Tangier, in Morocco, a country quivering on the cusp of independence. Along the way, she meets a myriad of characters including a scandalous dominatrix, Chera Lamorwho particularly captures Lucys imagination.Seeing as the show is based on a volume of erotica, you can expect to see some bold sex scenes on screen, which look they could be quite awkward to film.Was there anything the cast drew a line under when it came to depicting characters in intimate situations \"I was very clear from the very beginning of what is allowed and what is not allowed,\" declares Marwan, who was born in Lebanon, but grew up in Beirut and then Iowa.\"Im still scared to this day, to right this second, for when Little Birds comes out, how many family members Im going to lose.\"It sounds like Marwan being quite jokey at first, but then she stresses: \"Its funny, but its not funny even though I made sure that I would never show my breasts or my ass or I would never be in a scene where Im having sex, its still like I did too much for what my family would expect from me.\"The production [team], the director, were very, very understanding... It just felt like any boundary that the actor would set during the scene was accepted immediately, which made me comfortable to be able to do the scene.\"\"Stacie has been quite attentive to any conversation we would want to have with her, related to any intimate scenes,\" follows Raphael Acloque, who portrays an Egyptian aristocrat named Adham Abaza.\"She was always available, whenever we needed to discuss anything about it.\"Hugh Skinner - known for shows such as Fleabag and WA - plays Hugo, who is not only trapped in a relationship with Lucy, who he doesnt love, but we also see trying to become an arms dealer.\"Its so hard because when you put it like that, he sounds dreadful,\" quips London native Skinner, .\"But there are a lot of external forces weighing down on him and, in that sense, hes a bit of an emotionally stunted pinball.\"But despite being gay and deciding to marry a woman, hes really lucked out with Lucy actually because she proves to be incredible.\"All the characters, theyre all sort of outsiders in a lot of ways, taking ownership of their otherness and transcending the situation, and hes lucky to be with Lucy as she finds liberation.\"This may be a period drama, but theres no denying that the themes will resonate with modern audiences.For example, the idea of people being desperate to shake off the shackles of society still very much exists today, I suggest.\"Yeah, I think power struggles will always exist and I think this show is all about people fighting for their own agency, or struggling for their own independence whether thats personally, or politically, thats always going to be relevant,\" -year-old Nina Sosanya, who plays eccentric entertainer Lili Von X, nods in agreement.\"Its going to have a wide audience, because its set in a particular period, but its a period thats incredibly attractive to us anyway, just visually,\" continues the Londoner, who starred alongside Skinner in WA, and is also known for BBC One drama Last Tango In Halax.\"And youre going to have people that have lived through those changes - a section of the audience that might sometimes be overlooked, which is the people that are older than us, -plus who have actually seen those changes, who have lived through the sexual revolution of the s...

It was great. It was also just an incredible learning experience.\"\"I always say that I am always surprised by how much we liked each other because Ive done so many projects with people that I absolutely hated,\" Marwan follows candidly.\"At the end of the day, its a job. But something about this felt dferent... This felt like a very, very special project where, for some reason, most of us felt very connected to each other.\"There was something about just all of us being there together that helped me a lot during the process of filming.\"\"Which makes it extra cruel we have to be doing press for this via Zoom, because of a pandemic!\" cries Temple. \"It really would be nice to be together to do this for real.\"Little Birds launches on Sky Atlantic on Tuesday."},{"url":null,"title":"five-best-new-cars-towing-caravan","story":"Whether its a caravan, boat or trailer ndash or anything  in-between ndash having the right car for the job is essential when it comes to towing.Here, weve taken into account the maximum braked trailer towing capacity. However, always check both the kerbweight of the car youre using to tow with, as well as the weight of the caravan. For safe towing, its usually recommended to only pull a caravan which weighs % of the tow cars total kerbweight. Be extremely carefultowing a caravan which exceeds this % rule.Weve been through the latest models, to see which cars are the very best for towing. Lets take a look.... Volvo XC DVolvos stylish XC won the Towcar of the Year award for , so its only fitting that it kicks this list off. Capable of towing up to ,kg of braked trailer, the XC is just as practical as it is good-looking.An optional retractable towbar means you dont need to disturb the cars clean lines when youre not hauling, while the interiors solid fit and finish should mean its up to the task for any adventure. It isnt overly large either, which means that when not towing, its relatively easy to park and position.. Volkswagen TouaregThe Volkswagen Touareg is a big, luxurious, high-riding SUV, which is capable of wolfing up hundreds of miles without a moments hesitation. It also - handily enough for this list - is excellent at towing.Its able to tow up to ,kg of braked trailer, and a silky-smooth turbocharged six-cylinder diesel engine makes it a refined way of getting about.. Jaguar I-PaceIf youre looking to tow, then an electric vehicle might not immediately spring to mind. However, Jaguars I-Pace was designed to be capable of towing from the off, putting it in line with the firms go-anywhere mentality.As a result, itll tow up to kg. Well admit that its certainly on the lighter end of the scale, but its still admirable from an EV.. Skoda KodiaqThe Kodiaq is an excellent, well-valued choice in the seven-seater segment. Not only is it immensely practical but its also well priced, packing plenty of on-board technology and a vast suite of standard equipment.Plus, a .-litre turbocharged engine helps the Kodiaq to deliver a braked towing capacity of ,kg.

Its also packed with off-road technology and a iety of features which help it to keep going even when things get tough.Its impressive when it comes to towing too, thanks to a braked trailer rating of up to ,kg - which means its got more than enough pulling power for most occasions.Jack Evans"},{"url":null,"title":"Marianne Taylor  The unanswerable question for every Scottish Tory leader","story":"Few voters outside Moray know who Douglas Ross is. Recognition value within his own party may even be a moot point .Yet the -year-old north east native apparently believes he has what it takes to lead the Scottish Tories to victory in next Mayrsquos Holyrood election and achieve what his biggest supporter, Baroness Davidson of Lundin Links, failed to do: become First Minister.Despite no public profile to speak of and very little time to build one, Mr Rossrsquos approach over the last few days has certainly been bold. Ruthless, even, in way he and the party swept Jackson Carlaw aside.You get the feeling his campaign team hope for a Barack Obama-style recognition trajectory: at the beginning of  few knew who Obama was by the end of that year he was US President. If Mr Rossrsquos first approach to voters is anything to go by, however, the political figure we may be soon be comparing him to is Jo Swinson. Team Ross would be well-advised to learn lessons from the former Lib-Dem leaderrsquos disastrous  general election campaign, not least how poorly she communicated with voters in Scotland.Itrsquos early days, obviously, and Mr Ross hasnrsquot even been elected party leader yet, though this looks like a coronation rather than a competition. But the piece Mr Ross wrote for a newspaper yesterday, setting out his stall, was ill-conceived to say the least. Indeed, the sort of undecided voter his party desperately needs to pick up over the next few months may have found themselves themselves wincing, even chuckling, at some of the tone-deaf rhetoric.Herersquos an example. Near the beginning of the Sunday Times article Mr Ross states that ldquoa decade and more of nationalist government has left Scotland a ided country. Many readers, even those who donrsquot support the SNP, may immediately find themselves thinking about the how a decade of Tory government at Westminster has indeed left Scotland ided. Between the haves and the have nots. Between the working and the working poor. Between those who benefit from employment rights and those left at the mercy of the so-called gig-economy. Between those who rely on deliberately-underfunded public services and those who donrsquot have to.ldquoItrsquos the nature of nationalism to ide, Mr Ross goes on, seemingly without a hint of irony. The Little England narrative peddled by Boris Johnson and his cronies delivered Brexit at the ballot box, a isive and disastrous outcome that the vast majority of Scots remain economically, socially and ideologically opposed to.Letrsquos see how a no deal Brexit on  December - an outcome engineered and encouraged by a game-playing Prime Minister roundly despised and distrusted in Scotland - works out for Mr Rossrsquos Holyrood campaign. Such a result would undoubtedly heap even more misery upon Scottish businesses already on the brink after what will, by the end of the year, be -months of Covid--related downturn.Mr Ross is apparently a keen supporter of Boris JohnsonMaybe he truly believes he can influence Mr Johnson on Brexit policy where Ruth Davidson, David Mundell and Jackson Carlaw failed.But there lies the fundamental, inescapable rub for Scottish Tories. It doesnrsquot matter who leads them. They are shackled to a UK party that appears to revel in acting against the best interests of Scotland.Those most committed to the Union will still cast their votes for the party next May. They have nowhere  to go.But polls over the last few months have detected a sht. The size of this steadfastly pro-Union group looks like it is decreasing, largely due to Brexit. Younger voters remain overwhelmingly in support of independence.In a bid to counter this, Mr Ross refers throughout the aforementioned article to patriotism, a term associated with the sort of brash Brexiteers most in Scotland canrsquot stand, and is surely no less problematic than ldquonationalism.The architects of his campaign - among them Michael Gove - have little choice but to focus on ldquosaving the Union. But how do you even begin to do this when your own party works against you at every turn  That remains the enduring, unanswerable question for whoever leads the Scottish Tories."},{"url":null,"title":"issue-day-matter-tiktok","story":"What is TikTok TikTok is a social media  allowing users to connect with each other from all over the world, like Facebook, Twitter or Instagram.

Popular genres include comedy sketches, dance routines, make up, and fitness, alongside all sorts of other niche content creators.Secondly, it acts as a social media  by sharing usersrsquo videos to each other. Over time, the  develops an understanding of what sort of content each user enjoys, and creates a curated ldquoFor You page full of videos it thinks yoursquoll like. While most users are unlikely to reach a wide audience, successful creators can go viral and become ldquoTikTok famous. It may seem a little complicated but my -year-old sister insists itrsquos really quite simple.So why has it been so controversial TikTok stands accused of mistreating its underage users: fostering addiction, damaging attention spans, and failing to protect children from cyberbullying and inappropriate messages from adults. In February  the  was fined over M by the US FTC for collecting data on users under . Since then, the UK Information Commissionerrsquos Office have opened an investigation, alleging that the app fails to adequately protect children.Last November, TikTok admitted that it suppressed the content of disabled, ugly, deprived and LGBT users, allegedly in an effort to cut down on cyberbullying. Most damaging of all accusations has been that the app is influenced by the Chinese government.So is TikTok owned by China Itrsquos complicated. Ostensibly, ByteDanceis a private company based in mainland China. In reality, however, the Chinese Communist Party maintains a management committee over ByteDance and collaborates with it on CCP initiatives, blurring the line between the state and private sector in typical Chinese fashion. TikTok has been repeatedly accused of assisting the Chinese state by suppressing information about Chinese human rights violations, the Uighur genocide and the ongoing repression in Tibet, Xinjiang and Hong Kong, as well as promoting pro-CCP propaganda.Worst of all, the app has been charged with passing along personal, biometric and location data to Chinese intelligence services, an allegation the company strongly denies. Citing these reasons, the app has been banned by organisations such as the US Army, Joe Biden for President, and the Australian Defence Forces. The app has been banned entirely in India, and Donald Trump and several British Conservative MPs have made very clear their desire to do the same.Will the app be banned in the UK Under threat of a nationwide ban, ByteDance have scrambled to find a solution, and itrsquos looking asthe app will be sold off in a cut-price deal to Washingtonrsquos Microsoft. Initially this deal will only affect US operations, butthe British government continues its crackdown on Chinese tech companies , it seems likely the app will pass into Microsoftrsquos hands in the UK as well.

The Terrors were extremely well organised and made a potentially nerve wracking experience stress free for those of us who were lucky enough to take in their first game back in the Premiership.They would have loved the stands to be full of adoring supporters for the unfurling of the Championship winners flag, but with the stadium decorated in tangerine flags and supporter cutouts, they certainly made the best out of a bad situation.As much as it was great to be back at a live game, the lack of fans was the one big disappointment and I believe it certainly had an impact on those out on the pitch.United played against the  men of St Johnstone for the best part of  minutes on Saturday and threatened Elliott Parish in the Saints goal only once.If the stands had been packed with Tannadice followers urging their team on to attack, it could have quite easily been an opening day three points for Micky Mellonrsquos side.Therersquos talk of it being September before supporters are able toto their seats in stadiums across Scotland, albeit in reduced numbers.In my opinion this stage, with empty stadia, could have both positive and negative effects on teams.Dundee United, as previously mentioned, are a prime example of the way a lack of supporters can have a negative impact.But for a team like Rangers, I think an empty Ibrox for the opening period of the season could work as an advantage.Nobody can disagree that it takes a special player to perform week in week out in front of , and in recent seasons some Gers players have been guilty of finding that pressure too much.In contrast, having no one in the stands, players can focus fully on the job in hand ndash getting three points on the board week in week out.Consistency will grow confidence and when the time comes for supporters to make their way back through the Ibrox turnstiles, players should not find the weight of expectancy as heavy as usual.Only time will tellsupporter absence will play a key role in deciding where the title ends up this season, but letrsquos just take a minute to appreciate that our game is back.The league we love and adore, the teams we, in normal circumstances, would follow across the country every week are back on our screens.There was pressure on the Scottish game last weekend to get it right after a summer of squabbling between clubs and the SPFL about how the season was ended.It featured on our televisions and computer screens almost as much as the pandemic we are experiencing.But again I will reiterate, nobody has experienced anything like this before and cut-throat decisions had to be made.Those at the top got it right at the weekend and we must continue to showcase football in Scotland in the best possible way moving forward.The Scottish Premiership is one of the few leagues running at the moment and with an operational pay-per-view service and Sky Sports on our side - it is time to show the rest of Europe what we are all about.The talent is there and a captive audience is here now more than ever.You simply cannae beat it.

But no amount of immersion in JG Ballard, Philip K Dick and William Gibson could have prepared me for rsquos latest bombshell: the news that Gfnock has just squeezed out Kirkintilloch as the UKrsquos most desirable place to live.ldquoCome off it, as Irsquom sure John W Campbell, editor of Astounding Science Fiction, would have said. ldquoShape-shting telepathic poker-playing vugs from Titan invading the Earth, fair enough. Gfnock  No one would believe that.:Kirkintilloch and Gfnock named best commuter places to liveI donrsquot intend to malign Gfnock . I would have been almost as surprisedthe result had been Clarkston or Newton Mearns. But the coronavirus crisis has shted perceptions and priorities and, according to the property firm behind this study, previously desirable attributes such as air quality, open spaces and residentsrsquo happiness have now to be measured against broadband speed and ease of home working.According to those who said that lockdown had changed their priorities,  per cent were more likely to want a garden. Thatrsquos maybe not very surprising, especially after a period when many people could go out only briefly to exercise or shop, and later, could meet limited numbers of people, but only outside.To take another example, one barbecue manufacturer reports recent sales increases of  per cent, which suggests that those who have gardens are using them more, while Amazon recently had to recall a barbecue sold for use on the balconies of blocks of flats over safety concerns, which indicates the limitations of more cramped outdoor space.As with so many property fantasies, I suspect that the participants in this survey are romanticising the idea of a garden, or Gfnock. Growing your own vegetables, building a pizza oven, installing a trampoline or keeping hens are certainly all things that can be done in a garden, but are more of a challenge up a wally close. But theyrsquore all also things that require work and effort and which a lot of people get tired of fairly quickly.The experience of those who have been working from home, rather than going into an office in a city centre or on an urban business park, may have sparked the idea that theyrsquod like to commute a bit less, but it doesnrsquot seem to have persuaded them that itrsquos possible to work entirely from home.If there were a genuine conviction, among either employees or employers, that working from home were to become the norm, surveys such as this one would not focus on commutable areas, still less find their top spots occupied by suburbs. Gfnock may technically be a town, but it s as a suburb .Like the suburbs themselves, working from home may not be as transformative as all that, but rather a sort of halfway house. The question is whether, in the aftermath of coronavirus, being in easy reach of a city centre, but in a nice house with a fair-sized garden, in a quiet area with good schools and excellent broadband, will offer as many advantages as people currently seem to think it will.If office workers can work almost as easily from their own dining rooms, theyrsquove also discovered that they can do their shopping just as easily from there. Online sales across Europe were growing by  per cent in April even after the reopening of some shops, they remained up  per cent on the same time in the previous year. Andyou donrsquot have to commute to a city to work, why would you need to live all that near one at all The answer might have been shops, or restaurants, or leisure facilities, or entertainment venues. But these are the very things that,they are not already closed down for health reasons, are gravely endangered for economic ones.Cities, which have historically been the mark of civilisation and increased wealth, are still overwhelmingly the destination for that portion of the global population seeking to improve their circumstances. Forty years ago, less than  per cent of Chinarsquos population lived in urban areas itrsquos now more than  per cent, and that period exactly matches the countryrsquos economic growth.But in the developed world, or perhaps the digital world, the traditional purpose of the city is less clear, especially with the decline of labour-intensive manufacturing in the West. Automation in factories and the fact that service industries are largely conducted inside computer networks leave retail and hospitality businesses, cultural sites and entertainment as their main assets.Until now, suburbiarsquos main contribution to those fields has been to supply a steady stream of young people so bored by theirdistance from the action that they canrsquot wait to get into the big city.Now that the UKrsquos cities are emptying, and the bright lights are found on YouTube, Instagram or Spoty, itrsquos hard to see why yoursquod want to be in a city, let alone just quite near one. If it offers no good pleasure, as Mrs Brutus put it, why be reduced to dwelling even in its suburbs Itrsquos possible,for most of us unrealistic, to see the appeal of a rural smallholding. Itrsquos easy, for the dynamic, to see the appeal of a bustling metropolis. Butthe metropolis is empty and therersquos no broadband in the wilderness, the suburbs may not be the best of both worlds, but merely the least terrible option. Perhaps Gfnockrsquos triumph is a sign that our future homes will be, like Gertrude Steinrsquos Oakland suburbs, in places where therersquos no ldquothere there.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Twenty-five per cent of schoolsrsquo recommendations were ignored by SQA, using a methodology as suspect as the contention that Mr Chips chose to spend his time entirely in the company of young boys ndash despite having experienced a short le with the gorgeousness that was Greer Garson, at least in the film anyway.Why didnrsquot the SQA simply support the track and trace system, whereby teachers, who know the pupils implicitly, provide all the necessary background info, backed by faculty heads and senior management Education Secretary John Swinney boasted ldquoThree quarters of all gradings have required no moderation.

The Lisa Simpsons will struggle against all the other First Class Honours kids going up for a job in BQ.We need fairness and a structure we can believe in. We need to believe our teachers do their best for their charges.On television yesterday, both the FM and the Education Minister reiterated many, many, times there is an appeals process for those whose results didnrsquot meet expectation.

It all smacked of a pair who realised they were facing a seat outside the headmasterrsquos office for not doing their homework.As a result, many fragile, frustrated, confused young minds first major move in le will see them battle the SQArsquos appeal process.What kind of start is this for someone who has been isolated for months, unable to be part of the traditional teaching process If we donrsquot judge people by the colour of their skin why should we judge those who donrsquot get five lsquoArsquos  But we will.

Whilst the Covid- crisis has placed severe strain on the examining bodies, its solution is quite imperfect and works to the advantage of some and, more importantly, to the disadvantage of many others.Less able pupils in well-performing schools will likely be awarded grades beyond their inidual ability and the brightest pupils in poorly performing schools will be downgraded.Teachers may well apply results fairly based on their assessments of pupilsrsquo performance, but these are being moderated according to schoolsrsquo histories of achievement andthese are poor then pity the bright pupils.Good luck to those who have derived advantage from this system but it must not be to the disadvantage of those who have lost out.

The problem here is that moderation and averages swamp iniduals, whether across a qualication cohort or a whole school. The SQA is wide-open for criticism, but it has profiled a set of awards reflecting the disparities in the Scottish schooling system. An examination diet describes the situation. On no account can it be used to change it.How might this have been avoided  The SQA should have set out its protocols of previous school performance and made it clear that an enhanced profile for any pupil would require substantiating evidence. This could have been about the school as well as the inidual pupil. As other politicians have pointed out with alacrity, the SQArsquos historical assumptions have locked-in bias and perceived unfairness. These two protocols would have avoided unsubstantiated over-claiming by teachers and would have prevented likely exceptional inidual performance being lost in the crowd.But there is a lot more to this story than simply the alleged bureaucratic and methodological bungling of the SQA. Changing the attainment profile in Scotland is a much bigger issue involving educational priorities, capacityand associated resourcing. The SQA takes a kicking while the Government looks on.Professor William Wardle, Glasgow G.IT is perhaps understandable why the SQA had to downgrade some of the teacher judgments. From looking at the pass rates,teachersrsquo estimates were accepted en masse, the following unacceptable student grades would have resulted:National  ndash Up from . per cent in  to .% in , according to teacher estimates. An increase of .%. Higher. Up from .% in  to .% in . An amazing estimated increase of %. .Advanced Higher. Up from .% in  to .% in  using teacher estimates. An increase of .%.Even the final grades awarded resulted in the largest percentage rise in exam passes in recent memory.Teachers, understandably, wanted the best for their students, but in doing so, ignored the statistics of their previous yearrsquos school results.This overestimation could, in some cases, have resulted in genuine passes being overturned as inidual pupil performance could not be taken into account ndash ie, the whole cohort was downgraded.The sad fact is that the downgrading of pupilsrsquo results in the poorer areas was double that of the better-off areas.It was an almost impossible job for the SQA to have got right, but hopefully the appeals system will help.Tom Strang, Former PT Maths, Barrhead.THERE is much discontent with the way in which school assessments have been carried out in this peculiar year. Normally, these would have concluded with examinations, but this year coursework and teacher assessments are what has counted ndash until the SQA intervened. It is unfortunate that Scottish youngsters do not have the same opportunity as those in England will have to demonstrate their ability in exams. For decades, there has been criticism of exams, while \"continuous assessment\" has been favoured. It is true that exams are a throw of the dice on a specic day when some candidates may be out of sorts for one reason or another. Yet continuous assessment puts pressure on them over a y period, and puts pressure on markers to give good grades because the coursework counts towards the final grade. This allows little room for getting it wrong first time and then learning from that.Exams have a iety of advantages. First, apart from any attempts at impersonation, we know who has done the work, with all candidates under the same controlled conditions. Who knows how much \"help\" candidates have had with essays or projects completed at home  Second, ostensibly paradoxically, markers in national exams do not know who has done the work because the candidatesrsquo names mean nothing to them. Where candidates are known to markers, their papers can be anonymised. Third, exams provide a good discipline in being time-limited. Completing a task in a set time is a transferable skill, appreciated by employers. Fourth, under pressure of time, candidates are required to think on their feet , which is another transferable skill appreciated by employers.Instead, this year Scottish pupils are at the mercy of the SQArsquos statistical models. No doubt the SQA has produced an algorithm to guide it. Irsquom afraid that my experience of this kind of assessment has not been encouraging.Jill Stephenson, Edinburgh EH.PRESCRIBED text for John Swinney: The Leadership Class in Scottish Education by Walter Humes .

This could be a golden opportunity to re-establish equal delivery costs for islanders –the Chancellor will take these calls seriously.“Almost every family in the Highlands and Islands, myself included, has a story about being overcharged for deliveries.

They also provided essential trade routes to the protected waters of Scapa Flow.The medieval Viking names for farms and homesteads have long been known and studied in northern Scotland and the Isles. The new study investigated some of the names that have sea or boat connotations used for places that today are far inland in central Orkney.Names such as Greenay, meaning shallow waters, or Knarstonderived from the words for a transport vesseland a farm or homesteadwhere these vessels were moored. Warth, derived from Old Norse ‘ða’ , may also seem obscure as it is in a low-lying land-locked position today.However, there is evidence from Denmark that the same namewas used for a ‘vagttårne’in low-lying locations along water routes, such as the Roskilde fjord. Many such inland places are today located many miles from the open sea.Researchers used remote sensing geophysical methods to map a series of now infilled channels that extended north from the Loch of Harray to the lochs of Sabiston and Boardhouse towards the Earls seat of power in Birsay. The data was combined with information about the old landscape obtained from environmental records within sediment samples. These were cored from key sites throughout the area. The land is now dominated by agricultural activity and heavily modied by articial drainage networks constructed over the last three centuries making it dficult to see anything of the old waterways at the surface today. However, once the scientic data was analysed it was possible to model the pathways and link them to the nautically named locations.The results showed that a complete route from Harray, through the Loch of Banks and including a portage at Twatt over to the Loch of Boardhouse into the earldom estates in Birsay was easily achieved.The waterway network would have provided a shallow water routeway through which the Norse Vikings were able to haul both their boats and heavy goods, such as grain. Similar navigable waterways are known where in Scotland, for example, at Rubh an Dunain in Skye. This new work changes how we think about the transfer of goods and people in the west of mainland Orkney and perhaps enables historians and archaeologists to find more evidence of water transport in the Viking Age and Late Norse period in the Isles.Dr Alexandra Sanmark of the Institute for Northern Studies at the University of the Highlands and Islands said: “I am delighted with the outcome, as multiple pieces of written and landscape evidence suggested the existence of the waterway. The results will be used in our continued study of how the Norse used and organised the landscape of Orkney.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Not having the energy they need makes nerves vulnerable to further damage and causes disability over time.Orkney is understood to have the highest rate of MS per capita of anywhere in the world.Researchers—  funded in part by the MS Society – have discovered a natural mechanism in the body that tackles this issue, which they are calling ARMD .The study also suggests that a common diabetes drug could help enhance this new-found natural mechanism – and prevent disability progression in the neurological condition. Although this naturalalone doesn’t provide enough energy to address demyelination in MS, further research in animal models now suggests that pioglitazone –  a drug currently used to treat diabetes – could be the answer. Dr Don Mahad, senior clinical lecturer at the University of Edinburgh, said: “Disability in MS is caused by a loss of nerve fibres following damage to the myelin that protects them. #Although our understanding of MS has vastly improved over the last two decades, new therapies still do not protect nerve fibres. Such protection is the Holy Grail in MS treatment — not only for the relapsing form of MS, which has ious options available, but for progressive forms too, where treatment continues to lag behind. “Our discovery shows that nerves respond to myelin damage by increasing the movement of mitochondriato the area of damage — a response we’re calling ‘ARMD’. #Remarkably, we were able to enhance ARMD and protect these vulnerable nerves using the readily available diabetes drug pioglitazone. This is an incredibly important discovery – one we believe could finally bridge the gap in MS treatment.” Over the last few decades there have been huge strides made in our understanding of MS, and there are now over a dozen effective treatments for people with relapsing MS — but these only address damage that is caused by the immune system. In order to truly stop MS and find treatments for everyone, a method of protecting nerves from further injury and repairing damaged myelin needs to be discovered.Last year, another MS Society funded study found that a dferent diabetes drug — the fasting mimetic drug metformin —was able tocells to a more youthful state, and encourage the re-growth of myelin. Led by Professor Robin Franklin, the study found metformin could reverse changes that happen to cells responsible for making myelin as they age, and restore their regenerative capacity. MS Society assistant director of research, Dr Emma Gray, said: “This represents another important stride towards our goal of stopping MS — and we believe that MS treatment could in the near future look completely dferent. #People with MS will be prescribed a combination of therapies that work on every aspect of the condition: stopping immune attacks and relapses, protecting nerves from damage, and regenerating lost myelin. It will mean no-one needs to worry about their MS getting worse.“Currently, there are no effective neuroprotective therapies available for MS, but Dr Mahad’s research demonstrates we are getting closer – and finding treatments for everyone with MS is now a very real prospect.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

I am confident all our staff will have made their best overall judgements based on their experience, knowledge and activity throughout the school year – fairness to students was vital in these truly exceptional circumstances, but teachers had to ensure a true reflection of a candidate’s ability.“I wish to offer my congratulations to all those who received results today, for their commitment to their studies, and thank their families, teachers and lecturers and the wider school and college community who supported them.“Today is a day for all pupils and adult learners across Orkney to celebrate their many achievements and successes, after many months and years of study.

The PACE Partnership in Orkney is here to support anybody that may already have been made redundant or might be faced with being made redundant, and can offer support and reassurance to ensure you get all the help you need”.“We’ve supported a number of businesses across Orkney through the redundancy process, providing information and advice to staff and offering one-to-one tailored support.“While we can’t meet anyone face-to-face at the moment, we’re available to chat on the phone to give free, confidential advice and guidance on next steps.“I’d encourage any iniduals, regardless of circumstances, to get in touch.”Businesses of any size can also contact PACE to get help to support their staff through the redundancy process.You can find more information on PACE support at www.redundancyscotland, call the PACE helpline on    to speak to an adviser, or contact your local Skills Development Scotland centre in Kirkwall on  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

DaoineNow there is much within the machinations that occupy the precious time of our Comhairle officers that could well be regarded as relatively ‘trivial’, although I will fully concede that even the most improbable deliberations might well form the centre of somebody’s entire universe.But when we, as a community, or section of that community, continue to press for answers and resolutions to a subject that has already been explained fully to us, then we should ask ourselves one important question: “Are we doing this for the greater good, or because we are trying to promote our own agenda ”. about some of the material that was included in the Scottish Government’s RSHPguidelines and how I felt that some of it was completely over the top for inclusion in any classroom.Several concerned parents had written to me, asking what on earth was going on.I enquired of both the Director and Chair of Education and Children’s Services as to the validity of these concerns.I was happy to note that the ‘plot’ wasn’t as sinister as had been portrayed by some ‘concerned’ groups both within the counciland on anti-social media.Some alleged that the Comhairle were somehow, through the back-door and under the cover of the Covid- crisis , trying to sneak through an agenda which went against the “moral values of this community”.An inflammatory accusation, one that was sure to ignite passions and ring yet another Pavlovian bell.Except that, far from being subject matter that was about to get rammed down our children’s throats, not just ‘promoted’ it was simply an extreme example of what was included for reference, should anyone wish to avail themselves of it.Yes, some of it was fairly graphic stuff and, as I’ve said before, I was hugely alarmed that it was even considered for anything to be found in our classrooms.But, as is the case with material which has been taught in our schools for at least a couple of centuries the devil is in the detail .Luckily we have seen teachers, historically, opt to use the message of love, forgiveness, compassion and mutual understanding from this particular tome ignoring the more sinister aspects where death, retribution, punishment and all kinds of nastiness are very much front and centre.Choosing your testaments wisely is what this is primarily about.We are lucky to have an educational framework where common sense prevails, otherwise there could be very many distractions in the subjects of Biology, Geology and quite possibly Physics.I attempted to be amusing about a topic which has very legitimate, obvious, and serious, implications for our most impressionableyoung people.I hoped I was taking a cue from people who think that a banana dipped into a jar of Nutella is a suitable metaphor for something.Possibly the obesity crisis I think a jar of Bovril might have been funnier.If people wish to identy as a Unicorn and have sex with the pavement, then that’s fine too, but not surely for inclusion in ‘guidance’ material.Yes, I have to admit that I also jumped onto the bandwagon, until I had the situation clearly explained to me and was told to trust the teacher’.They will be given the ultimate discretion and they know best what’s appropriate for their young audience.We do ‘much ado’ well here.When ‘Ironside’ and ‘Bob the Budget Builder’ steered the Comhairle and helped many local businesses through the worst of the effects of the ongoing pandemic, we turned inward and focused on upholstery.With Bernie, Angus and the Education Department, all under immense pressure to get a hugely problematic school year underway on time, we are more focused on what won’tbe getting taught, rather than what will, and how.Andour kids come home from school with a penchant for strange combinations of fruit and nut sandwiches, then it will have been discussed with the Head Teacher and Parent Council first.A lot of the contentious issues which occupy us here in the Western Islesare perceived to exist somewhere between a conservative, culturally protective, radically Christian, ‘right’, and a somewhat more progressive, more liberal, secular, bunch of left-wing snowflakes.Most of us are somewhere, far more certainly and squarely, in the middle trying to make sense of it all.If we cannot empower and trust our teachers to do what’s best for the most vulnerable amongst us, then we will have failed both.The man of the week, last week, certainly in the northern half of this county, was the irrepressible David Black.Three rounds crammed into  hours saw him claim the Thompson Bruce Trophy at Stornoway and take an early lead in Scarista’s  ‘Blue-Riband’ event.Rounds of +  around Lady Lever Park on Friday and Saturday saw him edge out Eddie Rogers,  +  by just a single shot over  holes.A further shot adrt saw Murdo ‘Griddy’ MacLeod,  +  in third slot.Iain ‘Juke Box’ MacKay won the handicap trophy with two excellent rounds of nett  for a  total.In between his Thompson Bruce exploits, Davie also posted the leading score in the, two-round, Harris G.C. Club Championship.His  was  shots ahead of nearest challengers, Billy Fraser and Cal Robertson, both on .Starting with six straight pars, he succumbed to bogies at the ‘amen’ of corners, the deadly-deceiving brace of par-s at   .Naturally he bounced straight back birdies at the new th, and the th brought him back to level.He swapped a birdie for a bogey at  and  to see him home safely.Only a sht in plate tectonics will see him throw away this lead.Midweek at Stornoway saw the Glennie Trophy claimed by Iain Moir on  Stableford Points. Starting his opening four holes, five-over par, couldn’t have been good for his confidence.He was just one-over for the next .In the Junior section, Calum Gbounced back from his recent humblings at the hands of brother, Geordie H in the Par Bogey competition.Six ahead of the course, he demolished the rest of the field by  clear shots.In the Scarista midweek competition, Billy Fraser kept up his, season-long, decent form, partnering Chris Sutton to a fine win in the Pairs Greensomes.Their  was two ahead of Russell Tennant and Alan Gunn’s, .Benbecula’s finest continue to battle it out for their season-long Order of Merit, Dami Steele ing a semblance of normality, bouncing back from a week out of the top spots to consolidate his lead at the top.His round wasn’t, however, good enough to claim the full points last Tuesday evening, Domhnall MacKay storming to a -pointer and the maximum Point haul.Apparently Donald has been keeping his powderdry and intends, after a decent sabbatical, to make a strong charge over the coming weeks."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/web-banner-1.jpg","title":"litir do luchd ionnsachaidh","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine.’.

Both creations have been made by the hands of very talented local Cullybackey people.Shellinghill Park in Cullybackey has for some time been the focus of the ‘CCP In Bloom’ team. Colourful flower beds and neatly mown grass has been the focus of their attention - until now.  Following permission from the Mid and East Antrim Council, the park has just acquired a beautully sculpted horse made entirely from horse shoes. This is a unique piece of art which has given the village something to appreciate and be proud of. The creator of this horse is Bertie McNeilly, who is a leading member of the village Bloom team. He is a self taught sculptor who created this le size sculpture using nothing but recycled horseshoes. The shoes were supplied by a local farrier. This specially designed sculpture is something which has added another dimension to their in bloom activities and, being made from horse shoes, might even bring us good luck in any future competitions!Bertie said he had this challenging task in his mind for some time.“We, in the Cullybackey Community Partnership, are always looking for something which will enhance the village and will also appeal to our “In Bloom” judges. It was a big undertaking but I enjoyed the experience,”he said.  Cullybackey Community Partnership are very grateful to Bertie for his generosity in letting them have the benefit of his undoubted skills.They also thank Council for allowing them to use their ground to displaytheir latest acquisition.Knitted flowers displayMeanwhile, CCP have also been working on a knitted crocheted display of flowers in the last few weeks in honour of the NHS and to those who have supported them throughout this crisis. They are all made by people living in and around the Cullybackey area and each have their unique style.  This display can be seen in the Maine Business Centre window . The idea came from local lady Barbara Montgomery who assisted CCP Margaret Murphy to put together this amazing display.Margaret said as well as taking the opportunity to recognise the NHS and all support workers, she would like to thank the Cullybackey people who have taken time to knit or crochet hundreds of flowers to enable them to “put on this amazing display.”CCP have continued throughout this lockdown period to enhance the village with numerous floral displays which has resulted in the village looking amazing!

Just think of pop royalty like the Beckhams who gted their children the monikers Brooklyn, Cruz, Romeo and Harper.Sir Bob Geldof and his late we Paula were among the early trendsetters when it came to naming their daughters, settling upon Fi Trixibelle, Peaches and Pixie. When Paula went on to have a baby with Michael Hutchence, she kept to the family tradition, calling the little girl Heavenly Hiraani Tiger Lily.Not all celebrity offspring, however, enjoy being called something a little bit dferent. The late David Bowie named his son Zowie Bowie — full name Duncan Zowie Haywood Jones. At the age of , the youngster said he preferred to be called by his nickname Joey, later shortening it to Joe. Now a film director and screenwriter, he is known as Duncan Jones.He’s not the only one to opt for the ordinary — or at least to rue the day an unusual name seemed an inspired and fun choice.According to a new survey by Gigacalculator, Hunter and Aurora are among the top names parents regret calling their kids. The poll also reveals that thanks to Prime Minister Johnson and President Trump, parents have been totally put off calling their kids Boris or Donald. And mums and dads polled also said they would steer clear of the names Karen, Isis and Meghan for their little girls.So, what’s it like to go through le with a name that turns heads  While most Northern Ireland parents go down a more traditional path, we have tracked down some people with, well, famous names. Elvis Kirk: ‘Lots of people don’t believe I’m called it’Elvis Kirklives in Killyleagh with his we Paula. Elvis has three grown-up children, Tanya , Jonathanand Rebeccaand runs Elvis Kirk Contracts and KC Skip Hire and Recycling. He says he loves his name.“My mother was a big Elvis fan,” he says. “There was a big family of us, eight of us, and I was in the middle somewhere. They all have ordinary country names. There was Mervyn, Sidney, Philip, Alastair who passed away, me, Ronnie, Harold and Sandra.“There was a maternity hospital in Downpatrick called Hardy Greer and my mother was in there about to have me and the radio was on. Elvis had brought the song Teddy Bear out at the time and my mother said to the woman in the bed next to her thatshe had another boy she was going to call him Elvis. And that was how I got stuck with it. “I do like the name. Everyone always says what a lovely name it is but no-one ever calls their child it. At work I do a lot of phone calls andI ring a business and they ask me for my name sometimes you hear them laughing. A lot of them don’t believe that it’s your real name. But it’s quite good fun. We used to call our business Kirk Contracts in the early years and we later changed it to Elvis Kirk Contracts and I think that has been a great help. People see it on the lorries and look twice. It’s good fun.”While some people with such a name might dread being the butt of jokes in the classroom, Elvis says he never had any bother. “The teachers always liked my name. I suppose people thought it was a bit strange but I never got any hassle about it. People liked it more than anything.”And just like the rock’n’roll legend himself, Co Down’s own Elvis has made the headlines in his local newspaper a few times... though not for his singing.“I left school when I was  and have been working ever since, driving diggers and doing demolition, knocking big buildings down and driving big lorries — just rocking, knocking and rolling,” he quips. “We took the old council offices down in the town here about seven years ago and the local newspaper put ‘Elvis is rocking the building’ in the headline for a story on it. I hope to keep on rocking for another few years yet.“I thought some of my grandchildren might have taken my name,” he says. “But not so far. I don’t even know any other Elvis. I had heard of a man down in the country with the name Elvis, but I’m not surethat was his middle name. My first name is Elvis, it’s on my birth certicate, I was christened Elvis. “It’s never given me any problems opening bank accounts or anything. It definitely didn’t make them give me a bigger overdraft.“I wouldn’t change my name. If I came back again I would want to still be called Elvis. My name is part of who I am. “Like the real Elvis I can sing, but unlike the real Elvis I wouldn’t sing in front of anyone. I keep my singing for the shower or in the cab of a lorry. I sing away there.” He adds: “I would be a great Elvis fan, and am really proud to be named after him.”Mercedes Carr: ‘I wouldn’t ever change my name ... it’s part of who I am’Mother of two Mercedes Carr,lives in Londonderry with her partner Christopher and children Kianand Kora . She was named after her father’s dream car.“My mum and dad had seven children,” she says. “And I was the last of seven. My mum said to my dad that he could name the last child. So my daddy got to name me — as my mum named all the rest of the children — and he called me Mercedes. “Daddy was a big Mercedes fan and actually wanted one at the time but he wasn’t in a position to buy one, so he said he would name his daughter Mercedes instead. Dad eventually got his Mercedes, me, and also got a Mercedes car eventually which he had for several years. “It’s an unusual first and second name, but no one really noticed when I was younger, at primary school. But when I went to secondary school people noticed and thought it was a really cool name. No-one ever said it was terrible. When I was growing up and going to school, mum and dad imagined that someone would say something to me, but there was no negativity. Everyone loved it and thought I was lucky to have such an unusual name.“My name is strange, but I do like it. I don’t know anyone with the same name. Mind you, when you go into one of those novelty shops to buy a keyring or a mug with your name on it, I can never find my name there. I suppose a Mercedes car keyring is the only thing that would have my name on it.”When it came to her own son and daughter though, Mercedes decided to stay strictly middle of the road on the name front. “When I had my children I never thought about naming them something as unusual as my own name. I couldn’t do it to them. My fear would be that they would grow up, someone would say something to them about their name and then I would blame myself for giving them that name.”Mercedes, however, says that she is glad that her name has set her apart for le — and wouldn’t change it for the world.“People have trouble spelling my name at times, there are so many ‘e’s in it,” she says. “But it has never been shortened over the years to a nickname. The only person who did that was my best friend who calls me ‘Merc’. When I’m talking to people I don’t know or dealing with banks and things, people say ‘Are you sure that’s your first name ’ I say, ‘Yes I’m pretty sure’. Then I tell them my second name and that’s the showstopper. They think I am messing around with them. “If I could change my name, I wouldn’t. It’s part of who I am. I don’t think I would suit anything . You’ll never find another Mercedes Carr, I’m the only one.”Tyrone Power: ‘It’s not bad being named after a swashbuckling hero’Tyrone Poweris from Ballymena. He is married to Wilma and together they have a daughter Andrea , and son, also Tyrone . Tragically, their other daughter Rhonda died in a crash when she was just -years-old. The retired Gallaher’s factory worker says his mother was a huge fan of a certain Hollywood movie star.“My mother was a big fan of Tyrone Power,” he says. “My name has absolutely nothing to do with the county. “Tyrone Power was famous during the s and s. “He was around at the same time as Errol Flynn and was a swashbuckling, handsome movie star. I think my mum had a notion of him. Thousands and thousands of women attended his funeral. “I do like my name. People don’t recognise it as much now, but years ago people used to ask meI was the famous actor. Now they don’t seem to react as much any more or they think it is some connection with Co Tyrone. “Tyrone, as a first name, has got really popular in the likes of America, but years ago when I was a young man it was a very unusual name. It’s not too bad being named about a swashbuckling hero. Sometimes I wished I was him.”Tyrone says that there was more than one movie star in his street.“People might find this hard to believe, but there was another young fella in my street whose parents called him Errol Flynn. “We were stopped by the police when we were out one night and Errol was asked his name and I was asked my name and the policeman didn’t believe us. “He was going to take us to the barracks because he thought we were messing him around. “Errol’s dead now, but he used to live across the street from us. The neighbours in our street had a bit of a tradition of naming children after film stars. “There was myself, Tyrone Power, an Errol Flynn, a Robert Taylor and a Joan Collins all in the one row. “The postman made a comment in one of the local papers years ago that when he came into Inchkeith Road it was more like Hollywood Bouled with all the stars. I think my mum must have started a trend.“I do like my name. I am proud of it. I’m so proud of it I called my son Tyrone also. I wouldn’t change my name to anything less unusual. It’s given me a unique take on le. My we, when we met, didn’t even know who Tyrone Power was, so she was unfazed.”  Belfast   Most ReadJohn Hume made peace visible for others during darkest moments in Northern Ireland, funeral toldA special man: Tributes to TV presenter Brian Black after car plunge tragedyTwo more Co Down businesses close after staff test positive for Covid-DUP MLA Joanne Bunting charged with careless driving and leaving scene of accidentIn full: John Hume Junior#s funeral tribute to his father,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

As Mr Hume#s remains were carried from St Eugene#s Cathedral following Requiem Mass on Wednesday, Mr Coulter#s musical version of the song could be heard drting from inside.Speaking to the Belfast , Mr Coulter said: The Town I Loved So Well was the song he loved so well and we have done a duet on that on many#s an occasion in some weird and wonderful places.It was very poignant for me to play it for John today. It became John#s anthem and certainly any time we were in company and I was asked to play the piano, I could be sure that within seconds Hume would be at my shoulder saying #do the Town#.Mr Coulter acknowledged his friend#s singing capabilities, which he said were like every one  in Derry.He added: John could sing and like everybody in Derry, he believed God gave him the right to sing. A lot of other things, he didn#t give us in Derry but we all believe he made up for that by giving us voices.Mr Coulter said he was saddened that due to the coronavirus control measures, the numbers able to attend his friend#s funeral were restricted.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseMusician Phil Coulter  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappMusician Phil Coulter He said: It is sad and surely he deserved a State funeral with all the bells and whistles but there is something just more honest about this.This is a Derry funeral and sometimes the pomp and ceremony detracts from the point of it and the real point of it is, for Derry people, to say goodbye to John.For those of us who are here, it is not only to celebrate John#s achievements as a politician which world leaders have been coming forward to speak about, it is also for us to say goodbye to a very special Derry man.It is a Derry occasion and we are immensely proud of John and all he has done for this city, let alone what he has done for the country.This place was always special to John and John was always special to us and we are remembering John Hume, the Derry man.Mr Coulter who has shared a long and abiding friendship with Mr Hume said it was his friend he was remembering.He said: I am remembering the John Hume of many a night#s singsongs over a few pints in Donegal or wherever it might be.There are too many sings-songs in low es and high rises to recall but we had a lot of adventures in ious continents which were all good.

Louise Campbells song Everywhere was written in March just before lockdown and recorded in her home studio in the Waterside. The single was been picked up by both Christian radio station, UCB Ireland, and Derrys Drive . And it has now been accepted to the Indie Folk Acoustic section of the UK Christian Chart  A Step Fwd, which unlike traditional charts works on an online voting system. To even have it accepted was amazing, said Louise. There are some really big established names in my category. So evenit doesnt place its great just to have that recognition. googletag.cmd.push Louise is also part of Irish music collective Wired Worship which has  members from across the North West from dferent Christian backgrounds. Although she has been involved in music from a young age, Louise had lost confidence in her singing and songwriting. But after starting to write Christian music just over a year ago, she feels she has found her voice again. I write Christian music that everyone can listen to, explained Louise. A lot of my songs are about struggling with mental health and finding acceptance and being OK with who you are. People who arent religious in any way have told me that my songs have spoken to them. googletag.cmd.push Louise is a member of All Saints Clooney, Church of Ireland church on the Limavady Road and she had recently explored the possibility of becoming an ordained minister. She was disappointed not to get through the selection process, but instead of feeling it was a rejection she now sees it as a sign that music is the right path for her. I have sung from when I was a child and dreamed of being a singer for my whole le, she said. But I had lost my confidence and I hadnt written in years. Once I started writing about my own experiences I just couldnt stop. My songs are about relatable, real experiences as a broken person who doesnt have it all together all the time. Louise is hoping to release her debut album Stumble Into Grace at the end of the year and she is funding its production by selling handcrafted items online. She has set up a crafting station in a cabin in her back garden from which she creates hand made art. I have been painting, sewing and woodburning, she said. I love to take old junk and make something beautul. Pre-lockdown, Louise was very busy with her two kids and volunteer work but after being forced to shield due to severe asthma she suddenly found herself with lots of spare time. I loved it, she said. Ive never had this amount of time to do the stuff I want to want to do, rather than the stuff I have to do. So a lot of good has come out of it, although Id like it to be under better circumstances. Louise has set up a Facebook page dedicated to her music and art and a  member strong Facebook prayer group. Im an outgoing person but Im also a complete introvert, said Louise. But now I feel like Ive got all these people behind me shoving me off the bus. Ive come to see that my own fears and insecurities arent a good enough reason not to do what Im being called to do. You can find out more about Louise at her Facebook Page Lousie Campbell-Stumbling into Grace. Louises song Everywhere is on Wired Worships album Hear which is available on iTunes, Spoty and Amazon music.

His focus is on the now. After an extended break, Limavady gathered in recent weeks to pick up the pieces and plan for next season. “The boys took up where they left off, had a super attitude and we didnt lose too many players,” Eastwood continued. Scrum-half Jamie Millar transferred to City of Derry in search of first XV rugby and hooker Luke Montgomery found travelling up and down to Belfast for training and games not sustainable. Both are from Limavady and the door will always be open. googletag.cmd.push “We cant hold them back from playing rugby somewhere , we wished them well and they will be back at some stage,” Eastwood said. Last season wasnt the only time Limavady were pipped at the finish line. In Eastwoods first season,  , they topped the table by a point before losing the title with a defeat in the final game.  Coaches with some of Limavady’s new signings  “From a coaching point of view, the improvement is important. We hardly won a game up until Christmas, the year before I came in, and the following year itshows how much work the boys are putting in. “To go unbeaten last season, it shows the boys have been putting the invaluable work in on the training pitch. There were a few of them flirting with retirement, but every one of them is chomping at the bit.” Eastwood believes the club is in a strong place, both on and off the pitch. An acquired grant helped kit out the clubs gym and they now have access to three grass pitches, as well as the G facility at Scroggy Road. “As a club in the North West,you look at how Coleraine reacted last year, we were above Ballymoney and City of Derry were at the bottom ofC,” he points out. “We would like to think we are well up there and are attracting players from Coleraine, Ballymoney and Derry, who want to come to us to play an attractive brand of rugby and to a club on the up. “We have a few boys around  and , but the average age is in around ,  and . That team could stay together,they want, for the next four or five years and try and be successful. “As a club, we want to go upand we want to challenge again at the top end of junior rugby. Whatever way it has happened, we have not been able to do that. Hopefully this season we can try and recty it,” Eastwood hopes. One of those flirting with the idea of retirement was Jody McMurray, who doubles up as assistant coach after moving to the club with Eastwood. “Heruns the backs and this is probably his last year donning the boots, so he wants to go out with a bit of a bang,” Graeme reveals. Peter Wilson mixes playing with his duties as the skills coach, with Oisin Quinn now going into his second season in charge of the teams Strength and Conditioning. “He has worked wonders,” Graeme endorses. “He is very good with the injury prevention stuff, touch wood last season we had a broken bone here and there, but we didnt have one muscle strain and his inclusion is invaluable to us. He had the boys in tip top form. “For someone new to the rugby setup, he has really put his hand up to what we are trying to do over the last  to  months,” he said of Quinn, who has worked with Derry GAA teams and owns his own gym. “He has been a great addition to our coaching team and we are grateful he is staying for another season.” On the field, Limavady have had a productive off-season, with  players joining the , against only Jamie Millar and Luke Montgomerys departures. In particular, there has been an improved link with the local Limavady Grammar School. “We have got a really good connection and we are trying to build that link. Like every sport, having that link between schools and the youth setup is very important. Teams cant survive with bringing in playersevery year,” Eastwood added. He has high hopes for Ben McMillan, who has came in as hooker from the school, prop John McMichael s from the Academy and another from the Grammar School, Joe McCartney, younger brother of full-back Jim. “We have a really good mix,” Eastwood continued. “On top of that, we have brought in Craig Hueywho brings over  years of AIL senior experience, Jack Beattie a winger from Derry who played at Ulster youth level has also joined. “We have kept Jody McMurray, who has over  years experience, and Stuart Morrow who is an ex-club international.” Eastwood feels his side punches above their weight and with the disappointing end to the season, there will be a renewed vigour to finish the job this time. “All we can do is prepare as best we can and hopefully everything unfolds in front of us”, he said, referring to the complications of preparing a team with the cloud of a second Covid spike a possibility. “We know it is going to be dficult, other teams will be playing catchup and will have done their best over the summer to make sure they are strong as possible “I always day  we keep our own house in order and worry about how we train and play, then we will never be too far away,” Eastwood added. He feels the club would hold their own in Division , should they advance at the end of the season when it begins. “If you look at where theyhave come from, six years ago they were in Division  and not knowing where they were going. “Now you have ex internationals and boys leaving AIL clubs to come to Limavady because of what we are trying to do down here, it is exciting times,” Eastwood states. Its all with the sobering thought of needing to deliver. He uses the statement - nobody remembers anybody that doesnt win anything – to remind himself of what is at stake. “We are unfortunate, in that we couldve had two league titles in two years. We got beat in the semi-final of a junior cup, we won the conference Division , one the club has never won. “We want the big one. If you are top of the tree after  games, you are the best team that season and hopefully we can go a bit further this year and try and win it.” Thats the focus. It is that simple. Eastwood has organised games with AIL side Ballymena and Ulster Division  side Cooke for September. “They are two good tests, so we can be where we want to be at for our first league game. It will give us a few weeks to fix anything we see is needing addressed,” Eastwood concludes. The new season is about unfinished business.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Banagher defeated their neighbours in the  and  semi-finals before going down to Slaughtneil. The Lynchs have brought through a host of new players in the intervening years from their Ulster minor winning teams and have went toe to toe with the Emmets in the last two seasons. Geoffrey McGonigle has added to his management team. Former Dunloy goalkeeper Shane Elliott and Ryan ONeill join Ronan McCloskey in the setup. In a change to their team structure, Derry goalkeeper Sean Kelly played outfield last season but he has replaced BJ Lagan between the posts. googletag.cmd.push In the first round this season, they were - to - ahead against Swatragh and were cruising but failed to match the Swatragh workrate before losing their stranglehold of the game. In their game, Banagher led Coleraine by five points after the first quarter but it was the visitors to Fr McNally Park who took control. Darragh Cartins last gasp free earned them a draw but Banaghers body language told a story of dejection. The one thing that will raise them will be the sight of the Kevin Lynchs jersey and local bragging rights is everything. They met in the league last season and it was hell for leather. googletag.cmd.push Selector Ronan McCloskey stated after the Swatragh game that his side had plenty to improve on and they will be keen to put the record straight. In the other game in the section, all is to play for as Swatragh take on Coleraine, two teams who will have taken a lot out of their first round outings. For Coleraine manager Brendan McNicholl, it will be about assessing who all is available after last weekends football championship. It was touch and gothey would even get a team to play Banagher, such is their limited squad. They were minus Ruairi Mooney, Liam and Barry McGoldrick. Swatragh were upbeat after their spirited display in the Kevin Lynch Park monsoon but Declan McGuckin and Seamus Bradley will need to address their poor start that left them with a mountain to climb. They will need to get more scores from open playthey are to see off Coleraine. In the other group, merciless Slaughtneil take on Lavey where a win would seal a semi-final berth and allow breathing space during a hectic period for dual players. Gerald Bradley didnt start against Screen and could come into contention, but Michael McShane will be without Karl McKaigue following his Achilles tendon injury. The champions will have to plan without the suspended Jerome McGuigan but they have plenty more in reserve. Liam Cassidy, Prionsias Burke, Cormac McKenna and minor star Shea Cassidy could all come into the selection thoughts. Lavey lost Ryan Mulholland with broken fingers in their win over Na Magha and will need to offer more in front of the posts, with Johnny McGarveys side hitting close to  wides in their opener. Fintan Bradley, Paddy Henry and Ciaran Hendry were their scorers, but its hard to see them getting anything from this game. Ballinascreen manager Cathal McDaid will be looking for a reaction from his sides heavy defeat at Emmet Park to take into their clash with Na Magha. They will take positives with the appetite shown in the opening  minutes and how the use of Martin Mulgrews short puck-outs worked. Paul Cleary is carrying all their scoring threat and that will be a concern. Na Magha, minus Alan Grant, stuck with Lavey every step of the way and they will be keen to build on that as they strive to break away from their tag as a junior team. A win for Ballinascreen could setup a showdown with Lavey in Round , where the winner would advance to the senior semi-finals. The top two teams from each section will advance to the senior semi-finals, where the losers will play in the intermediate final. The bottom two teams in each group will make up the junior championship semi-finals.

The test centre was set up at the Judges Road home of City of Derry Rugby Club in April. However, as revealed recently by Derry Now - https:bit.ly DiqvOu-with the rugby club planning toto sporting action soon, a new base has to be found for the testing centre. The test site has now moved to the Lycra car rarkin Maydown. Initially testing was restricted to health and social care workers, it then accepted key workers and their families who had symptoms and more recently any member of the public with symptoms. googletag.cmd.push These tests can be booked via the Public Health Agency website. Many medical and disease control experts have said that testing and contact tracing is key to tackling the spread of COVID-. The Department has developed a COVID- ‘Test, Trace and Protect’ Strategy which sets out the public health approach to minimising COVID- transmission in the community in Northern Ireland. The key elements of the strategy are testing all people with symptoms of COVID-, contact tracing, providing information and advice on self-isolation, and support to enable people to self-isolate. It says for ‘Test, Trace and Protect’ to work, each citizen in Northern Ireland has a very important role to play. googletag.cmd.push “We must all prepare for the possibility of having to self-isolate and prepare to be tested in order to protect ourselves, our families and our communities. “Symptomatic members of the public are therefore encouraged to get tested early - this will be crucial in controlling the spread of the virus,” a spokesperson added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A construction company, HartlandsLtd, and Apex Housing Assocation had applied to build  houses at a large site at Springtown Road. However, planning officers recommended that the application be refused because the site was outside the current limit for housing developments as outlined in the Derry Area Plan. Planners said thatgranted planning permission, the new houses would set an undesirable precedent in terms of housing development in the countryside. The final decision on the application, however, rested with the members of Derry City and Strabane District Councils planning committee. googletag.cmd.push The planning application was discussed for almost two hours at a special meeting of the planning committee on Wednesday. Maura Fox, Head of Planning at the council, said she could not underestimate the signicance of the decision being made in relation to the Springtown plans. During the meeting, speaking on behalf of those behind the housing proposal, Daniel McAteer, described the Derry Area Plan as being hopelessly out of date and out of touch. He said the new houses would help to meet the critical need for social housing in the city. SDLP councillor John Boyle said he was worried about the sustainability of further development in the Springtown Road area, given the large number of houses which have been built in there in recent years. googletag.cmd.push He said there was already a high volume of traffic in the area and more housing would increase this problem. People Before Profit councillor Shaun Harkin said he recognised the desperate need for housing in the city but highlighted the concerns around creating a precedent in what was zoned as a rural area. Sinn Fein councillor Aileen Mellon said the new houses would help tackle the housing crisis in the city. When the issue was put to a vote, four councillors voted to support the recommendation to refuse planning permission, while three councillors voted against the recommendation.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Jim McReynolds, the popular former owner of McReynold’s Bar, died peacefully last week at his home in Dungiven. Mourners at his funeral heard how Jim had given his time generously to his parish, community and family le. “Jim was a man of faith and trusted in God all his le,” Fr Seamus Kelly told the congregation. “He was very involved in the le of this parish, taking up the collection, doing his time working with St Vincent de Paul, helping and supporting people. googletag.cmd.push “Growing up he was an excellent footballer and represented Dungiven with distinction, gaining a place on the Derry minor team in . “He sponsored many groups and clubs down the years, and club members often said that Jim was the saviour of the hurling club on many occasions. “Even when they hadn’t the money, he would have bought hurls and kits where required until they could raise the funds.” Jim was dedicated to the bar, running what Fr Kelly described as a ‘tight ship’, and he helped cement the bar’s place as a community hub in the town. “He ran a tight ship in his pub. He did not make sales or money his god, but often refused to serve customers he thought were too young or who had already had enough to drink,” he said. googletag.cmd.push “McReynold’s Bar has been famous, not only in Dungiven, as it was the only chief landmark for weary and thirsty travellers from all over the world, and it remains as popular today. “Just last year I had a friend or two visiting and the person wanted a pint, so I said I’d take them down to the best pub in town, McReynold’s Bar, and we had a few pints there. “He had a ready ear for customers’ problems, which were always treated confidentially, and he helped countless numbers of people in a iety of ways over the years. “I’m also told Jim enjoyed cooking and often provided the family meal. The children wouldfrom school, and Rose from teaching, to find a dinner waiting for them. “It had been cooked by Jim while he dodged in and out between the bar and the house, keeping the customers happy as well.” Fr Kelly also spoke of how Jim’s love and commitment to his family, in particular his we Rose, shone through in all that he did. “He met and fell in love with a wonderful Drumsurn girl, Rose Boyle, who was a teacher in her local school.” he said.  “Once they met, Rose and Jim had eyes only for each other and naturally they got married in Drumsurn chapel  years ago. “He loved the cottage in Donegal and was in his element entertaining family and friends when he got off there for a break. I’ve no doubt it holds great memories for all the family. “I enjoyed my visits to Jim and Rose when we were able to visit the sick, Fr Joseph and myself always got a great welcome. “Jim was most generous and appreciated having Holy Communion brought to him when he could no longer go to Mass. “He and Rose always sat side-by-side and I could sense the closeness in their relationship together. I know all the family will miss Jim, but especially his dear we, Rose.” Jim is survived by Rose and his children Finvola, Siobhan, Fanchea, Bernard, Bronagh and Ciara. He was the much-loved grandfather of James, Claire, Anne, Michael, Chris, Katy, Patrick, Cathal, Domnaill, Conal, Niall, Ciaran, Oliver, Liam, Ellen-Rose and great grandfather of Darragh. Jim was pre-deceased by his siblings Frances, Mary, Jean, Patsy, Kathleen and Tony.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The figure was outlined in a detailed consultants report commissioned to undertake an in-depth feasibility study to look at potential developments for the local harbour.While the key issue the consultants focused on was deepening the harbour to facilitate larger vessels, they also examined improving harbour conditions, berthing pontoons for smaller vessels and increased berthing facilities.The consultants also undertook a comprehensive review of possible harbour layouts, historic document research, topographic and bathymetric harbour surveys, quay wall inspection above and below the waterline and computer modelling.Ardglass has the only all-weather harbour between Howth and Bangor and has three primary areas, including the fish dock within the southpier. In August last year, ious concept layouts produced by consultants were reviewed by members of the Ardglass Harbour Developments group set up to oversee the regeneration of the port.Cllr Curran says there are plans to deepen the outer harbour by nine metres and the area adjacent to Cochranersquos building at the inner harbour by two metres to facilitate crab vessels.He said consideration is also being given to creating a pontoon with finger berths adjacent to the quay wall and gangway access for crab vessels. No leisure craft would be permitted at this part of the harbour.ldquoNew investment in Ardglass harbour can help sustain existing jobs and create new employment opportunities, said Cllr Curran. ldquoThe port plays a key part in the local economy and is at the heart of village le..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd July 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Couple who met at school enjoy 50th wedding anniversary  ","story":"A LOCAL couple who met at school and whose love grew at a church youth group have recently celebrated th years of marriage.Jim and Angela Wilson marked their golden anniversary with a family party with their three sons and their wives and nine grandchildren.The Saintfield couple, who now live in Comber, married on July ,  at Saintfield Parish Church and honeymooned, like many others of their generation, at home.Angela was just  and Jim  when they got married but despite their tender years starting off married le, the happy couple wouldnrsquot turn the clock back.Retired motor mechanic Jim said: ldquoWe met at Saintfield High School and used to go the local youth club, I was in the BB and Angela was in the GB.

But there was concern locally that the South Eastern Trust had been unable to provide a definitive date when this would happen.Trust officials mdash who gave a commitment to outline the date at the end of this month mdash have confirmed that emergency services will recommence on October  and operate between am and pm from Monday to Friday.In addition, a new daily minor injuries unit opens for business on August  at the Downpatrick hospital, operating on an appointment only basis with patients required to ring ahead for an appointment. The Downersquos GP out-of-hours service is also continuing as normal.While the planned reopening of the emergency department has been warmly welcomed, health officials say they are continuing to manage Covid- and that all plans remain subject to a number of critical factors.These include workforce availability, adequate supplies of personal and protective equipment, the potential impact of further surges of coronavirus and managing safety and risk for patients, service users and staff.The South Eastern Trust has also referenced concern about the ldquocirculation of information which may be inaccurate and misleading to the local community and reaffirmed its commitment to the Downe Hospital.ldquoThe hospital continues to play a vital role in responding to the Covid- pandemic and the Trust would like to thank the local community for the support and appreciation offered to our dedicated staff, who continue to work tirelessly to protect and care for the health and wellbeing of our population, a spokeswoman added.Health officials say they are working to rebuild health and social care services in accordance with the Department of Healthrsquos lsquostrategic framework for rebuilding health and social care services,rsquo explaining that as they do this, their absolute priority remains keeping patients, service users and staff safe.South Down MP Chris Hazzard, who organised last weekrsquos meeting in Downpatrick to press for the urgentof the emergency department and other services, described confirmation of the date for the restoration of emergency care as a ldquopositive outcome to the recent community campaign to protect local services.The MP also accused the South Eastern Trust of performing a ldquoU-turn in relation to the reinstatement of emergency services.He continued: ldquoOnly a number of weeks ago the Trust insisted that it was not possible to give a date for the restoration of emergency services but, following several heated exchanges with local political representatives and a five party meeting with trade unions and the Down Community Health Committee last week, the Trust has now performed a u-turn and announced that the service will be reopen on October .ldquoThis is welcome news for our community which, for too long, has been without the necessary services in our hospital. It is also a very powerful illustration of what can be achievedour community stands together in the interests of our local hospital and the wonderful staff at the Downe.Mr Hazzard said that in the months ahead, all political parties, trade union representatives, hospital campaigners and the health trust will work together to deliver for the Downe.The MP added: ldquoI want to thank the local community for rallying to this issue in recent weeks and extend a huge message of solidarity to those members of staff at the Downe who have worked tirelessly in very dficult circumstances in recent times.The Down Community Health Committee said while the reopening date is later than it might have wished and is subject to other factors, it is to be welcomed.ldquoThe Downe is a tremendous facility for the local community and recent investments in the hospital and those that are planned in the not too distant future will enable it to deliver even more and better services for our community and, indeed, across the region, campaigners said in a statement.ldquoWe must all continue to be watchful to ensure that the Department of Health does not attempt to introduce any change to healthcare provision without full consultation with the local community and its representatives.Campaigners say they welcome the manner in which local politicians have come together and exerted their not inconsiderable influence in connection with theof emergency services.Campaigners add: ldquoThere is still a great deal to be done to further protect, enhance and develop the services currently on offer at the Downe.

It should also be publicised in the Outdoor Swimmer Magazine.A council spokeswoman confirmed that the council took a decision to close all seasonal facilities in Newcastle, including both outdoor pools, due to Covid-.She said the decision was considered in the councilrsquos emergency business plan tabled at the local authorityrsquos Active and Healthy Communities Committee meeting on June  and ratied at the full council meeting last month.In relation to the reopening of the indoor swimming pool at the Down Leisure Centre, the spokeswoman said the local authority was currently considering recent announcements by the Northern Ireland Executive on the reopening of pools and health suites and in relation to spectators at outdoor facilities.She added: ldquoAt present, these facilities remain closed until further notice.ldquoThe council is taking a phased approach to the reopening of its leisure facilities to ensure the safety of both staff and customers. Any reopening dates for these activities will be communicated in due course..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd July 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Terry’s delightful take on nature and life  ","story":"TERRY Hanna is the chairman of Ballynahinch Camera Club and says he has owned a camera all of his adult le, ldquomostly for shooting family and holiday snaps, but using basic settings and with little creativity in mind.In , two years before retiring, he upgraded his camera and joined the camera Club, with a view to spending more productive time with a camera during retirement.ldquoThat is exactly what happened, although I hadnrsquot anticipated getting involved in club organisation to the extent that Irsquom looking forward to the   year as chair for a second year.

I was either three or four. My brother Garrett is a year younger than me. We moved from Strangford to Downpatrick when I was four-and-a-half and it was before that.My father had taken the two of us to watch a football match. Other than my mother, perhaps his five favourite things in le were reading, the crossword, conversation, a cup of tea and watching a game.What he wasnrsquot always great at was keeping a close eye on children in his charge. Between watching his old club play and chatting to a couple of the other men on the sideline, he didnrsquot notice Garrett and I making a sprint on to the pitch, looking for a go with the ball.It could well be that memory through the efflux of time has us causing greater disruption that night than actually was the case. In some ways I hope that our presence wasnrsquot even noticed by the players. It would be awful were that to have been the biggest influence that I ever had on a football match, although there is every chance that my high point was that warm evening in Kilclief.Unfortunately my enthusiasm for sport was not matched by aptitude. On one visit to his cousins in Listowel I was being encouraged to eat up my black pudding with the Kerry exhortation that I wouldnrsquot play football for Down without a good diet of black pudding.If only it had been that easy. The biggest problem was an unreliability and inconsistency in a ballrsquos direction of flight after it had been propelled by my foot, hand or implement. Allied to being short-sighted before my teens and having a slight frame, the portents werenrsquot good.Football was the game in the Red High and there were plenty of good footballers about. Kevan Owens, Ciaran McCabe and Patrick Kielty were in my year. Brian Burns the year behind. John Kielty the year ahead with Conor Deegan, Barry Breen, Mark McCartan and John Kelly a few years ahead.The recently-deceased Bro Charles was teaching in the school until my fourth year and every day hersquod put out a tea chest of hurleys for a lunchtime puck-about, which I often took advantage of. Bro Charles also coached a Downpatrick team and under his patient tutelage, and presumably need for numbers, I reached my sporting apogee with an East Down U-frac medal.What I did get from my father was the love of watching sport and going to matches. He brought me to Croke Park for the first time when I was six. It was the  football final. I was mesmerised by the colour and the noise. I know that Dublin beat Armagh that day but I honestly donrsquot remember that.What I do remember is that, for my only time, our seats were in the Ard Comhairle box. And they were soft seats. And I remember Down winning the minor match and them being given a big silver cup and I remember Daddy holding me up in his arms so that I could see it and it being so close that I tried to reach out and touch it.But it wasnrsquot all glamour. I still have yet to feel as baltic as I did one winter Sunday standing on a grass bank in the Marshes at about the age of eight or nine with the cold spreading from the frozen turf through the soles of my shoes and up my legs and Daddy talking and talking and talking as I futilely tried to will him back to the car and the warmth of home.Happier times included a spring and summer of going to watch club hurling matches. He was a member, along with Paddy OrsquoDonoghue I think, of a commission on the future of hurling in Down for the County Board and there were many trips to games, particularly to the Ards.As much as he loved football, in truth hurling was his real passion. Due maybe to a Waterford father. As a young man he had hurled for Kilclief and the county. Nothing better than a good game of hurling, hersquod say. Particularly one played in fair conditions on a firm pitch. He never got to the Munster final as often as he would have liked, but that was considered one of the great highlights of any sporting year.What we did get to and what from a young age what I was lucky enough to have as a highlight were the September trips to Croke Park for the hurling and football finals. Particularly the football finals. I got to see the great Kerry-Dublin battles, Kerryrsquos four-in-a-row, Kerryrsquos three-in-a-row.With a Kerry grandmother I felt some affinity to that great team. The Spillanes, Jack OrsquoShea, Paacuteidiacute Oacute Seacute, Mikey Sheehy, Bomber Liston, Ogie Moran, Charlie Nelligan. Great men. As magnicent as the modern Croke Park is, part of me will always miss the old wooden benches of the Hogan Stand.But there were green shoots beginning to appear with Downrsquos Minor All-Ireland in  followed by a narrow loss to Meath, my county of residence these last  years and more, in the  National League final. Preludes of course to theof the good old days and Downrsquos second era of greatness.I have never been at a more momentous sporting occasion than the  final.  comes close obviously, but doesnrsquot match it for the sheer joy, relief and euphoria.That match in Celtic Park is another contender. I suspect that had I been in Istanbul in  it might also have come close. I was in Cardf when Leinster came back from the dead with  unanswered second half points to win their second Heineken Cup. That too was an extraordinary day. But rsquo was in a league of its own.Those men of Kerry were heroes. But heroes in the same way as Kenny Dalglish, Alan Hansen and John Barnes were heroes. Itrsquos a very dferent thing when the heroes are your own people. The excitement building for weeks before. My father calling in favours from all over the country to secure extra tickets. He could nearly have opened a ticket agency.My seat that day was near the back of the Upper Cusack, two seats along from Paddy Doherty. Afterwards we made our way across the pitch and out on to Jonesrsquos Road to meet up with everyone  for the chat. At some ungodly hour on the Monday night the bus finally arrived into Downpatrick and the great Pete McGrath said that we beat the team that couldnrsquot be beaten.The last time that I went to Croke Park with my father was his last visit, three-and-a-half months before he died. It was the hurling final between his fatherrsquos county of Waterford and Galway.He had been there in  and  when they had won their two All-Irelands. He had spent childhood holidays with cousins near Dungarvan, which is where he had learnt to speak Irish. In  he had a lt by horse and cart into Tramore for the train to Dublin to watch the match.His lungs werenrsquot great at that point and I think he had greater clarity than the rest of us about how long was left. He had said to me one evening in France the month before, ldquoYou know that this is going to do for me. I knew it was, but I thought there was still a good bit leftto go.It was  years since he had brought me that first time to Croke Park when we saw Down win an All-Ireland. It would have been nice symmetry had Waterford won on his last visit but it wasnrsquot to be. The day still finished with him standing chatting to friends on Jonesrsquos Road for as long as he was able. I was happy to have been with him on that last trip.At some point in the lsquos my father stopped driving. He was probably happier with the greater opportunity for the crossword or the newspaper. My mother drove him about, but often therersquod be a lt to a match, usually with Joe Leonard. I think he went to more matches with Joe in his last couple of decades than with everyone  combined.We had started going on holidays to France in the lsquos and by the mid lsquos, by which time he had retired as Ombudsman , he and my mother were spending most of the summer there. They loved itbut,there was one downside, he missed a lot of football and hurling.Initially he relied on match reports by telephone from any of us still in Ireland. The urgency of the reports eased as his access to the internet grew but he still appreciated a call at some point to be told how the match had actually gone.The real salvation though was when their great friends, the McQuaids from Dungannon, started to come on holidays to the next town. That in itself was a good thing, but the real boon was Jimrsquos technical wizardry and ability to use a satellite dish to get RTEacute. Thereafter Jim and Maurice spent many Saturday evenings and Sunday afternoons watching Jimrsquos television.I donrsquot know when I first knew of the great feats of the lsquos. I donrsquot ever remember not knowing. Whether it was the flag that my mother kept in the house with ldquoUp Down stitched across it that she had made for one of her brothers in  that my brothers and I loved to take out and wave in the garden.Or my fatherrsquos watch that had been given to him by Brian McCartan and Charlie Carr, which was engraved ldquoTo Maurice Hayes, Secretary of the Down All Ireland Football Team . From B. and C., which fascinated us as children. A watch he wore for the rest of his le and which I am wearing now as I write this.That watch made it clear that this had been something of very great import. I often think of James McCartanrsquos story of meeting his father on Jonesrsquos Road after the  final. His father was in floods of tears and said to him, ldquoYou kept your promise.The names were as familiar as our own. The McCartans and the OrsquoNeills. Paddy Doherty, Joe Lennon, Kevin Mussen, Jarlath Carey, Leo Murphy, Eddie McKay, Tony Hadden, George Lavery, Breen Morgan, Pat Rice, Patsy OrsquoHagan, PJ McElroy, John Smith and Kieran Denvir along with names like John Murphy, Peter Rooney, Larry Powell, Danny Kelly, Ray McConville, Jim Milligan and the great Colm McAlarney from later in the decade.As a boy, when people heard that I was a Hayes, Irsquod at times be askedI was Mauricersquos son and then told that Down wouldnrsquot have won an All-Ireland but for him. And when Irsquod ask him about it hersquod say that Down wouldnrsquot have won an All-Ireland without the players, that hersquod never kicked a ball.He spent the best part of six decades holding those men in the highest esteem, as footballers, as people, and as friends. His view was that every one of them had lived constructive lives in which they had contributed to their families, their communities and to society.And for all their achievements, they were modest men. Paddy Doherty recently selected his best Down team of all time for the Down Recorder. He didnrsquot pick himself. Paddy lsquoMorsquo is the only person in the entire country that wouldnrsquot have Paddy lsquoMorsquo on that team.Above all, he loved their company. He loved meeting up with them over the years at matches and ious s. Usually wearing his Club Down tie. Part of the pleasure of going to a match was the half-time cup of tea and the chat with friends afterwards, whether on Jonesrsquos Road, in Newry or whatever ground the match was in.There are two photographs from the GAA Congress in Newcastle ten years ago that show it well. One is a formal photograph with President McAleese and ious dignitaries. Hersquos sitting at the bottom left deep in conversation with Kevin Mussen.In the other, therersquos a group standing on a set of steps. Hersquos at the back having a chat with James McCartan. I think that Bobbie Hanvey was one of the only people that could get him to look into a camera.A third photograph from that Congress showed him standing in front of the huge poster of the  team calling them ldquoThe History Makers. That photograph was used on his memorial card. When it came to his funeral, he was buried in his Club Down tie. Nothing  would have been appropriate.His last visitor before he died was Dr Walsh, who held his hand and chatted to him. Their last words together were, ldquoWe had good times. They certainly did.This article was originally published on the Club Down website..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/11664566.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

With free admission to NHS health workers and an extensive ‘Customer Confidence Charter’ in line with the World Health Organisation and Government advice, Titanic Belfast reopened to the public at the weekend.The multi award-winning, world-class experience’s first official visitor since it closed due to Covid- in March was Belfast’s First Citizen, the Right Honourable, the Lord Mayor, Councillor Frank McCoubrey. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Knotted rope on the floor shows the way around Boomtown BelfastAs part of its wide-ranging Customer Confidence Charter there’s an extremely user-friendly, one-way route vividly marked on the floor, artwork which wonderfully illustrates Belfast’s unique history whilst maintaining social distancing. Without missing a single historic detail, the floor-markings lead visitors through a series of themed areas.Boomtown Belfast is all about the city’s burgeoning industrial past and the marking on the floor is a thick, knotted rope.In times past, when the city’s manufacturing dexterity was at its peak, it was said that every sailor, of whatever nationality, sailing whichever ocean, worked with ropes that were made in Belfast. Titanic BelfastTramlines on the floor guide visitors through the shipyard exhibits, evocative of the days when Harland and Wolff not only built ships, but trains that were exported all over the globe, as well as having its own, vast railway system beside the Lagan, and trams, steam-cranes, buses, ferries and a fleet of taxis!Unmistakable white and red White Star Line flags and logos mark the route through Titanic’s Launch, Fit-Out and Maiden Voyage, with floor directions to The Sinking marked by her final Morse-code call-sign, repeated urgently, as it was when Titanic foundered. CQD - Come Quickly Danger - dash, dot, dash, dot dash, dash, dot, dash dash, dot, dot.There are ‘jump out’ circles and interactive zones along the way where visitors can pause and ‘delve a little deeper’ - maybe tap out the tragic Morse code, or take the amazing Arrol Gantry ride, or glance through a window at a yellow HW crane, or make use of the ubiquitous hand sanitising facilities. Face coverings were advisablenot mandatoryThe route to, and around, Titanic’s replica leboat is indicated on the floor with some of the heartrending newspaper headlines that followed her sinking - Her Side Ripped as by a Giant Can Opener, Great Loss of Le, Officers Sank with Titanic and , Die. Navigational markings and compass points on the floor indicate the route through Titanic Belfast’s modern-times narrative, explaining how the great ship has captured the world’s imagination, how the wreck was discovered and exploring the depths of the Atlantic where Titanic lies today. A le-size model of a deep-sea er from the Titanic era, with air-pipes connected to his thick brass helmet,shows that face coverings are advisable,not mandatory, but as I went outside to visit the Nomadic a line of pigeons perched on the roof of Lord Pirie’s former living quarters weren’t properly socially distanced!In addition to Titanic Belfast’s one-way, self-guided themed tour and Family Trail, visitors will be able to experience its award-winning outdoor Discovery Tour, Titanic Foundation’s Out of Stores Exhibition and its new Maritime Mile Treasure Trail.It will be accepting pre-bookings only and operating on a reduced capacity to allow for physical distancing.

Robert Rennie whose address was given as Malmesbury, Wiltshire, had registered himself as the owner of the Common and Crosscommon with Glamorgan County Council.It is believed in some quarters that the claim may be a hoax.But the Parish Council is treating it seriously and has asked the Association of Parish Councilsrsquo solicitors to take up the matter on their behalf.The Parish Council will certainly have unprecedented support from the villagers and many people outside, in their fight.The Common is the home of organised sport in the shape of local rugby and cricket clubs and widely used by local residents and visitors as a popular recreation area.It was at one time owned by the Lord of the Manor, General H. H. Lee.But it has been maintained by the Parish Council out of the local rate fund, ever since they took it over. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
