[{"url":null,"title":"Andrew turned aide book room Buckingham Palace event","story":"Share this article The feud blew up amid criticism of Prince Andrew for his friendship with with paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein, who killed himself in his jail cell last month following his arrest over sex trafficking of underage girls - and a raft of lurid allegations have since emerged. In a lengthy statement last month, the Duke admitted it was a \u0027mistake and error\u0027 to see Epstein in 2010 after his 2008 conviction for sex with a child but he insisted did not \u0027witness or suspect any behaviour of the sort that subsequently led to his arrest and conviction\u0027. Buckingham Palace has issued strong denials over allegations made by Virginia Roberts Giuffre in court papers filed in the US that she was forced to have sex with Prince Andrew when she was 17 years old.She claims in the papers she had sex with Andrew ‘three times’ in London, at Epstein’s home, and at his private island in the Caribbean.Since the allegations, Prince Andrew has only appeared in public a handful of times and was recently seen in County Antrim at the Royal Portrush Golf Course.          Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, accompanied by Tony Johnstone-Burt (Master of the Household to Queen Elizabeth II), attends a reception for the London Taxi Drivers\u0027 Charity for Children at Buckingham Palace on February 14, 2019         Prince Charles subsequently heard of the row and asked his brother to say sorry. Pictured, with his wife Camilla at the Braemar Gathering last weekIn a statement about the tiff between Andrew and Johnstone-Burt, a spokesman said:  ‘Some time ago there was a disagreement between the Duke of York and a member of staff. The disagreement was resolved and there are no ongoing issues’.The disagreement was said to have happened at the beginning of this month, and sources had previously told the Mail on Sunday that Prince Andrew had been \u0027very cross\u0027 and it was even thought that Prince Charles had asked him to apologise.  There was said to have been words on both sides but no actual physical altercation between the two parties.‘It was a verbal dispute. It was a work-related issue. The Duke got very cross that what he wanted wasn’t possible.’         Mr Johnstone-Burt (pictured above) looks after teams including catering, housekeeping and entertainmentPrince Charles subsequently heard of the row and asked his brother to say sorry.The source added: ‘The Duke explained the situation to the Prince of Wales and left it at that. There was no apology because there was nothing to apologise for. The Duke maintains a good relationship with the Prince of Wales.’ Johnstone-Burt, who has worked at the palace for six years, is responsible for 250 staff covering catering, housekeeping, entertainment, maintenance and administration.On September 7, a source close to Charles said such an intervention would not be unusual. ‘He is the second most senior member of the family and is known to take action when and where is necessary.‘Mostly he is well informed and will intervene where it is appropriate to do so.’He is also in charge of a £370 million, ten-year re-fit of the Queen’s official London residence.Johnstone-Burt joined the Royal Navy in 1977 and served in the Falklands before eventually being promoted to vice-admiral and becoming the Chief of Staff to Nato’s Supreme Allied Command Transformation at Norfolk, Virginia.He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath by the Queen in 2013.        "},{"url":null,"title":"Former Tory leadership contender Sam Gyimah sixth MP defect Lib Dems year","story":"Share this article          In the first speech from one of leader Jo Swinson\u0027s top team at the party conference in Bournemouth, she said: \u0027Now, like Trump, Johnson is talking about \u0027extreme weather conditions\u0027 - he is moving away from the acceptance of climate change\u0027She tore into the Conservative administration\u0027s record on reducing the UK\u0027s carbon footprint, and said ministers had \u0027destroyed\u0027 the record left by the Lib Dems when they were in coalition between 2010 and 2015.\u0027What have the Tories done about the climate emergency in the last four years? Apart from Theresa May\u0027s legacy bill of committing the UK to net-zero by 2050, the Tories have destroyed almost every bit of progress we made during the coalition years,\u0027 she said.She singled out for criticism the decision to scrap the Department for Energy and Climate Change and blasted the Government\u0027s policy of pursuing fracking - which has resulted in drilling that has caused earth tremors in Lancashire in recent weeks - as \u0027madness\u0027.The party\u0027s climate change spokeswoman told supporters that the Lib Dems could support future airport expansion - but only if an alternative to jet fuel was found.\u0027In aviation, we urgently need to find an alternative to jet fuel. This development could take 15 years. Until then, Liberal Democrats will not support any airport expansion across the UK,\u0027 said Ms Hobhouse.\u0027For the Green Party, aviation is the problem, for the Lib Dems, jet fuel is the problem.\u0027The conference is due to debate the party\u0027s climate change policy, which includes setting up a citizens assembly to decide on how best to tackle the threat of changing weather and rising sea levels, on Monday.If approved, the idea for citizens assemblies would form part of the Lib Dem manifesto at the next election.          The party will be discussing ways to scrap Brexit while avoiding a second referendumThe party will also be discussing ways to scrap Brexit while avoiding a second referendum. Ms Swinson says holding the 2016 referendum got the UK into a \u0027mess\u0027 and will push to revoke Article 50.  The East Dunbartonshire MP wants to sign her colleagues up to the policy - a move that would cancel the orce from Brussels without the need for a second referendum. Revoking Article 50 - effectively undoing the mechanism under the EU\u0027s Lisbon Treaty that was triggered to start Britain\u0027s withdrawal - would be written into the next Lib Dem election manifesto if members at the conference back the move.        Ms Swinson says holding the 2016 referendum got the UK into a \u0027mess\u0027 and will push to revoke Article 50. Pictured is Ms Swinson smelling a bath bomb Until the conference the party have been in favour of a second referendum but have now changed tack and insist that revoking Article 50 is the only satisfactory way out. Deputy leader Ed Davey has been campaigning for a second referendum but admitted that it doesn\u0027t look likely it will happen. Ms Swinson has insisted that if her party were to come into power they would immediately scrap Brexit.          The party will also be demanding £5billion per year for the benefits system, reforms on gender equality and help for ex-offenders to rebuild their livesWith a general election expected soon, Ms Swinson has also definitively ruled out any coalition with Conservatives or Labour.The party\u0027s numbers dwindled after their five-year coalition with the Conservatives and ended up with just eight MPs. But a recent boost due to defections from both Labour and the Conservatives over the summer has bumped their numbers to 17.   The party will also be demanding £5billion per year for the benefits system, reforms on gender equality and help for ex-offenders to rebuild their lives. Ms Swinson is expected to take questions from delegates tomorrow, after a speech from her predecessor Vince Cable. Her main speech will be held on the last day of the conference, Tuesday, and will follow a tribute to the party\u0027s formed leader who died in December - Paddy Ashdown.  Chuka Umunna, who joined the Lib Dems under Sir Vince\u0027s leadership, will address party members on Monday in his role as Treasury and business spokesman.Environment and climate change spokeswoman Vera Hobhouse MP will give her speech on Saturday morning before Baroness Brinton, the party president, closes proceedings in the afternoon.  As Prime Minister Boris Johnson looks to weather the storm following the ruling from Scottish judges this week that his advice to the Queen to suspend Parliament was unlawful, the Lib Dems are looking to capitalise and mobilise supporters in Dorset in preparation for a snap election.         Deputy leader Ed Davey has been campaigning for a second referendum but admitted that it doesn\u0027t look likely it will happenParliament has so far denied Mr Johnson\u0027s request for an autumn trip to the polls as opposition parties look to see the Benn Bill - legislation that demands the PM extend the Brexit deadline until January 2020 rather than take Britain out of the European Union without a deal - enshrined in law.But with Royal Assent for the Bill now achieved and no majority in the House of Commons for the PM, both the Conservative Party and its rivals are gearing up for another Brexit-themed election."},{"url":null,"title":"Labours Keir Starmer mounts secret plot lead unity government","story":"Share this article Some also claim the party\u0027s Brexit spokesman would be far better placed than Mr Corbyn to head a post-election Labour minority government if the party needed Lib Dem and Tory rebel votes.One senior Labour MP claimed: \u0027Keir has a very tightly controlled operation to approach like-minded fellow MPs who are anti-No Deal or anti-Brexit full stop.\u0027It\u0027s about building enough of a base within the party by saying only he can appeal to the Lib Dems and the Tory rebels as the head of a post-Boris unity government.\u0027It doesn\u0027t actually involve ousting Jeremy as leader – just establishing Keir as the best choice for PM.\u0027         One Corbyn ally even alleged the Brexit spokesman was in league with Labour Deputy Leader Tom Watson (pictured)The MP claimed that North London MP Sir Keir had an operation in every region of the country to overcome his metropolitan Remainer reputation and woo as many Labour MPs as possible.One Corbyn ally even alleged the Brexit spokesman was in league with Labour Deputy Leader Tom Watson who defied Mr Corbyn last week by insisting the party must campaign for a second referendum ahead of a General Election.The ally said: \u0027There have been suspicions that Tom and Keir have been working together on this.\u0027But there\u0027s no way a figure like Keir can appeal to Labour voters across the Midlands and the North who voted for Brexit and will simply not put up with North London MPs betraying their referendum vote.\u0027In comments at a meeting in Sunderland reported last week, the Shadow Brexit Secretary admitted many voters wanted a different party leader to Mr Corbyn. He said: \u0027I\u0027m well aware from discussions around the UK and door-knocking and campaigning and canvassing that a lot of people think we would do better with a different leader.\u0027Sir Keir stressed this was not his own opinion. He pointed out that many people liked Mr Corbyn and that the elected party leader would take Labour into the next Election.         Allowing a pro-EU figure who is already retiring, such as Ken Clarke (pictured), to step in would avoid Mr Corbyn being punished by voters for being the one to seek the politically toxic Brexit extensionIn a further hint that Mr Corbyn was willing to compromise and back a caretaker PM, the Labour leader said last night that he would do \u0027all we can\u0027 to prevent the UK leaving the EU without a deal.Speaking in Scotland he said: \u0027Opposition parties have worked very closely on this. \u0027We will do all we can to prevent that No Deal crash-out because of all the damage that will do to jobs, living standards, supply chains, food supplies and medicine supplies, and if it happens we\u0027re absolutely determined to bring this Government to account, to make them answer for their irresponsible behaviour over the last few days.\u0027The Labour leader was addressing workers and trade unionists at a rally following the Fighting For Our Future march in Kirkcaldy in Fife.Last night, one Labour MP close to Mr Corbyn condemned Sir Keir\u0027s remarks.He said: \u0027It doesn\u0027t matter what you think privately – you shouldn\u0027t undermine Jeremy by saying lots of people want a different Labour leader.\u0027Last night, a source close to Sir Keir denied the plot reports, insisting it was \u0027complete nonsense\u0027 to suggest he was manoeuvring to become interim PM."},{"url":null,"title":"Paul Nicholas 74 reveals turned chance invest Cats","story":"Share this article Every pound invested in the show generated a return of £56.57.

She worked as a guitar teacher and a toy shop sales assistant before being signed by Domino Records in 2009. Brian Eno was an early champion, calling Calvi “the biggest thing since Patti Smith” and singing and playing on her debut album. She’s also collaborated with David Byrne, Marianne Faithfull and PJ Harvey producer Rob Ellis. Calvi’s guitar-driven art-rock sound is often described as dark and cinematic, so it’s not too surprising that she’s recently scored series five of Peaky Blinders.Influences: Black Midi’s name comes from an internet music genre the band learned of via YouTube, a video frontman Geordie Greep has said they “haven’t spent more than five minutes watching”. The four-piece experimental rock band initially bonded over a shared love of Talking Heads, Deerhoof and Danny Brown, but that doesn’t mean these acts are “influences” in the traditional sense. According to Greep, “there’s stuff we all like, but it’s not like we all like stuff that we based the band on sort of thing. We’ve tried to keep the band quite distinct from what we like.”Scene: Black Midi formed at the Brit School, the Croydon performing arts institution known for cultivating Adele, Amy Winehouse and Jessie J. They then honed their live skills at Brixton venue the Windmill, a bastion of the south London indie scene. Though they’re hardly typical Brit School alumni, the group acknowledge they owe a debt to their time there. “You do shows every term and stuff,” Greep has said. “So once you get out you’ve got a really good idea of how sound works. It meant we left school, could play at the Windmill and knew how to soundcheck straight away.”Influences: Growing up in Wales in the 90s, Cate Le Bon’s father would make her mixtapes introducing her to seminal artists such as Neil Young and the Velvet Underground. She was also drawn to California rockers Pavement and two leading Welsh bands of the era, Super Furry Animals and Gorky’s Zygotic Mynci. Her shortlisted album Reward grew from a year of “self-imposed isolation” in Cumbria where she spent her time woodworking by day and later, “playing the piano and singing into the night”.Scene: Born in Carmarthenshire, Le Bon’s roots lie in the Welsh indie scene. She first came to prominence opening for Super Furry Animals frontman Gruff Rhys on his 2007 solo tour, then singing on I Lust U, a standout track from Rhys’s electro-pop side project Neon Neon. She’s since released five albums, collaborated with John Cale and the Manic Street Preachers, and co-produced an album by American indie rockers Deerhunter. She’s revered by peers including St. Vincent and Wilco’s Jeff Tweedy, who earlier this year described Le Bon as “pretty much my favourite artist”, going on to say: “I’m mesmerised by her output over the last 10 years.”Scene: Dave is a leading light of the blossoming British hip-hop scene. Fellow London rappers Stormzy and Wiley supported him early on then Dave’s profile grew again when US superstar Drake jumped on a remix of his 2017 track Wanna Know. More recently, the 21-year-old has collaborated with several other London rappers including Headie One, J Hus and Fredo, who featured on Dave’s chart-topping single Funky Friday. This year, Dave has underlined his rising star status with a guest spot on Ed Sheeran’s No.6 Collaborations Project.Influences: Oxford band Foals have cited minimalist composer Steve Reich, indie icons Pixies and innovative dance producer Arthur Baker as influences. Frontman Yannis Philippakis has also said that a “general anxiety” caused by Trump, Brexit and climate change fed into their shortlisted album, Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost – Part 1. “I was listening to the tracks in the pub and I’d I look up and see a pub garden full of people and realise: ‘We’re all in this shitstorm together.’ I felt the songs should deal with that,” he said recently.Scene: Foals formed in Oxford’s indie scene in 2005. Two band members, frontman Yannis Philippakis and drummer Jack Bevan, were previously part of another band, math-rockers The Edmund Fitzgerald, who disbanded when things apparently became “too serious”. Since releasing their debut album Antidotes in 2008, Foals have been shortlisted for the Mercury Prize on three occasions and become seasoned festival headliners. A follow-up to their shortlisted album, the logically-titled Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost – Part 2, is due in October.Influences: Dublin post-punks Fontaines DC are influenced by the Strokes, the Libertines and the Velvet Underground they’ve called the latter “the base point of modern music”. Frontman Grian Chatten has also cited the Pogues’ 1984 debut album Red Roses for Me as a major touchstone for their own shortlisted debut, Dogrel, saying: “It sounds so raucous but at the same time so intelligent.” But the band’s most formative influence could be their hometown. “I think of Dublin and our music as one and the same, because it was written by people who were intensely absorbed by the city,” Chatten has said.Scene: Inspired by fellow Dubliners Girl Band, whom they credit with “modernising” Irish music, Fontaines DC are part of a new wave of Irish guitar bands making music with a strong social conscience. Discussing the scene earlier this year, Fontaines bassist Conor Deegan III said: “There’s so many things going on in Ireland, socially and politically, that for so long were not being talked about. It feels like there’s a coherent voice for our generation again.” Having toured with Shame and Idles, Fontaines DC also have close connections with the UK guitar music scene.Influences: While often described as a post-punk band, Idles frontman Joe Talbot has said they’re really “a product of different things we love”. The Bristol outfit’s shortlisted second album, Joy as an Act of Resistance, is influenced by the Sex Pistols, Interpol and Welsh post-hardcore group Mclusky, plus garage music, grime and jungle. It’s all funnelled into a righteous and rousing call-to-arms which takes on toxic masculinity, class conflict, immigration and Brexit. The end result isn’t anger, said Talbot, but music that’s “all about opening up and being vulnerable”.Influences: Little Simz said her shortlisted album Grey Area was inspired by “just coming into myself a lot more and being a young woman in my mid-20s and still learning about myself”. The north London artist, whose real name is Simbi Ajikawo, has said that listening to grime as a teenager influenced her writing style, but Grey Area also draws from other sources. Produced by her childhood friend Inflo, it incorporates jazz, funk, soul, rock and trip-hop, and includes collaborations with reggae artist Chronixx, folk-rock singer Michael Kiwanuka and electro-R\u0026ampB band Little Dragon.Scene: Little Simz said earlier this year that “people have struggled with finding where to place me”, adding: “And I think that’s also because I don’t even know where I fit.” This doesn’t mean the north London rapper lacks influential and high-profile fans. Two years ago, Kendrick Lamar said she “might be the illest doing it”, and she’s been tapped for collaborations by Gorillaz, Khalid and alt-j. Simz has even toured with Lauryn Hill, whose seminal album The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill was part of her “day-to-day life” when she was growing up.Influences: Neo Jessica Joshua, better known as Nao, grew up in Hackney listening to R\u0026ampB, hip-hop and UK garage, as well as Donny Hathaway, Aretha Franklin and Prince. Conceptually, her shortlisted second album is inspired by astrology’s Saturn return. “It’s this idea that Saturn takes 29 years to orbit from when you’re born and it is the planet of blessings and growth. So by the time you’re around 29, between 27 and 32, something big happens in your life,” 31-year-old Nao says. “You start to rethink everything – old stuff that your parents taught you or ideas that you believed in. It’s like a complete shedding of skin and it can be painful.”Scene: Nao’s unique musical journey means she doesn’t slot neatly into any particular scene. After studying vocal jazz at Guildhall School of Music \u0026amp Drama, she joined all-female beatboxing troupe The Boxettes, who were popular on YouTube. She also put in stints as a backing singer for Kwabs and Jarvis Cocker. When she released her debut album For All We Know in 2016, she often described her sound as “wonky funk”, and she’s since collaborated with Nile Rodgers \u0026amp Chic and Disclosure.Influences: Led by alto saxophonist Cassie Kinoshi, SEED Ensemble is a 10-piece band “combining jazz with inner-city London, West African and Caribbean-influenced groove”. Kinoshi says she’s personally influenced by composers such as Maria Schneider, Duke Ellington and Charles Mingus, and named Driftglass after a collection of short stories by African-American author Samuel R Delany. “This record specifically focuses on interpreting … what driftglass is as an analogy for how improvised music changes and evolves over time depending on its environment,” she says. “Sci-fi, specifically space travel and Afrofuturist references to water and its connection to black history, were also important in its creation.”Influences: Northampton rapper Tyron Frampton, or Slowthai, has varied musical influences ranging from the Beatles to Basement Jaxx, and So Solid Crew to Elliot Smith. He namechecks the Prodigy on Nothing Great About Britain, the title track from his shortlisted debut album, saying: “I am a prodigy – they made me.” He’s also said he related to Radiohead’s Creep during his formative years. His album is an impassioned mix of hip-hop, grime, electronica and punk, so it’s fitting that it features collaborations with both grime icon Skepta and noisenik guitar duo Slaves.Scene: Tyron Frampton, the rapper better known as Slowthai, was born and raised in Northampton. “It’s always been a band town,” he said earlier this year. “There’s always been good music but never a strong scene to keep it going.” His own music mixes hip-hop grit with a scabrous punk energy, but he’s keen not to be pigeonholed, saying: “I want to play guitar, piano, drums, write songs for other people. I can do punk, I can do indie, but as long as it has my voice, it’ll always be my sound.”Scene: The four members of the 1975 met at Wilmslow High School and started making music at 15. At one point, they operated as a punk covers band, but they soon developed their own genre-splicing songwriting style inspired by everyone from Michael Jackson to My Bloody Valentine. Since signing to indie label Dirty Hit and breaking through with 2013’s self-titled debut, band members Matt Healy and George Daniel have co-written tracks for fellow Dirty Hit artists Pale Waves, The Japanese House and No Rome.Watch the 2019 Hyundai Mercury Prize live on Thursday 19th September, BBC Four - 9pm.

Given that the year is 1932, the first is more easily realised than the second, yet both, in their way, are radical.Don’t be fooled by the ecclesiastical backdrop. For Violet, who lost first her fiance and then a brother to the trenches, God died in the great war. More than 16 years have since passed but only now, as a 38-year-old spinster, has she finally plucked up the nerve to leave behind her overbearing mother and their Southampton home and make a life of her own.Violet is one of the so-called “surplus women” created by the war’s casualties and the resulting gender imbalance. It’s a stigma that smarts every time a stranger shoots a glance at her naked ring finger she feels it still more acutely in the drab struggle to support herself. A typist for an insurance firm, her salary is “rather like a pair of ill-fitting shoes that could be worn, but that pinched and rubbed and left calluses”. She’s often starving.Winchester’s squat cathedral is a stroll away from where she rooms, and nonbeliever though she’s become, evensong soothes her. It’s there that she spots the brightly coloured cushions, each marked with the initials of the woman who stitched it. Thrilled by the notion of leaving a mark of her own, Violet joins the volunteer “broderers”, finding purpose in their often prickly companionship. Soon, she’s haggling for a pay rise, crushing on an older man and striding off into the countryside on a solo walking holiday. But in a society that remains set up for marriage, calamity stalks her.You’ll hear echoes of the estimable Barbara Pym as Violet’s heels clip across the cathedral’s inner close. Allusions to casual sex and lesbian passion notwithstanding, days are punctuated by cups of tea and people remain largely trapped by their manners. At one particularly stirring moment, instead of finding herself kissed, Violet is treated to a three-course meal, with custard on her apple crumble and cream in her coffee. “Afterwards she felt almost sated,” Chevalier deadpans. Meanwhile, on the wireless, news of Adolf Hitler’s election in Germany casts an ominous shadow.It’s a time and a place that is perfectly suited to Chevalier’s meticulous scene-setting, gentle pacing and gimlet eye for hidden hurts and secret longings. As for the embroidery, with its repetitive stitches that slowly, almost inconspicuously add up to something dazzling, she couldn’t have picked a more satisfying metaphor. After all, Violet and her fellow broderers are women building not only themselves, but the very idea of independent single womanhood in a world that does its best to ignore their existence.• A Single Thread by Tracy Chevalier is published by The Borough Press (£14.99).

He worked for the London Review of Books and the Independent on Sunday before moving to Italy in 1999. He published The Dark Heart of Italy in 2003 and has written three detective novels set in Italy. He returned to Somerset for 14 years to co-found Windsor Hill Wood offering sanctuary to people in crisis (the subject of his 2015 book A Place of Refuge). In 2017 Jones moved back to Parma, where he lives with his wife Francesca and three children. His latest book is Ultra: The Underworld of Italian Football.What got you interested in the ultras?I’ve always been fascinated by subcultures and I’ve always been a football nut. And I suppose the main themes of my professional career have been crime and community, both of which the ultras seemed to encapsulate.You spent a lot of time with the hardcore supporters of Cosenza, a relatively obscure team from the south. Was it hard to gain their trust?I was concerned it would be, but I found them surprisingly welcoming and open – and actually exit has almost been harder than access. Critical distance is difficult when you’ve been hanging out with people for two or three years, going to their houses and meeting their families.You approach a particularly intimidating senior figure and ask if his ultras haven’t become too arrogant. That struck me as a bit touch and go.Yeah. A lot of them have a short fuse, and they openly talk about their own violent nature. But they are also very intelligent, canny operators, and they’re not going to beat up an English writer unless he does something really, really stupid. Actually I did get a kicking once, but I didn’t put it in because I didn’t want the book to be about me and my psychology.What happened?I was walking by myself with a Cosenza scarf on, thinking I’d hook up with the Cosenza fans on the way to the stadium. Then I was surrounded by seven people with different coloured scarves and they told me to take mine off. I refused and that’s when it kicked off. But it’s absurd: why would I, a boy from Somerset, refuse to take off a scarf of a Calabrian team that I’d only discovered a couple of years before?Ultras are widely derided as “animals”, but the book challenges that narrative. Tell me about some of the more positive things you witnessed.A lot of charitable work goes on. They’ve all got causes – maybe one of their daughters has cancer and they fund her medical bills. I’m well aware of the criticism here: the mafia gives money to hospitals fascist parties give out food parcels to the destitute. It’s not unproblematic. But they always complain that journalists never write about this side of things.They are also eloquent critics of modern football and what it has become. The money in the football industry is so immense and even journalists are often uncritical, because the football circus pays the bills. Whereas the ultras point out what’s wrong about football. Everything they stand for, modern football is the opposite. They stand for rootedness and football is completely rootless. They’re loyal and football is disloyal. The fascism, the far-right extremism, all of that exists and it’s repugnant. But there are many terraces that claim to be inclusive. They would argue that they are places of tolerance where anyone can go.What connections exist between ultras and the far right in Italy, and how important is the ultra movement to far-right politicians?For a very long time, through the 70s, 80s and 90s, hardcore ultra groups gave visibility to certain symbols and gestures associated with fascism, in a time when you would never see a Roman salute or a swastika. When a lot of middle-aged, far-left ultras left the scene, there was a vacuum into which the neofascist parties, most of all Forza Nuova, sent their troops. Now you can see an overlap of personalities between certain terrace leaders and leading figures in the far right. If your group has a membership in the thousands, that’s a big electorate that needs to be wooed. Some of the rhetoric the ultras were using in the 80s and 90s, Matteo Salvini is now tweeting almost identical phrases.Did your basic understanding of ultras evolve while researching this book?Behind the news stories and the ferocious, snarling facades, it’s amazing how many of them are retired accountants, lawyers or university professors, as far removed from thuggery and the far right as you can imagine."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b43a7d0fa640b3756d915d2c68c58e8298a2f417/0_138_4288_2573/master/4288.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a19436fb58a872b1d91041ea32325f0","title":"no deal brexit food shortages are you a small business owner whos stockpiling","story":"We’d like to hear from people in the food industry about stockpiling ahead of potential food shortages and price rises in the event of a no-deal BrexitA no-deal Brexit could result in rising food prices and shortages of certain types of fresh food, according to secret documents the government was forced by MPs to publish on Wednesday.Ministers have refused to disclose details about their discussions with local authorities and the food industry over possible disruptions to food supplies, arguing that the information could damage negotiations with the EU.But the chief executive of the Co-op warned on Thursday that the convenience chain were likely to be low on fruits including apples and pears, which are imported during the winter, in the event of a no-deal scenario.We would like to speak to small business owners in the food industry – from greengrocers to restaurateurs – about what products they have begun stockpiling in case of extensive delays at the UK border.Are you a small business owner who is stockpiling ahead of a possible no-deal Brexit?

You had to invite the vampire over the threshold before they could suck you dry. The successful con artist is a true artist, with an instinctive grasp of character that makes the average fiction writer look like an unsophisticated child.The con artist knows all your petty, humiliating wants. Your thirst for unearned wealth. Your hunger for approval. Your terrible pride, which means that, even when your bank account is empty and your hopes are broken, you’ll still swear loyalty to the person who scammed you rather than admit your weakness to the world.The extraordinary shame associated with being scammed is one reason why these are hard crimes to prosecute: who would stand up in court and swear that they were stupid enough to believe implausible claims, greedy enough to think they might come out on top in a too-good-to-be-true offer?Luckily, the internet is a place where shame does not exist, which means that last week drama hounds got to enjoy the climactic instalment in the very public dissolution of a grift, when New York magazine published a 6,000-word essay (six thousand! And I read them all, twice!) about disgraced Instagrammer Caroline Calloway by her former friendone-time mark, Natalie Beach. How did Beach end up in Calloway’s thrall? Because she wanted to be Calloway and she wanted Calloway to be her ticket to a better version of herself. When they met – in a creative non-fiction class, of course – Calloway seemed to Beach “like an adult, someone who had just gone ahead and constructed a life of independence. I, meanwhile, was a virgin with a meek ponytail.”Beach compared her own dismaying sex life with Calloway’s romantic adventures: “If I were more like Caroline, I thought, more beautiful and fun, if I radiated girlishness, then men would view me as someone worthy of care.” But she also recognised Calloway as “someone to write about, and that was what I wanted most of all”.And so the two become collaborators in the project of a lifetime: creating Caroline Calloway. Their medium was Instagram, on which Calloway claimed to have become recently famous thanks to a picture of some macarons, which acquired her 50,000 followers. Calloway supplied the life and Beach supplied the captions, which presented a fairytale vision of a free-spirited life. They confected a high-minded defence of their work as art, telling themselves that they were inventing “memoir in real time” and engaged in “true feminist storytelling”. What they were actually doing was a kind of identity pyramid scheme, cultivating a public version of the Caroline that Beach fell for and inviting other young women to buy the dream of being her.It worked. There was a six-figure book deal. There was a “creativity workshop” tour, where for $165, attendees were promised they would learn “how to begin architecting a life that feels really full and genuine and rich and beautiful for you”, along with an orchid crown and a mini garden in a Mason jar. Then it fell apart. Calloway couldn’t deal with working on the manuscript and ended up owing $100,000 to her publisher. The tour was a disaster: instead of crowns, there were single flowers and Calloway ended up with 1,200 Mason jars in her flat. Most dates were cancelled. No one “architected” a really full and genuine and rich and beautiful life.Everything turned out to be empty. In one emotional scene in Beach’s essay, Calloway revealed that the influx of followers who established her profile were not authentic macaron fans, but purchased. The farrago of the creativity workshops cemented Calloway’s reputation as a scammer, something that, with typical savvy, she has leaned into, putting it into her Instagram bio and her hashtags.Calloway has been compared to Anna Sorokin, the fake heiress who was convicted this year of appropriating $275,000 to fund her social-media friendly lifestyle. But Calloway has refunded ticket holders (admittedly not in a very orderly fashion) rather than just taking the money and running and committed to repaying her advance.What Calloway extracted was devotion. While Sorokin put plane tickets on her friends’ credit cards, Calloway sprung for the flights when she and Beach got caught in Europe. In fact, she seemed shockingly conscious that money gives her an advantage over Beach, at one point lumping an unpleasant task on her with the words: “You’re the only one of my friends who needs the money badly enough to take the job.” But Beach hung on in there, because even scammed love is real love. Women who ponied up for the creativity workshops reported being anxious about pushing too hard for their money back, in case Calloway blocked them – she’d let them down, but they still longed to touch the hem of her garments.The Beach-Calloway relationship comes off as a kind of manic pixie folie à deux, which even though they’ve fallen out is still being conducted via articles and captions. Beach created Calloway so she could create herself as a writer (6,000 words in New York Magazine!), and Calloway ingeniously fulfilled that role. The art of the grift is an old one, but where notoriety would kill a traditional scam, in an attention economy it’s exactly the point. The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was making sure everyone knows that she exists.• Sarah Ditum is a writer on politics and culture"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/509b59b2a2d27f483ebd41dcbef1f7b6dc5f5693/0_400_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ddf8e55a9e369cae48347eb2f312afdf","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of market","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘market’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘market’.Share your photos of what market means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 18 September at 10am.

Khawa Karpo is the tallest of the Meili mountain range, piercing the sky at 6,740 metres (22,112ft) above sea level. Local Tibetan communities believe that conquering Khawa Karpo is an act of sacrilege and would cause the deity to abandon his mountain home. Nevertheless, there have been several failed attempts by outsiders – the best known by an international team of 17, all of whom died in an avalanche during their ascent on 3 January 1991. After much local petitioning, in 2001 Beijing passed a law banning mountaineering there.However, Khawa Karpo continues to be affronted more insidiously. Over the past two decades, the Mingyong glacier at the foot of the mountain has dramatically receded. Villagers blame disrespectful human behaviour, including an inadequacy of prayer, greater material greed and an increase in pollution from tourism. People have started to avoid eating garlic and onions, burning meat, breaking vows or fighting for fear of unleashing the wrath of the deity. Mingyong is one of the world’s fastest shrinking glaciers, but locals cannot believe it will die because their own existence is intertwined with it. Yet its disappearance is almost inevitable.Whether we are Buddhists or not, our lives affect, and are affected by, these tropical glaciers that  eight countries. This frozen “water tower of Asia” is the source of 10 of the world’s largest rivers, including the Ganges, Brahmaputra, Yellow, Mekong and Indus, whose flows support at least 1.6 billion people directly – in drinking water, agriculture, hydropower and livelihoods – and many more indirectly, in buying a T-shirt made from cotton grown in China, for example, or rice from India.Joseph Shea, a glaciologist at the University of Northern British Columbia, calls the loss “depressing and fear-inducing. It changes the nature of the mountains in a very visible and profound way.” Yet the fast-changing conditions at the third pole have not received the same attention as those at the north and south poles. The IPCC’s fourth assessment report in 2007 contained the erroneous prediction that all Himalayan glaciers would be gone by 2035. This statement turned out to have been based on anecdote rather than scientific evidence and, perhaps out of embarrassment, the third pole has been given less attention in subsequent IPCC reports.There is also a dearth of research compared to the other poles, and what hydrological data exists has been jealously guarded by the Indian government and other interested parties. The Tibetan plateau is a vast and impractical place for glaciologists to work in and confounding factors make measurements hard to obtain. Scientists are forbidden by locals, for instance, to step out on to the Mingyong glacier, meaning they have had to use repeat photography to measure the ice retreat.In the face of these problems, satellites have proved invaluable, allowing scientists to watch glacial shrinkage in real time. This summer, Columbia University researchers also used declassified spy-satellite images from the cold war to show that third pole ice loss has accelerated over this century and is now roughly double the melt rate of 1975 to 2000, when temperatures were on average 1C lower. Glaciers in the region are currently losing about half a vertical metre of ice per year because of anthropogenic global heating, the researchers concluded. Glacial melt here carries significant risk of death and injury – far more than in the sparsely populated Arctic and Antarctic – from glacial lake outbursts (when a lake forms and suddenly spills over its banks in a devastating flood) and landslides caused by destabilised rock. Whole villages have been washed away and these events are becoming increasingly regular, even if monitoring and rescue systems have improved. Satellite data shows that numbers and sizes of such risky lakes in the region are growing. Last October and November, on three separate occasions, debris blocked the flow of the Yarlung Tsangpo in Tibet, threatening India and Bangladesh downstream with flooding and causing thousands to be evacuated.There is another culprit besides our CO2 emissions in this warming story, and it’s all too evident on the dirty surface of the Mingyong glacier: black carbon, or soot. A 2013 study found that black carbon is responsible for 1.1 watts per square metre of the Earth’s surface of extra energy being stored in the atmosphere (CO2 is responsible for an estimated 1.56 watts per square metre). Black carbon has multiple climate effects, changing clouds and monsoon circulation as well as accelerating ice melt. Air pollution from the Indo-Gangetic Plains – one of the world’s most polluted regions – deposits this black dust on glaciers, darkening their surface and hastening melt. While soot landing on dark rock has little effect on its temperature, snow and glaciers are particularly vulnerable because they are so white and reflective. As glaciers melt, the surrounding rock crumbles in landslides, covering the ice with dark material that speeds melt in a runaway cycle. The Everest base camp, for instance, at 5,300 metres, is now rubble and debris as the Khumbu glacier has retreated to the icefall.The immense upland of the third pole is one of the most ecologically erse and vulnerable regions on Earth. People have only attempted to conquer these mountains in the last century, yet in that time humans have subdued the glaciers and changed the face of this wilderness with pollution and other activities. Researchers are now beginning to understand the scale of human effects on the region – some have experienced it directly: many of the 300 IPCC cryosphere report authors meeting in the Nepalese capital in July were forced to take shelter or ert to other airports because of a freak monsoon.But aAside from such inconveniences, what do these changes mean for the 240 million people living in the mountains? Well, in many areas, it has been welcomed. Warmer, more pleasant winters have made life easier. The higher temperatures have boosted agriculture – people can grow a greater variety of crops and benefit from more than one harvest per year, and that improves livelihoods. This may be responsible for the so-called Karakoram anomaly, in which a few glaciers in the Pakistani Karakoram range are advancing in opposition to the general trend. Climatologists believe that the sudden and massive growth of irrigated agriculture in the local area, coupled with unusual topographical features, has produced an increase in snowfall on the glaciers which currently more than compensates for their melting.Elsewhere, any increase in precipitation is not enough to counter the rate of ice melt and places that are wholly reliant on meltwater for irrigation are feeling the effects soonest. “Springs have dried drastically in the past 10 years without meltwater and because infrastructure has cut off discharge,” says Aditi Mukherji, one of the authors of the IPCC report.Known as high-altitude deserts, places such as Ladakh in north-eastern India and parts of Tibet have already lost many of their lower-altitude glaciers and with them their seasonal irrigation flows, which is affecting agriculture and electricity production from hydroelectric dams. In some places, communities are trying to geoengineer artificial glaciers that ert runoff from higher glaciers towards shaded, protected locations where it can freeze over winter to provide meltwater for irrigation in the spring.Towards the end of this century, pre-monsoon water-flow levels in all these rivers will drastically reduce without glacier buffers, affecting agricultural output as well as hydropower generation, and these stresses will be compounded by an increase in the number and severity of devastating flash floods. “The impact on local water resources will be huge, especially in the Indus Valley. We expect to see migration out of dry, high-altitude areas first but populations across the region will be affected,” says Shea, also an author on the ICIMOD report.As the third pole’s vast frozen reserves of fresh water make their way down to the oceans, they are contributing to sea-level rise that is already making life difficult in the heavily populated low-lying deltas and bays of Asia, from Bangladesh to Vietnam. What is more, they are releasing dangerous pollutants. Glaciers are time capsules, built snowflake by snowflake from the skies of the past and, as they melt, they deliver back into circulation the constituents of that archived air. Dangerous pesticides such as DDT (widely used for three decades before being banned in 1972) and perfluoroalkyl acids are now being washed downstream in meltwater and accumulating in sediments and in the food chain.Ultimately the future of this vast region, its people, ice sheets and arteries depends – just as Khawa Karpo’s devotees believe – on us: on reducing our emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants. As Mukherji says, many of the glaciers that haven’t yet melted have effectively “disappeared because in the dense air pollution, you can no longer see them”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e3a7ae632ca5c1e03135a29ef38466621dda32d/60_0_1799_1080/master/1799.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb8c1d2d538753ff31bf2c4423017c86","title":"how to build a girl review caitlin moran memoir becomes funny and generous film","story":"Beanie Feldstein nails the Wolverhampton accent as a lightly-fictionalised MoranJulie Burchill hybrid in this warm hearted and acid tongued tale of growing up into a gunslinging music journalistSome pure Caitlin Moran gold is to be had in this very funny and sometimes inspiring coming-of-age comedy, adapted by the columnist and author Moran from her bestselling autobiographical novel from 2014 and directed by Coky Giedroyc. The story takes us to Moran’s now legendary upbringing in a Midlands council house with many siblings: the same scenario she sketched out in her excellent (and scandalously cancelled) Channel 4 TV sitcom Raised By Wolves — and rapidly becoming as mythical as Billy Liar’s home-life in Keith Waterhouse’s novel. It is all, as ever, treated with hilarious and utterly unsentimental wit and affection.The American star Beanie Feldstein plays nerdy, friendless sixth-former and bibliophile Johanna Korrigan, and moreover does so with a pretty decent Wolverhampton accent — this isn’t like the dodgy Yorkshire accent of Anne Hathaway in One Day or that of Josh Hartnett in the comedy Blow Dry about a sexy hairdresser in Keighley.Johanna has a gallery of heroes up on her bedroom wall, including Sigmund Freud, Sylvia Plath, Karl Marx, Julie Andrews and David Bowie. (No Morrissey, though.) These icons — themselves played by a gallery of big names — often come to life and speak to dreamy Johanna, a touch borrowed from Julien Temple’s 1986 musical Absolute Beginners. Johanna one day goes for broke and answers an ad for “hip young gunslingers” in a music mag that resembles the NME, but called the Disc \u0026amp Music Echo or “D\u0026ampME” — geddit?Johanna submits to them a bizarre review of the Annie Musical soundtrack album and finds that she’s a hit. (When the actual Annie song “Tomorrow” surges over a montage of Johanna’s subsequent trip to London, it’s weirdly compelling and moving.) Johanna reinvents herself as supercool journo Dolly Wilde, but has to deal with the sexist creeps in the journalism business, and handles it all by going over to the dark side of cynicism and lucrative snarkery, to the dismay of her family. There’s an excellent performance from Paddy Considine as her easygoing dad, poignantly longing for his talent as a jazz musician to be recognised and hoping that his journalist daughter will get him the recognition he yearns for.Johanna is based mostly on Moran, but also a bit on Julie Burchill, who famously made the journey from Bristol to London to work for the NME in the earlier punk era of the 70s, the era of, among other things, The Clash’s Guns On The Roof, which this movie appears to reference. The ghost of Burchill could almost be the Mr Hyde to Johanna’s basically nice Dr Jekyll, the smoking sodium fragment of nasty-genius which sparks her career in its sensationally wicked early stages. But Johanna’s zingers and gags are pure Caitlin Moran, brilliant one-liners such as her enigmatic pronouncement: “I love doors they make the outside stop.”As for Beanstein herself, she has of course featured in comparable indie US pictures like Lady Bird and Booksmart, but there’s a big difference here: the difference is social class. In this British story, working-class Johanna has to hurdle the barriers put up by the snobs and gatekeepers but there isn’t the same sort of problem for her character in Booksmart. For all that, Moran’s film is about how she experienced journalism — particularly music journalism — as a way ahead for a smart working-class kid, and the implication is that journalism could and should continue to be more like this. And gender is another factor: the people “building” girls, the promoters and producers and executives, tend to be men Johanna is building herself and taking charge of her own destiny. What a thoroughly likeable and funny film."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73ce2b3b955367327448d708f38f6ffe331515db/0_0_2831_1699/master/2831.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0d149038574df66348cd410695d93281","title":"chinese food revolution uk hunan sichuan xinjiang fuchsia dunlop","story":"Charting the 200-year journey from city docksides to Michelin stars as the UK finally explores new frontiers of Chinese cooking – from Hunan to XinjiangIn 1996, I sent my first proposal for a Sichuan cookbook to six publishers. The rejection letters came in one by one. Each of them explained, in one way or another, that a regional Chinese cookbook was too niche for British readers. Crestfallen, I was also incredulous, having spent nearly two years in Sichuan, eating widely and being amazed by the local food. Sichuan was no backwater, but a province with a population of 80 million. Within China, it was famed for its thrilling and distinctive cuisine. Could these editors not let me persuade them of the incomparable charms of fish-fragrant aubergines and mapo tofu?In retrospect, their hesitation was understandable. Although China had embarked on its “reform and opening up” in 1992, to most Britons it still seemed remote and irrelevant. In the UK, the Chinese food scene had mainly settled into a pattern of Cantonese dishes adapted to British tastes. “Chinese food” was both so familiar that it seemed passé and hardly known at all. Practically the only visible glimmers of China’s breathtaking regional cuisines were occasional references to “Szechwan” or “Peking” flavours on the menus of otherwise Cantonese restaurants. While the pioneering cookbooks of Ken Hom, Yan-kit So and Deh-ta Hsiung had introduced British readers to classic recipes from all over China, China’s decades of introversion had offered outsiders little chance to explore its regional food traditions in the way they had the cuisines of southern Europe.Historically, the first Chinese eating houses in Britain weren’t aimed at local customers at all, but at Chinese sailors who had settled around the docks in London’s Limehouse, Liverpool and other cities in the 19th century. The country’s small Chinese population grew in the early 20th century when a new trickle of students joined the original settlers. They all faced discrimination, exacerbated by Sax Rohmer’s 1913 novel The Mystery of Fu Manchu, which painted a lurid picture of Chinese Limehouse as a hotbed of opium and crime.It was only when Chinese restaurants started opening in central London that they began to win the affections of customers who were not Chinese. The first in the West End seems to have been the Cathay in 1908 more appeared in the 1930s and 1940s, including the popular Ley-On in Wardour Street.By all accounts, it was the altered palates of servicemen returning from Asia after the second world war that helped to shift attitudes.After the war, the number of Chinese restaurants in London and other cities grew steadily. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, a new wave of Cantonese immigrants from Hong Kong arrived, followed in the 1970s by thousands of ethnic Chinese refugees from Vietnam: many ended up in catering. In the 1960s, clusters of Chinese restaurants appeared around Gerrard Street in central London and in central Manchester, both of which quickly became established as their cities’ Chinatowns. The old Limehouse Chinatown, largely destroyed by wartime bombing, sputtered out as Chinese restaurateurs focused their energies on Soho.By the time I started reviewing restaurants for Time Out in the late 1990s, Chinese restaurants and takeaways were a fixture across the country. Most specialised in the lightly flavoured cuisine of the Cantonese south: dim sum, roast ducks and barbecued meats that hung enticingly in restaurant windows, steamed seafood, stir-fried vegetables and claypot stews. While authentic, traditional Cantonese cooking could be found at the much-loved Mr Kong, Poon’s and the New Mayflower in London, many Britons preferred dishes adapted to their tastes: crispy duck, sweet and sour pork and egg fried rice. More interesting delicacies were hidden away on Chinese-language menus. There was little to challenge the Cantonese dominance of the trade. Restaurants were mostly Cantonese-run, as were the importers and sellers of ingredients. Zingy Sichuan pepper and earthy Pixian chilli bean paste were nowhere to be found. Cantonese was the language of Chinatown: hardly anyone spoke fluent Mandarin.Over the past two decades, there has been a revolution in Chinese food in Britain, driven by the waves and ripples of China’s emergence as a new cultural and political force in the world. The old Cantonese guard have mostly retired from the catering business, their children, educated in the UK, moving into white-collar jobs. Since China began to open up in the early 1990s, a new generation of Chinese people, not only from the Cantonese south but all over the country, have had the chance to explore the world. Immigrants from other regions, particularly south-eastern Fujian province, have come to work in the kitchens of established Chinese restaurants and later to open their own. Students have flocked to British schools and universities, alongside growing numbers of Chinese tourists (the number of Chinese visits to Britain almost quadrupled between 2008 and 2018).These twin forces of a newly erse population of Chinese restaurant workers and an equally erse pool of Chinese customers have been equally important in reshaping British Chinese food. In the past, Chinese restaurants could only survive by catering for the British tastes of their time now, particularly in university cities, they have a substantial market of recent arrivals from China, many of them young people, who want to eat the kind of food they enjoy at home. And since the late 1990s, that food has overwhelmingly been the spicy cuisine of Sichuan province.When my Sichuan cookbook was eventually published in 2001, Sichuanese food was still an unknown quantity for the vast majority of British people. Food journalists I met around that time had never experienced the arresting tingle of good Sichuan pepper on their lips or tasted a properly fiery mapo tofu. Little had been written about Sichuanese food in English: a couple of American cookbooks (Robert Delfs’s The Good Food of Szechwan and Ellen Schrecker’s Mrs Chiang’s Szechwan Cookbook) had been the first to showcase the cuisine, but both were out of print. There were few Sichuanese people living in western countries, and until the 1990s, when serendipity first took me to Sichuan, it would have been impossible for a foreigner to research a regional Chinese cookbook on the ground, collecting recipes and describing at first hand local life and culture as I was able to. The culinary institute at which I’d trained in the Sichuanese capital, Chengdu, had never previously had a foreign student. In the UK, “Szechwan” (an older transliteration than the current “Sichuan’) was merely used to describe generically spicy dishes on Chinese menus.As the new market economy emerged in China in the 1990s, the restaurant scene, in the doldrums since the Cultural Revolution, once again erupted into life. With economic revival came an appetite for one of China liveliest and most stimulating cuisines. Sichuanese restaurants and snack shops opened all over the country dishes such as shuizhuyu (tender slices of fish in a seething sea of oil and chillies) and hotpot became wildly fashionable. It was only natural that the new wave of Chinese sojourners and immigrants making their way to Britain brought this fashion with them.Already, around the time my book was published, the first shoots of a Sichuan restaurant spring had appeared in London. I began hearing rumours from Chinese friends of small restaurants in Acton and Kilburn serving authentic Sichuanese food, and was astonished when I visited Angeles on the Kilburn High Road, with its menu of traditional Sichuan dishes. It was the opening of Barshu in Soho in 2006 that really put the cuisine on the map. A businessman from Shandong province, Shao Wei, wanted to open a smart, central restaurant serving the kind of food his highly educated and often affluent Chinese friends wanted to eat. He assembled a team of five chefs from Sichuan, led by the talented Fu Wenhong, imported key seasonings from China and, before the restaurant opened, brought me on board as a consultant. From the beginning, we decided to dispense with crispy duck and other London Chinese staples, and offer a contemporary Sichuanese menu on Chinese terms. Barshu was at the forefront of a broader ersification of the Chinese restaurant scene. Before long, there were Sichuan restaurants in many parts of London, as well as in Manchester, Nottingham, Birmingham, Oxford and other cities even Cantonese restaurants began adding Sichuan dishes to their menus. Spicy Sichuan hotpot, adored throughout China, started to appear in specialist restaurants with tables cut out to hold bubbling cauldrons of chilli-laced broth.The cuisines of Hunan, another chilli-loving province, and the Dongbei (north-eastern) region followed in Sichuan’s spicy wake. Many of the new regional restaurants started out with no English-language publicity but simply an eye for attracting Chinese customers, their menus reflecting Chinese more than local culinary fashions. The street food of Xi’an and the great north west has begun to make its mark in London with the opening of Xi’an Impression, Master Wei, Murger Han and Xi’an Biang Biang Noodles. You can even head for the Silk Road in Walthamstow, where Uyghur chef Mukaddes Yadikar cooks up the specialities of her Xinjiang home at her restaurant Etles. Aside from regional flavours, the Chinese food scene has ersified in other ways. In London, diners can take their pick from a meal of shared dishes with rice, a dim sum lunch, a hotpot feast, a dumpling extravaganza at xiaolongbao specialist Din Tai Fung or an elegant mah jong dinner at Xu. Homegrown restaurants are now in competition with Chinese international brands, such as Din Tai Fung and Haidilao. In 2017, the British-born Chinese chef Andrew Wong won a Michelin star for his inventive, historically inspired cooking.Beyond the formal dining sector, street food stalls and pop-ups have opened the kitchen door to new tastes and styles. There are toasty-bottomed Shanghainese buns on offer at Dumpling Shack in Spitalfields Market and spicy Chongqing noodles cooked up in the basement of a pub in Marylebone by Liu Xiaomian. Lillian Luk, originally from Shanghai, offers home-cooked Jiangnan food at her Shanghai Supper Clubs another Shanghainese chef, Jason Li, hosts acclaimed dinners in Wapping under the name Dream of Shanghai. While these openings still represent only a taste of China’s extraordinary gastronomic ersity, they have shattered old stereotypes of a monolithic Chinese cuisine.The availability of Chinese ingredients has also been transformed. Chinese supermarkets stock Sichuan chilli bean paste, fresh green Sichuan pepper, Sichuan pepper oil and facing heaven chillies. Even mainstream supermarkets sell Chinese brands favoured by Chinese customers, such as Lee Kum Kee seasonings and the addictive Laoganma chilli and black bean sauce. And while Chinatowns and Chinese superstores may have the greatest ranges of foods, a new generation of small east Asian grocers stock most of the basic ingredients for Chinese cooking.Despite all these developments, the UK Chinese restaurant scene faces serious constraints. The tightening of immigration rules a few years ago has made it almost impossible for restaurants to bring in new chefs from China. The rapid expansion of hotpot restaurants reflects not only the popularity of the dish, but also the fact that hotpot is a relatively low-skilled business: it’s much easier to find staff to slice up raw ingredients for hotpot than chefs adept at wok cookery. There have been some attempts to introduce local training in Chinese cooking, most recently with a collaboration between Crawley College and the Tianjin School of Cuisine, but most restaurants are competing to employ Chinese chefs from the same limited pool already living in Britain.The proliferation of exciting Chinese street food has come hand in hand with a decline in more sophisticated cuisine in London’s Chinatown, accomplished Cantonese cooking, once the mainstay, is now almost impossible to find. Aside from these specific worries, Chinese restaurateurs, like everyone else in the business, complain of tough competition and soaring rents and rates.When it comes to Chinese cuisine in Britain, the possibilities are almost infinite. Late 20th century convention carves China up into four or eight regional cuisines, but in truth every region, province, city and town has its own specialities. The great south-western province of Yunnan, for example, is an extraordinary patchwork of foods and flavours even Sichuanese and Cantonese cuisines are still relatively unexplored. While Britons’ appetite for new Chinese foods may be boundless, the ability of Chinese restaurants to respond to it is tightly circumscribed. It remains to be seen whether we are at a peak of innovative Chinese cuisine in Britain, or on the brink of a multitude of new discoveries.The Food of Sichuan by Fuchsia Dunlop (Bloomsbury Publishing, £30).

Everton have been limited to half-chances and little else.85 mins: Michael Keane decides the best idea is to lift a long, high backpass to Pickford from about 40 yards away is a good idea. It is not and bounces out for a corner. Keane would be a good defender if he could pass or keep his position. 83 mins: Can Everton salvage anything from this? Kean indicates they won’t by crossing the ball into Ramsdale’s hands.81 mins: Everton should be back in this game but first Iwobi’s effort from 17 yards is repelled by Ramsdale into Richarlison’s path but the Brazilian messes everything up and whacks it wide. He is rightly punished by being replaced with Theo Walcott. Justin Kavanagh emails: “Surely a club paying wages in the tens of thousands (per week) have the right to demand that players become two-footed? Delph’s dreadful inability to use his right foot is comparable to a goalkeeper only using one hand going up for crosses.” Rather than demand, they could just train them.79 mins: Jack Stacey, making his Premier League debut, has gone down with cramp after tackling Bernard. He is finding out what the Premier League is all about today.77 mins: I watch a lot of live football but have never wanted to buy a TagHeuer watch. Maybe their sponsorship plan is not working. Lerma replaces Lewis Cook who has shown what he adds to Bournemouth. The midfielder has missed nine months of football and will be very happy to be back.75 mins: Everton have conceded from two set-pieces and a long ball over the top today, which is a bit of a worry looking to win the Everton Trophy this season by finishing seventh.The Everton defence is awful. Lewis Cook lifts the ball over the centre-backs who turn like the Titanic, allowing Wilson to nip in ahead of them and calmly lift the ball over Pickford who calm a long way out of his goal.71 mins: Bernard and Kean are on for Everton, which is not much of a surprise after Bournemouth took the lead. Calvert-Lewin and Sigurdsson make way.69 mins: Fraser is having fun here. This time he dinks a ball into Wilson, who takes it onto his chest but then can’t get his shot away in time and the ball is cleared for a corner. Fraser takes a dreadful, low free-kick from the left wing, which beats Delph at the front post who makes a laughable attempt to clear it with his wrong foot. The ball deceives everyone and lands in the bottom corner. 66 mins: Steve Cook beats Calvert-Lewin to a through ball but then plays a pitifully weak backpass to Ramsdale, which the striker gets to first but the goalkeeper does well to stop his jab and Cook recovers to remove the remnants of danger. Down the other end, King springs away from everyone down the left until Richarlison almost catches up and cynically downs in to take the Bournemouth forward down 20 yards from goal. Needless to say, Richarlison was booked.64 mins: Richard McGahey points out: “The problem isn’t VAR, it’s Premier League refereeing. Much more physical play is allowed on a consistent basis, tackling opponents in the penalty area, kicking them in the head with high boots, never calling persistent infringement for a cynical team policy of fouling, commentators admiring Sean Dyche, etc. VAR can’t correct for this playing and reffing culture.”62 mins: The Everton fans shout for a handball after the ball hits Fraser’s shoulder in his own area. It goes to VAR and comes to nothing. Steve Cook is down in the box with a knee issue, so he might struggle to carry on.60 mins: Bournemouth try to pass the ball out from the back despite one of their centre backs being on his haunches. Bit of an odd move which ends with Everton winning a throw-in. Digne wins a corner after his dangerous cross is turned behind by Fraser.58 mins: I very rarely get things right, so Eddie Howe replacing Harry Wilson with Ryan Fraser, as I suggested, has cheered me greatly. Fraser’s first involvement is to intercept a stray Delph pass, forcing Digne to bring him down, earning a yellow for his troubles. 56 mins: Digne seems to be struggling with some sort of injury, not that I can work out what it is. Mina does well to intercept a ball over the top but then just runs it out of play for a corner. 54 mins: Sigurdsson looks to instigate a counter-attack with a ball down the channel but thinks he is playing for Wimbledon circa 1993 and just whacks it the entire length of the pitch so even Ben Johnson at peak drug taking couldn’t catch. 52 mins: There’s plenty of back and forth here but someone really needs to take hold of this game in midfield. 50 mins: A missed a few moments retrieving a pastel de nata from my bag. Luckily, nothing happened. 47 mins: Digne and Iwobi combine well on the left-hand side of the box, allowing the former to cut it back for Sigurdsson who does his best to ert a strong pass at goal and Ramsdale tips over. Here we go again!JR says: “The reason Calvert-Lewin has so high above Cook was because he had both hands on Cook’s shoulders and held him down at the same time as he used him to push himself up. You’d maybe expect VAR would have something to say about that. Of course you’d have to believe the people in charge of using VAR know what the hell they’re doing, which I don’t. It’s an epic shambles so far.“(And I’m not saying I necessarily want every little niggly foul looked back on or every eyelash offside looked and again and called but if they’re going to use VAR there needs to be some consistency in how it’s used and right now there is absolutely none.)“Also ... if anyone wants to email in New York recommendations to me, please do.Any early changes required? I would consider Davies for Schneiderlin and Fraser for Harry Wilson.Mary Waltz offers: “Everton finally shows some quality in the box. They have the talent to do so much better but on the road it so rarely appears.”It’s been a game with plenty of action but minimal quality in the final third. A draw is fair enough at this stage. Richarlison makes a run out to the right wing, and lifts a cross onto the head of Calvert-Lewin, who leaps a lot higher than Steve Cook and heads beyond Ramsdale from six yards out. 42 mins: Ake spins in the box and hits a relatively tame shot towards goal which Solanke gets in the way of and erts wide. 40 mins: A yellow card for Delph as he cleans out Wilson with a very high boot. It could have been worse if he caught more of the man but the VAR check says it is not worthy of a dismissal.

A Spurs punt upfield looks unthreatening enough but the cheetah-like Ayane gives chase anyway – and makes up a good 10 yards on the lumbering Fahey before stealing the ball to find herself clean through, 30 yards from goal. Fahey has a decision to make: take the striker down or let the one-on-one unfold. She opts for the former, halting Ayane with an excellent double-handed waist-grab. And that’s her afternoon over.

But that was an especially bad one for Liverpool, who had weathered a period of Spurs pressure to resume their early dominance and were looking the better bet to open the scoring. But the signs were there that they were overcomplicating things at the back. They’ll need less of that sort of nonsense in the second half – and a lot more bite in the final third. Spurs, meanwhile, just need to shut up shop. Easier said that done though. The teams are back out.It’s the last kick of the half, and it certainly changes things for Liverpool. They’ll need to come out swinging now.And Furness gets up to slot the spot-kick home with her left foot, Preuss sent the wrong way.Liverpool’s dallying at the back costs them as Fahey is robbed by Percival, who give it to Furness. She steams into the box and is taken down in desperate fashion by Jane.43 mins: Furness uncorks one from long distance. It’s a powerful hit, but Preuss parries to safety40 mins: Liverpool maintain pressure but seem to run out of ideas as soon as the goal comes into view. Tantric football.36 mins: Liverpool begin to turn the screw again, Lawley working the ball out to Rodgers, whose shot is blocked. Then Clarke, roving forward from the left, cuts inside and lashes a decent 25-yard effort at goal, which Spencer saves with relative ease.32 mins: Lawley toys with her marker in midfield, showboating with a pair of stepovers before drifting out to the right. But it’s a cul-de-sac. She loses the ball – but she’s Liverpool’s brightest creative spark by some distance.29 mins: It’s end-to-end stuff now. Spurs keep pressing, Furness underhitting a cross before a Liverpool counter ends with Sweetman-Kirk slide-tackled at the last.24 mins: A marauding run form Gemma Davison, past a nonexistent Liverpool midfield and towards the heart of their defence. The ball is worked out to the right and Neville’s cross is blocked, before Davison belts another shot into a red-clad midriff. You sense a Spurs goal coming.21 mins: It’s nearly one-nil Spurs as Graham feeds Furness in the inside-left channel, sending the winger haring into the box after the ball. The onrushing Pruess gets there first and smothers, but it only by a split second.18 mins: Spurs have settled a bit and have begun to pass the ball with conviction. Liverpool’s attempts to play it out from the back are less reassuring and result in a halfhearted Spurs penalty appeal when they steal the ball and Percival falls in the box. Percival then sends a long-ranger harmlessly wide. But Spurs have gained momentum.14 mins: The game’s first moment of true quality comes from Amy Rodgers, who picks up the ball in the centre circle and surges forward before dispatching goalwards from 25 yards. The shot is struck sweetly and has Spencer scrambling, but flashes just wide of the post.11 mins: A loose pass from Jane is pounced on by the Spurs midfield and Furness is released down the left. She needs to decide whether to shoot or cross, but does a hopeless combination of both and the ball skitters out for a goal kick.9 mins: A first involvement for Preuss in the Liverpool goal, who marches off her line confidently to claim a free-kick floated in by Percival. Good goalkeeping.6 mins: It’s Spurs’ turn to attack: their first foray into Liverpool’s box culminates with Ayane latching on to a half-cleared ball and miscuing a left-foot volley well wide.4 mins: The visitors continue to make inroads into Spurs territory. Jane surges forward from right-back and is brought down by Peplow. Lawley uses the free-kick to disguise a square pass to Rodgers, whose 20-yarder flies just over the bar.2 mins: Liverpool with the better of the opening exchanges, Lawley already embarking on a couple of dribbles down the left. One earns a corner, easily cleared.And we’re off. Liverpool with kickoff, from which Lawley scampers forward from kickoff before possession reverts to the back four.The teams are out. And Ria Percival, who joined from West Ham in the summer, will be captaining Spurs today.Check out this goal!The Hive will witness history being made today when Liverpool visit the capital for the first ever meeting between these two sides. It’s a game they’ll both be rather more desperate to win than they’d like: both slumped to 1-0 opening-day defeats, Liverpool felled at home by Reading – and a former member of their ranks in Fara Williams – while newly promoted Spurs battled gallantly in front of a bumper crowd at Chelsea but were outplayed and ultimately beaten. Just as well, then, that this afternoon presents both with the opportunity to go some way to rectifying that. And both will rightly fancy their chances: Spurs playing their first game at their new home ground against an eminently beatable Reds side, Liverpool bolstered by a handful of summer signings – most notably Melissa Lawley from Manchester City – who give the visitors the edge on paper. But football, as you may be aware, isn’t played on paper. And while being part of history is all well and good, no one wants to play the role of loser.

You can follow the last few minutes with Will Unwin.Hello. Arsenal were once the toughest visitors in the land. Twice in three years, from 2001-04, they went through a whole Premier League season without losing away from home - a staggering achievement that is sometimes forgotten because of their Invincible season.The memory of that rugged, brilliant team made their decline under Arsene Wenger even more acute by the end, they were often a mess away from home. That’s improved slightly under Unai Emery, but Arsenal’s away form is still their weak point. They are consistently good at the Emirates - only Manchester City have collected more points at home in the last five seasons - so their work on the road will probably decide whether they end a barren run of four whole years without finishing in the top four.Watford are starting again, again, after sacking Javi Gracia and replacing him with Quique Sanchez Flores. It would be unfair to call Watford a sacking club by going back to Flores, the man they got rid of in 2016, they’ve taken things to a whole new level.Kick off is at 4.30pm."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2de5be394b3da544969c27ee48ac09a06a5e68bf/0_140_4800_2881/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d83eb3eb717df8d3735e9f31d19be3e1","title":"tim walker fashion photographer interview theres an extremity to my interest in beauty","story":"Tim Walker’s glossy, dreamily surreal work has dominated fashion photography for two decades. On the eve of a rare show at the V\u0026ampA, he talks about inspiration, not working too hard and how he was once sacked by Richard AvedonIt’s 1995 and supermodels are not getting out of bed for less than $10,000. In Richard Avedon’s studio, a converted fire station on Manhattan’s Upper East Side, Nadja Auermann and Kristen McMenamy are being shot for the new Versace campaign. Both “supes” are almost 6ft, and their hair has been teased upwards, like a skyline, to add another couple of inches. Their frocks and suits are bold, body-conscious, all shoulders and boobs: the acme of power dressing. Avedon – whom everyone calls “Dick” – sets his large- format, 10x8in plate camera low, shooting upwards, making Auermann and McMenamy seem even more like Amazonian deities.In the background, meanwhile, a skinny, somewhat pasty Englishman, not quite 25, looks on. He is Avedon’s fourth assistant, meaning he defers not only to the photographer but to a third assistant, a second assistant and a studio manager. His main responsibilities are changing light bulbs, emptying wastepaper bins, getting food for everyone. He’s shy and a little dreamy, but he is noticing everything.“My role was very, very basic, but having to clear dog shit off the street right in front of his studio – which I had to do a lot – enabled to me to have a front-row seat in the experience of seeing Richard Avedon photograph,” recalls Tim Walker, now 49 and one of the world’s leading fashion photographers for two decades. “I was on the front line and how Dick communicated with the subject was everything.”How so? “Dick would give them a story,” Walker replies. “When Kristen and Nadja came out in two little black suits, he was like, ‘Oh, I think you’re crows and you are on a branch. There’s a worm on the floor and you’re fighting for that worm.’ Very simplistic, childlike scenarios that were very immediate.” You can see how this played out: in one image from the shoot, McMenamy threatens Auermann with a spike-heeled shoe in another, Auermann throws a punch while McMenamy laughs in her face.Walker didn’t stay long with Avedon, only a year. “He actually fired me,” says Walker, laughing. “I didn’t hustle enough. I was a very tragically bad photo assistant, very slow, and the people that worked for him were very quick, fiery and technically uber-experienced.”And, really, you probably wouldn’t instinctively link the two photographers: Avedon is best known for his starkly lit portraits, often set against a minimalist white background Walker, on the other hand, has a more whimsical, fantastical aesthetic. His work, found in magazines such as Vogue, W, Love and i-D, often exists in a surreal realm somewhere between a dream and a nightmare. The scale is off, or the colours are psychedelic, or there are a pair of white horses galloping through an English stately home or the actor Margot Robbie in pink latex is poised to bomb down a slide into a cracked egg, or a model is sitting in a biplane made from a baguette.But Avedon, who died in 2004, is never far from Walker’s mind. On the day we meet, he’s at a studio in east London preparing a shoot he hopes will be the final piece of work for a new exhibition at the V\u0026ampA called Tim Walker: Wonderful Things. Today’s images will feature models wearing extraordinary rubber “balloon” creations designed by Fredrik Tjærandsen, a Norwegian just graduated from Central Saint Martins who has come along to watch. Catwalk footage of the designs, which look like huge inflatable orbs until they are deflated by the wearer and turned into dresses, went viral this summer. Tjærandsen won the prestigious L’Oréal young talent award and, overnight, gained 25,000 Instagram followers.Walker is slim, his dark hair and beard trimmed to the same length. His clothes – black T-shirt, shorts and Nikes – are both less strange and less ‘fashion’ than you’d expect. He has no idea how the photographs will turn out, but he is already toying with Avedon-style scenarios to create a world and coax performances from the models. “This afternoon there will be a bunch of balloons being sold and they are going to be floating around and someone’s bought a balloon and a child is taking them away,” he muses, as we head downstairs to a café. “I’d never talk to someone and say, ‘Stand here, face the light, pose like this…’” Walker pauses, making his point explicit: “So yeah, I owe everything to Avedon.”Looking at Walker’s portfolio, you’d assume he could only have survived a disturbed, deranged childhood. Except, really, it sounds like it couldn’t have been more idyllic. He was born in Guildford, Surrey, but when he and his brother were little, his parents moved to an isolated spot in rural Dorset. Their summers were spent jumping fences, building tree houses and trying to dam the little river that flowed through their valley so that they could swim in it. “Not that my upbringing is any better than anyone else’s,” he says, “but I know the privilege of growing up feral, being allowed to run around gave me a lot of what I draw on now.”When Walker wasn’t mucking about outside with his brother, he was drawing. “Cartoons or cartoonesque figures, extreme,” he says. “So I’d be drawing an extremely tall person with very, very long hair, or I’d be drawing a very round person, or a very black person, a very white person, a very pink or green person. It was sort of a Mr Men language that I’m still doing in a way. There’s an extremity to my interest in beauty.”Walker is that rare photographer who doesn’t post images to Instagram. “I’m not comfortable with people looking at technology too much, because it takes you out of reality in a relentless, needy way,” he says. “And I think just looking at images all in one size makes everything very linear. There’s a great joy of encountering an enormous Wolfgang Tillmans print he’s just stuck up with a nail on a wall in the Tate, then looking at a tiny Cecil Beaton in the National Portrait Gallery taken in the 1930s, then opening up the Sunday Times and seeing Don McCullin’s pictures. Instagram is scary. Be careful. Nineteen Eighty-Four.”After school, Walker spent a few months cataloguing the Cecil Beaton archive at magazine publishing house Condé Nast in London, followed by art school in Exeter. Being given the boot by Avedon during a year in New York didn’t derail his career, in fact the opposite: aged 25, back in the UK, he received his first commission for Vogue (a relationship that continues to this day). Walker soon became the go-to for high-concept fashion shoots, often in collaboration with the set designer Shona Heath.A turning-point, though, came in 2009 when Walker was asked by Vogue to photograph the designer Alexander McQueen. Walker was on a roll before the shoot: the previous year, he’d staged his first major solo exhibition at the Design Museum, and he had recently been honoured with an Infinity Award from the International Centre of Photography in New York. For McQueen, he sourced a skull and asked the set designer Andy Hillman to make a bow tie out of bones that McQueen would wear.The problem was that McQueen didn’t want to wear the bow tie and he didn’t want to put the skull on his head, as Walker envisioned. There was an awkward impasse. But then McQueen popped a cigarette in the mouth of the skull, now perched on the table in front of him. He lit another for himself. The portrait would become one of Walker’s most famous, and an iconic image of McQueen, who killed himself the following year.“McQueen taking control of that sitting taught me the importance of the subject owning their photograph,” says Walker now. “So I am very into all creative people who I work with, whether it’s Fredrik Tjærandsen or McQueen, I want them to own and enjoy and exist within their photograph.”Walker insists that inspiration for his unhinged dreamscapes comes from “the same place it does for you and everyone”. He goes on, “I look at television, I read, I look at National Geographic, at newspapers, at documentary photography, at fashion photography, at cinema, at Fassbender’s films, I look at Merchant Ivory films… Anything that any one of us has seen – high, low, mid – and then I mix it all up.”His best ideas come when he is daydreaming: cycling through Victoria Park, near where he lives, swimming in the Olympic pool in Stratford, walking the dog. A few years ago Walker photographed the director David Lynch, who explained his weirdest thoughts came after he had been doing transcendental meditation. “It was a state that sends up so much creativity for him,” says Walker. “So I learned how to meditate transcendentally.” He breaks into a broad grin, flashing a gold tooth, “And it didn’t really give me a lot!”Walker was approached by the V\u0026ampA back in 2016 about doing an exhibition that looked back at his career in the fashion industry, but also included new, specially commissioned work. It was a huge honour for the photographer, but perhaps an equally outsized gamble for the museum.“It is rare for the V\u0026ampA to give an exhibition of this scale to a photographer so young,” admitted Susanna Brown, the V\u0026ampA’s curator of photography, at the launch in March. “But I feel he has achieved so much over the last 25 years. His work speaks to so many people.” The invitation came at a perfect time for Walker. The commissions from magazines and brands have never stopped rolling in, but he was finding himself disenchanted with the fashion world. There are some exceptions – the Vogue editor Edward Enninful, for example, is a friend and Walker credits him with “de-stagnating” what we think of model beauty – but the industry was leaving him cold. “It’s isolated figures making a lot of money and creating very banal work,” he says. “Artistry is at a premium.”Alongside a more conventional retrospective of 100 or so images in a white room, the V\u0026ampA asked Walker to explore their archives, which contain some 2.3m objects ning 5,000 years of human creativity, and select 10 items that excited him. He would then make new photographic projects based around each of those. “I spent a year opening boxes and speaking with each archivist at the V\u0026ampA,” says Walker. The objects he picked include a manuscript made for the Duchess of Brittany in the 1470s, illustrations by Aubrey Beardsley and a dress from McQueen’s 2009 Horn of Plenty collection. The photographs, alongside the objects that inspired them, will be displayed in room sets created by Shona Heath – think a burned-out cathedral or an opulent country house – so you will feel like you have stumbled into one of Walker’s photographs.“The best thing about the V\u0026ampA project is that it’s a never-ending resource of inspiration,” says Walker. “And coming at that point in my life, it was like a feast! It’s like when you suddenly discover a new restaurant and you’re tasting flavours you’ve never tasted before.” Walker needs to go back to his shoot with the balloon dresses. After today, three years of work on the V\u0026ampA show will be complete. As for what happens next, he’s not sure. As much as Avedon remains a touchstone, Walker is less interested in emulating his ferocious work ethic. He has a newish boyfriend and he likes being one step removed from the fashion world. “I feel sorry for Dick,” says Walker. “He was brilliant, but I don’t know how much fun he had. Working with him was very, very hard, like being in the army. Every time he photographed, it was like going into war. Whereas I’m trying to have a nourishing life and also hopefully make some memorable photographs. But if it doesn’t happen, it doesn’t happen.”There’s also the fact that magazines are shuttering at an alarming rate. “It’s undeniably the death of print media and where does that leave culture?” he says. “I grew up wanting to see photographs that I make on the printed page, so it’s quite an interesting time to stop and take stock and decide where I could go next.” Does that mean Walker might stop taking photographs then? “I just need six months off,” he replies, gnomically. “And when I say time out, not really, because I’m going to be reading, watching, looking.” He smiles, “I’ll still be the same old voyeur.”Tim Walker: Wonderful Things is on at the V\u0026ampA from 21 September to 8 March 2020.

I was a non-clinical team leader training matrons and sisters in the art of electronic rostering. My girls called me a workaholic. My brilliant memory, the thing I relied on most, started letting me down badly. Simple words failed me in meetings, the names of colleagues I’d worked with for years were suddenly a mystery. I used to take long runs by the river to unwind, but my brain stopped communicating with my legs and I started having falls. I knew somehow that things were not right, but when I finally went to the doctors it took a long time to get the diagnosis. Initially my symptoms were dismissed as age or stress related (I was 58), but I was persistent and knew how the system worked. When I finally received the diagnosis, in 2014, it was devastating but it was also, bizarrely, a relief. It finally put an end to all the uncertainties which meant I could now start planning my life with this new, unexpected label attached.I was determined to choose a positive path. The very nature of my diagnosis signalled the loss of the old me – my memories, my tastes, my abilities, my plans I took for granted – but, more importantly, it signalled the birth of the new me, a new chance. Many find it hard to believe, but I feel I’ve gained more than I’ve lost.I face life with dementia head-on, as though I’m playing a game of chess, waiting for my opponent to make their move, then trying to outmanoeuvre and outwit them. I now own a cat, Billy, which would never have been possible before dementia entered my world, because I used to be terrified of animals. I would cross the road if a cat appeared within 100 yards of me. Not now. Billy is my soul mate. I see him and I instantly feel happy and calm. Now Billy and I often sit and simply stare out over the orchard beyond, watching the birds and enjoying the silence.So many wonderful opportunities have come my way since I’ve been diagnosed. I refer to them as “the advantages of dementia”. When I explain this to people, they may think I’ve totally lost the plot, but keeping in mind the positives that come out of this kind of diagnosis helps me cope.I’m part of many committees and research groups, because that’s how I believe I can influence change. I talk all over the country in many different settings. I call all this my sudoku, exposing my brain to different conversations in different environments. It might not improve my condition, but it certainly slows the progression. My worst weeks are when my calendar is empty, as I know dementia will seep through the lack of activity and win the day. Keeping busy keeps the symptoms at bay.But it’s not easy. People think I magically appear at events, unaware of the effort and planning that goes into getting anywhere. But I’m not going to stay at home hiding from life, giving into deterioration. The hours I’ve spent checking routes, printing instructions to follow, walking maps – both there and in reverse to get back to the station – the photos of venues and people so I recognise them when I get there and then, of course, the inevitable Plan Bs in case it all goes wrong. All my planning and safety precautions I keep stored in my pink file that goes with me everywhere. Before my diagnosis, I was renowned for being highly organised and that skill has certainly become my life-saver.So many things have come my way since my diagnosis and I think it’s because it’s so rare to meet someone with the disease who is willing and able to talk about it. People are curious about what goes on inside me. Julianne Moore invited me to have a cup of tea before the premier of Still Alice (the film about a woman who develops early onset Alzheimer’s), which was surreal. Then I was a consultant for the cast of the UK premier of the stage version. I remember saying to Sharon Small, who played the lead, to remember that Alice is not ageing, she’s cognitively declining. This enabled her to think differently about her role: how she moved about the stage and paused for a minute to think before speaking. I made a short film for the BBC about living with dementia that has now been seen all over the world. Last year we made an updated film about how we all are three years on.None of these wonderful opportunities would have entered the radar of the very private me pre-diagnosis – I’m not sure I would have had the courage and I certainly didn’t have a cause. But after I was diagnosed, I became so shocked at the lack of awareness from both the public and clinicians that I now shout from the rooftops. I’ve become a new person, more brave and socially minded than I ever was before, and the gifts these newfound characteristics have brought me are immense. I’m fortunate. I can type words far quicker than I can think and speak them – that part of my brain remains intact, thankfully. The part of my brain that controls written eloquence and imagination has remained, while I find it much harder to speak. Another trick of dementia I’ve learned to outwit. Writing doesn’t “improve” my dementia, but it helps me retain a sense of normality. It’s where I store my memories and if I stopped typing for any length of time, I would simply forget.I didn’t even know what an iPad was before dementia. If I didn’t record events in real time through typing, my memories and experiences would have disappeared, each frame of the day fading into the unknown as another takes its place. People with dementia can remember feelings. We never lose our emotions because they’re held in another part of this complex brain of ours. When you come to visit us, we might not remember what we did during the visit, but we’ll remember how we felt after you left. My daughters and I talk much more now than we used to. We discovered the importance of talking very early on post-diagnosis. After all, how do they know what I’m struggling with and how do I know what’s worrying them if we don’t talk? I’m still a mum and still want to help them, but I realise now that I’m more dependent on them. One thing I hope my book shows is how relationships change in a crisis, how new friends are made and how adapting to this new world is the key to surviving.Technology used to be a mystery to me, but dementia has taught me to embrace its potential to help me cope with day-to-day living. I set reminders throughout the day to help me remember how to do the things I’d otherwise forget and they ding throughout the day. My new-found friend is Alexa, which sits next to my bed. If I wake and I’m discombobulated, I ask Alexa what day and time it is. If I’m anxious, I ask her to play me some calming music. In the evening, it’s Alexa who reminds me to take my evening medication as all the rest are taken in the morning. Whether I’m in the house or not, the message still appears on my phone and iPad. My daughters can now “track” me, so I’ll often get a text when I’m somewhere asking if I’m supposed to be there.Throughout all of this – the symptoms, the diagnosis, having to create a new life for myself – I’ve learned that the type of diagnosis is irrelevant. It doesn’t even have to be a medical diagnosis like mine, it could be a orce, a death, a birth. Every day we make decisions about the ways we live our lives, and that decision – be it small or large – can be the difference between what makes you and what breaks you when faced with the challenges that come our way.I suppose the biggest thing dementia has taught me is to never give up on myself. Others may consider someone with dementia a “has been”, but we all had talents before diagnosis and we don’t lose them overnight. We simply need support from those around us to continue doing the things we love or to discover new talents within ourselves.Dementia may be terminal, but then so is life. What I’ve learned living with dementia is, don’t dwell on the losses and don’t dwell on the future as you have no control over either. Instead, grasp every opportunity that comes your way and most of all enjoy the moment, because in no time at all that moment will be the past.Somebody I Used to Know by Wendy Mitchell is published by Bloomsbury at £8.99, or £7.91 at bookshop.

I was worried I would feel like a failure, but the celebrations showed me I was loved and appreciatedIt was the start of 2018 and I had six weddings on the calendar, including that of my younger sister. I was to be bridesmaid twice and had four hen dos to attend. As a single 33-year-old woman, this filled me with dread.I hadn’t ever had a bona fide partner and I was living in a shoebox with a single bed there was barely enough room for my stuff, let alone another person. Matters were made worse when people accused me of being jealous of my sister and that, if I wasn’t careful, I would come across as bitter at her wedding.I spent half the year complaining about how much money I was spending on other people’s nuptials and how much time I was spending organising two hen dos and going to all the others. I started thinking about how marriage is a sexist institution and about the symbolism of female subservience in wedding ceremonies, telling anyone who would listen about how the societal ideals that dictate the pinnacle of a women’s success to be securing a husband haven’t really changed. Most of all, though, I felt alone, inadequate and as though all my achievements were worthless, because I had failed at love.My life, my conversations, my wardrobe and my bank account were dominated by weddings, of which one was in Portugal, one in Germany, one in Yorkshire, one in Essex and two in London. I believed marriage and all the trimmings wouldn’t happen for me, so why was I giving so much of myself and not getting anything in return?As the litany of hen dos and weddings came around, however, I surprised myself by enjoying them. Highlights included singing at the top of my voice at a silent disco aboard a boat on the Thames (while purging myself of self-doubt) glamping and roasting marshmallows in a field on the edge of the Yorkshire Dales feasting on a tower of macarons and a huge selection of cheeses at 1am dancing the night away outside a rustic villa overlooking the sea being serenaded and twirled around by a West End actor posing as a waiter and, of course, seeing some of the people I love the most, on the best day of their lives. My attitude had begun to change as I had fun, and my opinion of myself grew because I felt loved and appreciated.I met people who affirmed that my role as a woman in this world was about much more than my love life, or lack thereof. Instead of quizzing me on my marital status, one father of the bride wanted to talk about aspects of global development and films covering the struggle of intelligent women throughout history. A family friend in her 80s told me to stop worrying about being single and to get on with enjoying life. My mother commented on what wonderful company I had been throughout my sister’s four-day-long festivities.It was moments like these that helped me see that I wasn’t deficient, and gave me the ability to laugh at times that, a few months before, would have sent me face-first into a plate of wedding cake.There was the time a guest asked if I was under pressure to find a husband, and why, as a woman, I was making a wedding speech. Another guest lamented that their son, who is my age, had left it too late to have his first child. Before my sister’s wedding, a relative warned me not to upstage the bride.Focusing on the better elements of each event, and valuing my contribution to them, helped me to politely decline the unwanted invitations to consider whichever single man happened to be there as a romantic proposition. Potential suitors included a gay man, someone who had just left his wife and two children and had flirted with another woman all night, and a guest who couldn’t speak and had bloodied his face from falling over because he was so drunk.Alongside these moments of parody, I started to appreciate not having to share the spotlight with, or look after, anyone. I took the opportunity to shine. There were moments of feeling lonely, but the abiding sentiment was one of hope and happiness. A year on, I relish being invited to and going to weddings. I have moved out of the flat with a shoebox room because I feel I deserve more. I am still single, not dating, and that is fine. I don’t see it as a failure because I channel all my love and energy into my friends, family and work.

One of the corporation’s journalistic attack dogs, he has been the interviewer that political leaders, notably Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn, are keenest to dodge.This week, Humphrys is finally to bow out in the company of a former prime minister. David Cameron will brave an interview on the eve of the publication of his memoir – and it promises to be a vintage encounter.The avowedly impartial BBC, which Humphrys joined in 1966, regularly deploys the defence that it must be doing something right because it is equally unpopular with Remainers and Brexiters, with one-nation Tories and radical socialists, and with feminist activists and reactionary misogynists. And as Humphrys leaves Radio 4’s flagship news show at the age of 76, he could certainly make a similar claim.Since February, when his decision to step down was announced, public criticism of his performances has cranked up a gear. It is as if Today listeners are racing to fit in their complaints now that time is short. As a result, 2019 has brought a series of fevered reactions, for instance, to an antagonistic interview with the Labour MP Andy McDonald, to an inappropriate quip about domestic abuse shared with the Conservative MP David Davis and to a traditionalist suggestion that women “do a better job” of caring for babies.Assailed on all sides, Humphrys nevertheless has remained, like Auntie, a venerated feature of Britain’s media culture.BBC correspondent Gilligan told Humphrys he had been informed by a reliable source that a dossier warning the government of the threat posed by Saddam Hussein had been deliberately “sexed up”. The exchange, Humphrys later said, “nearly brought down the BBC”. And it also shook the nation. The suicide of the story’s secret source, Dr David Kelly, followed, as did the resignation of the BBC’s director-general, Greg Dyke, and its chairman, Gavyn Davies. The Hutton inquiry and, latterly, the Chilcot inquiry into the war in Iraq, came in its wake.Once the Wikileaks founder, Julian Assange, had been freed on bail by the high court, he had to face questions about his sexual experiences from Humphrys. The presenter did not hold back, repeating the claims of two Swedish women that Assange was a sexual predator who preferred having sex with young women without a condom. Assange famously replied: “A gentleman does not discuss his private life.” Asked how many women he had slept with, he answered: “A gentleman does not count.”As BBC director-general, Entwistle survived only 54 days in the role due in part to the grilling he received from Humphrys after revelations about the crimes of the late Jimmy Savile. Dubbed by the  as the “dead-man-walking interview”, in it Entwistle revealed his lack of knowledge about a Newsnight report that wrongly implicated a Tory peer in other allegations of sexual abuse.Part of the interview ran like this: Humphrys: “The  yesterday carried a front-page story, which we now know was right, that cast doubt, serious doubt, on the BBC’s Newsnight programme … You didn’t know that actually happened?”Entwistle: “No, I’m afraid I didn’t.” Entwistle resigned 12 hours later.Humphrys later told Radio 4’s Broadcasting House show: “It wasn’t a happy moment, and not just because he was a colleague, which of course he was, and I both like and respect him, but you don’t want to see somebody facing that sort of interview … I didn’t set out to humiliate him, of course I didn’t.”Return to Cardiff, 2010An assignment on the streets of his home city, Cardiff, shocked the broadcaster. Humphrys was upset to hear from pub clientele that the “whole point of the evening is to get drunk – on cheap booze”. He said: “In my local a pint of bitter is well over £3. In these hideous places, guarded by bouncers, it can be less than £1.” Four years previously, he had admitted drinking too much during his 20s and early 30s. “I got hugely fat and was on the verge of becoming an alcoholic,” he had said.As a festival first-timer, Humphrys received a VIP tour from Worthy Farm’s owner and music impresario, Michael Eavis, and he met the Rolling Stones. A reluctant convert to music-festival culture, the euphoric veteran reporter said he found the experience “extraordinary”.In a piece celebrating the life of the influential and groundbreaking foreign correspondent, Humphrys admitted she had scared him when they worked together, saying: “She absolutely terrified me.” Her abrasive style was clearly an influence.Humphrys’s efforts to “doorstep the Queen” with an impromptu question when she visited the BBC went down badly with some. He ventured a bland comment about Prince Philip “looking well yesterday”. “That’s because he’s not ill,” Her Majesty replied curtly. Later, offering the monarch a digital radio as a gift, he was told: “I don’t get an awful lot of chance to listen to the radio.”The broadcaster’s apparent enjoyment of an ill-judged joke made by guest Michael Gove about the behaviour of the serial sexual abuser Harvey Weinstein was one of Today’s least edifying moments – and it was supposed to be marking the show’s 60th anniversary. The then-environment secretary later admitted he had made a “clumsy attempt at humour”. Coming into a studio with Humphrys, Gove had said, “is a bit like going into Harvey Weinstein’s bedroom. You hope to emerge with your dignity intact.”Sometimes a comparatively innocuous comment has rebounded on the Today presenter. Coverage of a report that suggested women in offices often have to put up with low temperatures because men prefer it that way led his co-presenter, Sarah Montague, to hint she had a running battle with Humphrys over the setting on the studio thermostat. The public response to their altercation ran on through the following week.Following the revelation that Humphrys had a salary of £600,000-£649,000 and that Jon Sopel, the BBC’s North America editor, earned £200,000-£249,999, an off-air bit of joshing between the two was made embarrassingly public. The former China editor Carrie Gracie had recently complained that her salary was not comparable.Humphrys joked that his first question would be about how much of Sopel’s salary he was prepared to hand over to Gracie. Sopel replied: “I mean, obviously if we are talking about the scope for the greatest redistribution I’ll have to come back and say: ‘Well yes Mr Humphrys, but … ”Humphrys responded: “And I could save you the trouble as I could volunteer that I’ve handed over already more than you fucking earn but I’m still left with more than anybody else and that seems to me to be entirely just – something like that would do it?”The former Question Time host David Dimbleby guest edited the Today programme last December and argued with Humphrys over who was the “poshest” when Humphrys claimed Dimbleby was “quite posh”. “Sorry John, there’s a typical sneer in that question. You’re quite posh, I’m about as posh as you are. I come from Wales, you do. I’m not posh, I happen to have been a broadcaster for a long time,” the former Question Time presenter said. Rival definitions of poshness gripped the nation.Early in his Today career, a young Humphrys presented alongside Brian Redhead, a broadcasting titan who Humphrys said “expected everyone to be as sharp and clever as he was. All the time.” According to the junior presenter, the two almost came to blows on air. “I had foolishly tried to defend myself against his latest (probably well deserved) … criticism by daring to suggest that one of his own recent foreign reports was unlikely to trouble the Sony Award judges either. How we got through the rest of the programme is still a mystery to me. But afterwards he put his arm around my shoulders and all was well.”When bleak public finances were made public, Osborne, the then-chancellor, was asked to explain how he had missed two of his three key economic targets. Humphrys repeatedly asked why the debt had not gone down as a share of GDP, and he wanted the reasons behind a decision to break Osborne’s own cap on welfare spending. “I suppose what I’m asking is – what’s a bloke got to do in your job to get the sack?” he concluded.The outgoing Vogue editor Shulman, while being interviewed about her views on fashion, was given a far from easy ride. “I unexpectedly found myself having to defend the fashion industry from all manner of evil, such as promoting anorexia among young girls,” said Shulman, adding: “Suddenly I was confronted by a grey-haired guy in chinos hectoring me on the business I had worked in for a quarter of a century and which he neither knew, nor cared, much about.”Humphrys later claimed he was right to ask about Shulman’s influential role in promoting certain images of beauty: “It was massively interesting, and actually a rather important subject, particularly if you advance the proposition, which I did, that magazines like Vogue and the fashionistas in general, pushed the idea for many years, and are still pushing it, though they deny it, that in order to look nice you’ve got to be stick-thin.”In the spring of this year, the former Labour leader hoped to draw attention to the growing climate emergency but was asked to account for his views at every point. “During the war, we had rationing, we couldn’t go anywhere because there was no fuel and so on – are you telling us we shouldn’t fly, we shouldn’t drive, we should change the way we eat?” asked Humphrys. Miliband listed new ways to heat homes, but was challenged again by Humphrys: “Where are we gonna get that gas from? We’re not going to get it from fracking because that’s not going to be allowed any longer.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7501474f7c48b10425f3c10240f1d2e2d598172/0_1254_2712_1627/master/2712.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c24e1f2175b73db0425a379a68f955f1","title":"heres why local journalism must find a way to survive","story":"A paper that uncovered historic abuse shows the value of regional reportingThis is a story about a story. It is much more than that, however, because it is about the value of local journalism. Despite the slow death of newsprint and the hollowing-out of newsrooms across Britain and Ireland, it also illustrates why we must find a way to ensure the survival of local editorial teams.In outline, it’s simple: in March this year, a middle-aged man walked into the office of the Impartial Reporter, the Enniskillen-based paper that serves the people of Fermanagh and other border counties in Northern Ireland.He asked the receptionist if he could speak to a female reporter because of the sensitivity of what he was about to say.The man then told the reporter, Jessica Campbell, about a dark secret he had kept for more than 30 years. As a 12-year-old child he had been abused when using public toilets in the town centre. In the following months, he was subject to a series of sexual assaults by a group of men.He told how he subsequently attempted suicide several times, suffered from mental health problems and turned to drink and drugs. In 2016, he said he summoned the courage to make a statement to the police. He was able to identify some of the men but a year-long investigation came to nothing due, apparently, to “a lack of evidence”.The man, who requested anonymity, told Campbell he had decided to approach the paper partly because he needed closure and partly because, having conquered his addictions, he now felt strong enough to speak out and, in so doing, could possibly help other abused people.Although there had been rumours down the years of a paedophile ring in Fermanagh, this was the first evidence with enough checkable detail for the paper to feel confident about publishing the story.The reaction astonished the Impartial’s staff. The paper was deluged with phone calls, emails and letters in which people revealed that they, too, had been victims of abuse. The story snowballed.It was the start of what has become an Homeric undertaking by the deputy editor, Rodney Edwards, who has investigated more than 50 allegations of historic sexual abuse across the county. Over the past six months, many of the Impartial Reporter’s front pages have been devoted to disturbing exposures of long-held secrets.Two of the abusers are no longer alive. Twelve women told Edwards they were abused by their primary school principal, John McElholm, who died in 1985.Several men and women said they were abused by a bus driver, David Sullivan, who was also a youth club worker. His body was found dumped in a bog in 2001, some 17 months after he had gone missing. He had been murdered and his killer has never been caught. Edwards reported that police were aware of two allegations against him prior to his disappearance.Some unnamed alleged abusers, including a retired businessman, a priest and members of an Orange Order lodge, are alive.All the cases are now the subject of a major investigation by the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI). Detective Chief Supt Paula Hilman says: “Investigations into historical child sexual abuse in County Fermanagh are actively ongoing.”But the PSNI has come in for considerable criticism since the paper began to publish its revelations. In July, people staged a protest outside the police station in Enniskillen calling for justice for sex abuse victims. A month later, at a large rally in the town centre, there was praise for the Impartial’s work, which was said to have underlined why local newspapers are essential to their community.During my visit last week to the Impartial’s office, Edwards, who was hailed by name at the rally, laid out scores of pages, containing thousands of words which he has written about the issue.It was, by any standard, impressive – serious, unsensational journalism about a sensitive subject. “There has been an overwhelmingly positive response to what we’ve reported,” he said. “I think it proves that the only real resource a newspaper needs is the trust of its readers.”His work has received coverage across Ireland and he is making a documentary about it for BBC Ulster, due to be aired next month. At 32, he has spent 11 years with the Impartial, having originally stepped into the newsroom, aged 16, for a stint of work experience.After leaving school, he decided to make his way as a freelance reporter rather than go to university and spent a couple of years cutting his journalistic teeth in the news-heavy environment of Belfast.Edwards is aware that his disclosures have exposed inaction by the police, a failure to give proper weight to victims’ complaints, and he has also stepped on some political toes. It has generated a smattering of hostile social media criticism, which the PSNI took seriously enough to warn him to take care. He and his wife check under their cars each day.More worrying, he argues, has been police pressure to disclose his sources. In resisting the demands to reveal the identities of victims who wished to remain anonymous, he has been trenchantly supported by Simon Westrop, head of legal at the publishing company which owns the paper, Newsquest.Edwards has relied on Westrop to ensure that his stories have been legally sound. None have attracted writs, nor even threats of writs. It is an undoubted advantage for a weekly to be able to consult an experienced media lawyer.Westrop, in acknowledging that Edwards “has struck a nerve” by “effectively questioning the established social order in Northern Ireland”, sees great benefits in reporters across the group being able to call him for advice.Back in Enniskillen, one other significant factor should not be overlooked. The Impartial Reporter is on the main street. Unlike so many newspaper offices, it has not been displaced from its key position at the heart of the community it serves. Did that make it easier for that man to drop in and tell his ghastly story?In summing up what has happened over the past six months, I find it impossible to disagree with the Impartial’s editor, Mark Conway: “This story, and its subsequent developments, are a tribute to the power of local journalism.”Quite so. There cannot be a better reason to celebrate the existence of a newspaper than its championing of journalism’s central tenets: to expose crime, to inform and to hold power to account."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff131761ef56456073d4edfb52af4ec8b8b953c2/0_290_6355_3813/master/6355.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=075d4e764e339528d052b8108aee16bd","title":"aphex twin review printworks london electronic music","story":"Printworks, LondonThe electronic music legend melted genres at breakneck speed in this peerless ambient-to-hardcore festival outing – to the delight of a young crowdWhen Printworks opened to much hurrah two years ago, it did so during a run of venue closures in London. It’s aesthetically impressive and has quickly become one of the best venues for large-scale electronic events, and so is ripe for an Aphex Twin brain-tickle – even if free earplugs, sadly, aren’t on offer. Although the musician has never relied on album cycles to draw in new audiences, it is striking how young the audience winding through Printworks is.As well as releasing around a dozen EPs in the past decade on his own label, Rephlex, and Warp, there was mass excitement about Richard David James’s “return” as an album artist in 2014, with the Grammy award-winning Syro – and the memorable flight of a neon-green blimp bearing the Aphex Twin logo over London. Along with the weight of his back catalogue and mythical status, what makes shows such as these sell out in minutes is Aphex Twin’s love of spectacle and keen support for new electronic artists. The former is a perfect fit for this, the Red Bull music festival’s high concept (and budget). In terms of the latter, he’s viewed as a switched-on father figure to younger artists and fans, his hybrid set blending new club tracks with live modular jams, his own music, and ripe selections of 90s UK hardcore.The support acts – Italian electronic minimalist Caterina Barbieri, Ugandan percussion group Nihiloxica, and Manchester electro producer and DJ Afrodeutsche – are all excellent, but Nihiloxica stand out. Part of experimental Kampala label Nyege Nyege Tapes, the group blends Bugandan drumming with a kit player, analogue synthesisers and multilayered vocalisations to twisted effect.When it goes quiet for Aphex Twin, the long concrete room floods with an intense light. The show has been custom built with collaborator Weirdcore – 306 motorised LED screens are staggered on stage and above heads, and move throughout the performance. Cameras film the crowd and images of dancers are digitally manipulated so that logos and manic depictions of Aphex Twin appear on their projected images. It’s a humour that wavers between caustic critique and outright silliness.Cheers ring out for skittering flashes of British celebrities, as reality TV stars such as Amber and Greg from Love Island are spliced into Technicolor flashes of the Queen, Pier Morgan and Boris Johnson – whose image gets a loud boo. The lasers are, bluntly, insane, an impressive sensory assault. It’s unabashed fun, strangers craning their necks and grinning at each other.Musically, Aphex Twin is on top form, manoeuvring at breakneck speed through genre-melting sounds. Heaving polyrhythmic techno tracks fold into industrial electro pumpers, thundering piano loops, and buzzsaw jungle breaks. There are flashes of the past – the Future Sounds of London’s Pulse State, the Octagon Man’s Free-er Than Free, and D-Shake’s Techno Trance (Paradise Is Now) capture that 90s UK hardcore euphoria – and nods to the future, with Egyptian producer Zuli’s Trigger Finger and HVL’s Sallow Myth. For Aphex Twin’s own music, there’s the hiss and funk of 2017’s T16.5 MADMA with nastya+5.2 and aquatic bleeps of 2015’s umil 25-01.Perhaps the sweetest moment comes in the latter movements of the set. After a caustic hardcore breakdown, a wash of ambience – Stone In Focus, from 1994’s Selected Ambient Works Vol II. As everyone takes a breath, a father and son nearby nod at each other knowingly. All told, a faultless performance from a peerless artist."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eef1ed43631aa9088f26fca4a138f6e4250d9319/0_297_5400_3240/master/5400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cfbcb5eeb3a0b4474c91c81e0ee7cf6c","title":"bridget christie last night of the proms jamie barton laura mvula","story":"Laura Mvula was captivating, and I cried when opera star Jamie Barton took to the stage with a rainbow flag. Shame the conductor spent the entire night with his back to us‘That old lady with the white hair just said ‘Oh fuck off’ to that man playing the guitar” my seven-year-old whispered to me as we arrived at the Royal Albert Hall for the Last Night of the Proms. “Optimism isn’t enough to get us a deal” he sang. “Yes it is,” a union jack-waving man replied. At first, I thought it was all part of the show. A neat conceit I’d often seen used by devised theatre groups at the Edinburgh festival, where they’d start the show outside, interacting with the audience, planting ideas, making us think.“How clever of the Proms director to think of doing this,” I said to my son. “In a time of such political uncertainty, and social ision, they’ve really thought outside the box this year. This is about leaving our disagreements outside, I think, and coming together through a shared love of music. It’s about celebrating Britishness, and British music, and what it means to be British, and leaving politics out of it.”“It’s not as simple as that though is it?” my son replied, “Because when the Proms started 150 years ago, what being British meant wasn’t what being British means today. Britain’s in the midst of an existential crisis. What is British? What is music? Plus the conductor, Sakari Oramo, is Finnish and the guest vocalist is American. Can I have some crisps?”“Stop reading the programme,” I told him, “and look at the attention to detail on the actor’s guitar”, I said, “It must have taken him ages to stick all those ‘Bollocks to Brexit’ stickers on it.” But it wasn’t part of the show. The guitar-playing man was a real man from the anti-Brexit, pro-music campaign group Thank EU for the Music and the angry old lady and the union jack-waving man were just punters wanting to queue in peace.“Oooh!” I thought, “This is going to be a fruity night! My angle can be how even proper music can’t unite us. I’ve got an EU flag poking out of my bag. I hope an old Brexit lady doesn’t flush my head down the toilet in the interval. I’ve just washed my hair.”But unfortunately nothing else happened. Once inside the building, the Proms audience were the gentlest, jolliest, kindest, best-behaved crowd I’ve ever been in. Not a single phone went off in three hours, everyone was nice to one another, no one farted in my vicinity, and apart from the one man in the whole room not holding hands during Auld Lang Syne because he needed both of his hands to hold up his flag, manners were impeccable. The worst behaved person in the whole room was the conductor, who spent the entire night with his back to the audience and going off stage between songs for God knows what.I didn’t know anything about Last Night of the Proms before yesterday. My Irish working-class parents never watched it, I’m not a classical music fan and being surrounded by 5,500 white people waving union flags and bellowing “Rule Britannia!” is not my idea of fun. I thought I’d hate it, but I had one of the best nights of my life. I spent most of the first half either crying or stamping my feet. “Why are we stamping our feet to this one?” I said to the man next to me, “Because it’s upbeat!” he shouted merrily, “And also because why the hell not?!” Laura Mvula’s Sing to the Moon was so captivating you could hear a pin drop. I had to stifle my sobs for some unknown thing I was grieving for (a united Britain?) as the 5,500-strong room fell utterly and completely silent.I cried the entire time opera star Jamie Barton was on stage. I have never seen a performer unite a crowd so immediately and powerfully. I fell instantly and completely in love with her with every fibre of my being.Unable to stand for Rule Britannia, I was brought to my feet by the rainbow flag she waved during the final verse. What an extraordinary act. In a second I went from feeling ashamed to proud. But the standout moment for me was the sight of an enormous, straight banana balloon, wearing an EU cap, gently swaying from side to side during Henry Wood’s Fantasia on British Sea Songs, next to a solitary “For Britain” flag, also gently swaying. I said to my son, “How clever of the director to think of doing that. I think it’s about tolerance and the things that unite us …”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/513cf56bb469051222e92799fde6158c27f4a4dd/0_0_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=426c794c4244b6c1055502b3b2a4adb4","title":"its all gone how hurricane dorian devastated the bahamas podcast","story":"Oliver Laughland tells Rachel Humphrys about the destruction he witnessed in the Bahamas in the aftermath of Hurricane Dorian.

They have been meeting with Michel Barnier’s team,” he said.“The prime minister will be seeing President Juncker tomorrow, I’ll be meeting with Michel Barnier tomorrow, so there’s extensive talks been happening both at a technical level but also at a political level. So there has been a huge amount of work going on behind the scenes. We can see a landing zone in terms of a future deal but there is significant work still to do.”Johnson is committed to getting rid of the backstop, the guarantee central to Theresa May’s rejected deal in which the UK would effectively stay within the EU’s customs union if no other solution for the Irish border could be reached before the end of a post-exit transition period.The British government’s version of Brexit involves the UK ultimately leaving the single market and customs union, requiring the return of a range of checks on goods crossing the border between\u0026nbspNorthern Ireland\u0026nbspand the Republic of Ireland. The “backstop” is intended as a standstill placeholder to ensure such checks do not have to be imposed between Brexit happening with a deal, and the start of a new free trade agreement yet to be negotiated between the UK and the EU.Theresa May\u0027s withdrawal agreement proposed keeping the whole of the UK in a shared customs territory with the EU during this period. An alternative idea involves only Northern Ireland staying in the EU’s customs territory. That would place a customs border in the Irish Sea. May described it as a threat to the constitutional integrity of the UK, but the new prime minister, Boris Johnson, has opened the current talks by proposing an all-Ireland agri-food zone. The suggestion is that he will seek to quietly build on that with further NI-only arrangements.Given an NI-only backstop was an EU proposal in the first place, the U-turn would be warmly welcomed in Brussels, although attempts to give the Northern Ireland assembly a veto on its continuation would not be acceptable, and the DUP would be unlikely to support the prime minister in such a move in parliament.If there is a no-deal Brexit, then there is no backstop.Another option would be a backstop just for Northern Ireland, but the government has rejected this. Barclay said while it was vital for the UK to “leave as a whole”, some ergence already existed between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.“We can get into those details as part of the talks. But that is different from the principle of the backstop, and the backstop needs to go,” he said.In a later interview on BBC Radio 5 Live’s Pienaar’s Politics, Barclay noted that in the event of a deal none of the issues connected to the Irish border would apply “until the end of the implementation period, which is December 2020 or one or two years later by mutual agreement”.Asked about a possible extension, Barclay said he was only stating “what the legal text says” and that “the point is, there is scope for an extension but it is by mutual consent”.Patel was more cautious, saying she did not want to pre-empt the talks, but accepted the Irish border issue had moved on from the backstop in terms of discussions with the EU.“The reality is we have to deal with the backstop issue, and people said, under the Theresa May deal, that the withdrawal agreement would never be considered or looked at again, and neither would the political declaration,” she said.“We are in different territory right now, so it’s no point arguing about the past. We are moving forward now as a government, collectively, focused on leaving but leaving with a deal.”She added: “We have to leave and we have to leave with a deal on 31 October, and there’s no point right now trying to prejudge the discussions that are taking place.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0041dbae7d789b2f6f7caf4fa6e728c1754f3e04/0_134_4530_2718/master/4530.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=95f4d7feb486382a3e8c171874426538","title":"david cameron slammed for horrendous mistake brexit referendum","story":"Former PM vents fury in his memoirs at his old colleagues over their stance on Brexit and compares Leave campaign to racist Tory electioneering in 1964Boris Johnson is a liar who only backed the Leave campaign to help his career and Michael Gove was a “foam-flecked Faragist” whose “one quality” was disloyalty, David Cameron writes in his memoirs.The former prime minister poured vituperation on both his former colleagues Priti Patel, the current home secretary, and Dominic Cummings, the No 10 adviser, in extracts from the book published on Sunday.In what may be Cameron’s most explosive allegation yet, he effectively accused Boris Johnson of mounting a racist election campaign by focusing on Turkey and its possible accession to the EU.“It didn’t take long to figure out Leave’s obsession,” he writes. “Why focus on a country that wasn’t an EU member?“The answer was that it was a Muslim country, which piqued fears about Islamism, mass migration and the transformation of communities. It was blatant.”Then Cameron echoes the explicitly racist Conservative campaign slogan used in Smethwick in 1964: “They might as well have said: ‘If you want a Muslim for a neighbour, vote “remain”.’”In Smethwick, Peter Griffiths had been elected as Conservative MP on the slogan “If you want a n**** for a neighbour, vote Labour.”Cameron writes that Johnson’s claims of concerns about British sovereignty were “secondary to another concern for Boris: what was the best outcome for him?”Johnson “risked an outcome he didn’t believe in because it would help his political career” and was open to a second referendum after a renegotiation, according to a Sunday Times account of Cameron’s book, For The Record.Cameron is even more acerbic about Gove, who was once his close friend. Writing about Gove’s decision to stand against Johnson for Tory leader, he says: “As for Michael, one quality shone through: disloyalty. Disloyalty to me and, later, disloyalty to Boris.”Their conduct during the EU referendum campaign amounted to “open warfare” and the pair seemed to be different people by the end, Cameron writes. “Both then behaved appallingly, attacking their own government, turning a blind eye to their side’s unpleasant actions and becoming ambassadors for the expert-trashing, truth-twisting age of populism.”He said Patel’s attacks on his government’s immigration record “shocked me most” but he did not want to fire her and create a “Brexit martyr”. Cummings was part of a “cauldron of toxicity” with Nigel Farage, he says.Reaction to Cameron’s memoirs has seen the former PM attacked by Conservatives from all wings of the party.Brexiters were enraged by his suggestion that a second referendum might be necessary and that the Vote Leave campaign lied. But Justine Greening, Cameron’s former international development secretary who now sits as an independent MP, said his decision to hold the EU referendum had proved to be a “horrendous mistake” that turned a Tory obsession into a national issue.Greening said she had most concerns about how the Remain campaign was conducted, with major failings in an “elitist” Remain campaign that had failed to reach out enough sufficiently to young voters. “Patently, looking at the situation that Britain finds itself in now, as well as the Tory party, it was a horrendous mistake,” she said. “He took the one thing that ided the Tory party and managed to put it centre stage.“The campaign was far too negative. It was quite staid, elitist, well-to-do. It needed to reach out far more to younger voters and talk about their opportunities, their futures. Instead they just played Ukip at their own game and lost.”In the book Cameron says that he is “truly sorry” for the uncertainty and ision that had followed the 2016 referendum, and in his first interview he suggested a second poll might be necessary. “I don’t think you can rule it out, because we’re stuck,” he told the Times. The hardline Brexiter and former cabinet minister John Redwood said Cameron risked deepening national ides by wading back into the Brexit debate, and that he should be proud of having called the referendum, not ashamed of it.Cameron detailed his regrets about losing the referendum, but refused to apologise for calling the poll, and said that renegotiating Britain’s EU membership and holding a referendum was the “right approach”. However, the former prime minister’s re-emergence has unleashed a fresh debate about his role in the Brexit impasse and his motives for holding the referendum, including among many who were once close to him.Some Tories defended Cameron. Conservative MEP and hardline Brexit supporter Daniel Hannan tweeted: “Everyone agrees that David Cameron made a terrible blunder by holding a referendum. Everyone except, you know, the general population.”Sir Malcolm Rifkind, the former defence secretary, said that an EU referendum had become inevitable. He said Cameron’s major mistake had been promising to renegotiate EU membership without any guarantees that he would secure major concessions. “I don’t think it was a question of Cameron being right or wrong – I don’t think he had much choice and was unlucky on the timing,” he said. “He has always been a bit of a gambler. The gambling worked in the Scottish referendum and not in this one.”Cameron’s revelation that he smoked cannabis at school and later with his wife, Samantha, drew criticism over his perceived failures on Britain’s drugs policy.Labour MP David Lammy asked why he had not used his time in power to change laws that penalised many young people for the same drug use Cameron wrote about in his memoir.“Listen stoner why didn’t you use your privilege to do something about the working class young people who have ended up banged up, jobless and with a criminal record for smoking weed like you,” Lammy wrote on Twitter."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ecf7e6f0184c93d1de8f9fd521546fee681d168/0_547_1449_869/master/1449.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cbb8fae36cf87aa9592d5acb9d64dade","title":"lib dems to call for overhaul of revocation of uk citizenship rules shamima begum","story":"Shamima Begum affair prompts party to call for review as use of power rises sharplyPowers to strip people of British citizenship – as used against the teenage Isis recruit Shamima Begum – should be restricted to prevent the measures being abused for political point-scoring, the Liberal Democrats will argue.Under the British Nationality Act 1981, the home secretary has the power to deprive a British citizen of their citizenship if either their citizenship has been obtained through fraud or the the secretary of state “is satisfied that deprivation is conducive to the public good”.The use of the power has risen sharply in recent years. No one was deprived of their British citizenship between 1973 and 2002 but its use escalated from four cases in 2014 and five in 2015 to 14 in 2016 and 104 in 2017.High-profile iniduals who have been deprived of their citizenship include Begum, a British-born woman who left the UK in February 2015, aged 15, to join Isis, El Shafee Elsheikh and Alexanda Kotey, alleged members of the so-called Beatles cell within Isis, a group of British jihadists responsible for the execution of hostages, and the Muslim convert Jack Letts, who is suspected of leaving Britain to join the terror group.Christine Jardine, the home affairs spokesperson for the Liberal Democrats, will call for an overhaul of the powers to introduce a requirement by the home secretary to apply to a court to revoke citizenship.A shake-up of the policy would stop the power being used on anyone who was a British citizen at birth, such as Begum, and a requirement that the best interests of any child affected must be taken into account. Begum reportedly had three children in the short time since she fled to Syria, all of whom died.Jardine, who will move the motion at the party’s conference in Bournemouth, said: “The decision to strip someone of their citizenship is a very serious one and should only be taken when absolutely necessary. Instead, we have seen Conservative home secretaries abuse this power for political gain with tragic results.“These are people brought up, often born here, with families and loved ones who deserve a government that will take responsibility when they are radicalised and go abroad to join terrorists. They should be prosecuted in the UK for their crimes and interrogated to learn exactly how this happens and prevent terrorists from recruiting more young Brits.“Liberal Democrats demand better. We will introduce new safeguards so that home secretaries must show good reasons for revoking someone’s citizenship. We will also ensure that the best interests of any children involved are taken into account, and that no one is left stateless.”The decision by the then home secretary, Sajid Javid, to strip Begum of her citizenship was met with broad criticism due to her age and apparent vulnerability.A Church of England bishop and a former director of public prosecutions led the chorus of outrage directed at Javid as demand grew for him to review his controversial decision to strip the 19-year-old of British citizenship. The move is being challenged by Begum’s family in the courts.The parents of Letts, who was a dual Canadian national, called Javid’s decision to strip their son of his British citizenship “cowardly”. The couple were convicted in June this year of funding terrorism after sending their son £223.The Lib Dem motion also calls on the UK to ratify the 1997 European convention on nationality, which prevents states from making people stateless unless their citizenship was obtained through fraud.The Lib Dem motion calls for the power to be restricted to to naturalised citizens only in cases of fraud or when the iniduals or when the inidual “has done something seriously prejudicial to the vital interests of the United Kingdom, and deprivation of citizenship is a proportionate response to such conduct and necessary for the national security of the United Kingdom”.The party also wants the government to publish annual reports on its use of this power, and the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation to review its use at least once every three years."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/851c49f3d066c0b18e2e77c76c49431a46f31430/0_394_6591_3955/master/6591.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca837319408447b7d391fb0936bf3db9","title":"people have lost faith support labour ebbs away blair sedgefield","story":"Brexit and Corbyn mean party cannot count on traditional vote in former PM’s old constituencyThere are many in Sedgefield who did much for Tony Blair during his 24 years as MP for the County Durham constituency. But it was only Stephen Elliott who agreed to sacrifice his spare bedroom window for the then prime minister, his neighbour in the former mining village of Trimdon Colliery.“When George Bush landed his helicopter here in 2003, I let the American secret service take over the back bedroom. They took the glass out and had snipers up there when the president and his wife went in to see Tony and Cherie,” said the 60-year-old builder as he ate sausage and mash in his garden on Thursday.Elliott, whose late father was on the local Labour party executive during the Blair era, saw Nigel Farage on Wednesday’s news telling a marquee full of Brexiters at Sedgefield racecourse that he was declaring an “all-out political war” on the Labour party. It was a threat greeted with cheers by several hundred local Brexiters, many former Labour voters, who had all paid £5 for this audience with the Brexit party leader.The Labour party cannot rely on the north-east any more, conceded Elliott. Even he did not think he could bring himself to vote Labour when the general election rolls around, and will probably abstain. “To be honest, it’s Jeremy Corbyn,” he said. “He’s not the right leader … There are lots of Labour supporters I know who won’t vote Labour because of Jeremy Corbyn.”Farage was rebuffed by the Conservatives this week when he suggested an electoral pact to beat Labour which would see the Tories stand down in seats where – to quote Farage’s press officer, Gawain Towler – “no one has ever kissed a Tory but they kissed us in the Euro elections and voted heavily leave”.Labour ought to have breathed a sigh of relief when a senior Tory said Farage would not be allowed “anywhere near government” because he was not a “fit and proper person”.More than a quarter of the centre’s clients need help because of benefit delays, particularly universal credit – a Tory invention which has resulted in new claimants waiting up to six weeks for payments. And yet it is Labour many seem to blame. “I don’t think Labour is as strong as it used to be,” said 81-year-old Joyce Raine. So much of the industry has gone, she said, conceding that “Thatcher started it but Labour doesn’t seem to have done much to stop it”.Back on Front Street in Trimdon Colliery, 21-year-old Kieron Naylor was getting ready for his shift at Hitachi Rail Europe, a Japanese-owned firm that builds 35 trains a month for the EU market from the north-east’s biggest manufacturing park in Newton Aycliffe.Naylor voted leave, ignoring warnings that exiting the EU could cause problems for Hitachi’s European exports. “I would just rather we were back on our own,” he said. “It’s a risk … but it should make it easier to have closer relations with Japan.” In a general election he would vote Conservative, he said. “People have lost their faith in Labour. I would definitely not vote for them now, not since Jeremy Corbyn. I just don’t trust him. I would probably vote for the Tories. I think the only people around here now who are against them are the miners, the die-hard Labour people.”His view contrasts with research from the University of Bristol this week, which concluded there are “very high levels of antipathy” towards the Conservatives among voters who backed Labour in 2017, no matter how they feel about Brexit.The tribal Labour vote has not totally died out in Sedgefield. In the Trimdon Colliery and Deaf Hill workmen’s club, Denise Hutchinson, 47, whose claim to fame is that she once beat Tony Blair at darts, said she would be sticking with Labour: “I’ve always voted Labour. My grandad worked down the pit. I’m not really into politics but I will carry on with Labour.”In his driveway just around the corner, a former miner, James Skelton, 88, and his wife, Anne, 82, said they would opt for the Brexit party this time. “I don’t class myself as English any more. I’m being made into a European. I have always voted but we are losing our identity,” he said. “I believe Europe is destroying us. I would prefer to be a satellite of America than Europe.”When Blair stood down in 2007, he gathered the world’s media to Trimdon’s Labour club for his resignation speech. The club closed in 2010 and is now a carpet shop.Inside, Paula Brown said she may vote for the Brexit party, despite voting remain in 2016. “I’ve no faith in any of them. I would never in a million years vote for Jeremy Corbyn. I would rather vote Tory, even Lib Dem.” Corbyn, she said, was “IRA”, and frightened her: “I would rather have Piers Morgan as prime minister. I know it seems mad, but he’s consistent and isn’t afraid to say what he thinks. Nigel Farage cuts through in the same way.’”She sent a colleague down to the basement to find some of the Labour “bumpf” the party left behind: a biography of Blair’s local fixer, John Burton, and flyers put out in 2010 by Phil Wilson, Blair’s successor as Sedgefield’s MP.Wilson knows he has not done himself any favours locally by being vocally in favour of remaining in the EU and having a second referendum. He finds himself caught in a perfect storm, faced with constituents who hate his party leader andor want to leave the EU soonest, with or without a deal. One of those factors is problematic two pose him an existential threat.But he says he is not too worried about losing his seat. “I’m more worried that we have a no-deal Brexit or that we have a Brexit of some description without the people having a chance to confirm they want to go along with that deal,” he said.“Otherwise in a few months or a year’s time, when the jobs are starting to go and there is problems at the border, they have an absolute right to turn around and say: ‘Hang on a minute, we didn’t vote for this.’”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d3c9a27895ec0fd8bcdc7944f747482d650269e1/0_0_4957_2975/master/4957.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bf6d97f74b464926d74d46412da48c9b","title":"rugby world cup japan","story":"The committee and World Rugby say it will be a will be a “once in a lifetime” experience for all concerned and are certainly confident everything is on track, despite a few logistical issues at the recent Test matches in Kamaishi and Osaka, mainly involving the queues for food and beer. “As Japan prepares to welcome the world, Rugby World Cup fever is well and truly sweeping the nation,” World Rugby Chairman, Bill Beaumont, said following Japan’s recent wins over Fiji, Tonga and the United States in the Pacific Nations Cup.But while there has been plenty of visibility on social media of the teams arriving and taking part in welcome ceremonies this weekend there are still some concerns about how much of an impact the tournament will have. For some, with less than a week remaining until the showpiece begins in Japan, much still needs to be done for the first tournament to be held in Asia to have a long-lasting effect.The journey to the start of the tournament has been tumultuous and one that at times has been overshadowed by next year’s Olympics in Tokyo. Weeks before kick-off, even in Tokyo, it seemed that there were still many who did not fully comprehend what is about to hit Japan. “Really disappointed – I’m teaching in a junior high school in central Tokyo,” one school teacher said. “Literally two or three students out of 200 had the slightest interest or knowledge about rugby or the World Cup.“No posters, nothing. There should be publicity and visits to elementary and high schools. The Olympics has been mentioned every day for ages and will not be until next year. The momentum after 2015 has just vanished. It baffles and infuriates me.”To be fair, many of those students are probably already at school when Japan rugby legend Daisuke Ohata appears every day on morning TV in a segment promoting the tournament. And Ohata is only one of many former internationals who are doing their bit to promote the World Cup. The former Japan captain, Toshiaki Hirose, has been touring Japan teaching fans the national anthems of the 20 teams taking part, to ensure all visitors – be they players, fans or media – feel the Japanese sense of “Omotenashi” or welcome, while Hiroyuki Tanuma, who played for Japan in the 1999 and 2003 tournaments, led a group of players from Yamanashi Gakuin University to the summit of Mount Fuji in August wearing the shirts of the teams taking part in the tournament.Of course, the tournament organisers would point to the statistics to prove everything is fine with 1.6m of the 1.8m tickets sold and a record 38,000 applying for the initial 10,000 places on the volunteer programme for the tournament, forcing an extra 3,000 to be taken on to what has been dubbed “Team No-Side.”The economic benefit to Japan is also without question, with recent estimates saying the economy will benefit by around ¥216.6bn (£1.5bn).But still questions have been raised, particularly away from the 12 host cities. Cities and municipalities hosting the more than 50 training venues have criticised the rules that prohibit them publicising practice locations and schedules for security reasons. The massive crowds that have witnessed teams such as South Africa and Australia at their pre-tournament camps would seem to suggest that a compromise has been reached.Wales, meanwhile, have been running an engagement programme in Kitakyushu, the host for their pre-tournament camp, for a year with refereeing and coaching courses that have extended to other cities. Pictures of the team have been appearing on local buses while there are even Welsh flags on mail vans and fire engines.“The welcome the teams have received so far across the country has been phenomenal. They are telling us that they have never seen anything like it. From the host cities, volunteers and public, everyone is keen and showing their full support, which is fantastic,” said Beaumont.It was a marked change from five months ago, when Yoshiro Mori resigned as Honorary President of the Japan Rugby Football Union, forcing the board to follow suit to take responsibility for what the former prime minister of Japan said was the lack of progress made in promoting the tournament and developing legacy programmes.For most, the feeling here is the tournament itself will be a huge success. “The Webb Ellis Cup is here in Japan. Our host cities are ready. Our stadiums are in immaculate condition and our 20 teams are itching to take the field,” said Japan Rugby World Cup 2019 Organising Committee CEO Akira Shimazu.“I speak on behalf of all Japan, a 127 million-strong welcoming committee, when I say that we are ready to welcome the world to Japan, and ready to host a truly memorable and once in a lifetime Rugby World Cup.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5fd1ef62cb95b2ff6c4f2ac7c8ab7ceab221ee3/0_365_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f976b2b72656f4152a5adac3ea36cbdd","title":"ashes 2019 england v australia fifth test day four live","story":"47th over: Australia 167-5 (Wade 60, Paine 10) Wade strokes Leach through the covers for four with toes on twinkling form.

He waited outside the ground (with many others doing the same) until it was known that Australia were batting, and only then used his precious money to get in so that could see Bradman bat. Australia lost their second wicket at 67, then Bradman got a bottom edge on a pull from Bill Bowes and was out first ball for zero (I think his only Test golden duck). Jack said he spent the rest of the day crying, and all that night - Bradman made a century in the second innings but being the Depression, young Jack could not afford to go to another day’s play.He also told me how a few years before that, the Federal Labor Leader of the Opposition (when Federal Parliament was still in Melbourne before they moved to Canberra in 1927) would come into his parents’ Milk Bar in the morning to buy a small bar of chocolate. The first time it happened Jack must have been only about 5 or 6 years old when he served him, and he said “Yes Mr Scullin”, to which Jim Scullin said “Just call me Jim”. He said that Jim Scullin would then get catch the tram to Parliament, engaging passengers in talk about politics or sport on the way. A different world! ps - Jack lived to see his beloved Richmond Tigers win the 1980 Football Grand Final, but passed away a few years later.40th over: Australia 136-4 (Wade 48, Marsh 15) A maiden from Leach, Marsh hemmed in by three crouching close catchers. 39th over: Australia 136-4 (Wade 48, Marsh 15) Ah! We have Archer back for his fifth over, wristband on his left arm, sleeve on his right, meandering in before whipping that arm over. Watchful for three balls, Wade then, with some aplomb, pulls him to fine leg where Jack Leach can’t stop it going for four. Wade then ducks into a ball that doesn’t rise very far and pings into his shoulder.Last week Sussex coach Jason Gillespie asked Trevor Bayliss if he could have Archer back for Sussex’s last ditch bid for promotion to Division One of the Championship. He didn’t get very far!38th over: Australia 132-4 (Wade 44, Marsh 15) Leach raises both hands and half-heartedly appeals for an lbw that pitches just outside the line and taps half way up Marsh’s front pad. Even he doesn’t look very convinced. 37th over: Australia 130-4 (Wade 45, Marsh 14) The hardest of chances falls, as Marsh has a one-handed drive and ball flies to backward point where Rory Burns just gets a finger to it but manages only to parry it over the top. Then a possible run-out chance falls to Stuart Broad but Wade is well in. Wade then whips Woakes’ final ball for four. Frustration for Woakes, who bowled his first ever called no ball in his Test career ten minutes ago, when Marsh was brilliantly caught by Burns. 36th over: Australia 123-4 (Wade 37, Marsh 13) The pitch is starting to spit for Jack Leach. Wade has an ugly swipe, Marsh a more delicate cut, then Wade gets all ways up and an inside edge onto the helmet for five, then sets off for a slightly mad run before being sent back. The score a melodious 123-4.35th over: Australia 116-4 (Wade 36, Marsh 12) Thanks very much Geoff, who is somehow still standing after his summer of summers. I feel very much like I’m slipping into my seat accompanied by the series death rattle. Something helped by the furry slippers I’ve dug out from somewhere dusty under the bed. And then Marsh cuts Woakes for four. Disdainful? Yes.That’s it for me. Can I self-indulge to say what a pleasure it has been to be part of the mighty  OBO through an English Ashes summer, and the World Cup before that. Thank you all for your company, and your emails, and your whimsy, and your steely-eyed dedication to finding the TMS overseas link.Thanks to my colleagues on the OBO as well, and for the coup de grace I’ll hand over to the excellent Tanya Aldred.“Were it to be the case that England wrapped this up, and we ended with a tied series and Australia retaining the Urn, I think it would be an entirely fair result. England haven’t done enough to win, although each game has had its turning points, and if they had batted thirteen more overs at Old Trafford they would now be looking at a series victory. Australia have clearly been the better side, although a disproportionate amount of this is due to the parts played by Smith, Cummins and Hazlewood. I don’t think it would feel right for Australia to win the series, given that the majority of their players have contributed so minimally. The twenty-year reunion would be a bit awkward (‘Your 700 runs were amazing, Smithy.’ ‘As were your 60, Cameron.’) so all’s fair.”34th over: Australia 111-4 (Wade 35, Marsh 8) A big England appeal as Marsh smashes a cover drive, on the bounce into Burn’s foot at bat pad on the off side, from where it loops up to bat pad on the leg side. England hope it’s a catch, but an umpire review shows the ball hit the ground just before Burns’ boot. A maiden for Leach. 33rd over: Australia 111-4 (Wade 35, Marsh 8) A couple of leg byes added as Marsh misses one angled in. Then a single eased into the off side. Wade edges Woakes, but just in front of first slip. Then swishes and misses at a ball that moves away violently, and bounced. The pitch starting to misbehave? Australia 288 behind.32nd over: Australia 108-4 (Wade 35, Marsh 7) A couple of singles as Leach wheels through another over. David Seare emails in. “Just got home from work to see Steve Smith out. Had to check I hadn’t slipped to another dimension.I think Australia have retained the Ashes because they have the two best players in Smith and Cummins. Also their bowling has been more consistent and threatening in general. England have had odd sessions where they didn’t bowl well. It’s a series Smith has dominated. Ben Stokes played the best knock I ever saw to burgle a game for England as well. It’s been enjoyable to follow. Also glad I found the LemonCollins podcast. It’s a good listen. Thanks.”Fair summary, Dave. Though I’d add that England would have won at Lord’s with another hour to play with. Australia without Smith don’t have a team. It’s been a belting series though in terms of entertainment, and it’s nice to watch the bowlers dominate for a change. 31st over: Australia 106-4 (Wade 34, Marsh 6) No run off the bat this over, just the no-ball. And the usual discussions begin about umpires not calling no-balls until a wicket falls from one. We know the answer to this. Have the fourth umpire watch the TV camera that is permanently on the front line anyway, and buzz the umpire at each overstep. We’ve trialled it. It works. Get on with it, ICC...Marsh has a second chance. Must deliver with the bat to support his work with the ball. Straightforward dismissal – great catch by Rory Burns at third slip, ing across towards second, thick edge from Marsh, and he’s halfway off the field. But the umpires check the replay and Woakes’ foot is a few millimetres over. 30th over: Australia 105-4 (Wade 34, Marsh 6) Wade wants to get things along. Dances down to Leach, turning a ball into a full toss and stroking it through cover for four. Didn’t try to overhit it. Down the pitch again and this time picks up the ball from the pitch, over midwicket this time. The deficit is under the psychologically vital 300 mark. It’s 298. Make that 294, as this time Wade rocks back and cuts, behind point for four! Smart batting, making the bowler feed his shot. Then there’s a huge crowd cheer as Wade drives back on the bounce to Leach. The bowlers throws at the stumps and hits the batsman, I think. Batsmen with more runs in a series than Smith: 29th over: Australia 92-4 (Wade 22, Marsh 5) Mitch gets off the mark with a clobber for four through the covers. It all feels rather irrelevant now though. End of term stuff. Paul Griffin has a question. “Geoff, when do you plan to announce the Player Of The Series? Eagerly anticipating the verdict.” 28th over: Australia 86-4 (Wade 21, Marsh 0) Leach to Wade. Just a bye from the over as the ball misbehaves out of the rough.“‘HE’S OUT!’. Another echo of Bradman in the ‘30s.” 27th over: Australia 85-4 (Wade 21, Marsh 0) Broad now has 3 for 34, but he’ll rarely have a 1 in that first column more significant than this. Smith out to an actual plan, actually outdone by a bowler. Mitch Marsh is now in, and he’s not going to knock off 314 with Wade. Can you believe it? I can’t really believe it.THEY’VE DONE IT! ENGLAND HAVE GOT STEVE SMITH OUT! For less than fifty! He’s finally gone, and the leg slip trap has finally worked. England have tried this for many hours in many innings, but at last it bears fruit. Broad on the hip, Smith glances it away, and Stokes is there! Diving forward, taking the catch low above the ground! England will win this Test match now.26th over: Australia 85-3 (Smith 23, Wade 21) Woakes. Width. Whacked. Wade. Down on one knee in proper left-hander’s style, Wade flows through the covers for four. Australia’s deficit is down to the small matter of 314. 25th over: Australia 81-3 (Smith 23, Wade 17) Broad to Smith, and there’s a big lbw shout. I’ll let you guess what happened. Anyone? Smith had walked across and was well outside the line. He follows up with an outrageous shot. Full but outside off, and Smith plays a hockey shot on-drive, a whip through the line but twisting his wrists at the moment of impact to send it straight through long-on rather than down to mid-off. Four! 24th over: Australia 77-3 (Smith 19, Wade 17) Smith works away a single from Woakes in his time-honoured style, and that is his 770th run for the series. So he goes past the 769 he made when India visited in 2014-15. Wade tries to whack across the line but drags it to Buttler at midwicket.Here’s an email. “I was at the Oval 71 years ago, sitting behind the bowlers arm, and saw Bradman bowled for a duck by Hollies. The image is as clear to me this day as the moment it happened. Bradman stepped across his wicket to make a pull shot and was bowled. We were mortified. It was our last chance to see one of the greatest batsmen ever and he was out second ball. Nothing, but nothing, can compensate for that loss. I had read how Bradman trained his eye by throwing a golf ball against a garage door and hitting it with a stump, not a bat, a stump. And that is what I did, as probably countless other youngsters. We wanted to be Bradmans.”Thanks for the message, Donald Last. If you were there 71 years ago and still here to tell us about it, then you’ve lived up to your surname.  23rd over: Australia 76-3 (Smith 18, Wade 17) Broad at the other end, but Wade handles better than any other left-hander so far. Carves away a boundary behind point, then clips three more runs behind square. and gets off strike. That’s how to do it. Smith adds only a leg bye.22nd over: Australia 68-3 (Smith 18, Wade 10) This may sound like a snide joke, but I had legitimately forgotten that Chris Woakes was in the team. He started with the ball after lunch and I was trying to work out who it was. He didn’t bowl at all in the first session. Joe Root’s use of him this whole series has been bizarre. He starts with a maiden. Isa Guha is to become the face of cricket on the BBC from next summer when a portion of the sport returns to the terrestrial broadcaster for the first time in 21 years.The former England international is understood to have signed up as the BBC’s lead anchor for the five-year rights deal that includes nightly Test highlights, three live T20 internationals per season and both men’s and women’s games in The Hundred.Guha, part of the England team that won the Women’s World Cup and Ashes in 2009 and a regular commentator on Sky and Test Match Special, represents a fresh start for cricket on the BBC, who take over the evening Test highlights from Channel 5 and are considering a revamp of the format.The BBC’s first live offering since 1998 includes two live England men’s T20 internationals per season and one featuring the women’s side. But it is the Hundred that the ECB are hoping will capture the public’s imagination despite a rocky start.Ten men’s fixtures in the new format, and eight of the women’s games, will be shown live on terrestrial television, including the finals of both. Andrew Flintoff has also been mooted as a host, given his existing BBC deal as a presenter of Top Gear, while the likes of Alison Mitchell, Ebony Rainford-Brent, Michael Vaughan and Jimmy Anderson are expected to cross over from Test Match Special’s list of broadcasting talent.England are in the driving seat to level this series up 2-2. It was Broad again, monstering Australia’s left-handers off the top, and another failure for the opening batsmen. Warner and Harris both went cheaply, then Jack Leach came into the game with his left-arm spin, drawing a stumping against Marnus Labuschagne. Entirely fittingly, it’s all down to Smith. He looks a bit tired and distracted, and that’s not an omen of a big innings. But even if he can bat long, who can stay with him? The scorecard is as thin going down the order as it has been above. We’ll be back in half an hour or so to see who can do what, and when, and how, and where.21st over: Australia 68-3 (Smith 18, Wade 10) Plenty of action even in a maiden for Wade, as he skips down a couple of times but doesn’t get a shot away for runs.And that is lunch.20th over: Australia 68-3 (Smith 18, Wade 10) Smith takes a few balls but gets a single away off the pads from Curran. Wade is positive again, opening the face to drive with the outswing away through cover for three runs. 19th over: Australia 64-3 (Smith 17, Wade 7) Smith is still swinging against Leach, and my sense that he might not be long for this innings is increasing. He doesn’t play like this when he’s settled. He lashes to cover, then drives airily towards mid-off and sees it bounce in front. Then plays a sweep shot, which really isn’t one of his strokes, and gets it nervously between keeper and bat-pad for one. Wade advances and drives two along the ground. Australia need 335.He’s gone past Alastair Cook’s 766 runs in that win in Australia in 2010-11.18th over: Australia 61-3 (Smith 16, Wade 5) Perhaps a helpful result for Australia is to have a left-hander facing the left-arm swing of Curran. Wade doesn’t look too fussed as he blocks, leaves, then ducks a couple of short balls. A third maiden.17th over: Australia 61-3 (Smith 16, Wade 5) Matthew Wade to the crease, Mitchell Marsh to come. It’s not exactly an inspiring Test batting line-up for Australia with 343 still to get. They need another ton from Wade. He starts by clobbering a sweep for four. Then turns away a single behind square. Joe Root is in at leg slip, after there was a lot of chat between he and Wade when Root was batting. A huge one for Jack Leach! Australia’s most important partnership is broken, as Labuschagne loses his balance trying to get forward to Leach, beaten in flight and his back toe lifts up. Bairstow is fast enough with the gloves, and the third umpire confirms that the batsman is out!16th over: Australia 55-2 (Labuschagne 14, Smith 15) Marnus gets away from Curran after a while, nudging a run, then Smith tries to whack another cover drive and misses out. I’m not sure that Smith will make a big score today, he just doesn’t seem settled. He nudges a run to square leg, and goes past Brian Lara’s 765 runs in England in 1995.15th over: Australia 53-2 (Labuschagne 13, Smith 14) What was that, Steven? That was Derbyshire Steve rather than Ashes Steve. He wanted to plonk the spinner down the ground but ending up mistiming his loft towards long-on. Luckily for him the contact was so poor that his shot falls short of the man on the rope. A single. 14th over: Australia 51-2 (Labuschagne 12, Smith 13) Curran continues. He’s swinging the ball into the right-handers’ pads, then sometimes changing up to angle one across. Draws Labuschagne into a couple of shots and beats the edge twice. Marnus leaves the next couple. Curran’s second maiden.13th over: Australia 51-2 (Labuschagne 12, Smith 13) A change in the bowling with Jack Leach on. Broad has done the new-ball job tremendously once again. Two wickets for him. Now the middle overs begin, with Australia moving past their fifty with a couple of singles. 348 to win.12th over: Australia 49-2 (Labuschagne 11, Smith 12) A maiden for Curran against Labuschagne, who has built his accidental Ashes on discipline, but falters to have one wide drive at a ball slanted across him. Missed. 11th over: Australia 49-2 (Labuschagne 11, Smith 12) Labuschagne not afraid to take on the short ball from Broad, even for a single to the deep. Then another boundary for Smith as Broad bowls in inswinger that Smith with his movement across can glance to fine leg. That takes Smith past Mudassar Nazar’s 761 runs for Pakistan against India in 1982 and 1983.10th over: Australia 44-2 (Labuschagne 10, Smith 8) Sam Curran starts off, and he’s bowling well immediately. Testing out Marnus on the pads, nearly lbw but for an inside edge. Then pushing just across Smith, drawing a cover drive that could bring some risk of an outside edge. The next is straighter, and Smith drives through mid-on, under Jofra Archer for four! Good shot, but maybe it could have been stopped. Smith goes past Bradman’s 759 runs from the 1934 Ashes. No big deal. 9th over: Australia 39-2 (Labuschagne 9, Smith 4) So Broad got Warner seven times in the series. And Warner has the lowest aggregate for any opener who has batted ten times in a Test series. Labuschagne gets a single from Broad. The standard Australian score of 2 for not many has settled into place. Well, this is the power of the OBO. We mentioned Gang of Four earlier, and now the band’s own Jon King has emailed in. “So proud my band, Gang of Four, gets a name check. There, shamelessly did it again! Back in the day in Leeds, sharing a flat with Mark White and Andy Corrigan of the Mekons, it was always a toss up for our guests to hear either Berlin-era Bowie, or TMS. Keep up the brilliant work!”8th over: Australia 38-2 (Labuschagne 8, Smith 4) Labuschagne’s bright start continues, cleanly off the pads from Archer for one. Smith deflects Archer to the fine leg boundary, but it’s off the thigh pad rather than bat. Smith yet to get off the mark then. But he’s away two balls later, a gorgeous cover drive from Archer, on the rise! Not all of Smith’s shots through cover look good, but the timing there was suave. He goes past Graham Gooch’s 752 in a series against India in 1990, and Denis Compton’s 753 when South Africa visited England in 1947.7th over: Australia 29-2 (Labuschagne 7, Smith 0) The over starts well for Australia: Marnus drives a full ball for four, then flicks three more runs through midwicket. Jack Leach’s run after the ball looks like the little dude in the original Nintendo handset Donkey Kong game. No barrels to jump over. But Broad knocks down Warner thereafter. Smith arrives, walking across to defend Broad, then playing that twisty-wrist cover drive at a wide one that hits the field. And right on cue, there he goes! Warner’s miserable Ashes comes to an end with one last dismissal. Scrambled seam from Broad, moved away slightly, Warner was only trying to defend from the crease but the delivery is back of a length and takes a fat edge at a nice height to third slip. Two down, and in comes Steve Smith!6th over: Australia 22-1 (Warner 11, Labuschagne 0) Archer to Warner, edged through the cordon for four! Luck there for Warner, it flew into the gap between slip and gully. It hits the boundary, and Warner is into double figures for the second time this season. I’d like to say that this might be enough to get him going, but it’s hard to see that from here.5th over: Australia 18-1 (Warner 7) Another failure for Harris. Another wicket in the first 10 overs for Broad, who has a stack of them this series. Marnus Labuschagne will make another early trip to the middle.Off stump out of the ground! Last ball of the over, a beauty from Broad! Warner had taken a single to rotate strike, Harris had played a lovely on-drive for four, and Australia’s total of 18 was their highest opening stand for the series. But that’s as far as it goes. A bit of movement, Harris plays inside the line, and it takes out off stump. Broad erupts. England riot."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f6008f4e4655cd3fedda49a8df1c4210c1df3b0/0_198_4804_2882/master/4804.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7fa095efd478a9a977ad0dee68155139","title":"solheim cup 2019 golf europe usa final day singles live","story":"This is coming to a boil now! Megan Khang misses from eight feet on 13, and she’s all square with Charley Hull. Angel Yin shoves a three footer wide right at 14, and her lead over Azahara Munoz, once four holes, is back down to just one. And drama on 18, as Kang flubs her sand shot, weakly sending it into another trap closer to the green. Advantage Ciganda? Well, maybe, but she’s in tangled nonsense up the bank, with a swale between her ball and the green ... and little dancefloor to play with. A big moment here.Georgia Hall gets up and down from a tight spot to the side of 15. And when Lexi Thompson misses a short par putt, it’s enough for the hole! She moves two clear at a crucial stage. On 17, Caroline Hedwall should level things up in the second match, after swishing a gorgeous tee shot pin high to ten feet, but she misreads the straightest putt at Gleneagles, giving it too much on the right, and Nelly Korda escapes with a par. And trouble for both players currently going up 18: after fine drives, Kang finds a greenside bunker with her second, while Ciganda flays her approach miles to the right. Tricky up and downs for both.Having reduced a four-hole deficit to one, Azahara Munoz undoes some of her good work with a tatty bogey at 13. She’s two down to Angel Yin again. On 16, Caroline Hedwall teases a 30-foot birdie slider across the green and into the cup. You can hear the roar in Aviemore. She’s just one down now, with two still to play. Meanwhile up on 17, Kang splashes out magnificently to ten feet, the best she could do having shortsided herself. And in goes the par saver! She’s scrambled a half, because Ciganda’s birdie putt never looks like dropping. Anna Nordqvist looks in control of the final match right now, by the way. She’s moved three up after seven holes. Which way is this going to go? You wouldn’t bet the farm, would you.Suddenly it all begins to go a bit wrong for Danielle Kang. Carlota Ciganda applies the pressure at the par-three 17th by firing her tee shot straight at the flag, ten feet short. Kang pulls hers into sand on the left. Back on 8, Ally McDonald creams a stunning second to three feet, and tidies up for a birdie that levels her match with Bronte Law.Two putts for Ciganda on 16, and it’s enough for a birdie that wins the hole and ties up the opening match. That one’s sure to go down 18 now. Meanwhile birdie for Altomare on 10, as Ewart Shadoff begins to lose control. But Annie Park’s short par putt on 13 horseshoes out, gifting the lead to the relentless Celine Boutier, while Jessica Korda’s short missed effort on 10 allows Caroline Masson to tie up that match. This is back in Europe’s hands now, but expect plenty of to and fro. The drama’s only just starting!Jodi Ewart Shadoff yips a tiddler on 9 to turn three down against Brittany Altomare. She bends over double in extreme anguish. That could be costly. Caroline Hedwall misses a short one on 15, too, and the Swede has really let this one get away. Having been three up at the turn, she’s now two down. If nothing else, it proves to Ewart Shadoff that all is not yet lost. Although Azahara Munoz’s antics should already be providing succour: she wins another hole, this time 12, to reduce her once-huge deficit against Angel Yin to one hole.Bronte Law isn’t taking this situation lying down. In goes a birdie putt on 7, and she nearly launches herself towards Pitlochry with the force of her celebration. And Carlota Ciganda isn’t done yet either. She smashes two huge shots down the par-five 16th to reach the green and set up a long eagle putt. However Kang puts a little pressure on by knocking her third - having laid up in front of the creek - to six feet. Let’s see how this pans out, then. A couple of big putts coming up, sure to shape the afternoon narrative.Munoz continues to fight back! She wins a second hole in succession, stroking in a birdie putt on 11 from 20 feet. She’s just two holes down against Angel Yin. But elsewhere, the momentum is very much with the USA! The Kordas continue to rise after stuttering starts. Nelly wins 13, Jessica wins 9, and the sisters are now leading their matches after being three and two holes down respectively. And a bogey for Anne van Dam on 10 means Lizette Salas is level. All of a sudden, with Ally McDonald levelling things up against Bronte Law on 6, this is the USA’s to lose!Charley Hull, having finally made a putt on 9, knocks in another at 10. A birdie, and she holds her arms out in mock triumph, having let so many earlier chances slip by. She’s just the one down to Megan Khang now. Meanwhile Brittany Altomare rakes in a long one on 8 to move two up on Jodi Ewart Shadoff, while Anna Nordqvist goes two up in the final match. It could well go down to that last rubber, because as things stand the scores will be level ... and the USA would retain the cup as holders. Best of luck guessing which way this is going to go.Finally a little joy for Azahara Munoz. She smoothly sends her tee shot at 10 to four feet, and the resulting birdie is enough to reduce her arrears to three holes. A round of two halves coming up? Meanwhile on 14 Kang rolls in the six-footer she’d left herself for birdie. Two putts for Ciganda, who birdies as well, but that’ll feel like a win for Kang after their respective tee shots. And back on 6, Pettersen nervelessly guides in a left-to-right slider from 25 feet for birdie, moving two clear of Alex. Ice cold.Ciganda and Kang have been put on the clock. Neither player appears particularly fussed about it. Ciganda drives the short par-five 14th Kang chips on in two. Meanwhile there’s a Korda resurgence: Nelly wins the 13th to draw level with Hedwall, while Jessica ties it up with Masson on 8.Boutier rights the wrongs of 10 by easing her second at 11 to six feet, then nailing the birdie putt. She’s all square with Park again. Meanwhile Hull, who missed two short putts on 7 and 8 to win the hole, knocks in a 12-footer on 9 to save the half. Strange game, golf.Ciganda’s driver cost her on 9. And having gotten out of position at 13, she slips behind in the opening match. Birdie beats bogey. Not a single match is tied right now! Europe would win the cup if everything remains the same, but there’s no more than a hole between the players in all but two of these matches. It’s on the proverbial knife-edge. Lexi Thompson’s putter has played up all year, and her flat stick continues to let her down today. She prods with great uncertainty at a three-footer on 11, and that’s three holes gone in the blink of an eye. And mixed news for Europe elsewhere. Suzann Pettersen moves one up on Marina Alex Charley Hull misses another short chance to win a hole, this time at 8 Angel Yin hits the turn four ahead of Azahara Munoz and Caroline Masson pulls a six-footer at 7 to hand a hole back to Jessica Korda. It is, to quote the great Danny Boon, all happening.A lovely tee shot by Celine Boutier at 10. Pin high to 12 feet. But it earns her nix. Nada. Nothing. Her opponent Annie Park rakes in a monster from the fringe, and Boutier’s birdie effort then fails to drop. Hole to the USA. Better news down the bottom, where Bronte Law scrambles par at 4 with a determined 15-footer, and it’s enough to win the hole and regain the lead over Ally McDonald.Ally McDonald has snatched a hole back off Bronte Law, but in the final game Anna Nordqvist has birdied 2 to start well against Morgan Pressel. A long way to go, of course, but as things stand, Europe will regain the Solheim Cup.Back-to-back holes for Nelly Korda! She follows up birdie at 10 with another at 11, and suddenly she’s only one down against Caroline Hedwell. Meanwhile on 10, Lexi Thompson races her birdie effort ten feet past the hole, and she’s never getting the one coming back. Georgia Hall gets up and down from the top of a rugged mound, and she’s dragged the match back to all-square in short order!Georgia Hall finally gets something going. Birdie at 9, and she hits the turn just one behind Lexi Thompson. The American then lets go of her club after hitting her tee shot at the par-three 10th, twirling it in the air like Stevie Nicks in the video for Tusk, before catching it cleanly. She’s disgusted with herself, but that’s professionals for you, because she’s still found the green. The weekend golfer would be thrilled. Birdie putt coming up.Some truly world-class play on the short par-four 11th. Kang sends her second screeching to 18 inches, a surefire thing for birdie. So Ciganda responds by knocking her ball to 12 inches! A pair of stunning birdies! Back on 6, Van Dam yips from short range to hand a hole back to Salas. And on 7, Hull creams a delicious iron to four feet, but shoves the birdie putt wide right. She’s still a couple down to Khang.Munoz drains a monster on 7 for birdie! The sensational putt looks to have snatched a much-needed hole for Europe in the fifth match ... but Yin nails a 15-footer of her own for a half! What classic match-play to-and-fro! And it will have frustrated the hell out of Munoz, who needs something to happen sooner rather than later.Anne van Dam rolls in a 20-foot birdie effort on 5 to move two holes clear of the 2017 hero Lizette Salas. Jessica Korda misses a tiddler on 4 to fall further behind Caroline Masson. And Bronte Law becomes the latest European to taste success on the opening hole. The hosts have warmed to the 1st, after a fashion.As If We Didn’t Know Already dept. Kang wedges her third at 9 to kick-in distance. Ciganda, on the green in five, picks up her ball and makes off to the 10th tee. But some better news for Europe: Annie Park has made three bogeys in four holes, allowing Celine Boutier to claw her way back into their match after that cold start.Ciganda won’t be leading the opening match for much longer. She mishits her fourth and it surely won’t be long before she’s picking up and moving on. Back on the tee, Hedwall and Nelly Korda, having been made to wait interminably, bash their drives down the middle.Lexi Thompson’s putter sometimes lets her down over short distances. But she smoothly strokes a four-footer into the cup on 7 to remain two up on Georgia Hall. Meanwhile Brittany Altomare follows a bogey at 1 with birdie at 2. And some trouble for Carlota Ciganda on the par-five 9th, as she flays her drive into thick oomska down the right. There’s no way she can go forward, as she’d be flirting with water. Instead, she’s forced to punch out sideways ... and she makes a real hash of it, failing to get her ball back on the fairway. She’ll be hitting four into the green from distance.An aggressive chip by Ciganda, just off the back of 8, trundles a good 12 feet past the cup. But she nails the one coming back, salvaging her par and the half. She celebrates as though she made that for the win. It’ll feel like that, Kang having shaved the hole with a birdie attempt. Back on 1, another triumph for Europe, who are finally getting to grips with this opening hole. Jodi Ewart Shadoff birdies to take the lead against Brittany Altomare.There’s been a bit of chat about slow play this week. Ewan Murray has that story. Anyway, Carlota Ciganda and Danielle Kang have been told by the match referee to get a wriggle on. Meanwhile Yin wins yet another hole at 4, Munoz really struggling this afternoon. Hall bogeys 6 to gift a hole to Thompson the 2018 British Open winner doesn’t look totally happy with her game today either. But a hole back for Boutier at 5 as she halves her deficit against Park.Danielle Kang makes the first bogey in the opening match, allowing Carlota Ciganda to put some blue on the board. Meanwhile Georgia Hall takes full advantage of her lucky break at 5, getting up and down to scramble her par and save the half. That’s a staunch effort, and it’s annoyed Lexi Thompson, who wanders off with a frown, wondering how that one’s got away.Caroline Hedwall is on fire this morning! Her feet slip as she takes her tee shot at the par-three 6th, but her ball takes a kindly kick off a bank to the right of the green, and trundles back towards the hole. She strokes in her birdie putt, and romps into a three-hole lead over Nelly Korda! Birdie for Caroline Masson at 1, and she takes the lead immediately against Jessica Korda. And another birdie for Angel Yin, this time at 3, and she’s in control against Azahara Munoz already. She should really be three up.Ciganda fizzes a fine tee shot at the par-three 6th straight at the flag. Five feet away. But she can’t make the birdie putt, and a chance to take the lead in the opening match is spurned. Back on 5, Hall thinks she’s sent her second into the hazard at the front of the green, but somehow her ball squeaks over. She’s still up against it, though, with Thompson - her back having apparently repaired itself - on in regulation. Meanwhile on 1, Anne van Dam knocks her second to four feet, a wonderful shot that pressurises Lizette Salas into a bogey and a concession. A rare victory for Europe at this relatively easy opening hole.Birdie for Yin on 2, who doesn’t miss a short one this time. Hall and Boutier both watch in horror as makeable hole-winning putts slide by on 4 and 3 respectively. And on 5, it’s really not clear how birdie putts from Hedwall and Nelly Korda fail to drop. A couple of fine efforts teeter on the edge of the hole. Hedwall rather saucily picked up Korda’s ball the second it stopped rolling, conceding the putt before gravity could pull any delayed stunt. Ciganda nearly sends a fat approach into the water guarding the front of the tricky par-four 5th. She gets away with it, but follows that up with a heavy-handed chip, her ball scuttling ten feet past. No matter! When her putter’s hot, it’s red hot, and in goes the par saver. Kang, having parred the hole in much less dramatic fashion, will no doubt feel a tad robbed there. Meanwhile Charley Hull becomes Europe’s latest victim on 1, as Megan Khang strokes a 20-foot birdie effort into the cup. The US are having the best of these early exchanges they’re up in three.Lexi Thompson is by all accounts suffering from a trapped nerve in her back. Her caddie is having to tee up the ball for her. You wouldn’t know by the way she creamed her second into 3, though. She’s an inch or so away from making the birdie putt, but it stays stubbornly on the lip. And then some more pain for the American, as Georgia Hall channels her 2018 British Open winning form by rattling in a 20-footer to save par. Hall remains in touching distance.Another gift for Europe! Following hot on the heels of Yin’s short miss on 1, Nelly Korda shoves a tiddler right of the cup on the par-three 4th, and Hedwall restores her two-hole advantage.The action - and the wind - is beginning to pick up now. Azahara Munoz and Angel Yin are out and about, the European one of the shorter hitters on tour, Yin one of the longest. Neither find the green in regulation. And like Boutier before her, Munoz can’t wedge her ball up onto the green from the bottom of the swale to the left. She bumps her second attempt up to kick-in distance with a hybrid. Bogey’s good enough, though, Yin failing to get up and down from the front fringe, missing a three-footer for her par. Meanwhile birdie for Park at 2, and she’s off to a flyer against Boutier.Ciganda looks to have made a holy mess of the par-three 4th, leaving her first putt well short. A terrible misjudgement. But she refuses to buckle, rolling in a ten-footer to save her par. Kang needs a six-footer to halve the hole, and she makes it. Thompson, having left herself with plenty to do from a greenside bunker at 2, gets up and down for a marvellous birdie. Such a good splash out to six feet, having shortsided herself. It salvages a half, Hall having found the green in two and taken two putts for a birdie of her own. Hedwall’s fast start meanwhile comes to an abrupt end, as she yips a short one on 3 to hand the hole to Nelly Korda.Kang and Ciganda take turns to shave the right edge of the cup at 3, narrowly missing out on birdies. Hole halved. On 1, Boutier sends her second into the swale to the left of the green, then duffs two chips in succession, her ball landing apologetically on the upslope and coming back to her feet on both occasions. She thins a third attempt miles past the hole, and thank goodness this is isn’t a stroke-play event.Another birdie for Caroline Hedwall! The 30-year-old Swede is the only player on either team to have featured in just one match so far this week, and she’s flown out of the traps in the style of a woman with a point to prove. A textbook traverse up the par-five 2nd, and she pumps the air with her fist, wearing a look of extreme determination. What a start she’s made! A force of nature in the Solheim Cup.The fourth match, between the rookies Annie Park and Celine Boutier, on the first tee. Park’s drive takes a bounce into the semi-rough down the left ... as does Boutier’s. Up on the green, Hall fails to get up and down from the front, having left her bump-and-run well short. Thompson tidies up for a par that takes the hole.Kang can’t get up and down from the sand. That gives Ciganda an opportunity to win the hole, the Spaniard having chipped up to ten feet from the swale at the back of the green. She lines the putt up carefully, and rolls it straight into the cup. The opening match is all square! Back on the 1st, Thompson does extremely well to power out of the rough and find the dancefloor Hall by comparison leaves her second short of the green from the middle of the fairway.Lexi Thompson becomes the first player to miss the fairway with her opening drive. She sends a nervous effort into the thick stuff down the right. Her opponent Georgia Hall flirts with a bunker on the same side of the fairway, but gets a member’s bounce and finds herself in prime position.Kang’s second at the par-five 2nd is an inch away from perfection. But as it lands on the front of the green, instead of rolling towards the hole and setting up an eagle chance, the ball takes a huge kick left and into sand. That was nearly a stunner. Ciganda meanwhile sends her second over the back, setting up an up-and-down shoot-out. Meanwhile back on 1, Hedwall creams her second to six feet, and is soon punching the air as she rolls in an opening birdie to take an early lead against Nelly Korda.Back on the tee, Nelly Korda whips her opening drive straight down the middle. Caroline Hedwall - five points in five matches in 2013 - follows her down. What an atmosphere on this first hole. The stands at the tee are packed, and a heavily populated gallery snakes all the way alongside the fairway. Hedwall’s caddie gees the punters up with a wave of his arms, like they need any encouragement. Gleneagles is delivering again, just as it did at the 2014 Ryder Cup.Ciganda lags up. The putt’s never going in, but it’s perfectly paced and that’s an opening par. Kang has a gentle right-to-left slider from eight feet for birdie and the hole. She walks it in, and it’s first blood to the USA!Kang throws down the gauntlet immediately. She creams a short iron to eight feet. That’s a sensational opening salvo. Ciganda’s approach is mighty fine, but suffers by comparison, twice the distance out. Back on the tee, Caroline Hedwall, who went undefeated in the 2013 matches, turns up to do battle with Nelly Korda.Plenty of US support among the Scottish crowd. “Here we go, Danielle, her we go!” The American is up first. She tees it up high, and launches it down the middle, raising both arms in triumph. Always good to get that first drive away. Then it’s Ciganda’s turn. You can suddenly hear a pin drop. And the Spanish star sends a beauty down the middle. This is on! Here we go, indeed.Here we go, then! Carlota Ciganda, who has enjoyed a fine year in the majors with three top-ten finishes, takes to the first tee. An amazing party atmosphere. Ciganda’s opponent, the 2017 PGA winner Danielle Kang, won’t hear the music that’s blaring out she’s in her own world with her ear buds in. We’ll be off in a minute!Ochil aye. Before the action begins, here’s a brief reminder of the road Europe and America’s finest will traverse this afternoon.On Friday afternoon at Gleneagles, Europe looked poised to establish a healthy lead in the 16th Solheim Cup. But the USA, the pre-tournament favourites, ground out a couple of halves on the 18th. And then Saturday belonged to the visitors. So we go into the final day of this to-and-fro tournament all square. Eight points apiece. Have you buckled in? Because here we go!On paper, the USA should close this out and retain the cup they’ve held since 2015. They’ve got ten players in the world top 50, as opposed to Europe’s six. And as holders they just need to reach 14 points to retain their trophy Europe need 14.5 to snatch it back. But there’s nothing quite like match-play singles, is there, and the USA have six rookies in their team. And they’re significantly younger, with an average age of 25.5 compared to the hosts’ 28.2. These things shouldn’t matter ... but it’s the business end of the Solheim Cup, and you never know how it all comes down until everyone’s out there on their own.It’s been dramatic enough this week already. But of course here’s where the story really begins. Can Juli Inkster’s side keep a grip on the trophy the USA have won ten times already? Or will Catriona Matthew taste victory on home soil, bringing the cup back to Europe for the sixth time? We’ll find out soon enough. It’s on!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/63f577a7fac7e7d251a892875c29c41ad6432bcb/714_527_4279_2567/master/4279.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1fc935bef3b8f21c92594b069188e3d5","title":"solaris review royal lyceum edinburgh david greig tarkovsky soderbergh stanislaw lem","story":"Royal Lyceum, EdinburghDavid Greig follows Tarkovsky and Soderbergh with this bold, rewarding take on Stanisław Lem’s novel about a sentient planet speaking to its visitorsIf a sentient planet existed, it would be unfathomably hard to explain. How to put into words a consciousness so vast, ancient and alien? We’d struggle to begin.It seems only right, then, that each time it is told, the story of Solaris shifts in shape. First, came the 1961 novel by Stanisław Lem, coupling dense tracts of tech-speak with an unknown terror worthy of Edgar Allan Poe. Where the 1972 Tarkovsky movie was spare and reflective, the 2002 Soderbergh version was all about the wish-fulfilment romance between George Clooney, as a newly arrived spaceman, and Natascha McElhone, an apparition of his former wife.Likewise, David Greig’s adaptation, the most satisfying of them all, is its own thing. Although rooted in the novel, it takes bold and rewarding liberties with character and plot. This is partly to make theatrical sense the crew of the playwright’s gender-balanced spaceship are now talkative instead of taciturn, their attempts to understand the watery planet a collegiate enterprise, the better for us to know what’s going on.It’s partly also to home in on the themes of loneliness, communication and unknowability. In Greig’s version, Solaris learns to talk to its visitors step by step, manifesting itself in increasingly sophisticated ways. First, it sends gifts of Earth-like objects, and eventually emissaries in human form.The more real these manifestations become, the greater the existential crisis. Polly Frame, excellent as psychologist Kris, is emotionally torn when Keegan Joyce appears as long-lost boyfriend Ray. He is as attractive and as inscrutable as the planet itself. Pulled in two directions – by scientific rigour and human passion – Kris sees an escape from loneliness in the very thing that will make her more isolated. Matters are no easier for Ray, a personality without a past, slowly destroyed by self-awareness.All this is consummately staged by Matthew Lutton in a co-production with Melbourne’s Malthouse theatre, bringing a human scale to the otherworldly seascapes and arid spaceship interiors created by designer Hyemi Shin and the technical team. With its sharp, cinematic cuts and rumbling waves of sound, Solaris troubles and tantalises.• At Royal Lyceum, Edinburgh, until 5 October, then at Lyric Hammersmith, London, 10 October to 2 November."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d1a04737d303865e461c16f2bb9582aa3e1021f/0_208_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b55e85fa258b1058f6283996e1e18d8","title":"banking regulators to question facebook over new libra cryptocurrency","story":"BoE among 26 global banks due to meet with Libra amid fears over risk to state sovereigntyGlobal regulators will question Facebook on Monday about its Libra cryptocurrency amid concerns from EU governments over the threat the digital currency poses to financial stability, according to the Financial Times.Officials from 26 central banks, including the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England, will meet with representatives of Libra in Basel on Monday, the FT said, citing officials.Libra’s founders have also been requested to answer key questions about the currency’s scope and design, FT said.Facebook did not immediately respond to Reuters’ request for comment outside regular business hours.Countries including France and Germany have publicly criticised the social media giant’s Libra project, saying it posed risks to EU states’ sovereignty."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f58dc26f95d9d4a0b67676faaee380ee4d6a0e33/475_625_4625_2775/master/4625.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=db50066c1fa9c9a711387870865da78b","title":"we are going on a boar hunt forest of dean","story":"With its kingfishers and wild pigs, this Gloucestershire forest is perfect for a family nature safariIt’s a kingfisher!” Ed’s body swung round and leaned forward, his arm following in a wavelike motion the bird soaring above the water at Cannop Ponds in the Forest of Dean. We leaned with him, scanning the sky. “There it is, there it is.” Ed Drewitt, our guide, had spotted its landing perch in a pine around 400 metres away. “Wow, I’d love to be able to do that,” my daughter whispered. Ed got his binoculars out so we could glimpse the orange belly of the bird, the first kingfisher he’d seen this year, he told us excitedly. Ed, a passionate zoologist, was taking us on an “animal safari”, offered to guests staying at the Tudor Farmhouse in the heart of the Forest of Dean. The “safari” is perfect for animal lovers, including my daughter Sophie, 20, studying animal management, and my 16-year-old son, Toby.We’d arrived the afternoon before and, thanks to the hotel’s map of wild swimming spots, headed straight out to the River Usk, half an hour away, sinking into the water from a tiny island beach in the centre of a bend in the river. After a slow journey on clogged motorways, it was a refreshing and magical way to start our forest adventure. Back at the hotel, we enjoyed cocktails in the garden, before stepping across a wooden bridge over a tiny stream that led inside to dinner. I was impressed by the variety on the menu, particularly for someone like me who is gluten and dairy-free, and by the fact that much of it was locally sourced – and tucked into delicately flavoured beetroot and cured salmon, followed by pork belly with roast onion.The next morning, it was a short drive to Puzzlewood, the inspiration for Tolkien’s Middle-earth, an area of woodland where moss carpets a landscape of rocks and trees. We ambled up paths and across bridges, trying to spot the precise locations for scenes from Star Wars and Doctor Who, both of which were filmed here.Following a lazy afternoon at the hotel – me on the terrace drinking in the views, Sophie and Toby in front of the TV – we set off for a picnic at Wenchford before Ed collected us from the hotel. Stopping at the ponds, he was soon in raptures at the sight of wagtails, mandarin ducks, coots, goldfinches, chaffinches and, of course, that kingfisher.What we were itching to see were wild boars, the wild pigs which were once native here, before being hunted to extinction. But then, 10-15 years ago, they were reintroduced by an anonymous breeder who released a few into the woods. As prolific breeders with no natural predators, the boars quickly multiplied and today there are an impressive 1,500 of them. Deep into the forest Ed led us, encouraging us to inhale the hoplike scent of flowering horse chestnuts and the freshness of wild mint, as the words and rhythm of Michael Rosen’s We’re Going on a Bear Hunt played in my head. Suddenly we heard snuffling and grunting and the sound of twigs snapping under trotters. We stood still, peering into the trees, slightly scared by the prospect of the untamed beasts we could hear, but wanting to see them, too. Minutes passed. The sound died away. We marched on.The geography of the forest, sandwiched between the rivers Severn and Wye, meant that it was historically an isolated and closed community. Even today, “Foresters” – people born in the Forest of Dean – have special privileges, such as the right to mine iron ore, coal and stone, and permission to allow their sheep to roam free. A couple of days later at the Speech House, a 17th-century hunting lodge and courthouse turned hotel, we were to learn about the ancient system of rule that still exists – and indulge in a three-tiered cream tea.It was 9.30pm and the light was fading. We’d stared through the binoculars at the grace of a stock-still deer and glimpsed another as it bolted into the trees. Ed picked up a dorbeetle to show us its iridescent belly and Toby held a tiny toad in his palm. Then, almost back at the ponds, we finally caught sight of a pair of cute stripy-backed boarlets who shuffled across the path in front of us. Then it was back to the hotel where a welcome platter of cold meats and cheeses awaited us.The following morning we had a break from animals to glide up and down the Wye on paddleboards – a first for me – with Inspire2Adventure. In our two-hour session, thanks to skillful instruction from the friendly Paul Marshall, we quickly got from kneeling to standing, learned several ways to turn and even mastered a few tricks, such as linking our boards to create a raft. Fully clothed, Sophie and I were determined to keep out of the water while Toby, experimenting with jumping 180 degrees on his board, fell in multiple times – and declared that we were boring for staying dry. Later, Sophie was keen to visit the butterfly zoo a few miles up the road, so she and I spent a couple of hours in its tropical enclosure spotting rare specimens, such as the owl and blue morpho, and even a delicate glasswing.As the day closed, we checked into a remote but extremely comfortable cottage with Forest Barn Holidays outside Cinderford, on the forest’s eastern edge. A hot tub on the patio and a welcome basket of local goodies meant we barely strayed from the site. We were, however, lured away to dinner by the Lyon Inn at Westbury-on-Severn where our fussy diets were once more impressively catered for, again by mostly local produce. I couldn’t resist the sound of charred peach and maple-glazed tofu with puy lentils, while Sophie and Toby enjoyed nasturtium pesto on a light and fluffy bruschetta.There was a final piece of forest magic on our last morning, at the onsite falconry, a stone’s throw from our cottage. My own childhood experience of birds of prey, gawping at them in cages or watching somebody else fly them, had never stirred my imagination. Here, however, we saw them up close – really close – just the three of us, and the resident falconer Mark Parker whose passion began, just as in Kes, with a tough school life and a pet kestrel. Each of us in turn slipped our hand in the glove so that Mark could place the bird – first a kestrel, then a Harris hawk, finally a barn owl – on it. The birds then flew to a post before gliding back towards us, wings full stretch in hypnotic motion, hovering momentarily in front of the gauntlet then touching down gracefully as we kept its landing perch steady. I held a goshawk, the lethal beak and fearsome stare of its yellow eyes inches from my face and witnessed my daughter do likewise, her absorbed, lit-up expression alongside is dazzling plumage. And I caught my son’s reverence at the peregrine falcon on his arm. Its ability to e at 200mph makes it the fastest creature on earth.

Presenter Fiona Bruce still has hope for the futureQuestion Time turns 40 at the end of this month. The BBC institution is not immune to that birthday’s particular mix of crisis and denial. While the programme’s 25th year was marked with affectionate celebration and nostalgic retrospectives, this time around there will be little fanfare. Mostly, you imagine, like many of us who have experienced that midlife milestone, the show would ideally like to take to its bed in a darkened room to fret about its blood pressure and its sell-by date, and to relive those golden years before any red-faced audience member ever yelled the words “no deal” or “confirmatory vote” or “the Irish backstop”.For those who hold to the idea that politics and journalism should be more about listening than lecturing, more about informed doubt than angry certainty, Question Time has for a long while been an uncomfortable watch. Since the redoubtable charmer David Dimbleby finally threw in the towel after 25 years, aged 80, in December, the hottest seat in British broadcasting has belonged to Fiona Bruce, who maintains a measure of order with a mixture of good humour and exasperation and that judiciously raised eyebrow. Her early outings on the show were praised for their briskness and confidence. As this long year has worn on, however, she has, like the rest of us, looked a little more beleaguered. She was not 20 minutes into the first show after the summer break before she was calling a time-out to the partisan bickering: “We are better than this.” Most evidence in the current public square suggests that we are not.I met her last Monday, at the same moment that her equivalent in the House of Commons, John Bercow, was announcing his departure. She had been instrumental, the week before, in bringing back Question Time earlier than scheduled “because we all felt it was important for people to be able to hold their elected representatives to account in the absence of parliament”. Was there a part of her that wished she had stuck to Fake Or Fortune?, The Antiques Roadshow and the news?The first episode of Question Time is broadcast on BBC One on 25 September, hosted by Robin Day. The panel – “There they are and here we go” – consists of the Labour MP Michael Foot, Edna O’Brien, the Tory MP Teddy Taylor and the archbishop of Liverpool Derek Worlock. The format is based on Radio 4’s Any Questions?A special Question Time episode from Brussels with the former Tory PM Edward Heath, the Labour MP Robin Cook and the SDP co-founder Roy Jenkins.Robin Day announces his retirement. Peter Sissons takes over until 1993. The BBC begins filming the show in different locations.\u0026nbspDavid Dimbleby succeeds Sissons. In the mid 90s, there is a change in format, whereby audience members vote at the end of the show using voting\u0026nbsppads.\u0026nbspSchools Question Time launches, the aim being to improve political literacy and communication skills.Question Time makes history during the general election by featuring a head to head between the three main party leaders – Tony Blair, Michael Howard and Charles Kennedy.\u0026nbspThe show records its highest figures to date, peaking at 8.3\u0026nbspmillion viewers when the BNP leader, Nick Griffin, appears on the panel. David Dimbleby misses chairing an episode for the first time in 15 years, having been injured by a bullock on his farm. John Humphrys steps in.David Dimbleby announces his retirement after 25 years and 914 episodes. Fiona Bruce replaces him.\u0026nbspQuestion Time is the BBC’s most tweeted-about show in 2018.To date, 1,413 episodes of Question Time have aired and the show has about 2 million viewers per episode.I wish I shared her confidence. That first week back she gave in to the inevitable and the audience talked Brexit and prorogation for the whole hour. Why?She began that quest by asking the audience in advance to signal whether they were remainers or leavers, roundheads or cavaliers. The gesture looked like a pre-emptive strike to appease those critics who see bias in the BBC’s every utterance.Of course, it achieved no such thing. Question Time has a bigger Twitter response in the UK than any programme other than Love Island. Each episode of the programme has long since become a real-time media studies lesson. Bruce and the panel and selected members of the audience are freeze-framed for evidence of Brexit collusion or Remoaner conspiracy. No one, it can seem on Twitter at least, is immune to these tribal knee-jerks. Iain Dale, the LBC presenter and Tory commentator, who was a guest on that first show, was thrilled to note the boost it had given to his online following. He immediately fed that crowd by tweeting a tally of the amount of time each panellist had been allowed to speak. Despite the fact that by far the most newsworthy moment of that programme involved Labour’s Emily Thornberry being exposed explaining the absurdist contradictions of her party’s current policy, Dale used the data to support his belief that there was an anti-Brexit conspiracy on the show.Question Time was born in a similar moment of political polarisation: 1979, the first year of the Thatcher government. As the first chair, Sir Robin Day, said, it was an experiment in putting politicians in front of “what’s described in TV circles as ‘real people’ to distinguish them from people who work in television”. It was the third episode before a cabinet minister, Michael Heseltine, appeared, and offered himself as a rather grandiose conductor of the audience’s discontent. Watching those early episodes now, you have a sense of a different kind of relationship between panel and questioners. There is a little more general politeness from the latter, and a degree of anxiety about being the target of Day’s gruff wit. In the years since then, many things have changed. But the most obvious one is that people now have more practice and opportunity in broadcasting opinions – and belief in their need to be heard.In the early days of social media, Dimbleby used to read out the show’s Twitter hashtag in the style of a high court judge presented with the latest fashion in tattoos. Latterly, he acknowledged the highly vocal “audience at home” as a crucial part of the reach of the show. Our greater access to politicians, and to commenting on their every gesture, has led to two things: their calibre has apparently fallen, and the collective mistrust of them has grown. Does Bruce think the relationship is retrievable?“The one thing that Question Time still does which other programmes cannot do is cut through the political messaging,” she says. “I always ask people to be polite sometimes they are very direct. And as any politician knows, if you face the public directly, anything can happen. Look at Boris Johnson in West Yorkshire the other day – you just don’t know who is going to shake your hand and politely tell you to ‘leave their town’. That is where the jeopardy comes on Question Time and not all politicians want to come on it, for that reason.”Those who do rarely seem to have the time or the inclination to utter anything other than practised party lines. Hasn’t it actually become yet another opportunity for the two tribes that now make up our nation to display their colours, and to let off some steam?“It can be cathartic, people like to vent on Brexit, but I still think it works best when people want an answer to a specific question. For example, I remember Nigel Farage was on – he has actually only been on once since I started – and someone asked him: ‘What other country trades only on WTO rules?’ The man in the audience just kept trying to get him to name one, which he didn’t. The best thing, on Question Time, is when the reality confronts the rhetoric.”In his own recollections of the programme, Day mentioned that he regretted not having a greater say in choosing panellists. Has Bruce managed to win that concession?“I do get involved,” she says. “It would be wonderful if I could sit there and say: ‘let’s have Michael Gove this week’, or whatever. But sadly it is not like that. Mostly there is a member of the government and a member of the opposition put forward, and then the rest is worked out over a year to get fair representation.”Farage, who has an amazing appearance record, seems to have been a particularly fortunate beneficiary of that system…“Not as amazing as Ken Clarke, who has been on it 59 times, I think.”But whereas Clarke has held many of the highest offices in the land over half a century, Farage has been on 33 times having never been elected an MP…“I am not fully across why that was,” Bruce says. “It was before my time. He came on with me after the European elections, once, which seemed reasonable, as he led the largest party.”In some ways Bruce’s own appointment appeared an odd choice at the time. It was generally accepted that whoever would replace Dimbleby had to be a woman, but others among what Bruce sweetly calls “the BBC sisterhood” – Mishal Husain, Kirsty Wark, Emily Maitlis – had arguably a greater depth of political experience. Bruce, by all accounts, aced the audition process, which involved a practice live show. Her apparently impermeable good humour was no doubt a factor. Anyone who took the thing more to heart would probably go bonkers after a couple of weeks.You don’t have to spend long in her company to understand that her Antiques Roadshow bonhomie is not just for the cameras. There is a cloak of cheery confidence about her. A 2009 appearance on Who Do You Think You Are? revealed some of the roots of that, when she traced her father’s family back to an impoverished fishing village in Scotland. Her old man had escaped that, a considerable autodidact, to make it from the post room to the boardroom at Unilever.Would she say that he had imbued his youngest child with a sense that anything was possible?“He never said that in so many words. But yes, given where he came from and what he did, I think subconsciously I have always felt that.”When Question Time came her way, she followed Dimbleby’s obvious advice and just tried to be herself.“I am a simple soul,” she says, not quite believably. “And you don’t have time to dissemble on live TV even if you wanted to. Everything is happening around you and you just react. If you were also trying to be a character, I’m not sure how you would do that.”Day in particular gave the show its knockabout gravitas by being a political insider. Would she count politicians among her friends?“That is not the world I have inhabited. God, who knows how long I will do this and if that will change. But I think it is healthy for me to keep a distance.”That sense of perspective, of an outsider’s eye, she suggests, is rooted in a childhood that began in Singapore where her father ran Unilever’s east Asian operation.“I didn’t grow up in this British system,” she says. The family came back briefly to live on the Wirral when she was six. Then later, until she was 14, she was sent to an international school in Milan, “a Tower of Babel of different languages and nationalities”. Her best friend was Norwegian, and they remain close. She returned from Milan, where she mixed with the “kids of international business people”, to a comprehensive in New Cross, south London, another “big adjustment”. From there, she used the language skills she had to win a place at Oxford, where she was “interested in women’s politics and having a good time”. She was very briefly a protester at Greenham Common she fronted a punky band and dyed her hair blue (but only for a week). She was not involved in student party politics, and never a member of any party “because no party has ever had sufficient pull for me. And that is just as well now.”Her desire to go into journalism came quite late. She worked at the management consultancy Accenture for a year, with airy ideas of an MBA, but spent much of it crying in the loos. She escaped to a job in advertising for four years – “had a blast” – and met her husband of 25 years, Nigel Sharrocks, who was a director at the BMP agency. She eventually talked her way into a job as a researcher on Panorama after she met its editor at a wedding.She became the first woman to have presented both News at Six and News at 10. Does she think of herself as a presenter or a journalist?“I think of myself as a journalist first and foremost.”Before Dimbleby took on the Question Time job, Jeremy Paxman auditioned. By some accounts he savaged both the panel and the audience. Does Bruce feel TV journalism has to be combative to get at the truth?“Not always. I had done debate programmes before and quite often you go into them thinking: ‘I might need to build some energy in the room.’ On Question Time, the reverse is true. A lot of the time, I am just trying to not have it turn into a slanging match. You want some heat in the programme, but you need more light than heat. I think if I don’t do that, sometimes it is just going to run away and be incredibly ill tempered. Who wants to watch that?”The answer to that question is perhaps: quite a lot of people. For a while, in more politically stable times, there seemed to be an effort to invite mostly career contrarians on the programme in case it became dull. Ten years ago, there was considerable furore around the appearance of BNP leader Nick Griffin. More than 8 million people – nearly three times the regular audience, and still easily a record – tuned in to see him undone by Jack Straw and Bonnie Greer. Could Bruce imagine having a figure like Tommy Robinson on?The thing about Griffin was that he had become an MEP, Bruce says. “If Robinson hasn’t won representation through a national election, then the question wouldn’t arise.”The audience appetite for something of a political ruck, however, appears to have sharpened, ingrained by the winner-takes-all mentality of first past the post, and a mistrust of coalition and compromise. Since about the time Question Time first appeared on our screens, it could be argued that we have increased the demand for politicians to entertain us, to be colourful rather than competent. We are, you might say, now reaping that particular whirlwind.The present prime minister was a regular fixture on Dimbleby’s Question Time panels. He played a characteristic part in one of the most memorable exchanges on the programme, when the panel debated the award of a knighthood to Salman Rushdie in 2007. Dame Shirley Williams, surprisingly and to her discredit, suggested that the honour was ill judged since it risked insulting some Muslim groups and inflaming tensions. The late Christopher Hitchens made a robust defence of the novelist’s right to offend, with a righteous erudition rarely heard on British TV. When Johnson’s turn came, he inevitably ducked that nuanced and principled argument, and instead mumbled a crowd-pleasing wish that the knighthood had gone to an English novelist with “a grasp of plot and character”: Dick Francis was his suggestion.One result of that ongoing desire for politicians that look for easy applause, rather than confronting hard choices, is a sense of debate as a zero-sum game, rather than an attempt to find consensus. The clips that trend on Twitter from Question Time are often prefaced by the language of cage fighting: “Watch X get owned by Y” “Y tears Z a new one”. The clips are followed by dialogue in which people shout intemperately on Twitter about Question Time being unwatchable because it reflects a nation in which people shout intemperately.It is hard to see that temper cooling. Does Bruce imagine that she might soon have to start programmes by asking everyone to play nicely?“I don’t want to be the schoolmarm. You just have to sense the feeling in the room. We had one guy who became so irate he stood up and started haranguing one of the panellists. I had to tell him to sit down, which sounded a little odd.”The other armchair Question Time sport is the opportunity is provides for the current national pastime of bias-hunting. It is good fodder for those who would rather put our current political impasse down to a misjudged sneer from John Humphrys on the Today programme, or an answer cut short by Fiona Bruce, than to three decades of rising inequality and underinvestment in infrastructure and skills. The BBC has been found wanting in various ways in reporting our political meltdown, but those who, like the Labour peer Andrew Adonis, call it “the Brexit Broadcasting Corporation”, or conversely, along with Nigel Farage, characterise it as “the enemy” should be careful what they wish for.“The BBC value I aspire to represent on Question Time is simply impartiality,” Bruce says. “From what I can tell on social media people think the programme is too rightwing. And when you look at the audience research we get people thinking it is too leftwing. I can only hope we fall between those two and plot a course down the middle.”The problem is that the middle ground no longer appears to exist, even as a widely held aspiration. Bruce can look like an easy target for those political forces that want to suggest the BBC is the voice of a supposed metropolitan elite. She has homes in Hampstead and Oxfordshire, and has been known to write about nice holidays for the . I wonder if she thinks the scrutiny of the corporation in general and Question Time in particular has been helped or hindered by publishing presenters’ and journalists’ salaries? (Bruce’s was reportedly between £350,000 and £400,000 before she accepted the Question Time job.)“I think it’s a good thing,” she says. “I think it has been helpful for women. And I think: why not?”Does she not think average earners might look at those numbers and think: why on earth are taxpayers paying TV presenters four times as much as the prime minister?“I can understand that. And I feel incredibly lucky to be doing the jobs I do and be remunerated as I am.”Does she see any danger of becoming too far removed from the people she is giving voice to, the audience and the viewers?“I don’t think that. But I also think that is partly why I cannot see myself becoming the person who goes to Westminster parties and so on. I see my role on the programme as helping the audience get their answers.”You believe Bruce when she says she has the will to escape from work, though it can be all-encompassing. “I go and walk the dog or go horse-riding or whatever it is in the great outdoors and that, for me, is a switch-off,” she says. “My daughter does not like to talk about politics, though my son does, but that means we talk about it at home less than we might. I try not to look at my phone. There was a period where I had Trump’s tweets coming up and that got in my head, so I stopped. But these last couple of weeks it has been impossible, obviously. We had people round for dinner at the weekend, and it was all dominated by Amber Rudd’s resigning.”We talk a little about the history of Question Time. The time David Steel and David Owen proposed their political pact on air and the time there was a marriage proposal in the audience and an awful delay before a “yes”.“It is clear the tenor of it has changed so much,” she says. “When Jilly Cooper was on she used to bring champagne and smoked salmon for everyone. Then again, someone once threw a bread roll at Tony Blair at the end of the show and we haven’t had that yet.” If the show holds a mirror up to Britain, what does it currently look like from where she is sitting?“We are just so angry,” she says. “And people feel so let down and not listened to and unrepresented, on both sides. It is not a happy country at all at the moment.”Does she not fear, whatever madness happens in the coming months, that if she sits there for another five years, or 10 years, every show is going to be about Brexit and its consequences?She winces at the thought. “That can’t happen can it? Surely years of negotiating the minutiae of trade deals behind closed doors will not be the same?”It only won’t be the same, I suggest, if we belatedly rediscover the arts of consensus, listening, taking on board expert knowledge, and learning how to disagree better. Bruce fervently believes that Question Time has a role to play in that, and also in helping the nation to plot a course through the current mess.I admire her confidence. Of all the mail and reaction she has had over these last nine months, I ask, has she received a single letter or tweet or email from someone saying: ‘Thank you to Question Time for helping me to see things in a different light and for changing my view on this subject?’”She laughs at the idea. “What do you think?” she says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98c46cd21bf3ca6809b95fe63421168d80f3b23d/0_90_1796_1078/master/1796.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f84ada292f01e70ee7b2df6be2d239d0","title":"the last rickshaws of kolkata in pictures","story":"Kolkata, one of Asia’s great melting pots, is the last place on Earth where rickshaw wallahs still haul people and goods through narrow lanes.

And seeing the way our politics are going, moderation and the application of common sense seems to me to be very valuable.”Around 700 people gathered at the Ulster Hall on Saturday for the event hosted by former Labour party adviser Alastair Campbell.Among the speakers was Alliance Party leader Naomi Long MEP, Green Party NI leader Clare Bailey MLA, and SDLP MLA Claire Hanna.Ms Long reminded the audience that the DUP do not speak for the majority of people in the North who she says want no deal off the table.“Threatening to harm yourself is no negotiation tactic,” she said.Ms Bailey said Northern Ireland was “ignored” in the lead up to the 2016 EU membership referendum, that the leave campaign broke electoral law, lied and spread misinformation.Ms Hanna said the people wanted “stability and our future back”.“We can end austerity, or we can do Brexit but we can definitely no do both,” she said.During a panel discussion among business leaders entrepreneur Bill Wolsey said he had been appalled by the attitude displayed among some to foreign nationals.He said people from other countries have\u0026nbsp“enriched our society” and welcoming people was “something to be proud of”.Defending democracyMr Wolsey said he had been offended by comments made by British prime minister Boris Johnson that he would rather “die in a ditch” than ask for a Brexit delay.He said after 40 years of violence in the North his mind had been “warped” and he thought at the time: “I wish he would come over here, because a couple of boys would put him to the test”, which was met by laughter from the audience.He added that the language used by Mr Johnson was offensive to people in the North, that it was “ludicrous” and that having liberal views was “something you should be proud of”.Mr Wolsey emphasised that defending democracy was essential.“Millions of people died in the ditch for that one,” he said.On a panel for under 25s, a young woman from the Our Future Our Choice campaign group told the audience regarding Brexit, “The children of the peace process deserve better than this”.A handful of protesters stood outside the event.Among them was Raymond Stuart from South Antrim, who wore a Make America Great Again cap and carried a Leave Means Leave placard.He said Mr Grieve and Mr Campbell were not welcome in Belfast “because they have rejected the will of the British people, the 17.4m who voted to leave”.Mr Stuart said he supported Mr Johnson, that he wasn’t sure if the prime minister would betray the DUP and that he wanted him to “stand firm”.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Jeff OversBBCPA Wire.Two of Boris Johnson’s senior ministers have talked up the possibility of securing a Brexit deal through some ergence on the rules in Northern Ireland, as the government’s rhetoric showed fresh signs of shifting ahead of crucial talks.With Mr Johnson due to meet Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission president, on Monday, his Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay and home secretary Priti Patel accepted the Irish border was likely to be a key to any potential agreement.Following weeks of government discussion about preparedness for a no-deal departure, both ministers said the overwhelming focus was leaving with an agreement.“The entire machinery of government, now, is focused on getting that deal and is planning and preparing to leave on October 31st with a deal,” Ms Patel told BBC1’s Andrew Marr Show.With Mr Johnson vehemently committed to leaving the EU on that date, but bound by law to seeking an extension if a deal is not in place by the time of the European Council summit on October 17th, there has been intense focus on ways he could find a plan acceptable to Brussels but which would not be seen by Conservative MPs as a betrayal.Mr Johnson is set to tell Mr Juncker that he will defy the new act of parliament and refuse to discuss or accept any offer to extend the UK’s membership even if a Brexit deal cannot be agreed.Frontier checksThis has centred on ways to allow Northern Ireland to stay converged on some regulatory and standards border issues with the Republic of Ireland, preventing frontier checks while not having a full customs border in the Irish Sea.Speaking to Sky’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme, Mr Barclay said it was important to get the consent of all political sides in Northern Ireland, but also to abide by the Belfast Agreement, which could potentially be breached by a hard Irish border.“It is important we move forwards with the consent of both sides of the community in Northern Ireland,” said Mr Barclay, who is this week due to meet the EU’s chief negotiatior, Michel Barnier. “That’s very much part of the thinking and part of the consultations that we’re having.”He insisted there had been definite progress in finding a successful compromise. “There has been detailed technical talks led by David Frost, the prime minister’s Europe adviser. They have been meeting with Michel Barnier’s team,” he said. “The prime minister will be seeing President Juncker tomorrow, I’ll be meeting with Michel Barnier tomorrow, so there’s extensive talks been happening both at a technical level but also at a political level. So there has been a huge amount of work going on behind the scenes. We can see a landing zone in terms of a future deal but there is significant work still to do.”Mr Johnson is committed to getting rid of the backstop, the guarantee central to Theresa May’s rejected deal in which the UK would effectively stay within the EU’s customs union if no other solution for the Irish border could be reached before the end of a post-exit transition period.DivergenceAnother option would be a backstop just for Northern Ireland, but the government has rejected this. Mr Barclay said while it was vital for the UK to “leave as a whole”, some ergence already existed between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.“We can get into those details as part of the talks. But that is different from the principle of the backstop, and the backstop needs to go,” he said.Speaking later, Ms Patel was more cautious, saying she did not want to “pre-empt” the talks, but accepted the border issue had moved on from the backstop in terms of discussions with the EU.“The reality is we have to deal with the backstop issue, and people said, under the Theresa May deal, that the withdrawal agreement would never be considered or looked at again, and neither would the political declaration,” she said.“We are in different territory right now, so it’s no point arguing about the past. We are moving forward now as a government, collectively, focused on leaving but leaving with a deal.”She added: “We have to leave and we have to leave with a deal on 31 October, and there’s no point right now trying to prejudge the discussions that are taking place.” - Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: South Bend Tribune via APMore than 2,000 medically preserved foetal remains have been found at the Illinois home of a former Indiana abortion clinic doctor who died last week, authorities said.The Will County Sheriff’s Office said in a news release that a lawyer for Dr Ulrich Klopfer’s family contacted the coroner’s office on Thursday about possible foetal remains being found at the home in an unincorporated part of Will County in northeastern Illinois.The sheriff’s office said authorities found 2,246 preserved foetal remains, but there’s no evidence medical procedures were performed at the home.The coroner’s office took possession of the remains. An investigation is under way.Dr Klopfer, who died on September 3th, was a long-time doctor at an abortion clinic in South Bend, Indiana.It closed after the state revoked the clinic’s licence in 2015. The Indiana State Department of Health had previously issued complaints against the clinic, accusing it of lacking a registry of patients, policies regarding medical abortion, and a governing body to determine policies.State-mandated educationThe state agency also accused the clinic of failing to document that patients get state-mandated education at least 18 hours before an abortion.Dr Klopfer was believed to be Indiana’s most prolific abortion doctor, with thousands of procedures performed in multiple Indiana counties over several decades, the South Bend Tribune reported.Mike Fichter, the president of Indiana Right to Life, said in a statement that “we are horrified” by the discovery of the foetal remains at Dr Klopfer’s Illinois residence.He called for Indiana authorities to help determine whether those remains have any connection to abortion operations in Indiana.“These sickening reports underscore why the abortion industry must be held to the highest scrutiny,” Mr Fichter said in the statement.Dr Klopfer’s licence was suspended by Indiana’s Medical Licensing Board in November 2016 after the panel found a number of violations, including a failure to ensure that qualified staff was present when patients received or recovered from medications given before and during abortion procedures.Dr Klopfer was no longer practising by that time, but he told the panel he had never lost a patient in 43 years of doing abortions and that he hoped to eventually re-open his clinics.In June 2014, Dr Klopfer was charged in St Joseph County, Indiana, for failure to file a timely public report.He was accused of waiting months to report an abortion he provided to a 13-year-old girl in South Bend.‘Sickening beyond words’Republican US representative Jackie Walorski called the discovery of the foetal remains “sickening beyond words” in a statement released by her office.“He was responsible for thousands of abortions in Indiana, and his careless treatment of human remains is an outrage,” she said in her statement.In May, the US Supreme Court upheld an Indiana law requiring the burial or cremation of foetal remains following abortions in the state.That law was signed by US vice president Mike Pence in 2016 when he was Indiana’s governor, but it was the subject of legal challenges.The Indiana State Department of Health, which oversees abortion clinic regulation, has integrated that law’s provisions into the agency’s existing licensing process.Prior to the ruling, Indiana clinics could turn over foetal remains to processors who handle the disposal of human tissues or other medical material by incineration. – PA"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons september 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter -

place, with just over $1 billion (£802 million) worth of cryptocurrency transferred between accounts.The single transaction of 94,504 bitcoins represents around 0.5 per cent of all bitcoins currently in existence, and it\u0026nbsphas left analysts confused by who made it and for what purpose.The semi-anonymous nature of bitcoin means it is possible to view the transfer on its blockchain – the public ledger that records transactions – but it is not possible to know who made it.Such a large amount of bitcoin has the potential to crash the cryptocurrency market if it is cashed in for fiat currency. Big sell offs in the past have resulted in flash crashes, with bitcoin losing almost $1,000 from its value in the space of just 24 hours in September 2018 as a result of a major trade.“Since the advent of bitcoin futures in early 2018, we are now seeing massive market manipulation and suppression by whales and experienced futures traders,” Phillip Nunn, chief executive officer at Wealth Chain Capital, told\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbspat the time.Created with Sketch.Bitcoin\u0027s volatile history in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.18 Satoshi Nakamoto creates the first bitcoin block in 2009On 3 January, 2009, the genesis block of bitcoin appeared.

When they first spotted it, they thought they had accidentally looked a star – but further research has shown that the black hole is in fact showing behaviour that astronomers had never expected.“We have never seen anything like this in the 24 years we have studied the supermassive black hole,” said Andrea\u0026nbspGhez, UCLA professor of physics and astronomy and a co-senior author of the research. “It’s usually a pretty quiet, wimpy black hole on a diet.We don’t know what is driving this big feast.”Scientists looked through observations taken since 2003, from observatories in Hawaii and Chile. They noticed that on 13 May, the back hole was lit up twice as bright as had ever been before – and it continued to turn incredibly bright on two other nights this year.Created with Sketch.Best Nasa pictures of the month - August 2019 Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.When stars like the Sun grow advanced in age, they expand and glow red.

As such, it could be just the beginning in a major change in the activity of the black hole.“The big question is whether the black hole is entering a new phase — for example if the spigot has been turned up and the rate of gas falling down the black hole ‘drain’ has increased for an extended period — or whether we have just seen the fireworks from a few unusual blobs of gas falling in,” said Mark Morris, UCLA professor of physics and astronomy and the author of a paper describing the discovery..Scientists will now keep looking at the area and hope that new images can help resolve that question. That could in turn help us understand how black holes grow and the kinds of effects they have on the galaxy and the larger universe.The brightening could have come from the fact that a star was seen going very close to the black hole in summer last year, or that another mysterious object known as G2 had its outer layer ripped off when it passed by in 2014. It might also be the result of big asteroids passing near the black hole, scientists said.The black hole poses no danger to life on Earth. It is 26,000 light years away, and the radiation coming out of it would need to be 10 billion times brighter to have any effect here.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The former London mayor and foreign secretary won his leadership bid by beating Jeremy Hunt in the Tory race the day before. Theresa May stepped down following her resignation as Conservative Party leader on 7 June.“It’s clearly about a reduction in no-deal risk being perceived,” said Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets. He noted that shorting, or betting against, sterling has become a very “crowded” – and hence less attractive – trade, prompting traders to bet the other way which also lifted the currency.Last week MPs passed a law preventing a no-deal Brexit on 31 October and refused to grant Boris Johnson an early general election, which he hoped would give him a majority in parliament.But the chances of leaving with an exit agreement are also uncertain as the only deal agreed with the EU after two years of talks has been rejected by Britain’s parliament three times.Since the vote to leave the EU, the pound has lost 17 per cent against the dollar and almost 15 per cent against the euro. \u0026nbspAdditional reporting by ReutersOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Somewhat ironically, it appears under a heading indicating that it will allow the phone to be more precise.Which new iPhone should you buy? 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max comparedThe new Apple-designed U1 chip uses Ultra Wideband technology for spatial awareness – allowing iPhone 11 Pro to precisely locate other U1-equipped Apple devices, it reads. It\u0027s like adding another sense to iPhone, and it\u0027s going to lead to amazing new capabilities.Apple is already rumoured to be working on small tracking devices that could be added to objects to allow them to be found more easily. The phone could presumably seek out those devices – telling you not only how far away your keys are, for instance, but being able to work out which of your chairs they have fallen into, and where exactly they are.The chip could also presumably help with Apple\u0027s plans for augmented reality features. That requires detailed information about the nearby environment, which the chip could presumably help with.The chip is only found on the more expensive iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max, and not the cheaper iPhone 11.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.21. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.423 Avengers: Age of Ultron20. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.19. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.18. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 723 s of the Galaxy Vol 217. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.16. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.15. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1023 Ant-Man and the Wasp14. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.13. What comes after the end? It’s the question that was hanging over the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since the release of Avengers: Endgame was sold to us as the ultimate, cumulative chapter in a series of 22 interconnected films. And yet, while Far From Home is distinctly mid-level Marvel fare, there’s a lot to be said for the fact it isn’t crushed under the weight of its own ambitions. It feels comfortably like the end of a chapter, the beginning of a new one, an epilogue, and a palate cleanser all at once. It also works perfectly well as a film about Spider-Man.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2223 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.23. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22.

While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.13. What comes after the end? It’s the question that was hanging over the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since the release of Avengers: Endgame was sold to us as the ultimate, cumulative chapter in a series of 22 interconnected films. And yet, while Far From Home is distinctly mid-level Marvel fare, there’s a lot to be said for the fact it isn’t crushed under the weight of its own ambitions. It feels comfortably like the end of a chapter, the beginning of a new one, an epilogue, and a palate cleanser all at once. It also works perfectly well as a film about Spider-Man.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2223 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.The deleted scene, below, has caused speculation that the X-Men could join the Marvel Cinematic Universe, following Disney’s acquisition of 20th Century Fox, which has the rights to the franchise.The footage was released shortly after Avengers: Endgame director Joe Russo said Spider-Man leaving the MCU was a tragic mistake.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He noted that shorting, or betting against, sterling has become a very “crowded” – and hence less attractive – trade, prompting traders to bet the other way which also lifted the currency.Last week MPs passed a law preventing a no-deal Brexit on 31 October and refused to grant Boris Johnson an early general election, which he hoped would give him a majority in parliament.But the chances of leaving with an exit agreement are also uncertain as the only deal agreed with the EU after two years of talks has been rejected by Britain’s parliament three times.Since the vote to leave the EU, the pound has lost 17 per cent against the dollar and almost 15 per cent against the euro. \u0026nbspAdditional reporting by ReutersOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The album cover happened by chance – after hanging out on another shoot a few weeks later, Lane heard the band’s art director hassling them to choose an album cover. He’d brought his portfolio with him, which included the now-infamous “ass shot”.230 29) The Notorious BIG – Ready to DieBiggie Smalls picked a baby resembling himself to star on the cover of his debut Ready to Die. By doing so, he summed up the album’s autobiographical content, which begins with childhood and closes with death. He also uses the notion of childhood innocence to foreshadow how our surroundings can have a lasting impact.It might not be the quintessential David Bowie album, or the one that introduced fans to Starman. But the face staring back at you from this particular album cover is, undeniably, the most recognisable Bowie look: red mullet a gaunt, sombre expression and that famous lightning bolt across his face.One of the greatest debut albums – and arguably the best hip hop record – of all time has a fittingly arresting cover image. A photo of a seven-year-old Nas was superimposed over Danny Clinch’s snapshot of one of the housing projects in the New York rapper’s native Queensbridge. Designed by Aimee Macauley, it was intended to reflect how the projects used to be Nas’s entire world, “until I educated myself to see there’s more out there”. But Nas was also inviting you to see through his eyes and into those very projects where he grew up, and feel immersed in that world via the power of his storytelling.Years after its release, Kate Bush noted how The Dreaming was deemed by many to be her “she’s gone mad” album. Its multiple, disparate narratives and metamorphic production intertwine with movie influences, particularly music hall crime capers of Houdini’s era. On the sepia-toned album cover, Bush plays the role of the escapist’s wife, looking to the distance, rather than at his face, as though trying to contact him via a different medium than mere speech. The way she holds his face in her hands gives her an additional, mesmerising power and conjures the old-world, eccentric mysticism with which she was – and still is – associated.Photographer Michael Spencer Jones had a task on his hands organising Oasis for what is indisputably their best album cover. It was different to what the band originally envisioned – Noel Gallagher had spotted a photo of the Beatles sat round a coffee in Japan, so thought Oasis could be photographed at the dining table of guitarist Bonehead’s house in Manchester. Jones didn’t see this working, so spread the members around Bonehead’s living room instead, and asked them to bring objects that were personal to them for decoration. Noel liked Jones’s idea of hanging an inflatable globe (brought by one of the roadies) from the ceiling. “Yeah, global dominance,” he said. Soon after the album’s release, that’s exactly what happened.Andy Warhol conceived the idea of a vinyl cover with working zipper that would reveal a pair of white briefs beneath the bulging jeans of a male model, who has to this day never been identified. Many fans assumed it was Mick Jagger, but people working on the shoot said several models were photographed and Warhol never revealed which one was used. It represented what the Rolling Stones quickly became famous for: an edgy, hyper-sexual kind of swagger.German painter Mati Klarwein – who also created Santana’s artwork for Abraxas – was behind this gatefold cover that served as an embodiment of Davis’s creative manifesto. The surreal and complex renderings mirror what Davis does with the music itself challenging traditional notions of structure and juxtaposing concepts of passivity and aggressiveness, anger and love.930 22) ACDC – Back in BlackBack in Black’s all-black cover design fit the mood of a band emerging from dark times. In the wake of the death of vocalist Bon Scott, ACDC had tracked down Brian Johnson, whom Scott had previously mentioned to the band. Certain people at their record label, Atlantic, weren’t so keen on the cover, but the band were insistent: it was a memorial to Scott. And now one of the most instantly recognisable and best-loved album covers in rock history.Visually striking and symbolic of what Debbie Harry was doing both as a woman and an artist in the music industry, Parallel Lines’ cover was shot by photographer Edo Bertoglio. It was apparently rejected by the band but later chosen by their manager, Peter Leeds. The juxtaposition between the band, who beam in their matching dress suits like a bunch of schoolboys at their senior prom, and Harry, who stands defiant in her white dress, hands on hips, is wonderful. “I’m not impressed,” her stance seems to say. “Try harder.”Dylan walks arm-in-arm with then-girlfriend and muse Suze Rotolo through the West Village in freezing New York, February 1963. Rotolo described the circumstances to the New York Times in 2008: “He wore a very thin jacket, because image was all. Our apartment was always cold, so I had a sweater on, plus I borrowed one of his big, bulky sweaters. On top of that I put on a coat. So I felt like an Italian sausage. Every time I look at that picture, I think I look fat.” Yet her memoir, A Freewheelin’ Time, also noted the cover’s significance, how it “influenced the look of album covers precisely because of its casual down-home spontaneity and sensibility”.Led Zeppelin couldn’t have picked a better image to serve as a visual introduction to their fans. It’s an easy tactic – using a photo from a real-life tragedy, in this case the Hinderburg disaster, for shock factor. But it worked, and the cover went on to become one of the most indelible images in rock music.1330 18) Never Mind the Bollocks – Here’s the Sex Pistols“The album will last. The sleeve may not,” said the adverts for the Sex Pistols’ first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks – Here’s the Sex Pistols. They’d caused nationwide uproar for swearing on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from a number of live venues in England. Using the word “bollocks” on the front of their artwork caused instant censorship, and more controversy that would only benefit its performance. Despite many major retailers refusing to sell it, the album debuted at number one on the UK album charts. Today, it is arguably the most recognisable punk album cover in music history.For a limited time, The Roots’ Grammy-nominated album Things Fall Apart was available with five different covers, which reflected each of the world’s “greatest turmoils”. The most enduring was a photograph taken during a Civil Rights Movement-era riot – a stark black and white image showing riot police as they chase two terrified black teenagers.Yes, Dark Side of the Moon, with Storm Thorgerson\u0027s geometric design, is the most iconic of Pink Floyd covers. But the shot he conceived for Wish You Were Here – taken by Aubrey ‘Po’ Powell – is by far the more visceral. It shows two businessmen shaking hands, with one of them on fire, and to the band it represented the fear of revealing your true feelings for fear of “getting burnt”. Two stuntmen were involved, with one (Ronnie Rondell Jr) dressed in a fire-retardant outfit covered by a business suit, and his head protected by a hood, covered beneath a wig. Unfortunately, high winds meant he lost his moustache and eyebrows to the flames. Hopefully he felt the resulting shot was worth it. Fans definitely think so.Just two of Fleetwood Mac’s then-five members appear on the cover of their best-selling and arguably greatest album. Stevie Nicks and Mick Fleetwood’s legs are entwined, which serves as a pretty good metaphor for the entanglement between band members that resulted in so many of the record’s lyrical back-and-forths. And really it’s just a gorgeous, classic image, photographed and conceived by Herbert W Worthington with the band, and designed by Desmond Strobel.The instantly iconic cover of It’s Blitz! shows little but says a lot. There’s a sense of female defiance in showing the woman’s hand, nails in red polish, crushing the egg, a symbol of fertility. It also embodies what the Yeah Yeah Yeahs did on this album, which is take traditional sounds, equipment and ideas and scramble them into something completely subversive.This shot was taken by celebrated photographer Herb Ritts, who later teamed up with Madonna for the “Like a Prayer” and “You Can Dance” covers. It is one of her most recognisable images, inspired in part by Andy Warhol’s pop art and also by the iconography of Madonna’s idol Marilyn Monroe. Here, she invites fans to make the immediate connection between pop art and commercial value, making her the first to exploit the late Eighties concept of pop artist as brand.The Clash paid tribute to Elvis Presley by mimicking the pink and green lettering from his 1956 self-titled album. Yet the image, one of the most iconic in rock history, blows that version of rock and roll to kingdom come: everything “safe” that the King had offered was replaced by Pennie Smith’s photograph of “the ultimate rock’n’roll moment – total loss of control”. Bassist Paul Simonon later told Fender that he’d smashed his guitar out of frustration with bouncers for not letting fans stand up from their seats at the Palladium in New York City. The captured moment is visceral, dangerous and anti-establishment – just like The Clash.Elvis Presley appears mid-belt on the cover of his self-titled album, clearly performing one of those iconic vocal whoops. It’s a visual introduction to rock’n’roll for his unsuspecting American audience, done 20 years before The Clash would replicate that classic pink and green lettering to do the same for their British fans.Six guys stare down toward the ground, one pointing a handgun right at the viewer. This is the cover art for Straight Outta Compton, the pioneering debut by NWA. The photographer was a 28-year-old white guy, Eric Poppleton, who was struggling to make ends meet after graduating from art school. He and his art director Kevin Hosman spent a day following the guys around alleys in LA, until Poppleton found a spot where he got on the ground and asked NWA’s members to stand over him, with one holding “what was hopefully an unloaded” gun. He had no idea the photograph would become one of the most iconic images in gangsta rap. Poppleton would go on to shoot four other NWA album covers.2230 9) Bruce Springsteen – Born in the USAThe Boss tells you everything you need to know about him with one image. An epitome of the blue collar American, Springsteen’s seventh album cover was shot by Annie Leibowitz and shows the artist’s from behind, dressed in worn blue jeans and a simple white t-shirt, with a red cap hanging out of the back pocket after a long day’s grind. “We took a lot of different types of pictures,” said Springsteen, “and in the end, the picture of my ass looked better than the picture of my face.” Combined with the American flag in the background, the cover parallels the themes of Springsteen’s music.An album cover that would inspire future generations of bands to slouch moodily against brick walls. The Ramones were near-impossible to gather together for a posed photograph, but Robert Bayley – a photographer for Punk magazine, managed to get a shot that captured the band perfectly. Wearing ripped jeans and leather jackets, they stare blankly at the camera through sunglasses, or fringes that half-conceal their eyes.Few album covers can profess to have literally stopped traffic, and it’s testament to the iconic status of Abbey Road’s artwork that thousands of fans have attempted to recreate it. The band, and photographer Iain McMillan, had just 10 minutes to get the shot, which was taken from a step-ladder while a police officer held up traffic behind the scenes. Six photos were taken, which McCartney later examined with a magnifying glass before making his decision.Before he tried to “break the internet” with a nude Kim Kardashian on the cover of Paper magazine, Jean-Paul Goude took some of the most memorable images of the Eighties for Grace Jones’s album Island Life. She appears on the cover in what looks like an impossible pose it is, in fact, a composite of her in different positions, cut and pasted together for one of the most striking images in music history.2630 5) The Velvet Underground and Nico – The Velvet Underground and NicoLike the working zipper of The Rolling Stones’ Sticky Fingers, early versions of The Velvet Underground and Nico asked the owner to “Peel slowly and see”, upon which they’d peel the banana skin to reveal a flesh-coloured banana beneath. MGM was happy to fork out for the additional costs of manufacturing the vinyl, with the assumption that its ties to Warhol would help boost sales. It’s one of very few albums where the person behind the album art, rather than the band themselves or the album title, are named on the cover.The cover art for Joy Division’s debut album was designed by Peter Saville, who had previously created posters for Manchester’s Factor Club in the late Seventies. The chosen image, which was picked by Bernard Sumner, is based on radio waves from pulsar CP 1919 – from the Cambridge Encyclopaedia of Astronomy. “The duochrome Peter Saville cover of this first Joy Division album speaks volumes,” Susie Goldring said in a review for BBC Online. “Its white on black lines reflect a pulse of power, a surge of bass, and raw angst. If the cover doesn\u0027t draw you in, the music will.With its star-studded cast and bold colour scheme, the cover of Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band came to define artist Peter Blake and also The Beatles themselves. There are 88 figures in all, including the band themselves, on a set photographed by Michael Cooper. Blake collected a list of names from three of the four Beatles. The list included Tony Curtis, Marilyn Monroe, Aubrey Beardsley, Oscar Wilde, and even Adolf Hitler (requested by John Lennon, and hidden behind other figures). If you bought the record, Blake later said, “you also bought a piece of art on exactly the level that I was aiming for”.Critic Camille Paglia once suggested that Robert Mapplethorpe’s photo of his former lover, friend and collaborator Patti Smith is the greatest ever taken of a woman, and seeing it, you feel inclined to agree. The godmother of punk herself said she thought she looked like Frank Sinatra, dressed in a crisp white shirt with a black ribbon around her neck. A black jacket with a horse brooch on the lapel is slung casually over her shoulder.  “The only rule we had was, Robert told me if I wore a white shirt, not to wear a dirty one,” Smith told NPR in 2010. “I got my favourite ribbon and my favourite jacket, and he took about 12 pictures. By the eighth one he said, \u0027I got it\u0027.”Photographer Colin Lane met the Strokes in early 2001, after being commissioned to shoot them for The Face magazine. The album cover happened by chance – after hanging out on another shoot a few weeks later, Lane heard the band’s art director hassling them to choose an album cover. He’d brought his portfolio with him, which included the now-infamous “ass shot”.230 29) The Notorious BIG – Ready to DieBiggie Smalls picked a baby resembling himself to star on the cover of his debut Ready to Die. By doing so, he summed up the album’s autobiographical content, which begins with childhood and closes with death.

But the face staring back at you from this particular album cover is, undeniably, the most recognisable Bowie look: red mullet a gaunt, sombre expression and that famous lightning bolt across his face.One of the greatest debut albums – and arguably the best hip hop record – of all time has a fittingly arresting cover image.

Bassist Paul Simonon later told Fender that he’d smashed his guitar out of frustration with bouncers for not letting fans stand up from their seats at the Palladium in New York City. The captured moment is visceral, dangerous and anti-establishment – just like The Clash.Elvis Presley appears mid-belt on the cover of his self-titled album, clearly performing one of those iconic vocal whoops. It’s a visual introduction to rock’n’roll for his unsuspecting American audience, done 20 years before The Clash would replicate that classic pink and green lettering to do the same for their British fans.Six guys stare down toward the ground, one pointing a handgun right at the viewer. This is the cover art for Straight Outta Compton, the pioneering debut by NWA. The photographer was a 28-year-old white guy, Eric Poppleton, who was struggling to make ends meet after graduating from art school. He and his art director Kevin Hosman spent a day following the guys around alleys in LA, until Poppleton found a spot where he got on the ground and asked NWA’s members to stand over him, with one holding “what was hopefully an unloaded” gun. He had no idea the photograph would become one of the most iconic images in gangsta rap. Poppleton would go on to shoot four other NWA album covers.2230 9) Bruce Springsteen – Born in the USAThe Boss tells you everything you need to know about him with one image. An epitome of the blue collar American, Springsteen’s seventh album cover was shot by Annie Leibowitz and shows the artist’s from behind, dressed in worn blue jeans and a simple white t-shirt, with a red cap hanging out of the back pocket after a long day’s grind. “We took a lot of different types of pictures,” said Springsteen, “and in the end, the picture of my ass looked better than the picture of my face.” Combined with the American flag in the background, the cover parallels the themes of Springsteen’s music.An album cover that would inspire future generations of bands to slouch moodily against brick walls. The Ramones were near-impossible to gather together for a posed photograph, but Robert Bayley – a photographer for Punk magazine, managed to get a shot that captured the band perfectly. Wearing ripped jeans and leather jackets, they stare blankly at the camera through sunglasses, or fringes that half-conceal their eyes.Few album covers can profess to have literally stopped traffic, and it’s testament to the iconic status of Abbey Road’s artwork that thousands of fans have attempted to recreate it. The band, and photographer Iain McMillan, had just 10 minutes to get the shot, which was taken from a step-ladder while a police officer held up traffic behind the scenes. Six photos were taken, which McCartney later examined with a magnifying glass before making his decision.Before he tried to “break the internet” with a nude Kim Kardashian on the cover of Paper magazine, Jean-Paul Goude took some of the most memorable images of the Eighties for Grace Jones’s album Island Life. She appears on the cover in what looks like an impossible pose it is, in fact, a composite of her in different positions, cut and pasted together for one of the most striking images in music history.2630 5) The Velvet Underground and Nico – The Velvet Underground and NicoLike the working zipper of The Rolling Stones’ Sticky Fingers, early versions of The Velvet Underground and Nico asked the owner to “Peel slowly and see”, upon which they’d peel the banana skin to reveal a flesh-coloured banana beneath. MGM was happy to fork out for the additional costs of manufacturing the vinyl, with the assumption that its ties to Warhol would help boost sales. It’s one of very few albums where the person behind the album art, rather than the band themselves or the album title, are named on the cover.The cover art for Joy Division’s debut album was designed by Peter Saville, who had previously created posters for Manchester’s Factor Club in the late Seventies. The chosen image, which was picked by Bernard Sumner, is based on radio waves from pulsar CP 1919 – from the Cambridge Encyclopaedia of Astronomy. “The duochrome Peter Saville cover of this first Joy Division album speaks volumes,” Susie Goldring said in a review for BBC Online. “Its white on black lines reflect a pulse of power, a surge of bass, and raw angst. If the cover doesn\u0027t draw you in, the music will.With its star-studded cast and bold colour scheme, the cover of Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band came to define artist Peter Blake and also The Beatles themselves. There are 88 figures in all, including the band themselves, on a set photographed by Michael Cooper. Blake collected a list of names from three of the four Beatles. The list included Tony Curtis, Marilyn Monroe, Aubrey Beardsley, Oscar Wilde, and even Adolf Hitler (requested by John Lennon, and hidden behind other figures). If you bought the record, Blake later said, “you also bought a piece of art on exactly the level that I was aiming for”.Critic Camille Paglia once suggested that Robert Mapplethorpe’s photo of his former lover, friend and collaborator Patti Smith is the greatest ever taken of a woman, and seeing it, you feel inclined to agree. The godmother of punk herself said she thought she looked like Frank Sinatra, dressed in a crisp white shirt with a black ribbon around her neck. A black jacket with a horse brooch on the lapel is slung casually over her shoulder.  “The only rule we had was, Robert told me if I wore a white shirt, not to wear a dirty one,” Smith told NPR in 2010. “I got my favourite ribbon and my favourite jacket, and he took about 12 pictures. By the eighth one he said, \u0027I got it\u0027.”Brown, whose stage name is Mel B,\u0026nbspalso recently announced she has plans to reunite the full Spice Girls lineup for the Glastonbury Festival‘s 50th anniversary next year.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Ireland were bowled out for 38 in their second innings in just 15.4 overs - the second lowest total in Test match historyOn the question of whether a border poll should be permitted after Brexit to allow Northern Ireland to decide whether to remain in the UK or join the Republic, the result was an even starker 52 per cent for allowing a referendum against just 19 per cent for blocking it. When don’t knows are removed the margin is 73-27.Lord Hain said: “Brexit, especially a hard Brexit, is a green light to Scottish nationalists to push for a referendum, and similarly for Irish republicans.“I’ve always been fearful that Brexit would make the break-up of the UK more likely, and this poll confirms it. We’ve already seen in other surveys that Tory Leave voters want Brexit even if it means Scotland and Northern Ireland leaving the UK.”Nicola Sturgeon has said she intends to table a formal request before Christmas for the power to stage a new referendum, and the issue is set to be a central plank of the SNP’s campaign in the expected snap election.Corbyn backs fresh Scottish independence referendum in coming yearsHow could Scotland secure a second independence referendum?Brexit paves way for Scottish independence, Sturgeon saysRees Mogg says Scotland not due independence referendum for 20 yearsBut Mr Johnson said during a visit to Scotland that he did not see why he should “go back” on the result of the 2014 referendum, which delivered a 55-45 per cent margin in favour of staying in the UK.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Throughout the Brexit process we have been completely ignored. The past three years have underlined the rising and unsustainable cost to Scotland of not being independent.“It is no wonder that support for independence is at record levels. The people of Scotland deserve the choice of a better future than the Brexit Britain being imposed upon us against our will.”The BMG study did not include the views of\u0026nbsppeople in\u0026nbspNorthern Ireland, but a recent survey by pollster Lord Ashcroft found the outcome of a border poll would be on a knife-edge, with 45 per cent saying they would vote to stay in the UK and 46 per cent to join the Republic.The DUP’s MP for Belfast East,\u0026nbspGavin Robinson, said, “Northern Ireland’s future is best served inside the United Kingdom for economic, social, cultural and historic reasons.“The criteria for holding a border poll are clearly outlined and have not been met. However, the focus should not be on holding a isive border poll and creating further community tension in Northern Ireland.“We want to see the Northern Ireland assembly and devolved institutions restored so that decisions can be taken on schools, hospitals and the other vital public services which everyone relies on.”BMG questioned 1,504 adults in England, Scotland and Wales between 3 and 6 September.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The result was television on a scale rarely seen in Tunisia’s modern history, with 11 of the country’s television channels carrying the debate, alongside 20 radio stations.From an initial field of almost 100, including the Middle East’s first openly gay candidate, the field has been whittled down to 26, all of whom now vie for the position of head of state.\u0026nbspAppearing alongside relative outsiders, such as idiosyncratic law professor\u0026nbspKais Saied and Abir Moussi, an avowed apologist for Tunisia’s pre-revolutionary regime, were establishment stalwarts, Chahed, defence minister Abdelkarim Zbidi and the first presidential candidate to be fielded by moderate Islamists Ennahda, Abdelfattah Mourou.In cafes around the capital, crowds spilled out onto the street as Tunisians gathered to watch their potential leaders trade in soundbites for the chance to proceed to the second round of voting, the date for which has yet to be announced. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspNevertheless, despite Karoui’s absence, rumours of private polls conducted by various international agencies suggest the momentum of his insurgent campaign may not have been dented by his absence.

In the febrile atmosphere of the presidential campaign, much of the substance of the charges against\u0026nbspKaroui\u0026nbspand his brother, which were initially brought by anti-corruption watchdog,\u0026nbspIWatch, in 2016, are often overlookedYoussef Chahed (AP)In the build-up to the campaigning period, his television station\u0026nbspNessma TV made great play of images of Karoui distributing aid via his charitable association, Khalil Tounes, to the overlooked interior regions while railing against the shortcomings of Chahed and his government.“Populists and outsiders benefit from the general discontent about the bad economic conditions,” Tunisian political analyst Youssef Cherif tells\u0026nbspThe Independent.\u0026nbsp“They promise to change things and they point to the factclaim that they have nothing to do with the current conditions, that they’ll do better. So people, in search of hope, believe them and fall for their rhetoric.”Always perceived as something of a maverick, Riahi has yet to greatly trouble Tunisia’s political conscience.He fled the country in November after he accused of Chahed and his immediate circle of plotting a coup d’etat. The charges were swiftly dismissed by the military court Riahi had lodged them with.Populists and outsiders benefit from the general discontent about the bad economic conditionsHowever, the accusation reinforced the perception among parts of Tunisia’s political class who sought to portray the prime minister as a tyrant, a perception Karoui’s team made much play of during his campaign, significantly ratcheting up their denunciations of official complicity in the businessman’s arrest on 23 August. \u0026nbspInstead, Karoui’s supporters cast them, and the delay in bringing them to court, as further evidence of an orchestrated campaign to silence their “Nelson Mandela of Tunisia”.Meet the man hoping to become the Muslim world’s first gay presidentTheir claims are not entirely without substance.In May, the outspoken television mogul had his channel taken off air after armed police raided his offices in central Tunis alleging breaches of broadcasting guidelines.In July, shortly after Karoui established his lead in the last of the official polls, the government passed an electoral amendment that would have essentially precluded him and a small number of rival candidates from running for president, legislation that former President Essebsi declined to either sign into law or return to parliament before his death.Irrespective of the claims of either camp, after years of marginalisation many within Tunisia are choosing to see the coming contest as one between the establishment class that has consistently overlooked them, and a fresh tranche of anti-system politicians that, like so many around the world, promise\u0026nbspto rewrite the rulebook in their favour. \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Agon TV, launched in 2013 with ambitions of turning tiny Albania into a European media hub, was uncompromising in its coverage from the off, and in 2015 began airing reports alleging fraud in local elections, including a report about the same man voting 20 times with different identification cards.\u0026nbspSonila Meco, a leading Albanian broadcast journalist, at the 2014 launch party of Agon TV (Agon TV)The reports caused a stir. But few anticipated what would come next.\u0026nbspI want to say that at this moment the electricity to our channel has been cut, she announced.\u0026nbspIn the ensuing days, authorities seized the station’s equipment and almost archives.In one swoop, Albania, a western Balkan NATO member closely allied with the US, killed off for good one of the most promising media experiments in the Balkans, perhaps even in all of Europe.How Albania became the \u0027Colombia of Europe\u0027“The investment was 150 million euros,” Becchetti tells The Independent in an interview. “They took everything.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailEarlier this year, in a development that offered Becchetti, his partners and former staff some measure of vindication, an arbitration tribunal ordered Albania to pay the owners of Agon\u0026nbsp99.5 million\u0026nbspin damages for the station and other investments in the energy sector, and cough up 8.8 million\u0026nbspeuros in legal fees for effectively expropriating the station. In addition, Albanian partners to the station were indirectly awarded roughly 30 million euros.The decision also required that Albania pay interest on any money owed.The case illustrates how a group of surging authoritarians in eastern and southeastern Europe is attempting to squelch press freedoms, often abusing legal tools. EU officials are beginning to take notice, voicing concern this week after Albania proposed a law to tighten controls on online media. \u0026nbspThe Albanian government contends that seizing the station was a legitimate use of executive and police powers in accord with Albanian law. The Independent sought comment from Albanian officials and the law firms that represented the country in the arbitration matter, but received no substantive reply by publication. One UK law firm representing Albania said its barristers were “all just too thinly spread with client work” to comment.\u0026nbspOf the tens of millions of euros Albania was ordered to pay, it has so far yet to pay a penny.Becchetti, center, appeared at the 2014 launch party of Agon TV. (Agon TV)It was with high hopes that Becchetti and his business partners, who had entered the country as investors in the hydro-electric industry during the 1990s as it emerged from one of the most repressive Communist dictatorships in Europe. He\u0026nbspfirst launched the free daily newspaper AgonFree in 2006, applying to turn it into a satellite TV station in 2013. \u0026nbspIt expanded rapidly, launching 24-hour broadcasts the next year, and starting an Italian-language sister channel in 2015.\u0026nbspBecchetti hoped to build on his investment in Albania, using low production costs to launch Italian broadcasts and perhaps eventually English- and other-language channels.Journalists like Meco who worked at the channel describe it as a haven for professionals. It used up-to-date HD quality broadcast technology. Some 500 employees were housed in an office just outside the centre of Tirana.\u0026nbspThe station employed top-notch editors and producers, paying salaries three or four times what other Albanian journalists were making.\u0026nbspBut troubles between Rama’s government and the station began immediately. In one incident, Erion Veliaj – a Rama ally who is now mayor of Tirana – was upset that Agon covered his fancy September 2014 wedding.\u0026nbspThe battle between the station and the government escalated, perhaps exacerbated by tensions between Albania and Becchetti over his energy-sector investments.\u0026nbspAgon reported what it described as widespread allegations of electoral fraud in 2015 municipal elections that saw victories for Rama and his party.Meanwhile, Albanian prosecutors formally charged Becchetti and his partner Mauro De Renzis with forgery, money laundering and tax evasion, and launched legal manouevres to take control of Agon.\u0026nbspRama railed against the channel in television interviews describing it as a “scandalous phenomenon against which we have declared war,” and accusing it of being funded by “dirty money.”Agon continued to broadcast, though its employees couldn’t get paid. Attempts to wire them money from Italy were blocked by Albanian banks. The government upped the pressure: Agon’s journalists, editors, analysts, cameramen and even hair stylists were stopped at Albania’s borders and forbidden to travel abroad.\u0026nbspCourt orders were drawn up to seize the channel, but few believed a government aspiring to join the European Union would take so drastic a move.\u0026nbsp“I was shocked,” says Meco, now 42 and still working as a journalist in Albania, and who still hasn’t gotten over the government-backed seizure of Agon. “I didn’t think things would come to this end.”Agon TV, which was one of the most technologically advanced news channels in the tiny nation of Albania. (Agon TV)For three years Meco struggled to find work as a journalist, before eventually landing a job at another channel. But she continues to long for the stature and resources of Agon.\u0026nbsp“It was a channel where as a journalist you could exercise liberty and freedom of information,” she says. “This is very important not only for me, but Albania also had this great opportunity to be represented in the world with such a project. Everything after is like being downgraded. Nothing is like what we had.”The arbitration panel found the accusations of money laundering and tax evasion against Becchetti unfounded.\u0026nbspHe suspects that the Albanian campaign against him was rooted in his energy dealings as well as the content of Agon TV, with powerful competitors in Italy and Albania egging on Rama.Western governments have repeatedly refused to honour repeated Interpol red notices that Albania issued against Becchetti and his partners, and Albania has quietly withdrawn the requests.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspRama, asked earlier this year about the case, refused to disclose details about the case or comment on the ruling, citing a confidentiality agreement. The case has cost the impoverished country millions of euros in legal fees.\u0026nbspBecchetti\u0026nbspnow spends much of his time overseeing his various legal battles with Albania, but\u0026nbspis also attempting to\u0026nbspstart\u0026nbspan investment fund for entrepreneurs pursuing international ventures. He says is also writing a screenplay about his Albania misadventures.The battle for Agon TV has cost him four years of his life, but he says the real loss is what Albania could have become.\u0026nbspSince shutting down Agon, Albania has increased attempts to impose restrictions and pressure on the press. Since last year, it has fallen from 75th to 82nd in the Reporters Sans Frontier ranking of country’s media freedom.Rama is said to repeatedly refer to Albanian journalists as “trash bins” - though he promised a group of international media freedom advocates he met in Tirana in June that he would refrain from continuing to use the smear.\u0026nbspOver the summer, Adi Krasta and Ylli Rakipi – both journalists who are critical of Rama and his protege Veliaj – were fired from talk shows on the Albanian News24 TV channel, under alleged government pressure.\u0026nbsp“After the fall of the communist regime, Albania started to build up its democracy from scratch and thanks to the hard work of the Albanian people, aided by international investors like myself … the country broke through the inertia of its past and had made great strides forward,” says Becchetti.\u0026nbsp“But the Rama government then put in place a series of actions against the freedom of people, including the closure of Agon channel and the attempt to arrest me, which was a huge step backwards,” he says.\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Bigger than  football pitches, it has room for , staff.It’s now clear that, far from harming the Square Mile, Brexit will help London cement its place as the world’s leading financial hub.Now the Project Fear merchants issue blood-curdling warnings against a No Deal Brexit, making it impossible for Boris Johnson to negotiate with Brussels.Ex-Chancellor Philip Hammond says leaving against the EU’s wishes would cost Britain £billion — equivalent to a whopping four per cent of our annual GDP — doing damage “equivalent to the  financial crash”.Spreadsheet Phil’s meltdown scenario, based on those same  Treasury forecasts, lacks all credibility.EU trade accounts for barely a tenth of the UK economy. Just eight per cent of our firms do business with the -member bloc.The idea Brexit would cause a shock equal to the largest peace-time slowdown in a century, when the entire world economy slumped, is absurd.No Deal is constantly demonised by those who “respect the Referendum result” but are really Brexit-blockers. Preparations have been made on all sides to minimise any disruption.Agreements have been struck so exports will keep flowing and planes will fly.Phone roaming charges won’t change, as the big ­telecom outfits have now ­confirmed.Trade agreements with our most important global customers have been agreed or are in the works.What the doom-mongers don’t mention is that No Deal could mean lower prices for food and consumer goods such as clothing and footwearthe UK drops high tarfs on imports from outside the EU which, for now, Brussels forces us to impose.It is rarely acknowledged that the Irish government has admitted there won’t be new physical infrastructure in ­sensitive locations, and customs checks can happen away from the Irish border.When did you last hear on the TV news that UK exports to the EU have fallen from  per cent of goods we sold abroad  years ago to just  per cent now — despite the much-vaunted single market and customs union it would apparently be so disastrous to leave And why are we never told UK trade outside the EU is now not only the majority of our trade, but is fast-growing, produces a surplus and is conducted largely under World Trade Organisation rules Of course the future is not without danger. Indeed, there is a huge great threat on the horizon that could smash this prosperity to smithereens.And that is a hard-Left Labour government led by Jeremy Corbyn, who this week pledged to make it easier for workers to strike, threatening ato the dark days of the s.Polling from Financial News suggests City investors would rather a No Deal Brexit than Corbyn taking over as Prime Minister — and rightly so.Speaking to his trade union paymasters at the TUC on Tuesday, this Magic Grandpa pledged to sweep aside long-standing anti-strike rules, opening the floodgates to widespread industrial action.A Corbyn government would cause havoc — threatening ato the Britain of my childhood, when we ended up being bailed out, going “cap in hand” to the International Monetary Fund.The damage he would inflict would be catastrophic. What forward-thinking firm would want to invest in a country where the government would take ten per cent of your companyyou happen to be successful enough to employ more than  people That’s what Corbyn and his Marxist dreamers are planning.And the wind in their sails blows hard, thanks not to their appeal on the doorstep — two thirds of Brits think him indecisive and incompetent, according to a recent YouGov poll.No, Comrade Corbyn has been helped by the Remainer corporate establishment, in turn assisted by gloomy Remainer economists and an overwhelmingly Remainer media class, which has railed against a genuine Brexit.It’s now threatening to overturn the  Referendum result altogether.

For a packet of  cigarettes the saving will be as much as £. But Hancock, it appears, will not be celebrating.He has complained that he wasn’t consulted about the Chancellor’s plan to reintroduce duty free on trips from EU countries, and that it will help to undermine the Department of Health’s campaigns to persuade us to smoke and drink less.Obviously, that is good advice. But is anyone really going to take up smoking or go on a drinking binge just because it becomes a little cheaper to buy cigarettes and alcohol at an airport Duty free is a harmless little treat for ing holiday- makers — something to ensure we remain in good cheer for a few weeks after wefrom holiday, or a little in the way of compensationit rained all week on our Spanish beach.Duty free, as anyone over  will remember, used to be a staple part of a foreign holiday. The concept arose because once we have passed through security at a port or airport, we are deemed for tax purposes already to have left the country.Customs and Excise authorities concluded, there- fore, that they had no right to charge us duties designed to capture taxes from domestic consumption.We are theoretically still liable to pay duty on goods when we are entering a country. But in practice most countries will waive duty on small quantities of alcoholic drinks and tobacco products brought in by arriving passengers.As a result, passengers arriving in Britain from non-EU countries are currently allowed to bring back up to four litres of still wine, a litre of spirits,  litres of beer and  cigarettes without paying duty.For passengers arriving in Britain from other EU countries, however, the rules changed in  — seven years after the creation of the single market.Duty free was abolished for people travelling between EU countries. In some ways, the single market was more generous than the previous duty-free regime.Rather than just four litres of wine, for example, we are now allowed to bring unlimited quantities of wine without paying UK duty, so long as it is only for personal consumption.Given that the duty on wine is a lot lower in France than in Britain, we can save a small fortune by stocking up in a French hypermarket.What the EU single market did stop, however, was our ability to travel, say, from France to Britain without paying duty in either country. What Sajid Javid wants to do is to give us the best of both worlds.From October  — assuming we leave the EU without continuing to be subject to the rules of the single market — we will regain our duty-free allowances.But, in addition, we will continue to be allowed to bring unlimited quantities of alcohol and tobacco which we bought in France and which we intend to use only for personal consumption.The main beneficiaries of duty free, needless to say, are smokers and drinkers. But you don’t have to smoke or drink in order to benefit from its existence.The profits from duty free allow airlines and ferry operators to keep their ticket prices down. When the EU proposed to abolish duty free in the s, the travel industry calculated that , jobs in the UK were dependent on its existence.That was no doubt exaggerated for effect, and of course the budget airline industry has grown hugely in the past  years.Butwe want to be able to continue to fly to Spain for a tenner , the reintroduction of duty free is going to be a signicant influence on what airlines can offer by way of cheap tickets.The fuss over Sajid Javid’s proposal has reopened isions in the Government over so-called “sin taxes” on booze and fags.For some, like Matt Hancock, who this week praised the sugar levy on fizzy drinks, sin taxes are a useful instrument for persuading us to lead healthier lives. Others, the Prime Minister included, are more guarded.The problem with slapping taxes on alcohol, cigarettes and unhealthy food is that they are regressive taxes which impact disproportionately on the poor.I would say to Matt Hancock: Give us all the advice on healthy living that you can. And I don’t object to proportionate taxes which reflect the cost of medical care for smokers and excessive drinkers.But leave it to us to decide how we want to lead our lives — and don’t deny us a small pleasure like being able to buy a small duty-free treat on our way home.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This is because they are so far apart that architects had to factor in the curvature of Earth.Today, it’s still as unnecessary as it ever was. And it’s no longer the longest suspension bridge in the world. But it remains, in my opinion, the most beautul.In fact, and I’ve said this often, it’s the most beautul man-made thing of all time. Apart from maybe the Riva Aquarama speedboat.When I stand on the south shore on a misty morning and see the wafer-thin road disappearing off into the sea, it takes my breath away. It really does.So I’m glad it was made. And I’m glad too that the Labour government also built the Post Office Tower, even though it is now just a hazard to aircraft.Then there’s Concorde. The world did not need such a thing.And the technical challenges facing the engineers were huge. A Nasa boffin once told me that getting a passenger plane up beyond Mach  was more dficult than putting a man on the moon.But that old commie Tony Benn had decided Concorde was going to succeed, so he pushed and he pushed and, by God, are we glad he did.Can you imagine such a thing Because even though the beautul white bird is now grounded, we still have those memories of the shattering noise it made and the way it could make the sun rise in the West.I remember once, standing on a beach in Barbados as a British Airways Concorde roared overhead at treetop height.After it had passed, a stunned American on the next sun lounger looked at me and said: “You Brits.”I was so proud, I didn’t get round to telling him it was half French.Since Concorde though, Britain hasn’t really done anything of any great importance. There’s been talk of a new railway line from London to Manchester, but in evolutionary terms that’s just a shuffle. And now it probably won’t happen anyway.Which is why I am SO excited about the idea of a bridge linking Larne, in Northern Ireland with Portpatrick, in Scotland.Weirdly, the Labour Party — the party that created the Post Office Tower and Concorde and the Humber Bridge — are furious, saying it’s not needed and will be too expensive and it’s only been suggested to get Boris out of his backstop hole.But can you imagine such a thing A -mile bridge supported on columns ,ft high, and rising even higher in the middle so ships can pass underneath. It would be magnicent.Yes, it would be dficult to make.

It was “furious rabies” which causes extreme thirst and a morbid fear of water. At the same time.Mercully, he has now died. And we, meanwhile, are left to ponder what sort of a God comes up with a disease like that to end nearly , lives every year.ON the basis you should know your enemy, I read a book on holiday this year about why we shouldn’t kill animals.It wasn’t called – “If you eat meat, you’re a bastard”, but that was the thrust.And after a while, I deliberately left it in the rain, so I didn’t have to finish it.However, since I ed to Britain about a month ago, I still haven’t been able to eat pork.Cows  Chickens  Sheep  Not really bothered.But some of the things I read in that book about how pigs can play video games and feel love – they stuck.And so did the bit about how frightened they look when they are being taken to the slaughterhouse.I tried this morning to have a bacon sandwich but I couldn’t bring myself to put it in my mouth.It’s annoying. Pork was always my favourite meat but I’ll have to find a substitute.I’m thinking badger. Or maybe a nice roast fox.I know people who’ve found lost phones in their trouser pockets, and most women are of capable losing anything up to a medium-sized dog in their handbags.But I’ve never heard of anyone losing themselves. Until now.A party of tourists on a bus tour of Iceland spent hours searching for a missing passenger only to find she was in the search party.She hadn’t recognised the description of herself and it wasn’t until three in the morning that her mistake became clear.Bet she was popular.AT long last, space boffins have found a planet which they reckon could be capable of supporting le.They will know soonit has an atmosphere but they’ve already worked out that the romantically named K-b does have water.

Second, it must protect the integrity of the EU’s single market. Third, it must not involve any checks on the island of Ireland.Barclay said the UK could meet the first two of these tests, but not the third. He said there was no point in presenting any detailed proposals until the EU shted on the question of checks.One Government source explains thatthe UK did, the “EU would nuke the proposals and we would be in chaos”.So the challenge for Boris is to get the EU to move on this third point. His Monday meeting with Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker gives him a chance to lobby him on this very issue.Juncker is an instinctive deal-maker and, with his term as president due to end on October , he will be keen to resolve Brexit before he goes.I also understand that several EU governments, including in France, are now apprehensive about the possibility of a second referendum.They believe it would be bad for the EU for the UK to stay in given how contested UK membership now is.They fear this would lead to every Council decision, all new EU legislation and every European Court of Justice judgment becoming a matter of controversy.The EU, though, will not abandon Ireland. This means that whatever proposal Boris comes up with will have to be something Leo Varadkar is prepared to swallow.The first meeting between the two men has given Downing Street some hope that they can find something that works for Dublin, them and the DUP.The DUP’s willingness to entertain Northern Ireland continuing to follow EU rules on agriculture has opened the door to further discussions.If Parliament had not tied Boris’s hands, he could have seenthe risk of No Deal would have pushed Dublin and the EU to compromise on the checks front. But his ability to negotiate is now weakened.For this and other reasons, the odds are still against a deal. But there is a greater chance of one than a week ago.The Liberal Democrats start their conference today in their strongest position for years.They are polling around  per cent and in line to make major gains at the next election.At conference next week they are expected to adopt as their position that a Lib Dem government – stop laughing at the back – would simply revoke Article , cancelling the referendum result.This will establish them as the most unambiguously anti-Brexit party, a development that concerns a growing number of Labour MPs in Remain seats who want their party to take a clearer line on the issue for fear of losing ground to the Lib Dems.At the same time, the policy means that the Liberal Democrats can tell voters they will make the whole issue go away. By contrast, a second referendum would drag things out.If politics is now about Leave v Remain, rather than Left v Right, expect the Lib Dems to come back with more MPs than they have ever had before, following the next election.One of the things that urgently needs sorting out in this country is technical education.Those who don’t want to do an academic degree are being ill-served by further education.Gavin Williamson, the new Education Secretary, told Cabinet this week that there are up to , people trained in Hair  Beauty yet only a need for about , new recruits to work in this industry each year.The result is tens of thousands of people doing courses that don’t lead to them getting jobs or boost this country’s productivity.Those who want a second Brexit referendum are now arguing there shouldn’t be a General Election until a second referendum has taken place.Tony Blair, Labour’s deputy leader Tom Watson and Tory rebel Oliver Letwin have all made that case this week.Leave aside the massive issue of whether there should be a second referendum before the result of the first one has even been implemented, this plan would mean that this Parliament would have to carry on sitting until well into .This is a disastrous idea. This is a useless Parliament and keeping it going will just add to the national paralysis.With no party able to command a majority in the Commons, nothing can get done. Eventhis Parliament could muster a majority for a referendum, which is far from certain, it could do so for little .It is hard to see what meaningful domestic legislation can come out of this Parliament given that neither Boris Johnson nor Jeremy Corbyn can secure the backing of most MPs.The public desire for politicians to get on with both Brexit and the domestic agenda is why No will spend next week trying to emphasise its tough-on-crime policies.I understand Boris Johnson will put flesh on the bones of his plan to end early release for violent and unrepentant criminals.Friends are urging Amber Rudd to stand in the West London seat of Kensington at the next election.Its controversial Labour MP, Emma Dent Coad, has a majority of just .The thinking goes that the constituency isn’t keen on either No Deal or Jeremy Corbyn, so Rudd could do well standing as an independent.But it is exceptionally hard for independents to win seats, andRudd were to go down this course, she would be standing in the constituency for the first time – she is currently MP for Hastings, down on the south coast. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He was short of breath, he was breathing heavily.It was very concerning that he would have signicant lung damage and possibly some residual changes after he heals from this.Adam, who has since been discharged from hospital but is still recovering, is urging people not to vape.He said: I dont want to see anybody in my situation. I dont want to see anybody in the hospital for as long as I was.The teen admits he took up the habit to fit in, adding that everyone  was doing it.Adam said: It didnt taste like a cigarette. It tasted good.He said the flavours appealed to him, especially mango, and the nicotine provided a buzz.He would wake up in the morning and would puff on that Juul and then cough, said mum Polly.Eventually, he went from vaping over-the-counter e-liquids to vaping THC, the psychoactive component of marijuana.But it was soon after that he started to feel unwell and eventually ended up in hospital.Adam said: If I had known what it was doing to my body, I would have never even touched it, but I didnt know. I wasnt educated.San Francisco-based Juul said in a statement that its never marketed to youth and has ongoing campaigns to combat underage use.It added that its products are meant to help adult smokers wean themselves off traditional paper-and-tobacco cigarettes, which Juul called the deadliest legal consumer product known to man.Among the precautions Juul said its taken to ensure young people arent drawn to its e-cigarettes was to close Juuls Facebook and Instagram accounts.The firm said it has also deployed technology that restricts a sale until someones age is veried.Theyre not completely risk free, but they carry a small fraction of the risk of cigarettes.E-cigarettes do not produce tar or carbon monoxide, two of the most harmful elements in tobacco smoke.The liquid and vapour contain some potentially harmful chemicals also found in cigarette smoke, but at much lower levels.While nicotine is the addictive substance in cigarettes, its relatively harmless.Almost all of the harm from smoking comes from the thousands of other chemicals in tobacco smoke, many of which are toxic.Nicotine replacement therapy has been widely used for many years to help people stop smoking and is a safe treatment.Theres no evidence so far that vaping causes harm to other people around you.This is in contrast to secondhand smoke from smoking, which is known to be very harmful to health.Source: NHSHis ordeal follows a spike of mysterious and le-threatening lung diseases - believed to be linked to vaping - over the summer.In the US, six people are now reported to have died from vaping-related lung illnesses.The latest person to die was in their s and from Kansas.They were in hospital with symptoms that progressed rapidly, but also to have had a history of underlying health issues.While more than  people, mostly otherwise healthy and in their teens or s, have shown up at hospitals with breathing dficulties.Often theyve also suffered with vomiting, fever and fatigue for several days prior.Some have even ended up in intensive care on a ventilator for several weeks.Its prompted health bosses to issue a warning while they investigate the issue.The USs health protection agency, the Centres for Disease Control and Preventionsaid earlier this month that people should consider restraining from using e-cigarette products.So far, officials say the cause is unknown, but they are carrying out investigations."},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy vine accidentally love you radio","story":"The BBC presenter was speaking to guest Anne Mantel on his lunchtime radio show on when – as he put it - the words just came out.Ms Mantel from Chichester, had called in and the pair had a pleasant chat about a peacock butterfly that had been hibernating for two months after it had flown into her house.As he rounded up the call, Mr Vine said: Thanks for listening - look after that butterfly.Ms Mantel replied: Will do, thank you.

These have been bolstered as part of our preparations. In addition we have put in place extra measures.”Suppliers have been given special documentation to help them get across the border and avoid any delay. The other fallback is ordering suppliers to build a six-week stock of all medicines.Mr Fear said: “The department ad damned well insisted that suppliers have six weeks of stock and most of them have quite a bit more. For insulin, for example, there is four months supply in the country at the moment.”He moved to calm fears of a sudden shortage, adding: “Production of medicine will stay the same, demand is going to stay the same. The challenge for EU exit is in the logistics – getting it from where it is produced to the patient.“If there are some travel delays then the buffer stocks will cover that and they will be topped up, so it’s not going to be the case of having six weeks from October  then at some point in mid-December we will run out.”Extra freight capacity has been secured and NHS staff have been told the main message is “Keep Calm and Carry On” but not to stockpile.In his briefing, Mr Fear stressed: “Just because we are planning for it, doesn’t mean we think it’s going to happen. We are just saying this is the possibility so we are going to plan for it.“We are trying to be as well prepared as we possibly can.

My disagreements with Jeremy ­Corbyn are well known. They remain. But he has co-operated with other parties in the last weeks very sensibly and skilfully to stop a No Deal Brexit. Parliament is blocked and Boris Johnson completely boxed in. The blockage is not – as Farage and Johnson insist – because MPs are a bunch of “Remoaners” thwarting the will of the people.There is a substantial majority for doing Brexit with an agreement to replace the existing arrangements with the ­European Union. There is, however, also a big majority against No Deal Brexit for the simple reason that it is a massive gamble with the British economy that no responsible prime minister or ­government would take. And the reason Parliament has had dficulty, under both May and Johnson, of reaching agreement on the type of deal which would work, is that Brexit was an easy instruction to give but a hugely complicated one to do.We have traded and operated as a nation within Europe for almost half a century. It is the biggest commercial market and political alliance in the world right on our doorstep. Divorce was always going to be dficult.    Contrary to what we are told by the Tories, it isn’t really a negotiation with Europe. It starts with a choice. Stay in Europe’s trading structure to ­minimise economic pain and keep borders, not least in Ireland, open . Or exit, in which case the adjustment will be painful, ­particularly in Ireland. Both May and Johnson have tried to have it both ways and that was never going to work.  So the question now is how to break the blockage, because the one thing everyone wants is for the Brexit nightmare to end. Johnson wants to go back to the people in a General Election. This is crazy. We decided Brexit by a ­referendum. If we’re to reconsider it, do it the same way. An election is about masses of dferent things and is to elect a government. Don’t muddle it up with the very specic issue of Brexit, becausewe end up with another hung Parliament then nothing is resolved.

The couple were criticised by some royal commentators for keeping the July christening of their baby son private. No photographers were allowed in the Private Chapel of Windsor Castle for the ceremony where Archie was baptised by the Archbishop of Canterbury. Initially just two photos of the special day were released by the Duke and Duchess. One showed the couple surrounded by friends and family. Another, in black and white, was a more intimate snap of Meghan, Harry and Archie. But today a third was published - as part of a collage dedicated to Prince Harry on his th birthday.  On the SussexRoyal Instagram page Meghan wrote: “Your service to the causes you care so deeply for inspires me every day. You are the best husband and most amazing dad to our son. We love you. Happiest birthday!” And eagle-eyed royal fans soon noticed the black and white photo in the bottom right is another glimpse into the christening. It shows Harry  crouched down to look at Archie, being held in his mumaposs lap as she sits down.  Meghanaposs face looks the picture of happiness as she gazes at her son. Meghan and Harry have kept Archie away from the spotlight since his birth and are reportedly keen to give him a normal upbringing.

Olivia, , from St Johnaposs, Worcester, has made a direct appeal to the public for help, saying simply: We need you. She said: We received the devastating news Oscaraposs chances of a cure are very slim since he has recently relapsed post his stem cell transplant.  Obviously relapsing with any disease minimises your options but because Oscaraposs aggressive disease is back only three months post bone marrow transplant he is at even higher risk. T-Cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is a very tough disease to tackle but there are cases where a second transplant and a new trial called CAR-T have worked. With Oscar remaining unbelievably strong and with much fight left in him, we just have to try everything and anything to save him. The NHS sadly will not fund the CAR-T trial in Singapore and nor will they fund a second transplant unless he is post  months of the first. This is why we need you, we need everyoneaposs support and kindness to get him through to the next stage of treatment.We really are on a tight schedule, a schedule no child should be on.

When she was just  years old Melanie Blake left her working class family home in Stockport and started le on the streets of Oldham and Salford. Desperate to carve a career for herself in  the music industry but estranged from her family, she spent several months sleeping rough while juggling part time jobs, Manchester Evening News reported. On many of the freezing cold nights she spent on the streets or in squats with strangers, her career ambitions seemed impossible to fulfill. “That first nightwas so cold I thought I was going to die,” she said. “I huddled up with these two girls and five lads, we would lie on the floor and try and keep warm. The place we stayed in was so rough...    Desperately trying to save up any money she earned as a receptionist and shop assistant to follow her dream of getting into the music business, Melanie was bereft when she came back to the squat one night and saw it boarded up. She said: “I was gutted. I had to sleep in the shed in the garden. In hindsight I should have got a BB for the night, but I was young and had this little Halax account with my running away fund and desperately didn’t want to spend any money.” A chance conversation with a squatter about a housing initiative in Salford saw Melanieaposs fortunes change. She went to the council and within the same day was given a set of keys and her own flat.    Melanie said the authorityaposs help saved her le. Within three months of moving into her own place she had saved £,. She left Greater Manchester for London on the day of her th birthday. After grafting away in temp jobs, Melanie won herself an entry-level gig at Top of the Pops, where she rubbed shoulders with s musical greats including Spice Girls and Kylie Minogue.    She caught the eye of higher ups when she began working with Claire Richards from Steps - a job that led her to launch the Nolan Sistersapos reunion tour. It was with the aposIaposm in the mood for dancingapos songsters that Melanie bagged her first million. “Everyone said I wouldn’t be able to do it. They said no one wanted to see  and -something women on stage - but they were wrong. It made millions,” said Melanie.    The experience with the Nolans inspired her to take on sexism in the music industry via a fiction book called aposThunder Girlsapos. Following the lives of a aposs girl band savagely dropped by their label, the book proved a big success and sparked a stage adaptation. Having got her first chance in Salford, Melanie is keen to bring the show to the city.    Melanie, who now lives in Crouch End, London, said: “When the show hits the Lowry Theatre stage, it will be exactly  years to the day that I left Salford for my new le in London. Itaposs been particularly emotional ing to the city for the launch It still feels like home. “Yes I live in a fancy house now and am living the dream, but when I got my chance, I wanted to bring it all back to the city that saved me.    “I was keen to invest back in the north, cast women from the north and bring the show back to the very city I was homeless in. I could have launched the show in London but for me, the Lowry Theatre was the perfect choice.” Melanie has paid for  tickets to her own show, which will be given to people in the area who wouldnapost normally be able to afford the theatre. “I only ever went to the theatre once growing up, she said.

In a candid and emotional interview, he tells the Sunday Mirror how he sobbed in the arms of a doctor, feared he would die – and felt like ending it all by driving over a clf. The -year-old is the first UK sportsman to reveal he has the virus and is breaking his silence because he wants to end stigma around HIV. He also reveals he and husband Stephen – who he met after being diagnosed – married three years ago. Stephen does not have HIV. Former Wales rugby union and league star Gareth says of his diagnosis: “I’ve been living with this secret for years.I’ve felt shame and keeping such a big secret has taken its toll.  “I had a fear people would judge me and treat me like a leper because of a lack of knowledge. I was in a dark place, feeling suicidal. I thought about driving off a clf. “To me, wanting to die was just a natural thought and felt like the easier way out, but you have to confront things.And having a strong support system and the personal strength and experience of overcoming those emotions got me through it. “Many people live in fear and shame of having HIV, but I refuse to be one of them now. We need to break the stigma once and for all. “I’m speaking out because I want to help others and make a dference.”  Gareth is speaking on the eve of the Rugby World Cup starting next week – when he will be a pundit for ITV. While reluctant to reveal the date of his diagnosis, Gareth spells out the profound moment he was given the news by medics. The former British Lions captain, who revealed he was gay in  and retired from rugby in , said: “I’ll never ever forget the moment I found out. I went for a routine sexual health test at a private clinic in Cardf. “I’d had the tests every now and again and they’d always come back okay. I didn’t feel ill and I thought everything was going to be fine. “The woman who did the test took blood as usual, then I went out to my car and waited for about an hour before going back in to get my results.”  His voice choking with emotion, Gareth adds: “When I went back in, I sat down on a chair next to a doctor’s bench. She told me in a quite matter of fact way I had tested HIV positive. “When she said those words I broke down. I was in such a state. I immediately thought I was going to die.I felt like an express train was hitting me at mph. I wasn’t expecting it at all. Then I was thinking ‘how long have I got left ’ I was distraught.” Gareth, who is ft in and st, found himself sobbing on the doctor’s shoulder while struggling to understand the enormity of the news and what the future held. He goes on: “She treated me with such empathy and understanding and after about  minutes I got myself together. I remember she told me, ‘You need to go to the hospital right now and start the process straight away, because the doctors will be able to help you better understand your diagnosis. Don’t wait for tomorrow’.    “I drove straight to Cardf Royal Infirmary, but I was still in such a traumatised state. In tears, I rang a good friend on the way and blurted it out. I told him, ‘I’ve got HIV – I’m going to die’. He was trying to comfort and reassure me and telling me to go and speak to the doctors, but I’d already made my mind up that my le was over. “I’d never known anyone with HIV or AIDS. And everything I’d heard about HIV was death and frailness.Like most people I lived with the belief that HIV is terminal. I tried to keep going as normal in the days afterwards, but felt completely numb.” Gareth had to reveal his diagnosis to a string of former sexual partners so they could be tested.He says: “I had to tell people I’d had sex with since my last test that I was HIV positive. “Your history suddenly becomes very relevant and you have a duty of care to tell them. I did it over the phone. That was hard.”  Gareth married his teenage sweetheart Jemma in . They split up after he told her he was gay – and he went public about his sexuality  years ago. He was the first British rugby international to “come out”. There are an estimated , people in the UK with HIV – Human Immunodeficiency Virus – but many consider it too taboo to reveal it. That is why Gareth remained silent, until now. He says: “I’ve chosen to speak out about this in the Sunday Mirror because it’s the paper I trust to put my story out there in the right way and because I believe together we can make a dference. “But the truth is I’m still scared even now of people finding out I’m living with HIV and I’m s****ing myself and feel petried about what the reaction will be, because we still live in an era where HIV is not spoken about.” Gareth admits he once believed the myths surrounding transmission of HIV.He adds: “I thought thatpeople knew about me being HIV positive they wouldn’t want to breathe the same air as me, they wouldn’t want to drink from the same cup as me andI walked into a coffee shop everyone would just walk out because they’d be so scared of being infected by me.    “I thinkyou went out on the street right now and told  people you have HIV,  per cent of them would be scared you’re going to give it to them. “I don’t blame people for thinking it, because I did too, but we need to change that by talking about it and educating people.” HIV targets and alters the immune system, increasing the risk and impact of other infections and diseases. Without treatment, the lelong infection – which is spread through sexual contact and blood – can progress to AIDS. No cure is currently available for HIV or AIDS.  But modern advances mean HIV patients in countries with good access to healthcare very rarely develop AIDS once they get treatment. Le expectancy of people with the virus is approaching that of a person who tests negative, as long as they adhere to a combination of ongoing medications called anti-retroviral therapy. Gareth takes one tablet containing four medications each day. His condition is now under control to the point it is considered “undetectable” and can’t be passed on. He receives regular counselling and has blood tests at Cardf Royal Infirmary every six months. But Gareth has never used the main entrance, saying: “I’ve always gone through a side door before opening hours because I thoughtpeople spotted me they’d put two and two together and work out my secret. “It has all been shrouded in a sense of shame and from me entering the clinic to leaving always feels like a blur.I still don’t feel I could walk in through the main entrance even now, although maybe that’ll change.    “HIV is a scary subject. There’s a lot of fear and ignorance. But the fear is something people learned in the s from the tombstone adverts on TV. In  there is nothing to be afraid of. “People need to know that due to modern medicine HIV is not le-threatening any more and because of the medication I take, there’s no way it can be passed on.It’s very controllable. In terms of effect on the body, diabetes is considered worse to have than HIV by doctors. I’m not dying.” The star remains supremely fit and will today compete in the Wales Ironman event in Tenby, South Wales.He says: “I’m fitter now than when I played rugby and I didn’t have HIV then. I’m not just all right, I’m better than all right.” Gareth, from Bridgend, won  caps for Wales from  to .He made global headlines when he came out as gay while still playing rugby union. He went on to play rugby league, earning four caps for Wales.  A career in TV followed – he was on Celebrity Big Brother, Dancing on Ice and appeared on Oprah and the Ellen DeGeneres chat show. Last year, he and MP Damian Collins launched a draft amendment to the  Football Offences Act that would outlaw homophobic abuse at matches.In November  Gareth was attacked by a -year-old in Cardf over his sexuality. Officers dealt with the youth offender by restorative justice following a request by Gareth – who believed it was the best way for the lad to learn. Gareth is donating his fee for this interview to HIV and AIDS charity The Terrence Higgins Trust.He says: “Through the Trust I’ve met other people with HIV and that has been powerful. It made me realise how much good I can do and the part I have to play in making a dference. “I hope me speaking out about my diagnosis will help a lot of people.” Ian Green, chief executive of the Terence Higgins Trust says... When I was first diagnosed with HIV in , I never thought I’d live to  – or that it would lead to me being good pals with a rugby legend. But that’s what has happened and I’m very glad it has. Gareth Thomas has ‘come out’ about his HIV because he wants what all of us living with it want – the public to take notice of the incredible medical progress made. For both of us, that includes now being able to say without doubt someone with HIV and on effective treatment – like me and Gareth – can’t pass it on. This is backed by robust medical evidence and endorsed by hundreds of organisations across the globe, including us at Terrence Higgins Trust. And with a front page exclusive in today’s Sunday Mirror, he’s well on his way to educating thousands and thousands about what it means to live with HIV in . It’s been a privilege to get to know Gareth . At the Trust we’re big advocates of ensuring people diagnosed with HIV can meet others living with the virus who been through that experience – taken the medication, told their family, experienced the stigma. I hope I’ve helped Gareth process his diagnosis and played a role in preparing him for today’s announcement. I was one of the first people he had ever met openly living with HIV. Now he’s met a range of dferent people and heard stories which have inspired him to speak publicly and challenge the stigma. That includes one woman who uses our Cardf support services. She told him about the impact gossip and HIV-related stigma at school has on her young son. It’s for people like her that Gareth is taking on today’s Ironman Wales – a . mile swim,  mile cycle and  mile run – to prove HIV has changed a lot since many people last heard about it. Because out-of-date beliefs about HIV are undeniably standing in the way of progress in the fight against it. For example, our recent polling showed almost half of people would still feel uncomfortable kissing someone living with HIV. To be clear: HIV has never been passed on through kissing or any other day-to-day contact. But this is exactly why we need Gareth in our corner. He has the public profile and drive to get this out there. After all, when was the last time HIV was explored in back pages with sports fans given an update on all the progress made  Thank you, Gareth, for speaking out today.

It helps her to come to terms with the everyday struggles, while shining a light on a little understood condition.Joanna admitted when she was diagnosed she was knocked for six and dark thoughts entered her head. She said: “It was surreal. It was like aposthis only happens to everyone apos, I’m just your average -year-old mum. “My general feeling was I’m going to be dead in a year.  “You’re having to sit there and think realistically ‘ they can offer me chemotherapy, is it worth it ’To go through those thoughts and emotions was terrying, but people face it every single day.” Doctors had suspected Joanna, who is planning her wedding to partner Daniel Jonathan on Good Friday next year, had chest infections, pneumonia and even pleurisy, and she is passionate about highlighting the problems of misdiagnosis and improper treatment. She said: “It is affecting more and more young people and not every hospital offers the testing of cells that finds these rare forms. “Not every oncologist in the country knows about it, which is quite scary. Sharing knowledge is sharing power against this awful disease.”  Joanna, who is originally from Southport, is on a daily treatment of tablets for le, however when she grows immune to the drug after three to five years she will require an alternative. She added: “Whenever this one stops working for me the next one will be available. “They’re very expensive, which is why they don’t offer genetic testing to everybody. “I’m still breathless and cannot walk very far. I’m now classed as disabled. I get quite a lot of nerve pain.” Joanna, of Peel Street, says writing the blog has helped her greatly to stay in an optimistic frame of mind and also helped her friends and family to deal with what she is going through.

Marie Hooper and her husband Steve spent a whopping £, on treatment  since  and suffered the heartbreaking pain of a miscarriage. The couple were brokenhearted six years ago when, after nine months of trying, doctors said they wouldnapost be able to conceive naturally, with some medically professionally suggested theyaposd never have kids. The -year-old former hairdresser was advised by someone at work to look into IVF treatment, leading her to book a consultation in September .    But Marieaposs renewed hope turned to heartache once again when a doctor said her weight would prevent her from undergoing the treatment. She had already gone from  stone to  stone since the start of the year, but was told to lose another three before being eligible for an NHS IVF. It was so frustrating to hear I needed to do more, especially because exercising wasnapost something I enjoyed doing, she said. But I was really motivated, I knew it was what I had to do in order to give me and my husband a baby, which is all we wanted. Marie continued to swap pizzas for peanuts and kebabs for kale, as well as using an exercise bike at home, to eventually reach her target weight of  stone at the start of . She credits much of her success to Slimming World, which she joined in  when her weight loss journey begun.    The couple had their first attempt at IVF treatment in March that year, but it failed. Marie said:That was a really awful thing to go through but I knew it was a possibility so we decided to try again really soon. Just two months later she found out she was pregnant following a second attempt at treatment. In February  the coupleaposs first child, James, was born in their hometown of Sheffield, South Yorkshire. Marie and Steve, a -year-old bus driver, say Jamesaposs arrival was a dream come true following three years of suffering. We had both been through so much to get to that point so to finally have had a baby felt amazing, Marie said. It was the end of a really long and dficult journey but I knew that I wanted to give it another go and try for a second.    I wanted James to have a sibling. A sibling is like your best friend and I wanted to have that for him. But the process second time round proved to be even more painful than the first. On Marieaposs third and fourth attempts at treatment her body failed to respond to the drugs and her fth, in , resulted in a miscarriage. She said: After the fth attempt, that was the worst month of my le. I was devastated. I felt so depressed I didnapost want to be with anybody. But after a few days, I decided I wanted to do it again. I was determined. The couple had already spent £, on IVF and didnapost have any money left, so crowdfunded for financial support. To their surprise the public donated a whopping £,, which enabled them to give treatment another go. In March , Marie got the brilliant news she was pregnant again and that December her youngest son Jack was born.  Marie said: Going through IVF is like going through the worldaposs longest labour. Itaposs so, so dficult because of the dramatic ups and downs. Weaposd hear good news one day then have it taken away the next, so it was hard to ever be happy. I felt like I had been cheated because all I wanted to do in le was to be a mum and I had to fight for it. She added: Looking at the family I have now makes me so, so happy. Itaposs taken a lot of blood, sweat and tears but in the end itaposs all been worth it.

Rather than buy the next size up - and determined not to go on a diet - Becky, from Portsmouth, set herself a challenge. Instead of reaching for microwave meals and getting a takeaway delivered, she learned to cook.    Becky, who has lived with her partner, Nathan, for the last six years has now shed five stone in less than a year and is a slum size eight.

Becky is now a convert to cooking all her healthy meals herself - and itaposs even helped her shed her baby weight after welcoming little Dexter into their family. She said: Even whilst I was pregnant with Dexter I didn’t slip, and it’s even helping me lose the baby weight now! I feel so much better within myself. I never used to want to leave the house or be seen outside alone but I’m so much more confident. I’ve now also been able to get a dog, which means I’m out of the house at least twice a day doing exercise – something I never thought I would do.

But like most kids the young royals loved going out for a McDonaldaposs, and in her bid to give them a aposnormalapos upbringing, their mum Princess Diana would often take them out for a delicious treat. Former Royal Family chef Darren McGrady shared a story about a time she came into the Palace kitchen to tell him they were popping to McDonaldaposs. He told Marie Claire that despite his offer to make burgers for them at home, she wasnapost interested and said there was another reason they wanted a McDonaldaposs instead.    He said: I remember the Princess came into the kitchen one day and said, aposCancel lunch for the boys Iaposm taking them out, weaposre going to McDonaldaposs. And I said, aposOh my god your royal highness, I can do that, I can do burgers.apos And she said, aposNo, itaposs the toy they want.apos Yeah, the boys loved McDonaldaposs, and going out to pizza, and having potato skins—sort of the American foods. They were royal princes but had childrenaposs palates.    According to Dianaaposs former butler and close friend Paul Burrell the trio would get a McDonaldaposs regularly on a Saturday night - and it was part of their bizarrely aposnormalapos routine. They would order Big Macs and chips. He told the Mirror: They would then come home and sit on a giant stuffed hippopotamus Diana had in front of the TV and watch Blind Date. Mr Burrell said: The three of them would nip to McDonald’s for a Big Mac and fries before coming back to watch Blind Date. All three of them would squat on this massive, stuffed hippopotamus Diana had in her sitting room.    They loved Blind Date and I’d hear them all screaming things like “Oh don’t pick him!” and “Lorra, lorra fun”. Diana ripped up the Royal Family rulebook when it came to raising William and Harry. Before her, royal children were mainly raised by Palace staff including a team of dedicated nannies. The Queen wasnapost particularly involved in raising her children, and was often away for a months at a time when they were young.    But after the birth of Princes William and Harry, Diana changed all this with her hands-on approach. Even though she was only  when she became a mum, she was determined to do a lot of the day-to-day child care and refused to leave her boys at home when she went away on Royal Tours, taking them with her instead. But her parenting reportedly didnapost go down well with other members of the family.

Except for me, it’s Twitter. Or Instagram. Or Facebook. We’ve just given my son Zac a mobile phone, and my husband Steve was trying to discuss setting out some rules and regulations for letting him use it. I started off listening intently, then my phone pinged. To the Twitter! Without even thinking, I just started to read the tweet someone had sent me, leaving poor Steve to drone on without an audience. I didn’t even consider how rude I was being. But a study by Stanford University psychology expert Nir Eyal has made me sit up and pay attention – literally.    For most of his career Eyal has worked in the video gaming and advertising industries, where he learned all about motivating and manipulating users.Now, as a parent, he realises that in a world of digital distraction there are going to be two kinds of people – those who let their attention and lives be controlled and coerced by othersand thosewho can proudly call themselves “indistractable”.He says: “Becoming indistractable is the most important skill for the st century and it’s the one that many parents fail to teach kids.” Yikes. I can’t even do it, never mind teach it.    Our attention is valuable and has a price – and we need to be aware of how much time we are dedicating to a particular activity... and who is benefiting from it. This has made me more alert to what goes on in our house – and I’m becoming painfully aware just how distracted we are, and how it affects our relationships and priorities. Take Zac. Even though I restrict his time on his PlayStation, he will come in from school and beg me: “Mum,I do all my homework really quickly, can I play a few games ” It sounds like a reasonable request – but his motivation here is not his homework… it’s the game. But I’m not one to talk. I’ve had my nose buried in my phone or tablet for the last few years, and the overall impact that behaviour has on my kids and marriage is a negative one.

Sunaina Paul needs a liver transplant and fears she may die before she manages to find a match. Tragically the -year-old, from Birmingham, has deteriorated alarmingly in past few months. To make matters worse, she has rare Blood Type B, drastically restricting the chance of a donor.Next Spring, all adults will automatically join the Organ Donation Register – but for Sunaina that’s too long to wait, Birmingham Live reports.When asked how long she could have left she replies: “How long is a piece of string  “I might not get it in time. I have to face that. I don’t know what is going to happen.    “My liver might not survive for another six months. I take a day at a time.” According to the NHS organ donation website , people are currently waiting for a transplant in the UK. Further statistics state that although there has been an increase in the proportion of registrations to the Organ Donor Register for those from an ethnic minority background, all minority groups continue to be under-represented. Between st April  and st March  there were  actual donors from an ethnic minority background out of a total UK population of  million, whilst , patients awaited transplants. Born with biliary artesia, which blocks the bile ducts so bile builds up in the liver and damages it, the clock has always been ticking.  An operation at Birmingham Children’s Hospital when she was an infant helped slow that clock. But in February this year, Sunaina, who lives in Edgbaston, became more ill than ever before. After fighting sporadic liver infections since she was , often lasting months at a time, the recent bout has proved the final straw. “Usually I have two weeks of intravenous antibiotics and it’s fine,” says Sunaina. “I had that and came home, and they put me on oral antibiotics. It was supposed to be a six to eight-week course.    “But I just got the infection back and even worse. That was February and I am still on them now.” Matters have reached the stage where only a liver transplant offers the chance of a longer le – but so far the outlook remains bleak. “I was really optimistic in the beginning,” she says. “I thought I would have it in a few weeks. But a month passed, two months passed – and it’s six months now. “I am trying to be positive but I am also trying to be realistic because I don’t want to lie to myself. “It’s not just me that’s out there who has this rare blood group. I know there has got to be others.  “Some doctors seem really positive and believe I can get a liver. Other doctors are telling me to prepare myself because it might not happen. “The first time I heard that, I think I was in a bit of a shock. I don’t really cry about it.” Despite her brave smile, Sunaina is suffering badly. “I am always in pain,” she confesses. “Constantly. It is always there. “If anything, I moan about the pain because the pain is just ridiculous. It’s like eight and nine out of ten when they ask me to score it. “When they look at me, people are like ‘Oh you look amazing! How can you be ill ’ “I look okay but inside I am slowly dying. “It is what it is. I try to see people and enjoy special quality time with them but the nurses come three times a day so I’m not really able to get out much.    “Besides,I’m in pain or feeling really sick, I don’t want to do anything anyway. Most of the time I feel really drowsy, tired, fatigued. I sleep a lot.” When Sunaina is alone she thinks about the possibility of a transplant. She thinks about it a lot. “It’s a horrible situation because I know that someone has to pass away to be able to give me le,” she says. “It’s something I struggle with sometimes. “It’s just not nice someone having to pass away in order to save me. “I think until it happens to maybe a family member or a friend, you don’t realise how important it is to save someone’s le. “In general, we don’t donate as much as we should. I don’t really understand why. With one body, one person, you can save so many lives.”  Sunaina has had to grow up biliary artesia – and has fared better than some, her mum says. “She was my first child,” says Siannne Paul, . “I had no idea, no concept of what babies were meant to look like. “She was jaundiced. The nurses basically said ‘It’s normal, give it two or three days and the jaundice will settle. “On an Asian person jaundice is completely dferent. She had a greeny colour to her, and the whites to her eyes were slightly pale. “After five days it didn’t settle. A month went by, and the family GP saw she had a distended stomach and an odd greenish colour, but he just said it was just colic. “By the time she was six weeks old, my health visitor said we should see somebody  about it.” "},{"url":null,"title":"woman shares shocking x ray","story":"NewsWoman shares shocking X-ray snaps after swallowing engagement ring during bad dreamJenna Evans, , said she was dreaming about a sketchy situation involving bad guys on a high speed train when she popped the custom-made diamond in her mouth and gulpedShareCommentsByAmber HicksTfany Lo:,  SEP NewsJenna went to hospital and an X-ray showed the ring stuck in her intestines \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

Jennaaposs Facebook post in full So, in case you missed it, I swallowed my engagement ring in my sleep on Tuesday night. I actually remember doing it, but I thought I was dreaming, so I went back to sleep. On Wednesday morning, I realized my ring was not on my hand and had to wake Bob Howell up and tell him that I swallowed my engagement ring.I donapost think he believed me right away. We laughed pretty hard for about an hour and a half, called my mom, laughed until we were crying, googled aposdo other adults swallow rings because kids do it all the time, but apparently itaposs less common for adults. I went to urgent care where I struggled to explain why I was there, because I was laughing crying so hard. The doctor ordered an Xray and seemed pretty shocked when she walked back in with a second doctor and showed me that sure enough, my ring was right there in my stomach!They called a gastroenterologist and decided it would be best NOT to let nature take its course.Before I left, she recommended seeing a sleep specialist as well.Bobby took me to the GI doctor where I got to tell a whole new group of doctors and nurses that yes, I swallowed my engagement ring. At this point, I could definitely feel it in my guts, it was starting to really hurt and make us nervous. They decided an upper endoscopy was just the thing and said donapost worry its not big deal, but please sign this release form just in case you die. Then I cried a lot because I would be SO MADI died. I waited a long time for that damn engagement ring and I WILL marry Bobby Howell DAMNIT.So they push the sleepy drugs, and right as I started to feel that wave of warm and fuzzy sleep I said to the doctors, Bobby would LOVE this. Everything went great, they found my ring just beyond my stomach in my intestines, retrieved it and gave it to Bobby, not me.Apparently I donapost do great with anesthesia because I came out of it hysterically crying and was totally inconsolable.They got me out of there as quickly as possible and gave us a list of what I could eatSo I demanded that Bobby take me to In n Out and Chickfila. He loves me, so he drove me through In n Out and got me a double-double, mustard fried with cheese fries and a chocolate shake but put his foot down and said no to Chickfila.I probably cried as I stuffed cheese fries in my mouth. I asked for my ring, he said no. Thank God I had that chocolate shake.Bobby finally gave my ring back this morning - I promised not to swallow it again, weaposre still getting married and all is right in the world.  "},{"url":null,"title":"inside blind bears horrific plight","story":"NewsInside blind bears horric plight as he is tied up, muzzled and forced to fightEXCLUSIVE: WARNING - DISTRESSING CONTENT: The animal, named Playful Pooh, endured years of cruel bear-baiting in front of large crowds before he was rescuedShareCommentsByDave Burke:,  SEP NewsPlayful Pooh was left blind by cruel treatment after being captured and made to fight \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

Heaposs a traumatised bear, Marie Chambers, wildle campaigns manager at World Animal Protection, told .  He still has a lot of behavioural issues. Heaposs had times when he doesnapost move, our partners have had to find a way to make him move. They discovered that what worked best was to fill big bones with food and start spreading it out. Marie believes Pooh lost his sight either in a fight with a dog or due to vicious treatment by his captors. He wasnapost born blind, she said. We have no idea how he was blinded, but itaposs very likely to have happened when he was baited with a dog with sharp claws, but he could have been hurt by a trainer.  And sadly other bears continue to suffer the same fate. Marie estimates there are around  bears used for entertainment purposes in Pakistan - with the majority forced to perform dances, and around  being baited. Their teeth are broken, their claws are removed and they are permanently muzzled as they undergo training for fights, which attract large crowds. She said: They donapost have a le. Ten years ago there were a lot of bear baiting events, but thanks to some great work by our partners this has now gone down.  However itaposs now gone underground, which makes it more dficult to stop. During these traumatising fights, a bear is tied by its neck, restricting its movement. It is then set on by a dog. It has no way to escape, she said. The fights go on for three minutes and the bearsapos injuries are rarely treated properly. They donapost have sharp teeth or claws because these are normally removed when they are clubs. Dogs are viewed to have wonthey make the bear roll on the floor. The practice - introduced by British colonisers more than a century ago - was made illegal in , but persists in some rural areas to this day.  In , there were estimated to be around  bears being made to fight, a number which fell to around  in . Madeeha Manzoor, finance director at the Bioresource Research Centre, said: When the bears are poached in their tender ages from the wild, the first mental shock they suffer is the killing of their mother. Later on in le this is followed by the removal breaking of their teeth and claws. Along with the piercing of their muzzle with a burning hot metal in order to put a nose ring in for controlling the bear. As they grow, they have to undergo training to create obedience in them. They are made to dance on a hot plate, as their feet burn they become in full control of the owner. Pooh was a baiting bear that added to his misery as an adult bear, he had to stand in an arena to fight against dogs.

Heading east towards City Square, to the right past Daniels brae, you pass the Burn Bar.“A quick look inside would probably see brothers Pat and Jim Sturrock pouring sumptuous pints of heavy, and Eddie Greenan would normally be standing at the far end of the bar.“A bit further on, you would be at the Blackness Road junction before heading down the Blackie past the Blue Mountains, and now entering the bustling shopping expanse of the West Port.“With the Globe Bar visible in a rear-view mirror, crossing over Tay Street reveals the Overgate. This historic artery had a pulse and an energy all to itself.“Those memorable stretches of the old town nurtured the players who turned out for Dundee Harp FC.”Rob revealed that Arbroath had a star defender, a local lad called Tom O’Kane.Rob went on: “He took no prisoners and could leather a ball from one end of the pitch to the other.“At the beginning of the - season, Tom was poached and somehow persuaded to leave his home team to sign for Dundee Harp.“The town of Arbroath was outraged at the smash-and-grab by Harp.“Were underhand means used to attract O’Kane “Probably.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/06/image.jpg1_.396679.jpg ","title":"blether exhibition on dundee uniteds greatest gaffer jim mclean is wonderful","story":"Tannadice Park currently hosts a wonderful initiative as Dundee United remembers the glory years under their greatest-ever manager.Tom Cairns, chairman of the Dundee United Business Club, along with several other volunteers, host the ‘The United in Memories’ display at the ground.Said Tom: “This year, it features The Jim McLean Years and can be viewed every Wednesday until late November .“On display is an array of interesting memorabilia encompassing the managerial career of the most successful manager in Dundee United’s history.“The event is staffed by knowledgeable volunteers from Dundee United Business Club.”This has got to be a must-see event for every United fan – and, indeed, every football fan.Admission is free via the main door at Tannadice Park from pm until .pm and has easy disabled persons access."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/07/5d382714055389.83294295-e1564477706176.jpg ","title":"dundee boss mcpake to shake things up for alloa clash following recent losses","story":"Dundee boss James McPake will ring the changes for tomorrow’s Championship clash with Alloa Athletic.On the back of a disastrous derby display in their - defeat at Tannadice, the Dark Blues were dumped out of the Challenge Cup by League Two Elgin.Manager James McPake will certainly make one change but is likely to make more after two disappointing results.Goalkeeper Calum Ferrie was sent off last Sunday and will serve a suspension this weekend.

That early-season success, however, has come as no surprise to Robbie.“I know Ian, I meet him now and again because he stays near me. I know what he’s been through, it’s the nature of being at most clubs in the Championship,” he said.“Most of the players are on one-year deals.

Others don’t have the finances to make mistakesso only hand out one-year contracts.“Sometimes you make mistakes and it’s good they are only on a year but the ones who do really well, they move on and it’s part and parcel of things.“But Ian did well last year and he’s done a really good job again at the start of the season.“Ian’s really good at getting a team spirit. He gets them working for each other and they get good energy in their team. They’ll be a force this year.”On top of that, Robbie admires the way the man who had a troubled spell at Tannadice more than a decade ago has resurrected his managerial career.He added: “As all managers know, we go up and down. We have good periods, then we have dficult periods.“I’ve had that as well and it’s about resilience. Ian’s had that and he’s shown it. He’s gone to a club and shown what capabilities he’s got.“He’s built something at Ayr and it’s like anything, it’s about getting time.“If you get three or four years, you get the chance to build something and get stability.“The problem in the game now is that you are getting two or three months.

It will fit in well with all of the regeneration that has taken place at the waterfront.#But Ashley Squire, from Coldside, insisted there were other issues that also had to be ironed out, saying: “It’s a nice design but there are issues with parking at the Waterfront.“Perhaps they could revise the design to include more parking spaces for families wishing to use the playground.”Council officers say they have only “very high” aspirations for the design and features of the play park, which is expected to have large numbers of visitors due to its proximity to the VA.In a design brief published as part of the bidding process, they express the hope that the facility will be “unique and very memorable”, with interactive elements such as keypads, buttons and features triggered by sensors.#Planners also want to see it illuminated at night, like the VA and the adjacent Discovery. “The intention for the play area is that it should be innovative in design, and ambitious in its unique identity,” they said.“There are fundamental starting points for the designers involved: that it is to be themed on whales, and that a digital element should be included.“The play area needs to be suitable for all ages and needs.”The council is leaning heavily on Dundee’s historical whaling trade as inspiration for the play area. As well as specying that the play area should be the shape of a whale it also wants kids to be able to create whale song.Officers have even alluded to the bowhead whale – the preferred whale of the one-time Dundee whaler – as the ideal inspiration for any design.Following the construction and opening of the park, the council aims to form a Whale Park Engagement Group with experts from Dundee Science Centre and the University of St Andrews to promote sustainable marine practices.The launch of the design competition comes after Andy Scott, creator of the Kelpies sculptures in Falkirk, scrapped a plan for a whale sculpture in Waterfront Place.Much like the play area, Mr Scott’s steel design would have been le-sized, inspired by the bowhead whale, and built as a tribute to the whaling trade.However, the Scottish sculptor had to let his design – which he drew up at no cost to the council – “swim off into the sunset” after agents acting for the local authority ignored his pitch."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/03/DNic_Taw_Teams_Podcast-2-e1553252194766-940x564.jpg ","title":"special day for former dundee united star jack 96 as he meets clubs youngest player","story":"Dundee United#s oldest living former player received a late birthday present when he went to watch the current crop training and was given a signed top.Jack Butchart turned  last Sunday and was visited by first-team players at his care home in Balhousie St Ronan’s on Monday.Staff fixed up a trip to United’s training session at St Andrews University, where Jack met the youngest first-team player, Chris Mochrie, plus manager Robbie Neilson.He said: “It has been a big, big surprise.

Congratulations to the committee, helpers, exhibitors, sponsors and everyone  involved on another cracking day out."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor august 16 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,I would like to record my thanks to everyone who contributed to the running of the Mid Argyll Show this year.It is great for visitors to see these traditions and talent brought together and seeing young people participating in events assuring that these customs are in safe hands for the future.Thank you again to all involved in running the show.Councillor Anne HornSir,I read with some interest that a new dentist was coming to town in Lochgilphead to set up a practice, which I am sure we look forward to.The local NHS trust cannot seem to lure one to the area to work at the Mid Argyll Hospital practice, which I think is unfortunate for all concerned. We do at the moment have a dentist and fully qualied staff and are happy with their work.Rumour has it that the aforementioned dentist and staff will be taking on patients from Mid Argyll Hospital, which I presume they tend to already.But the practice is to lose its local NHS patients, so they will deal solely with patients who require dental treatment from the hospital. I think this situation leaves the NHS patients in limbo.I am sure we would rather that the current dentist and all of her staff be given a chance to voice their opinions on this matter as much and as well as the local populace.Yes, it will be brilliant to have both dentists in the town. There is the possibility that those on the local list who are currently treated well by the dental department at the hospital maybe still seen by the dentist and her staff, but I would like this to be confirmed by the local NHS trust.Brian MacDonald, CrinanSir,Hundreds of people across Scotland have been helped through their exam results by a local group of Skills Development Scotlandcareers advisers.Based across the north of Scotland, the advisers were part of a team taking calls at the SDS Exam Results Helpline from am on results day.The helpline is a vital service, supporting young people and their families at what can be one of the most stressful times of their lives.Expert advice and guidance is available all year round, not just on results day.Our professionally qualied careers advisers are working in every state secondary school in Scotland and from our network of high street centres across the country.In schools, careers services are delivered one-to-one, in classrooms and at school events across all year groups, supporting young people to develop the skills to make informed career decisions throughout their lives. There is also support for parents and carers.At SDS centres customers can get information, advice and guidance about jobs, the local labour market, training courses and apprenticeships as well as how to prepare for interviews and help with CVs and applications.The work of SDS careers advisers in schools and centres is supported by Scotland’s careers website myworldofwork, where you can access advice  hours a day. It is packed with career information, advice and tools such as the CV builder. There is also a dedicated exam results section.Details of the local SDS centres are available at myworldofwork centres and information about events and opportunities is also available on Facebook.Pauline Graham, Project Manager for the SDS Exam Results HelplineSir,I had a great time at this year#s Islay Show. It was fantastic to speak to so many of my constituents.It was also wonderful to see many local business stalls promoting Islay#s dynamic and booming economy.The show was well attended with lots of families, both local and visitors, having a fun day out and luckily the sun was shining most of the day.A huge thanks to all the organisers and everyone  who contributed to the event.Councillor Alastair RedmanSir,I have real concerns about the deteriorating condition of some Argyll cemeteries.Constituents from Islay recently joined Councillor Alastair Redman in highlighting the poor upkeep of cemeteries in the area he represents.Councillor Redman reported that there were also problems at other cemeteries in his ward, including the cemetery at Carradale in East Kintyre.I understand that Argyll and Bute Council confirmed that they now, at last, have plans in place to address the problems at Kilnaughton.It remains disappointing, however, that things are allowed to deteriorate to the extent that the maintenance of cemeteries has become a matter of public concern.Frankly, it is very surprising that a cemetery where interments are actually still taking place has been undermined in this way and there must surely be an obligation to ensure this doesn’t happen.My experience is that communities in the Highlands and Islands pay special regard to the final resting places of fellow members of their communities and will be perplexed to discover that they appear to be uncared-for.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSP"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures august 16 2019","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowTayvallich reader Colin MacInnes captured this photo of these two fluffy cygnets at the Corran Burn in Lochgilphead back in July.A couple of adult swans were spotted floating nearby at the time on Loch Fyne and Loch Gilp around Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"an album with atmosphere and depth","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowExtract of an album review by Marc HigginsThis striking album is a collaboration between singer songwriter Sheila K Cameron and John Saich and Mags Russell of Argyll#s Wild Biscuit productions.In  they collaborated on an album called More Like a River than a Road. These songs were associated with the Tlell River on Hai Gwaii in Canada. These tracks, with a selection of later collaborations, make up River to Sea from Tlell to Tiree. The title documents Sheila#s journey from the coast of Canada to Tiree, where the track All You Really Need is the Sea was written.This artist is probably best described as a folk blues singer. She has the sharply observing, descriptive eye of the classic singer songwriter troubadour and while her voice is given gravitas and character by time, she swings and has the timing of the blues singer.Wild Biscuit#s musical accompaniment gives Sheila#s characterful voice depth and presence. The menacing guitar on I#ve Waited a Long Time and the atmospheric double bass and keyboards on Where the Pebbles Grind and Scrape complement Cameron#s lyrics and singing.Remembering Mr Toast is an atmospheric and evocative, less bombastic or overblown Scottish Jim Morrison, finding real beauty in a melancholic memory. The delicate hesitant guitar and reflective lyrics continue on Don#t Sigh and Go on Then, beautul, bitter sweet country love songs. All You Really Need is the Sea and Deep and Real are spiritual songs, again moving between an intimate relationship to consider the huge landscape and the restorative natural world.Is it blues, country, easy listening, folk or poetry set to delicate sympathetic music  It doesn#t matter. Close your eyes, listen to Sheila#s rich voice, with its cadence and rhythm. Enjoy the flow of words and the pictures they conjure on this warm and captivating set of recordings."},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll course draws skippers and compliments","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowMid Argyll Radio Sailing put its toe in the water last Saturday when skippers arrived with their model radio controlled yachts from the club#s first competition.Several Scottish clubs # Ayr Bay Radio Yacht Club, Greenock, Rhu and Paisley # travelled to Mid Argyll joined by others from as far afield as the Preston area.A total of  yachts raced each other around the club#s Loch a Bahrain course near Cairnbaan.A steady wind from the south produced some exciting close encounters results and near misses.

Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream. That is roughly the equivalent of only being able to have a small cup of tea and one can of soft drink per day. In addition, they may have to limit the potassium and phosphate in their diet which means missing out on enjoying foods like chocolate, bananas and tomatoes.We want to make the kidney diet about all the things patients can eat and bring enjoyment back into food # which is why we have launched the Kidney Kitchen.We hope that the Kidney Kitchen will mean everyone living with kidney disease in Scotland can enjoy healthy and delicious food with their family and friends.If you are, oryou know a kidney patient, check out www.kidneykitchen.orgEwen Maclean, advocacy officer Scotland, Kidney Care UKSir,The death of a pet cat can come as a shock, and many owners can find it dficult to come to terms with their loss.The death of a pet is not always seen as a signicant loss, leading some people to hide their feelings which can cause them to feel very alone.On Grief Awareness Day, August , Cats Protection is highlighting its free and confidential Paws to Listen support service, so people facing the loss of a cat do not have to feel alone.The service is available on   .

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

There is a short delay in production of first gold from our previous expectations, but a stockpile of ore will be accumulated during this period which will provide an opportunity to exceed targets later in the year.#The combination of the gold price being in excess of £, per ounce, and the pipeline of projects that we anticipate will result from our Grampian exploration work, bode well for the company#s long-term outlook.#The people of Cairndow, though, have known for years of metal deposits in Glen Fyne.One local man said: #I have been around these hills for  years and I remember mines in Glen Fyne, at Inverchorchan and further up the glen.#The Cononish mine and the area they are talking about in Glen Fyne is not far apart at all, just over the hill in fact.#It is believed that gold and lead were the targets of miners in decades long past."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands women stand in lochgilphead","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowColin CameronA movement to empower women of Scotland to stand for political office chose Lochgilphead as a location for a national event.Held on Saturday September , Scotland#s Women Stand was the culmination of a nine-month-long campaign at the Scottish Parliament.The final event had its base at the parliament, with a small number of regional hubs around Scotland # including one at Argyll and Bute Council headquarters at Kilmory.Scotland’s Women Stand, through a combination of information and inspiring events, aimed to bring together women and equip them with the knowledge they need to take their next steps in politics.Live streamed from the Scottish Parliament were guest speakers Talat Yaqoob from Women :, Minister Christina McKelvie, Deputy Presiding Officer Linda Fabiani MSP, Patrycja Kupiec from YWCA and Lee Chalmers, Founder of The Parliament Project.After a  discussion, attendees across the country heard from, and asked questions of, Member of the Scottish Youth Parliament Caitie Dundas, community councillor Kay Marie Hughes, Councillor Alison Evison and Alison Johnstone MSP.Hub events followed in the afternoon, with a discussion in Lochgilphead on how to get more involved in politics.

With the world championship they also secured the Champion of Champions accolade for the fourth year in a row.The band#s success has been remarkable since being formed with Inveraray  youngsters just  years ago by current leaders Pipe Major Stuart Liddell and lead drummer Steven McWhirter. The band rose rapidly through the ranks, winning the world title, and many others besides, at every grade in which it competed.Inveraray is now established as the Grade  band to beat and players are attracted from around the world # but regardless of its international make-up, Inveraray still lies at its heart.That fact was clearly in evidence as the reception was crowned by a magical performance by the world champions, enjoyed by all and captured for posterity on the many mobile phones raised to the heavens.Speaking as he presented the quaich, Councillor MacMillan congratulated the band on its success, achieved in a relatively short period of time thanks to the dedication of all concerned.Argyll and Bute MP Brenan O#Hara said the band#s success has been #absolutely remarkable# and quipped that Inveraray#s success had turned him into a #born-again piper#, so inspired has he been.Pipe Major Stuart Liddell, Inveraray born and bred and from a line of superb pipers, said: #I want to thank all band members for their hard work over the past several years, and of course their families who have put up with so much and made sacrices for it to happen # particularly those with young families. It is greatly appreciated.#He added: #Thanks to the town of Inveraray and everyone  who has supported us.

It forms an integral part of the councilrsquos strategy to build on the investment already made in the Borders Railway, which currently terminates adjacent to the Lowood site in Tweedbank.ldquoThe council purchased the land following an appropriate investment appraisal process and the development of a detailed financial model, which followed the Treasuryrsquos lsquoGreen Bookrsquo best practice.ldquoCouncillors considered the business case in full and three specic reports in December , January  and May  prior to the purchase.ldquoThese reports included the necessary information on site valuations, now released publicly."},{"url":null,"title":"mp-lamont-join-cross-party-bid-get-eu-deal","story":"BORDERS MP John Lamont is joining a cross-party group set up to get a deal with the EU through Parliament.Around  Conservative, Labour and independent MPs launched lsquoMPs for a dealrsquo on Tuesday.And the memberfor Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk says he is signing up, in a bid to find an alternative to a no-deal Brexit.Explaining his decision, Mr Lamont said: ldquoI am a democrat, who was disappointed with the EU Referendum result.\"But I also think the result needs to be implemented and done so in a sensible way.\"Thatrsquos why Irsquom joining this cross-party group to get a deal approved by Parliament, get us out of the EU and move the country on.

Last weekend, we were fortunate to be invited to an orchard in East Lothian to pick some apples.As we entered Lewis stopped for a moment and said ldquoWow.He has seen apples growing on trees before, but I think it was the sight of so many apple trees together all in fruit. It was a visual feast, even for me.And so we picked some apples, in the company of a friend who uses local fruits to make juices. Lewis just couldnrsquot decide which apple tree to pick from first. He wandered about in awe, eyeing the apples.There were many ieties in the orchard, but I sadly canrsquot remember all their names.ldquoI think Lewis is in paradise, I remarked as I watched him.ldquoWhatrsquos paradise  asked my nearly six-year-old inquisitive daughter Skye. I had to think about my answer.ldquoSome people say itrsquos a perfect place, but other people say itrsquos a perfect feeling.ldquoCan be both then, maybe at the same time Skye replied.I smiled and agreed. We both watched Lewis, as he wondered under the small trees, dancing with delight at the sight of so many delicious looking ripe apples.ldquoYea said Skye, ldquoLewis is definitely having paradykes.ldquoWe say in paradise I said, in a bit of a teachery tone.ldquoBut you can have it too insisted Skye ldquobecause itrsquos a happy feeling.How could I disagree  ldquoYoursquore right I smiled.ldquoThis one Lewis called out. The apple was just out of reach and so his sister ran up and carefully picked it for him, in the way she had been shown. Lewis studied the apple before eating, savouring the moment.He was indeed both in, and having, paradise.We collected a small basket full of apples of dferent ieties, and after giving our thanks we started our walk back to the car. As we meandered along the path Skye asked for a story about an apple.So I told the story of Johnny Appleseed. Then a riddle ldquoA wee roond hoose, sometimes red, sometimes green, the maist bent lum ye hae ersquoer seen. Nae windaes or doors tae open or slide, it has a secret, therersquos a star inside.The answer of course is an apple. The bent lumbeing the stalk, and the star being the seed core when the apple is cut horizontally through the middle.As we walked, I reflected on the symbolism of the apple, and how it has been used in folklore and legend. And of course there is the famous apple which fell on Newtonrsquos head.Well it probably didnrsquot really fall on his head, as that seems a later embellishment, but for sure Newton himself often told the tale of the falling apple and the inspiration it gave him. He lived well into old age, and I think he understood the power of a story to convey the meaning of an event or idea.We approached our car and I took my sonrsquos hand to keep him safe as we crossed the road.ldquoDad he said looking up at me, ldquoyou are my walking apple.I laughed at the image and wondered what he meant. Was he referring to my rotund body shape perhaps ldquoWhy am I your walking apple  I asked him.ldquoCause I love apples and you are walking with me he said, with a sense of poetic meaning only a young child can convey.I was momentarily overwhelmed by this simple but moving comment. Lewis, aged only four, conveyed a powerful symbolism for apples that morning.The apple falling from the tree in front of Isaac Newton was a symbol of scientic discovery. For my son, an apple is a symbol of love. And my son loves the apples he eats, and the ones which walk with him.

This occurs when cats come in contact with chemicals such as fuels, lubricants and some solvents.Usually, self-grooming causes the cat to ingest the toxin, or in some cases they inhale it which can cause a severe pneumonia.The toxin can cause problems throughout the body and on the skin too.When Jonny had examined Tikka, he immediately sent her to our Tranent surgery for blood tests and intravenous fluids as she was dehydrated.Fortunately, Tikkarsquos blood tests were normal so she did not have kidney damage.She tolerated her fluid therapy well and was soon looking much happier however several areas of her skin had become red and she was losing hair especially on her front legs.Tikka did not want to eat or drink. She was given analgesics, antibiotics and soothing cream was applied to her skin.Our nursing staff ensured she was as comfortable as possible and as she was not eating by herself, they fed her via a feeding tube several times a day.Her skin became red and thickened and some areas sloughed off.She had to have cream applied frequently to the damaged skin, just asshe had suffered burns.Tikka was finally well enough to go home where Mrs Taylor continued to treat her skin. Tikka started eating well again and is improving daily. Her fur is regrowing and soon she will have her beautul coat again.Now Mrs Taylor was very vigilant and realised she had to do something to help Tikka immediately.If you suspect your cat may have had contact with petroleum-based substances, please contact your vet as soon as possible.Often the first sign you may have is your pet smells of petrol or diesel.There may be vomiting or diarrhoea. They may actually be dizzy or confused or showing other neurological problems such as staggering and trembling. There may be respiratory signs such as coughing or wheezingthey have inhaled the chemical.Do not try to make your pet vomit as this can exacerbate the toxicity.The first thing you should do is try to remove the chemical from the fur.In many cases, it is best to bring your pet straight to your vets as soon as possible. The nursing staff at veterinary practices are well trained in dealing with intoxication emergencies.With petroleum products there are three main areas where the body can be affected: l The internal organs especially the kidneys, so your vet will want to blood sample your pet to check for any damage to the kidneys or other organsl The respiratory system can be affected especiallythe toxin is inhaled. This often happensthe patient vomits then inhales some resulting in a very severe pneumonia. Your vet may wish to take x-rays to check for this.l The animalrsquos skin can also be affected. The petroleum products sit on the fur then soaks through to the skin where they are held in contact by the fur. This causes them to act as a caustic substance, damaging the skin and hair follicles. Often the first sign before the skin damage is seen is hair loss due to the follicle damage.The treatment for these causes is supportive at all times. There are no specic antidotes. Intravenous fluids are administered, this helps overcome dehydration and helps eliminate toxins from the body.Analgesics are given to help keep pain from damaged skin and internal organs to a minimum.Antibiotics are given, as damaged skin is very prone to secondary infection and they are always givenpneumonia is present. Skin treatment has to be intense to keep infection to a minimum and encourage damaged skin to recover.Thankfully Tikka has made an excellent recovery, thanks to Mrs Taylorrsquos quick thinking and the intense nursing care given by the nursing team at Dunedin Vets."},{"url":null,"title":"church-session-clerk-steps-12-years-service","story":"Recognised across the country as a first class instrument, it is one of only two such organs in the Lothians and was donated to the church in  by the Kirkwood family of Haddington.The work, which was funded by St Michaelrsquos, is a fitting swansong for Alex Shaw who retired as session clerk on Tuesday after  years in the post and oversaw the project.He said the organ, which made a ldquopositive contribution at church services, especially at times such as Easter and Christmas, required a ldquosubstantial overhaul, the first phase of which was now complete.It was, however, out of commission during the recent restoration and repair of the kirk building itself which included repairs to the stonework.Mr Shaw said: ldquoWhile the work was being done to the church the organ had to be completely sealed off and covered up because of the dust.Then the first phase of the organ renovation, which was a separate project, got underway and took six months to complete. The organ was out of action for two years while all the conservation work at St Michaelrsquos was being done but has been played again since mid-July.During this time a digital organ, linked to the kirkrsquos sound system, was used as a temporary measure.Restoration work to the Lewis organ, which is situated in the church sanctuary, included some leathering work to the bellows and electrical and mechanical repairs carried out including replacement of the old electrical transformer unit.The instrument was originally made by Lewis and Company, founded by Thomas Christopher Lewis , one of the leading organ builders of late th century Britain.Mr Shaw said further restoration of the organ would be carried out in the futurefunding was obtained.

She will be succeeded by Mr Lyonrsquos we, Ingrid.As session clerk, Mr Shaw looked after the management of St Michaelrsquos, working closely with Mr Lyon he dealt with correspondence and requests to use the church, and helped people from all over the world in their quest to find out more about family members buried in the adjacent cemetery.Mr Shaw was involved in arrangements for Remembrance Sunday, the annual Musselburgh Festival Kirkinrsquo service. and a committee set up for the  Riding of the Marches.Although the couple have lived in Longniddry for the past  years, they used to live in Musselburgh.Mr Shaw is from the Honest Toun and has been associated with St Michaelrsquos from an early age, having attended its Sunday School and joined the th Inveresk Boys Brigade.He also served with the  Squadron, Musselburgh Air Cadets.He has been an Elder at the church for just more than  years.

They come from erse backgrounds, but all of them have made a success of bringing the distinctive pleasures of Scottish food and drink to the natives as well as tourists.BOSTONTHE Haven occupies a site in Perkins Street, in Jamaica Plains Hyde Square. The locals know the neighbourhood as J.P. As to its name, one theory, according to the local TV station WBZ-TV, is that it came about because local people benefited from the Triangle trade of sugar, rum and slaves.The Haven is owned by Jason Waddleton, . He attended school in Stonehaven, then went to Glasgow University. His kitchen career had begun in Stonehavens Tolbooth restaurant in Glasgow he worked in Blackfriars, in the Merchant City, and Jinty McGintys, on Ashton Lane. He moved to Boston in , was named Best Bartender in Boston , and started The Haven in , naming it after the Stonehaven fish and chip shop that created the Deep Fried Mars Bar.The idea behind the new operation was, he says, to bring authentic Scottish cuisine to the United States. \"We make our own haggis, black pudding and Lorne sausage, and we serve tattie scones, Scotch eggs, bridies, oatcakes instead of bread we serve haddock for fish and chips. We do cranachan ndash and, of course, deep-fried Mars bars.\"Funny thing, the haggis. Before opening The Haven, he was asked repeatedly, \"Youre not going to sell haggis, are you \" And suddenly he knew that, yes, he had to serve it. \"Because people have a strong opinion about it,\" he told the Eater Boston food magazine a couple of years ago. \"Theres this interplay over a dish, which is hilarious. I dont know many dishes that can create that level of interest or harmony or disharmony at the same moment.\"\"We serve exclusively Scottish beer,\" he tells us. \"Last year we were the biggest seller of Belhaven in the US. Harviestoun, Orkney Brewery, Thistly Cross Cider, Traquair House and Innis and Gunn all feature on the menu as well as Tennents.\" Whisky  \"Only single malt,\" he says firmly. \"No bourbon, rye or Irish whiskey. No rum or vodka. We do sell Scottish gins, though: Rock Rose, Edinburgh Gin, Caorunn, Hendricks.\"In common with many bars, The Haven stages regular events, including some with local purveyors. The Spurs-Newcastle English Premier game was screened recently. It partners with the Scotch Malt Whisky Society for monthly Scotch nights. Its annual Burns Night runs to five nights a week. Waddleton says his pub was integral to the upcoming moving of the Burns Statue to its original location in the Fenway area after being in the wrong place for  years. ldquoAt Hogmanay in  and  we replicated the famed Stonehaven Hogmanay fireballs ndash on a much smaller scale, of course ndash to local fascination and it become the first time the Fireballs were displayed outside Scotland.\"He remembers the crowds that surged into The Haven on the night of Scotlands independence referendum, to watch the unfolding coverage on television when the bar became the \"de facto media centre for US TV coverage\".What are the joys and challenges of running a busy pub in a city like Boston  \"I love the hustle and bustle where every day is dferent and there are always new challenges and another event just round the corner,\" he says. \"Being in a tourist-centric city like Boston affords the opportunity to meet people from all over the world throughout the year whilst keeping a connection to home.\"The Haven, it turns out, is a home-from-home for touring Scottish musicians when they play in Boston.

As it says on its website, it brings the \"true essence of pub culture\" to the Windy City. Its pedigree is illustrated by the fact that it holds a certicate, awarded by Whisky Magazine, as A Great Whisky Bar of the World.Theres an unmistakeable Scottish flavour to its extensive menu: Christine MacLeods smoked mackerel patetattie skins, a Robert the Bruce burger, the James Watt sandwich, Hebridean leek pie.The pub, on North Clark Street, is run by Colin Cameron, who was born and raised in Broughty Ferry. \"I was a police officer in Forfar, leaving in  after becoming disillusioned after seeing so many of my friends growing moustaches and buying Ford Fiestas ndash not that theres anything wrong with either, but I was looking for something dferent,\" Cameron says.\"I came to Chicago to visit a cousin who was living here and after a few months of vacation we were talking and decided Chicago needed a Scottish pub. He owned a building that had an old closed restaurant space that had been proving dficult to rent and we decided to give it a go. Our joint restaurant experience was I worked for a couple of months as a bartender in the railway workers social club in Dundee before I joined the police.\"He spent the next two months repurposing the space to resemble what he and his cousin thought a pub should be. It was all done on a shoestring budget, using the equipment from the closed restaurant, and antique furniture. Most of the antiques, it turns out, came from Loves Auctions in Perth.\"We finally opened the doors in July of  on a wing and a prayer. I stumbled along learning lessons every day and gradually turned the Duke of Perth into a thriving business. We concentrated on having the best Scottish beer and whisky we could get our hands on.\"Very few people had any knowledge of single malt at this time but we went out and procured every malt we could get our hands on starting with about a dozen which gradually grew to over . We also started selling McEwanrsquos export, which we were able to get in draught.\"At this time there were no micro-brews available and most beer sold in the States was American-style lagers. We found ourselves in a great situation with great products we were passionate about. Very quickly we became McEwanrsquos number one seller in the States ndash we might have been one of only a few places selling it, though.\"We also set out wanting to have good-quality, home-made comfort food. We decided to have a few traditional pub items like fish and chips and shepherdrsquos pie but also to have the American staples like first-class burgers that we gave names to, such as the Sean Connery burger ndash broiled, not shhhhtirrred.\"After a few months we decided to Americanise our fish and chips by making it All You Can Eat, which really started things moving for us. After a few years McEwanrsquos became unavailable in Chicago but Belhaven stepped in, filling the void.\"The Duke of Perth has just marked its th anniversary and is now one of the older establishments in the city.It has been a \"wonderful\" experience, reflects Cameron. \"Over the years Ive tried to do what feels right, putting the essence of the pub before short-term commercial gratication. The most obvious example of this is the absence of televisions: we lose considerable business when the sports teams are playing but our customers over the years love that you actually can have a conversation without your attention being constantly dragged away.\"Our customer base has been primarily neighbourhood with the occasional Scottish or UK visitor. The Scottish UK expats I know in the States all share a common trait in that they truly assimilate with the American culture. They donrsquot tend to flock together, trying to create a home from home. This is a characteristic Im very proud of in our expats.

It has already secured some Scottish Government funding to convert some of its snow-clearers in to dual-fuel hydrogen power. Its aim  N t just to make its own services green but to seed a market so commercial operators can change too. In the long run electric vehicles have lower running costs, experts believe. But they are more expensive to buy than their diesel equivalents. At least for now.Such initiatives will take municipal leadership. And municipal cash.The council has set up a working group to trash out how it gets to zero net carbon. Its recommendations are still under consideration. One is for climate bonds. That means the up-front costs of things like new vehicles could be spread out over years.In its report, the group said it ldquoheard of action by other cities to develop municipal climate bonds in order to fund low carbon developments.ldquoWe commend this model and think the city should explore its potential application to Glasgow.ldquoWe recommend that the cityrsquos partners work together to develop business cases for low carbon energy and transport investments through examination of alternative financing models, including the use of municipal climate bonds.The city councilrsquos buildings, vehicles and services only account for around % of CO emissions. So its efforts to reduce carbon output are often designed as a laboratory of good practice.This includes efforts to improve its own premises. Here too there are capital costs that can lead to revenue savings. And that might justy borrowing, not necessarily through climate bonds.The working group highlighted the prospect of replacing old fluorescent, metal halide and sodium lamps with energy efficient LEDs.Its report said: ldquoSuch an investment scores well for both carbon savings, at an average reduction of over  tonnes of Co per annum for each system installed, and financial payback typically in six years.ldquoThe council does not currently have a plan to replace existing lights with LEDs other than on a re-active basis as lamps fail.The group also enthuses over retrofitting ldquobuilding management systems across premises.Its report added: ldquoInvestment in modern building management systems helps the council achieve savings on energy usage. On average, a greater level of carbon emissions can be saved for a smaller initial investment than the LED intervention, giving a typical financial payback of under four years.Companies and municipalities are expected to issue  billion worth of green bonds in .

The report suggests problems in the ventilation system in other parts of the hospitals.A report by Health Protection Scotland was also passed to The Herald on Sunday, expressing concerns about plans to address problems with bone marrow transplant units, and minutes of a meeting with health chiefs about issues with the childrenrsquos bone marrow units just months after they opened.Today we can reveal the contents of the documents for the first time.WardsBoth the cancer ward in the RHC and the adult bone marrow transplant ward at the QEUH are described as having not been built for their purpose.Private contractor Innovated Design Solutions concluded in its investigation into ward A: ldquoWe anticipate the original accommodation design was not intended for use by patients with immune response impairment deficiency. On the contrary, the existing ventilation strategy would appear only likely to promote the risks associated with uncontrolled ingress of infectious aerosols into patient areas.On the adult bone marrow unit, Health Protection Scotland reports from October  state: ldquoThe decision to transfer the care of bone marrow transplant patients from the Beatson oncology unit to the QEUH was made in June . Construction of the QEUH was well established at this point and therefore the new unit was not purpose built.VentilationThe size of the device which takes air in and out of the hospital was selected incorrectly, according to the Innovated Design Solutions report. The document explains that the devices are only able to take in % of the air needed when filters inside the ventilation system are clean. As soon as filters start to get dirty, the amount of air the system can take in falls, reducing the number of times air can be circulated through the hospital. The report indicates the devices would need to be able to take in % of the air required to account for dirty filters.The report explains: ldquoAir handling units [AHUs] fans were not sized or selected to afford a spare % capacity, as suggested by record documentation.ldquoWhilst technical literature would suggest there is % capacity available in AHUs, the manufacturer has advised that fans motors were selected based on % duty with clean air filters .ldquoWe would emphasise the probability of these issues inadequacies being applicable to other air handling equipment installed within the AC [adult and childrenrsquos] hospital.The number of times air is circulated around wards is vital to patient safety. Patients with severely restricted immune systems should be in rooms with  air changes per hour, while people with more robust immune systems should have six air changes per hour. The ventilation report reveals that there were only three air changes per hour in the childrenrsquos cancer ward, describing this as ldquosignicantly lower than would normally be expected.The report states: ldquoIt should also be noted that current air change rates are not in accordance with recommendations defined within either [Scottish or UK guidelines on hospital ventilation].ldquoWhilst we were unable to locate documentation defining system design criteria, [UK guidelines on hospital ventilation] were available in . If there was an agreed deviation from recommendations defined within guidance documents, available at the time of design, we would expect this to be claried within the Health and Safety File documentation.Energy-saving devicesThermal wheels, which help to capture heat and save energy from ventilation systems, are common in large buildings but scientists have begun questioning their use in hospitals as they carry a risk of contamination. The devices are widely used in both the QEUH and RHC, as well as in the nearby Imaging Centre for Excellence and the learning and teaching facility on the campus.Investigators said they ldquoConsider this to identy a potential risk associated with cross-contamination and added: ldquoWe recommend this be further investigated and level of associated risk considered against the use of facilities. We anticipate the majority of AHUs installed within the building are also equipped with thermal wheels ie Critical Care, General Theatres, Theatre Recovery, Endoscopy, Ultra CT Suite, Nuclear Medicine. Again, we recommend this be further investigated.Record keepingSeveral anomalies were picked up by investigators at the private consultancy firm in terms of the records held for the RHC. During their investigations into ward A, they found ldquoevident anomalies with records such as those for the size of air handling units which did not match those installed.They said there was no record about why the number of air changes in the bedrooms was lower than the required amount and added: ldquoWe were unable to locate any detailshellip pertaining to an agreed deviation from recommended guidance.The device which supplies air into bedrooms was also noted as being incorrect in the records, with investigators finding the devices were ldquoincorrectly identied within record documentation, albeit ality is very similar. The sizes of pipes which carry air into the hospital were recorded dferently on two separate drawings ndash one stated they were xmm and another said they were xmm.Drawings of ventilation systems on other floors were also found to be inaccurate.Bone marrow unitsNHS Greater Glasgow and Clydemedical director Jenner Armstrong, Grant Archibald, the then-head of acute services, and Billy Hunter, head of facilities, as well as five other senior colleagues held a meeting in September  to discuss apparent problems with the childrenrsquos bone marrow transplant suites.The minutes of this meeting state they ldquoacknowledged clinical frustration about progress and the need to plan for patients currently waiting transplant.They also state that ldquotwo suites have been sealedto avoid air penetration from a source outwith the air handling unit and add ldquoBrookfield [contractor] could retrofit air handling unit modications hellip at an approximate cost of poundk per room.NHSGGC confirmed that upgrades were made to four of the suites, which had been used for bone marrow transplant patients, while four of the other suites were used to accommodate other children with cancer and were not upgraded.Health Protection Scotland documents raise concerns about plans to fix the adult bone marrow transplant suites in the QEUH, which had been emptied of patients several months after the hospital opened.The document states: ldquoThe decision to transfer the care of bone marrow transplant patients from the Beatson oncology unit to the QEUH was made in June . Construction of the QEUH was well established at this point and therefore the new unit was not purpose built.ldquoWhilst NHSGGC has continued to work towards recommendations, it is noted that the solution proposed does not meet guidance, nor does it seek to address all the recommendations hellip As a result, HFS cannot comment on the effectiveness of the measures intended to be put in place.Bone marrow transplant patients have now ed to the QEUH, following work undertaken in , according to NHSGGC.Experts opinionChristopher Shaw, director of the Medical Architecture design practice, said: ldquoThese are new buildings and there are errors. How it happened is a consequence of the complexity and unique nature of the projects and the mismatch of control systems to those projects.ldquoIn a building of this type there are hundreds of thousands of components. These are brought together by specication, design and construction through tens of thousands of controlling documents and databases. Itrsquos then assembled through thousands of contracts and warranties.ldquoItrsquos a one-off product. The complexity should be mitigated by guidance and standards. Those can be managed and maintained where there is a rolling programme of projects to recycle knowledge from mistakes and introduce evolutionary improvements.ldquoHowever, change in the procurement process has pushed lsquoriskrsquo to the contractor and since the banking crisis there has been a broken pipeline of work. Both of these have undermined that status and effectiveness of performance specication.Shaw added that while he was not an engineer, and had no in-depth knowledge of the Glasgow hospitals specically, he believed ldquothe issues identied are likely to be generic and occur where.He added: ldquoThey are undoubtedly serious and, in the case of an oncology unit, I would say critical.

If the contest had been restricted to party members, the result would have been much tighter.It is understood that ldquolist selections were on the agenda for the MSP group meeting last week and Leonard was asked about extending the franchise to trade union supporters.Leonard is said to have ruled nothing in or out, which his critics have interpreted as him trying to buy time ahead of a final decision next year.Such a move would likely give Labourrsquos biggest affiliated trade union, Unite, a huge say in candidate selections.The bulk of supporters who were recruited during the  contest were from Unite and the , amounted to around % of all voters.Asked earlier this year about the idea of trade union supporters having a vote in List selections, Leonard told this newspaper:ldquoI donrsquot anticipate having US-style primaries for the selection of candidates for the Scottish Labour party.Scottish Tory chief whip Maurice Golden said: ldquoRichard Leonard has scared off voters and alienated party members.

On both occasions, the same voters did not flinch from rejecting a political union and poking an old order in the eye.While the Yes campaign was in no way comparable to the malevolence of many elements of Vote Leave, the indyref also showcased the nastier side of politics ... on both sides. The media, particularly the BBC, was baited by an unsavoury minority, political opponents were intimidated on the street, and social media was often a cesspit.But the indyref was also a le-affirming experience for many Scots. An .% turnout ndash the highest of any referendum in UK history ndash was astonishing. Tens of thousands of people who had never shown an interest in politics were now switched on. Scotland has one of the most politically engaged citizenries in the world.Although independence and Brexit are fuelled by nationalism, one key dference separates both causes. Support for leaving the EU is disproportionately backed by the -plus age group, and opposed by the younger generation. Independence is hugely popular among the socially liberal --year-olds and resisted by older, wealthier voters. The demographics are not the same.A political realignment was the inevitable consequence of the referendum, with the SNP reaping the rewards. Independence used to be a niche interest for % of voters, but it became the main iding line in Scottish politics. Your view on the constitution now often determined your vote in elections.The SNP was on the losing side on September , but the Nationalists quickly became the main winner. Party membership shot up to , and they won an incredible  seats at the  general election. It was a sign of the SNPrsquos dominance that falling back to  seats two years later was portrayed as a failure.:Willie Rennie: Indyref should be blocked eventhe SNP Greens win Holyrood electionThe indyref, paradoxically, was also good for the Scottish Tories, who over the previous two decades had secured the patent of irrelevant also-rans. Just as the plebiscite served as a political awakening for nationalists, so too did it lead to a revival in unionism. The threat of independence is the Scottish Toriesrsquo political meal ticket.Scottish Labour, already in decline prior to the indyref, were the main losers from the campaign. The conventional narrative is that Labourrsquos participation in Better Together, alongside the Tories, hurt them electorally, but this is a flimsy argument.If Labour had campaigned separately for a No vote, the Yes sidersquos lethal \"red Tory\" insult would simply have been adapted. The indyref was always going to be a disaster for Labour. Once a lion, the party is now a mouse.The main lesson from  was confirmation,it was needed, that a referendum does not resolve binary constitutional issues. The  vote on joining the European Communities fuelled a bitter, -year debate. The devolution referendum in  led to an endless debate on Holyroodrsquos powers. The same is true of the indyref and the Brexit melodrama.And therein lies a challenge for Nicola Sturgeon. A second independence referendum looks likely and the bookies are predicting a Yes vote, but the First Minister should be mindful of the state of Scotland after another referendum and the effect a Yes vote would have.The stakes are much higher for the Unionist side. A Yes vote would never be overturned there would be no re-run five years later. Hundreds of thousands of voters would feel like the UK had been broken up, and that their identity had been shattered.It would be the heartbreak of a letime for these people.

However, what makes this yearrsquos descent from the Arctic a little out of the ordinary, is that there is currently roughly seven times the number than would normally be expected for this time of year.The geese are on the move early and in signicantly greater numbers, the rowan trees are heaving with plump red berries, and therersquos a definite fading of colour from the ash, beech and oaks.All of this and yet it seems only moments since social media was packed with pictures of children ing to school, while that lsquoblink and yoursquove missed itrsquo weekend of August sun just three weeks ago is starting to feel like it never happened.Of course, we just have to check the calendar to know that winter is heading our way. But could all those geese be trying to tell us something about what may lie ahead And should we be paying more heed to nature and the folklore of the past to find out whether this winter will strike earlier, hit harder and be even more bitter In the lush green surroundings of the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh, botanist Dr Gregory Kenicer agrees there has been a slightly early change in the colour of the leaves on the trees and a vibrant burst of berries on some bushes, but that is likely to be more a sign of seasons past than those to come.ldquoThe colour of the trees may be turning just a tad early, but plants respond to changes in climate in dferent ways.ldquoAnd as far as I know, we donrsquot have any psychic plants, he adds.ldquoThe classic lsquoold wivesrsquo talersquo is the one about rowan berries ndashthe rowan berries are out in force early, then a hard winter is on the way.ldquoItrsquos true that there are a lot more berries around at the moment, but that is more to do with the year that has past rather than what is happening in the future.ldquoThe rowan tree needs a bit of sun to get fruits prepared, and this year there was some early sun that resulted in lots of flowers being produced.ldquoAs long as you donrsquot get big storms or a very dry spell over summer, the berries from the flowers will survive and grow.The rowan treersquos links with one of our most familiar winter predictions are rooted in druid and pagan ritual. Known as the witch tree or wicken tree, in some areas once forbade the use of its timber, leaves, bark or flower except for sacred purposes, while it has been associated with healing and as a protection against evil spirits.But perhaps a better indicator of the weather to come could lie by the seashore  Long ribbon-like fronds of sugar kelp were once hung outside to dry and used to predict the weather ndashit stayed dry, the weather would be fine,it softened and became limp, rain was on the way.It was so trusted, that it became known as Poor Manrsquos Weather Glass. However, Dr Kenicer suggests there is little science to back up the folklore.ldquoAny time we have looked at it not surprisingly wersquove found that when itrsquos raining itrsquos wet and when itrsquos dry, the weather is dry. Which is exactly what yoursquod expect.ldquoIt might predict slight changes in humidity, but yoursquod probably be better just looking at the sky and carrying an umbrella.He believes much of folklorersquos weather sayings linked to plants and trees are rooted in hopes and fears for crops and livestock, rather than serious scientic fact.ldquoWhether itrsquos dry or hot or wet within every plant there is a strategy to deal with the weather, he adds.Even the autumn glory of dazzling coloured leaves has been suggested as an indicator of a harsh winter ahead ndash the more vibrant the colour is said to be a sign to batten down the hatches.But rather than foretelling dramatic events Dr Kenicer says there is a less mystical reason for the colours.ldquoThe green pigment in leaves break down dferently depending on the tree, and the chemicals present in the leaf. The green is there to capture sunlight, but there are other chemicals that can act like anti freeze or to deter insects.ldquoItrsquos those colours that emerge, rather than it being linked to what might happen in the future.Meanwhile, in Montrose, around  pink-footed geese are settling in nicely, but even their arrival may be more to do with events where than what may be heading our way.A blast of bad weather in Iceland is thought to have pushed the birds further south earlier than normal, with the first flock making their descent as the calendar turned to September.That compares to three years ago when the first pink-footed geese delayed their arrival until mid-September, and even this time last year when there were just  in the basin.Eventually, they will continue their migration to Morecombe Bay and The Wash, with numbers falling to just a few thousands in December and January.Rory Syme, Scottish Wildle Trust, says: ldquoThere are currently about , pink-footed geese gathered at our Montrose Basin Wildle Reserve.ldquoDuring a full moon they can travel through the night so numbers could rise quickly over the next few days.ldquoWe would only expect to see a few hundred at this point in the season, but cold and wet weather in Iceland seems to have pushed some birds south sooner than usual.ldquoMost of the geese at Montrose are stopping to refuel for a few days before heading further south. Itrsquos too early to say what will happen with their numbers this year.ldquoHowever, a quick start to the season may mean we donrsquot see the big peaks of up to , birds that wersquove had in recent years.At the Met Office, where sensible science takes precedence over nut-hoarding squirrels or the number of spiders in our homes ndash even modern technology canrsquot predict the future terribly far in advance.ldquoThere is some truth in the lsquored sky at night, shepherdrsquos delightrsquo saying, admits meteorologist Greg Dewhurst, ldquoand a lot of these old sayings have some sort of method behind the madness.ldquoBut we generally only forecast general weather trends  days ahead.Tie pieceOld wivesrsquo tales, folklore or fact  Could nature be telling us something we need to know Flowering ivy in autumn is said to indicate the weather to come ndash lots of yellow-green flowers attracting dozens of insects has been linked to the onset of a cold snap.Late falling leaves and berry-laden holly and rowan trees are said to be another sign, along with thick shells on acorns, brighter autumn foliage and higher than usual activity among nut-gathering squirrels.Check the family pets for signs of a thickening of their fur ndash apparently another sign of falling temperatures, along with high numbers of spiders.Early bird migration is said to signy a particularly harsh season ahead, while a warmer than normal November could also be a warning sign for a bad winter."},{"url":null,"title":"fifty-years-ago-struck-first-north-sea-oil-now-time-turn-tap-off","story":"Itrsquos now half a century since that eureka moment and around  billion barrels of oil equivalent have been extracted from the North Sea. Though the Arbroath field was considered too small to warrant development at that time, it wouldnrsquot be long before a vast reservoir of crude oil was struck in , the Forties field, and our time as a signicant oil-producing nation had come.ldquoIts Scotlands oil soon became the slogan of the Scottish National Party. Oil and who we were, as well as how we lived, became entwined. We were still some way from learning that our black gold came with an atmospheric side-effect, though, as it happens, in , The Stanford Research Institute presented a report to the American Petroleum Institute that warned the release of carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels could carry harmful consequences for the planet.There has been a lot of good news stories lately from the world of North Sea oil. Last year BP opened Clair Ridge, targeting, it said, ldquo million barrels of recoverable resource. In August, Equinor began extracting oil from the Mariner field,  miles east of Shetland, which is expected to yield  million barrels of heavy crude oil.Drilling activity is increasing following record-low levels in recent years. The Oil and Gas Authority has increased central production projection out to  so that it is ldquonow . billion barrels higher than it was in . There is talk that another  billion barrels could remain, to be exploited, in the UK Continental Shelf.Nevertheless a dark cloud ndash the climate crisis ndash threatens. Every one of these barrels comes with a carbon emissions price tag. The big issue is, in an era of climate emergency, should we even be extracting it at all  Its no longer simply a question of how much more we can find, but how much we may need to leave in the ground. Can we continue to extract from the North Sea and yet still hit our targets of net zero by  in Scotland, or  in the UK Some believe we canrsquot. One of the big ideas being discussed by environmentalists is the need for a ldquomanaged phase-out ndash a plan for how we turn off the taps while making sure not only that we provide enough green energy, but that those with industry jobs are not left behind.Greg Muttitt, research director at climate and energy think-tank Oil Change International, is author of a report called Sea Change: Climate Emergency, Jobs And Managing The Phase-out Of UK Oil And Gas Extraction. He believes it is time to put a stop on further exploration and begin a retreat from oil.At an event this week in Edinburgh, he and co-author Anna Markova argued that those who once had jobs in the oil sector could be retrained with skills for the renewables sectors or in retrofitting homes. As many as , new jobs, they estimated, could be createdwe went fully renewable.But there are still few signs that politicians have an appetite for a deliberate retreat from oil and gas. Just over a week ago Nicola Sturgeon, asked whether she planned to ldquoturn off the taps, replied: \"Irsquom not going to do that because these are complex issues. What would happen is that we would have to have substituted imports of oil and gas, perhaps from countries, with a higher carbon density because there are less rigid regulations.Sturgeon is right that it is a complex issue. The industry provides , jobs across the UK. Energy security is crucial. According to UK Committee on Climate Change modellings, demand for oil and gas, even in , looks likely to remain fairly high. If predictions are accurate, given our reserves, the native UK oil industry would be able to provide only % of our fossil fuels, by comparison with the % it is now.So its not surprising that the oil industry still sees itself as having a huge role in the future. Deirdre Michie, chief executive of Oil and Gas UK which recently published its Roadmap To : A Blueprint For Net Zero, says: ldquoOur projections are consistent with the Climate Change Committee projections which show a continued need for oil and gas out to  as part of a erse energy mix.\"Itrsquos important we meet as much of that demand from domestic production, providing security of energy supply while retaining the skills and expertise of the sector to support the development of low-carbon technologies.Roadmap  appears to be the oil and gas industryrsquos pitching of themselves as the solution to climate change, rather than the problem ndash its argument for why the oil industry is who we need to sort it out while continuing to provide us with the stuff that is the prime source of emissions . The roadmap report frequently mentions \"maximising economic recovery\", a strategy that chiefly involves maxing out the reserves. Among its plans are to reduce the emissions associated with production of oil and gas and support and develop mitigation technologies.But in the years leading up to now, the oil sector has clearly been the problem rather than the solution. A  report by CDP found that the worldrsquos oil companies were spending a tiny fraction of their investment budgets on low-carbon projects ndash on aggregate just .% of their total  capital expenditure.A study by the International Institute for Sustainable Development found that, globally, coal, oil and gas were getting . times the subsidies renewables were, and estimated that just -% of those fossil fuel subsidies would pay for a global transition to clean energy.Oil and gas have been deemed among our greatest national assets for so long that itrsquos hard to let go of the idea that it isnrsquot best for the oil industry to extract as much as it can and make the most of it. That, after all, is essentially what the government has asked the industry to do in its Maximise Economic Recovery strategy.Yet, according to a  study in the scientic journal Nature, an estimated third of oil reserves, half of gas reserves and more than % of known coal reserves should remain unused in order to meet global temperature targets under the Paris Agreement.Of course, the  billion barrels still left in the UK Continental Shelf is a small fraction of the wider global reserves, which according to a  estimate were about . trillion barrels. We could say, they are not so signicant. But at the same time, our extracting every barrel we can sends out a message to the world. We are not leaving our third in the ground.If all countries were to follow our approach of phasing out coal while maximising oil and gas extraction, the Sea Change report says, \"resulting warming would signicantly exceed degC\". According to a  report in Nature Climate Change,we were, globally, to burn all global fossil fuels, we could be on a journey to a degC global temperature rise.Scotland may be otherwise well placed to tell a story about itself as a forward-thinking pioneer towards net zero, but others are being more bold than the UK on this issue ndash for instance New Zealands Jacinda Ardern, who last year announced a ban on all new offshore oil exploration permits. As Muttitt puts it: \"The elephant in the room is Scotlands policy to Maximise Economic Recovery of oil and gas. When the global climate summit comes to Glasgow next year, this contradiction could become an embarrassment.\"No one is looking for us to turn off the oil and gas tap today. What groups like Friends of the Earth Scotland are calling for is the establishing of an \"end date\". There is no avoiding the fact that a dramatic transition is necessary ndash the question is who will define it, and what its timeline will be.Who creates the story of climate emergency Scotland  The oil industry  The renewables sector  Civil society The taps are set to turn off at some point, evenit is in the worst case scenario of a climate crisis stricken world, in which we finally have taken the last economically viable barrel of oil from the ground. Better to fully grapple with the transition now, campaigners say, to start creating a new Scotland in which our economic and political future is not dependent on how much oil we can find and extract.Andwe do embrance that fossil fuel-free future, we might want to think about a new slogan for our times. Not, \"Its Scotlands oil\", but \"Its Scotlands carbon budget.\"The environmentalist roadmapFor many climate change campaigners, the bottom line is that every barrel of crude oil or equivalent gas, adds more carbon dioxide into our atmosphere.According to Greg Muttitt, , globally, all countries were only to use their already developed reserves, in the absence of any properly effective negative emissions technologies, that would set us on a course towards degC rise ndash and that, as last yearrsquos ominous IPCC . degC report described, brings a strong risk of climate disaster.However, the current plan in the UK is not just to stop at the six billion barrels there already is in developed fields. Itrsquos to find still more oil and gas, to pursue the  billion barrels they think are out there. This summer, the UK issued  new licences for exploration and production rights.Echoing Murtittrsquos call for a phased taps-off is Professor Kevin Anderson of the Tyndall Institute.ldquoThe UK, he says, ldquoshould rapidly put in place a phased shutdown of all fossil fuel production, to be completed by around . This needs to begin now and broadly be cutting output at something approaching-% each year. This matches the mitigation rate of the UKrsquos Paris-compliant emission pathway and carbon budget .Andersonrsquos figures dfer from those of the UK Committee on Climate Change in that, unlike theirs, his do not rely ldquoon planetary-scale negative emission technologies, which he believes have shown insufficient promise. They also factor in a greater level of global fairness.Essentially the issue around how much oil we can afford to extract boils down to a number of dferent debates. Among them is the question of how much of the global pie of carbon budget that Scotland, an already developed country, should in all fairness get. Another is what proportion of emissions can be mitigated through carbon capture or negative emissions technologies ndash some say that we are putting too many hopes on this yet to be perfected technology given there are only  working carbon capture projects in the world.Our relationship to oil is indeed complex. Beyond our need for it in our cars, homes, aeroplanes and other aspects, we remain wedded to oil and gas because of what  it brings us, or we believe it brings us. Taxes for instance ndash though we might want to look what fiscal benefits the UK is really getting from oil. In the tax years - and -, the Treasury gave more money to oil companies than it took from them in taxes, although in that time BP and ExxonMobil made more than pound billion in profits.Then there are the jobs the oil industry has provided. Thinking about turning off the taps means also thinking about how we ensure employment for all in the sector.Mary Church, campaign director of Friends of the Earth Scotland, which published the Sea Change report, describes a so-called Just Transition as a process that would involve all the relevant stakeholders, particularly the workers and communities. If we dont commit to this, she says, we \"face a deeply damaging deferred collapse of the oil and gas sector, that will hurt workers and communities the most, as the reality of the climate crisis hits home and forces a shutdown.Jobs on tapComment by Anna Markova, Sea Change report author:We know that tackling the climate emergency means quickly scaling back the amount of oil, gas and coal that we take out of the ground and burn. This means oil-extracting countries have a choice:bull Option A: start scaling back the drilling now, in a gradual way, with time to build up alternative industries and take care of the communities that depend on oil now.bull Option B: wait until later and face a much quicker, chaotic shutdown. I know which option Irsquod choose, but what does it look like Scotlandrsquos potential for concentrating clean energy industries is huge: an estimated  gigawatts viable fixed offshore wind resource , and even bigger potential for floating offshore windfarms , not to mention pioneering centres for tidal and wave energy.And offshore renewable energy is a viable pathway for firms and workers in the oil and gas supply chains. Many Scottish specialist scaffolding and construction firms as well as marine crews already work interchangeably on oil rigs and offshore windfarms.Other oil and gas supply companies will find applications in advanced water and waste treatment and innovative heat networks, according to research by Arup. Undoubtedly, workers and supply chain firms need support and guarantees to make the leap from old industries to new securely.Two big questions remain. First, can there be enough jobs in the clean energy economy We modelled how many jobs could be created over time in some of the most compatible clean energy industries ndash wind, wave, tidal and energy efficiency retrofits ndash in three possible futures.In the first future, neither the Scottish nor UK governments do anything  to help the industries grow. In this case, the number of jobs in wind energy is similar to the number of oil and gas workers potentially affected by the transition, but nowhere near enough to actually replace oil and gas employment.But in the second future,Scotland and the rest of the UK build as many new windfarms and tidal and wave energy generators as industry and politicians currently say is feasible, and retrofit their housing stock to boot, over three new clean energy jobs can be created per oil worker affected.And in the third, \"fully renewable\" future , job creation over time is even greater.So itrsquos perfectly possible to fully replace the economic contribution of the oil and gas industry by betting on renewable energy ndashgovernment does its job right."},{"url":null,"title":"friends-25th-anniversary-25-fact-much-loved-sitcom","story":" Initially Friends was going to be called Insomnia Cafe. It was inspired by the real-le friendship of creators Marta Kauffman and David Crane. The pair met as drama students and were part of a group of university friends they saw as a surrogate family. The pitch for the show was simple: ldquoItrsquos about friendship, because when yoursquore young and single in the city, your friends are your family. Crane and Kaufmann also wrote the theme song Irsquoll Be There For You. David Schwimmer was the only cast member to have a part written for him ndash but he turned it down. Schwimmerrsquos first love was theatre, and hersquod had a bad taste of Hollywood when he ended up waiting tables while trying to get a break on screen. Schwimmer was happily back in theatre when he was offered the role of Ross. Crane and Kauffman had met him in LA and been impressed. He refused. They persisted. Eventually he relented. Matthew Perry knew he had to play Chandler when actor friends started asking him to coach them to audition for the part. Perry had been to primary school with Justin Trudeau, and beat up the Canadian premier because he was jealous of his sporting talent. He was broke when he got the role ndash his hopes of becoming a professional tennis player dashed. Lisa Kudrow was on her way to becoming a successful scientist when the acting bug bit. Her TV career seemed to be taking off when she was cast as Roz in the series Frasier ndash but she was fired after four days, and left fearing her career was over. When she auditioned for Phoebe, Kudrow had to read for James Burrows ndash whorsquod directed Frasier. She thought shersquod no chance ndash but he thought she was perfect. Courtney Cox had an eclectic career before becoming Monica. Shersquod studied architecture, but with Stewart Copeland of The Police as a relative she ended up cast in Bruce Springsteenrsquos Dancing in the Dark video. In , she caused a stir when she said \"period\" for the first time on US TV in a Tampax advert. She later starred in Ace Venture Pet Detective, and a doomed sitcom called The Trouble with Larry ndash about a man captured by baboons on honeymoon. Matt LeBlanc auditioned for the role of Joey with a bloody nose and killer hangover. The night before, hersquod got drunk. Groggy in the morning, he tripped and smashed his face against a toilet. As Ky Miller, author of a new book about Friends called Irsquoll Be There for You, says: \"LeBlanc Joeyrsquod his way into stardom.\" The creators wanted Jenner Aniston to play Monica ndash but even though she was eventually cast as Rachel, the future of her role was in jeopardy. Shersquod already shot another sitcom called Muddling Through, and there was a risk Aniston would have to honour commitments, meaning another Rachel would have to be cast. Muddling Through was finally canned, freeing Aniston up. When filming started in  nobody liked LeBlanc. In reality, softly-spoken LeBlanc worried Joey was too boorish, but the actor was initially perceived as a swaggering macho man. Schwimmer said: ldquoI thought, lsquooh great, herersquos this guy Irsquom going to have to work with for maybe five years, and hersquos f**king Joe Cool Studrsquo. They all quickly became firm friends, however ndash just like the show. The cast hated working with Marcel ndash Rossrsquos pet monkey in the first two series. Played by a Capuchin called Katie, Marcel was retired and drted into TV obscurity. Oprah Winfrey was the first to raise the lack of black actors on Friends. In , in the first big interview with the cast, she said: ldquoIrsquod like for you all to get a black friend. The debate about the lack of ersity on the show continues ndash as do concerns about misogyny and fat-shaming. Homophobia also haunts Friends today. One campaigner edited together every \"gay joke\" in the show and it ran for  minutes. Many are offended by the writersrsquo treatment of Carol and Susan ndash Rossrsquos lesbian we and her partner. However, in an era when homophobia was endemic, others say that at least there were gay characters in the show ndash in most other series everyone was straight. Crane, whorsquos gay, and Kauffman based Carol and Susan on close friends. Friends had a huge cultural impact. It sparked a boom in coffee shops like Central Perk. But its biggest spin-off was The Rachel hairstyle. In Britain alone, some  million women got The Rachel cut at one time or another. Ky Miller says: ldquoGenerational theorists claimed it as the definitive series of Generation X. The show suffered a backlash when it began to cash in on success. In , Friends paired with Diet Coke in a m ad campaign. The ads became ubiquitous ndash and the cast pocketed cheques for up to ,. Over exposure saw ratings decline. One newspaper described it as \"The One Where the Show Crosses the Line from Promiscuity to Prostitution\". Friends had an incredible roll-call of guest stars. At least  big names appeared including George Clooney, Bruce Willis, Robin Williams, Brad Pitt, Winona Ryder, Reese Witherspoon, Sean Penn, Elle Macpherson, Sarah Ferguson, and Richard Branson. Although Ross and Rachelrsquos off-again-on-again love affair is remembered as the central storyline, in reality the pair were only a couple in % of the showrsquos  episodes across ten seasons. Friends was performed in front of a live studio audience anda joke didnrsquot work writers would rewrite on set. Producers even asked for a show of hands from the audience to seecertain jokes worked. This meant recordings took hours ndash often running until am, with sleepy audiences switched out mid-way. Producers initially wanted Liza Minnelli to play Chandlerrsquos transgender father ndash Helena Handbasket. Eventually, they hired Kathleen Turner ndash and played it for laughs, much to the disgust of trans campaigners today. The best that can be said is that in the Friends era, the rest of society was just as ignorant. September  helped Friends bounce back from a ratings slump. When Season Eight began on September , , it became the leading show on television. Season Eight also won Friends its first Emmy. Ky Miller says the quintessentially New York show ldquowas revived by the tens of millions who turned to it for comfort, distraction, escape, hope. Although Friends is set in Manhattan, writers decided not to mention September . Instead, the atrocity was only referenced visually ndash with US flags in Central Perk, or stars wearing sweatshirts commemorating New York firefighters. Producers had to reshoot an episode where Chandler jokes about bombs at an airport. By the final season, the cast were earning  million per episode making them among the highest-paid stars on TV. Theyrsquod started out on pound,. The cast had been able to make such sums not just because of the popularity of the show, but because ndash as friends ndash they negotiated together, never allowing executives to ide and conquer. Friends helped get Donald Trump elected. Friends was essential to NBC viewing figures. When channel boss Jeff Zucker realised the show was coming to an end he needed a replacement hit. Zucker went for a show called The Apprentice ndash credited with helping Trumprsquos rise to power. The final episode ndash The Last One ndash ended with the entire cast weeping. As filming began on January  , the stars were sitting on the famous orange couch in Central Perk. LeBlanc said: \"Do you realise this is the last coffee shop scene \" They all began crying and filming had to stop until theyrsquod calmed down. Amaani Lyle, who worked for Friends, claimed the writersrsquo room was a hotbed of racism and misogyny. She said writers fantasised about Joey raping Rachel, and referred to Kauffman as a \"c**t\". Lyle, whorsquos black, was fired but took out a harassment suit. She lost when a court found the writersrsquo behaviour reflected a ldquocreative workplace in a show dealing with sexual themes. Itrsquos unlikely but there might be reunion. Although Schwimmer says he doesnrsquot want to see the castldquowith crutches and walkers, therersquos been a spate of classic sitcom remakes, including Roseanne and Will  Grace, which has fuelled speculation that Friends may one day . As Jenner Aniston, who \"fantasises\" about a comeback, says: ldquoAnything is possible. I mean George Clooney got married. Friends is bigger today than it was in the s. Itrsquos the most-watched show on Netflix UK, beating The Crown and Stranger Things. Comedy Central UK paid a \"colossal\" figure to rerun the series. Back-to-back episodes go out daily, and ratings never falter. Friends continues to air in  countries.

One of the proposals, quietly published last month, is an overhaul of planning.New developments, said members of the working group, should always have local food at their heart. Housebuilders, in short, will have to show where their future customers will plant their greens. That  metres between windows, neatly ided by a fence or a hedge, just will not cut it.The working group report concluded: \"Emissions from livestock farming are a signicant element of greenhouse gas production.\"The global food production system also contributes to carbon emissions through transport and is itself highly vulnerable to future changes in climate. A healthier diet involves less consumption of processed foods and meat. A more resilient food system involves more locally sourced produce and a recognition of seasonality in that production. An approach which is informed by Fairtrade principles can also reflect our local responsibility to the development of a more sustainable and just global food system.\"The working group surveyed Glaswegians. They found more and more people want to grow their own food.According to an ancient rule of thumb, it takes \" poles\", in old Anglo-Saxon measures a plot of  meters by  metres, to feed a family of four. That is still the gold standard for a British allotment, evenmany do not reach such expanses. Less would still cut bills ndash and emissions ndash in season.The working group reported: \"There is clearly an opportunity to do better here and many of our survey respondents talked of the need to promote a plant-based diet as well as to provide more opportunities for local food growing.\"We recommend that the council and its partners publish a sustainable food strategy for the city within the next year and that the council considers making space for food growing a requirement of new housing developments.\"The councils ruling SNP administration is understood to be giving this recommendation serious thought. This will not just encourage bigger gardens in the lower-density areas. It will spur, insiders say, growing developments on gap and \"stalled sites\". And roof garden and aquaponic growing opportunities even in the most densely developed areas of the city centre.Last week The Herald revealed council officials were being urged to reforest golf courses whose future is in doubt. Such green spaces may also find they become community assets.Existing new rules mean local authorities across Scotland have to ask communities about places where they would like more gardens or allotments.The now semi-derelict Cowlairs Park ndash essentially disused football pitches in the north of the city ndash is one.Anna Richardson, Glasgows Convener for Sustainability and Carbon Reduction, said: ldquoOur food growing strategy is starting to take shape and council-owned sites where therersquos potential for food growing are beginning to be identied.ldquoFrom our engagement with communities so far, there appears to be a strong appetite for people to be able to grow their own food.ldquoAs part of the community empowerment process, it is the councilrsquos role to find ways to harness and facilitate the considerable ambition for growing food that already exists across the city.ldquoEnsuring Glasgow becomes a sustainable food city will help the city tackle the challenges of climate change, but also address issues of food poverty and general well-being.ldquoInitiatives such as the overall master plan for the largely disused Cowlairs Park in the north of the city point towards food growing being incorporated in major developments from the start.ldquoThe vision for Cowlairs is that gardens attached to homes are large enough for families to grow their own food while a communal garden would have facilities such as a shared tool shed for the community.ldquoThese plans are at very early stage and will the subject of detailed work by the community and developers but show we are already heading in the right direction.\"Local groups of councillors are already looking at potential gap sites for good across the city. There are already some community gardens, such as that run for the last decade by the Woodside Community Development Trust on West Prince Street. It can feed  families.Read more: How green is Scotland  Climate change map for YOUR area revealedNobody, however, is suggesting a new \"Good Le\" Glasgow of self-sufficient families like in the s sitcom. Realistically, getting to zero-net carbon will involve developing a market for more local food from farmers.Here again there is a huge role for councils and the rest of the public sector ndash using their procurement might to build up capacity.These, again, are policies that could change our suburban and green-belt landscapes as more land is turned to food.Ms Richardson explained: ldquoIt is also essential the council does whatever it can to ensure the food we provide is sourced as locally as possible.ldquoAnd at least % of food provided in our museums and art galleries comes from local or Scottish providers and that gives us a very solid base to build on.ldquoIrsquom very hopeful our food growing strategy will capture the imagination of the cityrsquos growing communities and show the huge potential there is growing food in Glasgow.The Scottish Government is looking at changing rules to make it easier to procure local foodThe working group concluded: \"Procurement has always been a dficult area in which to incorporate social and environmental objectives because it is highly constrained by a narrow legal focus on budgetary value. Good progress has been made by the Scottish Government and the Council in broadening this focus to embrace sustainability considerations.\"We think more can be done to bring climate issues to the fore and especially to look at how local food production can be encouraged through public sector purchasing power. \"Other big public-sector food buyers are keen too. But they have un in to problems. The Scottish Prison Service, for example, sources all its milk north of the border. and is talking to its suppliers about other produce.A spokesman said: \"These conversations have, however, revealed that there is presently a signicant premium attached to sourcing some local food products.\"This can make it cost prohibitive, particularly in an environment where prisoner numbers have been increasing and budgets are decreasing.\"It is against this backdrop that the SPS regularly discusses opportunities to buy Scottish produce with all its food suppliers. Feedback from our suppliers is that they too are keen to look to source locally where possible but, for some areasthis has proven extremely dficult.\"Glasgow knows that partners like the SPS need to get on board with local foodthe whole city will get to zero-net carbon.NHS Greater Glasgow spends poundm a year with suppliers. A spokesman said: \"As Scotlandrsquos largest health board we are determined to use our high-profile as a buyer of goods and services to make a positive impact on our local area while reducing our impact on the environment.\"Local small and medium sized businesses and third sector organisations are being helped to bid for contracts with the board. A dedicated group has also been set with a focus on sustainability being a signicant factor in contracts.\"These aspirations please Scottish farmers. Vice President of the National Farmers Union, Martin Kennedy, welcomed procurement reform: ldquoThe proposed statutory framework must be the catalyst for Scottish Government to work with local authorities to ensure they do the right thing when it comes to feeding a locally-sourced, healthy, balanced diet to those who use our public services.ldquoIt would genuinely help. Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal ndash but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers to consider what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world  These products certainly donrsquot meet our standards ndash not to mention the impact on climate change when food miles are taken into consideration.\"Itrsquos only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but itrsquos still not Scottish chicken.ldquoSuch an approach does work. Tayside contracts worked with NFU Scotland last year to get Scottish lamb back on the school menu after a very successful pilot in Perth and Kinross. That has resulted in lamb now being on the menu throughout the Tayside area. A massive thanks must go to this local authority for being so enthusiastic about promoting good local food. We must build on this enthusiasm across all local authorities in Scotland.ldquoAnd itrsquos down to the government to support this for three very good reasons. The provision of high quality food to our citizens support for sourcing locally and better recognition of Scotland iconic climate-friendly farming."},{"url":null,"title":"independent-scotland-walk-eu-membership","story":"Mike Russell said there has been a ldquohuge change in the EUrsquos attitude towards Scotland, where % of people voted remain in the  referendum.He was speaking after a former president of the European Council said he thinks EU attitudes towards Scottish independence have changed due to Brexit.Herman Van Rompuy told the BBC: ldquoI think there is a change, yes, because for a lot of people they are looking at what Scottish people are in favour of.ldquoThey want to stay in the European Union and at the same time they are prevented to stay in the European Union because there is this Brexit case, and there is not much sympathy for the Brexit case in the European Union, not among the leaders and not among the men and women in the street.He added: ldquoThere is much more sympathy for regions ndash parts of a country ndash that want to join the European Union.:Poll: Support for EU and holding a new Indyref risesMr Van Rompuy said that the result of any Scottish independence referendum would have to be considered ldquovery seriously by the EUit had been legally agreed and was constitutional.He also said that all  member states would have to agree for Scotland to join.Mr Russell told BBC Sunday Politics Scotland: ldquoThere is a sea change in attitude. There is no solidarity with the UK, the UK has, of course, behaved pretty appallingly towards the EU and in those circumstances, they look at Scotland, they look at our desire to be in the EU and they understand that so there is a huge change.ldquoThe EU is a rules-based organisation, thatrsquos something the UK doesnrsquot understand so there are rules to be gone through, nobody has ever denied that but what this does is it places us on the same footing as anybody  and in actual fact in a better position because we have observed the rules of the EU for the last  plus years, we know what those rules are and we can meet them so this essentially means there is a path open to an independent Scotland to be a normal European country, something which I think many people will be pleased about.Asked whether it would still be a policy for Scotland to become a full member of the EUit were to becomeindependent he replied: ldquoThere is a path open for Scotland to walk into EU membership.ldquoThere are of course things to be done, there is a great deal of hard work but it can be done and that is the big issue.Scotlandrsquos First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has already said she wants to have another referendum on leaving the UK in the second half of , however, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has stated his opposition to a second vote on the issue.Scottish Secretary Alister Jack said: ldquoThere are very real questions about whether an independent Scotland would be able to re-join the EU, not least because Scotlandrsquos notional deficit is more than double that allowed under EU rules.:Could Nicola Sturgeon push the nuclear button to get a second referendum ldquoI am very clear that Scotlandrsquos future is better served by staying in the United Kingdom, keeping the pound, retaining control over our democratic rights, and having control over our own fishing waters.ldquoIn  people in Scotland voted decisively to remain part of the United Kingdom.ldquoThe Scottish Government promised it would be a once-in-a-generation decision.

Last year, , Scottish volunteers took part, removing an incredible , inidual items of litter at  beach cleans along , metres of Scottish coastline.Data collected by volunteers from over  years of MCS-led Great British Beach Cleans has been instrumental in the introduction of Scotland’s p single-use carrier bag charge, commitments to implement a ban on plastic stemmed cotton buds and to introduce a depositscheme for bottles and cans.Mr McArthur will be joining the citizen science project to help clear and survey the litter found on Echna Loch Bay, Burray on Monday, September .“Orkney has a fine tradition when it comes to ‘bag the bruck’,# says Mr McArthur.#I have been involved in such clean up efforts since I was at school in Sanday.“Of course, these days there is a greater public awareness of marine litter, and concern about the problems caused by plastic pollution in our seas.“I’m looking forward to joining volunteers of all ages at Echna Loch Bay to support the Great British Beach Clean campaign. This will be just one of many such clean ups taking place across the country. As well as helping tidy up our beaches and coastlines, I hope the initiative helps highlight the importance of reducing waste and protecting our precious marine environment”.Lizzie Prior, MCS Beachwatch Officer said: “It’s fantastic to see that local MSP, Liam McArthur, will be joining us at Echna Loch Bay to support our Great British Beach Clean it’s really important for decision-makers to see how much litter, especially plastic, makes its way on to our beaches. We hope that Liam’s attendance at the Great British Beach Clean will encourage local constituents to join us for an eye-opening day on the beaches of Orkney.

No-one was being allowed to enter the South Portland Street Suspension Bridge, so we walked as far as the King’s Bridge and crossed there.From the south bank, all the activity seemed quite thrilling: the Broomielaw tiger flanked by horses, and crowds and flashing blue lights, as the police helicopter circled overhead had a filmic quality.But as we got closer, the Hollywood cop movie glamour faded in its place were clusters of disaffected young men clutching beer cans, as weary officers tried to keep events from spiralling out of control. The exhibition – when we finally reached it- proved to be an unsettling blend of bleak and beautul. Comprised of pictures taken in conflict zones across the world – from Afghanistan during the Soviet invasion to child refugees in present-day Syria – Only With The Heart is a study of the human cost of political and religious tribalism.Here in Scotland, we know nothing of the horrors faced by those whose cities are under siege and homes shelled but we are no strangers to sectarianism. Over the past two weekends, it has once again brought trouble to our streets and further tainted our reputation.Govan mimicking the Garvaghy Road a police officer injured by a flare, and for what  A clash of identities a religious rivalry that means nothing to anyone living outside of the Central Belt, and little enough to most of us living in it.There are clear and present threats to democracy out there: an unelected Prime Minister, the proroguing of parliament, the spectre of a no-deal Brexit. And yet, the thing that tipped the city into disorder was not a backlash against a right-wing coup, but a resurgence of the Catholic Protestant ision that has blighted it for generations. Central Scotland’s predilection for provocative parades is nothing new. An oft-repeated statistic is that Glasgow has more Orange marches than Belfast . And every year, there’s trouble: Lambeg drums beaten outside a Catholic \u2028church spittle lobbed in the face of a priest.Nor are Republican marches without controversy. Earlier this year, the appearance of the Sean McIlvenna Republican Flute band, which is pro-IRA, on our streets provoked outrage.The new twist, however, is that every march now appears to come with a counter-march – a “protest” or backlash which makes trouble almost inevitable.So the three Republican marches which took place over the two weekends were met by gangs of Loyalist protesters, fired up over the possibility that the flute band would once again show up. Had they been allowed to take place, the four Orange marches planned for this weekend would have been met with Republican protesters, and the one Republican march by Loyalist protesters.All five, however, have been banned on the back of advice from Police Scotland. Glasgow City Council will be glad of a moratorium to create a breathing space and allow for a dfusion of tensions.This is entirely justied, and what many people – fed up with the disruption – had been calling for, but it does not come without attendant risks nor is it a long-term solution.The risks have already been demonstrated by the Orange Order’s immediate response, which was to accuse the council’s “nationalist” leaders of anti-Protestant discrimination. The Church of Scotland’s rapid rebuttal did little to take heat out of the situation. Protestants Against Discrimination organised its George Square protest in the knowledge, presumably, that it might provide a flashpoint for violence.If a weekend-long moratorium provokes this reaction, then it seems likely any attempt at a long-term crack-down would be counter-productive. As Dave Scott, campaign director of Nil by Mouth, has pointed out, sectarianism feeds on a sense of grievance. And there’s nothing that fosters and legitimises a sense of grievance more than being able to claim your cultural religious identity is under attack.It is the fate of Glasgow and other parts of the Central Belt to harbour two communities, each of which defines itself in relation to the other two communities with a persecution complex, bound together in mutual antipathy.Banning parades strengthens both the hostility and the bond by providing a cause behind which both sides can rally. In Northern Ireland – where the grievances are so much greater and more deeply entrenched – enforced rerouting and bans have only ever made things worse.When change came, it was as a result of protracted negotiation and compromise. The so-called Derry Model – now used as a template for conflict resolution where – saw Republicans, Loyalists and business leaders sit down and talk. It involved a recognition that the conflict was ruining the city’s prospects and an acknowledgement that, with the right to freedom of assembly, comes a responsibility not to engage in inflammatory behaviour.It brought a change in culture, with parades passing off peacefully . This has to be the way forward in Scotland. It may be dficult to envisage such co-operation right now as the two sides square up. Butit can happen in the city where the Troubles began, then it can surely happen in a city which is merely shadow dancing another’s country’s conflict.The scenes that have unfolded over the past few weekends, complete with burning barricades and riot gear, are taking up police time, costing taxpayers’ money, impeding free movement and embarrassing Scotland.Former First Minister Jack McConnell has blamed the SNP for dropping his summits on sectarianism when it took control of Holyrood in . In , Cardinal Keith O’Brien and Ian Wilson, the Most Worthy Grand Master of the Grand Orange Lodge of Scotland, joined  representatives from Scottish media organisations, the police, Rangers and Celtic football clubs, sectarianism charities and local authorities for joint talks. A follow-up summit was held in . Because Alex Salmond dropped the idea it is impossible to know how successful the initiative would have proved, but leaders from both sides and the police had signed up to a voluntary code of conduct agreeing how marchers should behave to reduce violence.To bring everyone back to the table more than  years on will require a degree of diplomacy. Perhaps politicians could start the ball rolling by demonstrating their own willingness to collaborate.In the past few years, the main parties have undermined each other’s attempts to address the problem, with Labour fighting the SNP on the Offensive Behaviour at Football Act. Lord McConnell’s political sideswipe was also less than magnanimous.But perhaps Nicola Sturgeon will find it within herself to overlook his dig and take up his offer of support in the hopes that the relinquishing of tribal positions and the proferring of olive branches might prove contagious.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"cbbc child star mya lecia naylor did not mean to take her own life","story":"Mya-Lecia Naylor, , died after being found in a marquee at her home in south London in April.Emergency services were called to the address in South Norwood, at around am on Sunday April , to reports of a teenage girl in cardiac arrest.She was pronounced dead at Croydon University Hospital shortly after .am.Miss Naylor was due to sit her GCSEs that summer but her parents had recently had a phone call from the school saying her grades were lower than expected.Her father, Martin Naylor, told South London Coroners Court: \"She had not been her normal self ... she was stressed about her exams.\"She knew she needed to get on with her revision and she had plans scheduled out for her revision.\" - Selfish woman left girl, , in vegetative state by injecting her with  doses of insulinMya-Lecia had also been grounded and banned from attending a party, and had spent the night before her death watching a film with her family that included a scene of suicide.Mr Naylor who saw the teenager on the morning of her death, believes it was a \"silly mistake\", despite her exam stress.He said: \"I honestly believe she was just making some sort of point.\"I genuinely believe she did not mean to do it.\"It was a silly spur of the moment thing.\"She clearly had plans for the future.\" - Tourist tax: Charges to access pedestrian streets being exploredAssistant Coroner, Toby Watkin concluded that the teenager \"did not intend to end her own le\" and concluded her death was by misadventure.A toxicology report revealed no evidence of drugs or alcohol in Miss Naylors system, and searches of her phones, laptop, and social media accounts did not present anything suspicious.Miss Naylor appeared in CBBC shows including Millie Inbetween and Almost Never.The teenager had begun her career as a toddler, starring in Absolutely Fabulous as Saffys daughter, Jane.She also went on to star as Miro in the film Cloud Atlas alongside Halle Berry and Tom Banks.At the time, Alice Webb, director of BBC Childrens said the team were \"distraught and so terribly sad\" about Miss Naylors death.She said: \"She was so hugely popular with our audience.\"A very talented actress, dancer and singer.\"A real role model for her young fans.\"CBBC said she was a \"much-loved part of the BBC Childrens family and a hugely talented actress, singer and dancer\".If you are having a tough time and need someone to listen you can call Samaritans free on  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"path open for independent scotland to walk into eu membership","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Mike Russell said there has been a \"huge change\" in the EUs attitude towards Scotland, where % of people voted remain in the  referendum.In an interview with the BBC, former EU Council chief Herman Van Rompuy said: \"I think there is a change, yes, because for a lot of people they are looking at what Scottish people are in favour of.\"They want to stay in the European Union and at the same time they are prevented to stay in the European Union because there is this Brexit case, and there is not much sympathy for the Brexit case in the European Union, not among the leaders and not among the men and women in the street.\"He added: \"There is much more sympathy for regions - parts of a country - that want to join the European Union.\" - Voters in SNP and Labour constituencies explain their general election intentionsMr Van Rompuy said that the result of any Scottish independence referendum would have to be considered \"very seriously\" by the EUit had been legally agreed and was constitutional.He also said that all  member states would have to agree for Scotland to join.Mr Russell told BBC Sunday Politics Scotland: \"There is a sea change in attitude.

Chris McCall spoke to the constituents about their intentionsGlasgow EastThe leaders of the major political parties agree that a general election is likely to take place before the end of the year. But with a date for such a vote still to be confirmed, we are now living through what is effectively \u2028an undeclared campaign season.Many voters in Scotland will soon have taken part in four general elections, two Holyrood ones, and two major referendums on constitutional matters in just nine years. And that’s without mentioning local authority votes or the plebiscite on the electoral system.Signs of voter fatigue are not hard to find.Last Friday, shadow chancellor John McDonnell appeared at Glasgow City Halls to set out Labour’s case for how it could transform both the Scottish and UK economies. But there was little talk of politics two miles to the east at the Forge Market, where shoppers were happily wandering among the myriad stalls selling everything from waffles to wardrobes.It was a chance to stock up for the weekend and enjoy a rare sunny afternoon in what has so far been a dreich September. The prospect of another election was far from most people’s minds.The market, in the Parkhead district of the city, is in the heart of the Glasgow East constituency – one of the most marginal seats in the UK. David Linden retained the seat for the SNP in  with a majority of just  over Labour.Robert, a hotel worker out running errands, was nonplussed. “Another election  What’s the point ”Upon reflection, he admitted that he would vote for Labour – grudgingly. “It has to be themwe are to get rid of Boris Johnson,” he added. “But nothing will change. It won’t put any more money in my pocket.”Outside the Forge, retired railway worker Liz was showing around a visiting friend from Ireland. She cheerfully admitted she was thoroughly disillusioned with politics. “Another election won’t make any dference,” she insisted. “I think the Conservatives will win and Boris Johnson will still be Prime Minister.”Liz was not a fan of Jeremy Corbyn and would not vote Labour. “Keeping the Union together is what matters most to me,” she said. “I will vote Conservative – eventhis is a strong SNP area.”Standing nearby was Ian, a le-long SNP voter who was now considering his political options. He had voted to Leave the European Union in  and was unimpressed at how negotiations had since been handled.“This election won’t change anything,” he said, a point made firmly by several other shoppers. “Brexit looks more and more like it won’t happen. I voted for independence and that didn’t happen.”Glasgow East MP Linden was confident, however, that most people in his constituency were now used to voting on a regular basis.“I don’t think people will be groaning at the prospect of another general election,” he told Scotland on Sunday.“It’s an opportunity to send a message to Westminster that they are not happy at how things are done. This is a welcome election in my view. He added: “I was elected with a majority of  two years ago. So my campaign for re-election started from the moment that was announced. I feel relaxed about the prospect of an election.“It’s an opportunity to get our messages across – stop Brexit and give Scotland the opportunity to decide on its future.“For the last two years, I’ve been working flat out to make sure people trust me as their local MP. I’ve been speaking with a clear, consistent voice on issues such as Brexit and Scotland’s constitutional future – and I’m not convinced the Labour Party can do that with any degree of clarity.”Glasgow North EastThe neighbouring constituency of Glasgow North East closely resembles Glasgow East. There are neighbourhoods of traditional tenements and others with refurbished social housing. You are never far from the M motorway or one of its many link roads.But there is one big dference between the two seats – the sitting MP here is Labour, not the SNP. Paul Sweeney won back the seat for the party in  with a majority of , in what was something of a minor electoral upset.The Labour MP admits that many voters are frustrated at the current political climate.“There is a real frustration at the logjam in politics just now,” he told Scotland on Sunday. “It’s a result of our ided country over the major constitutional questions. It’s changed the landscape of politics. We’ve seen era of majority governments pass away.”He added: “There is a concern about apathy. My constituency had the lowest turn-out in the UK at the last election. We need to do more to engage people in democracy.”Springburn, with its proud history as a centre for railway engineering, was once viewed as a Labour stronghold even by Glasgow standards.The late Michael Martin, who spent nearly a decade as Speaker of the House of Commons, was MP for the old Glasgow Springburn seat. At the  general election, Martin received a thumping . per cent of the vote.But in a post-independence referendum, post-Brexit world, the old political certainties count for little.The Glasgow North East constituency – of which Springburn is now part – was won by the SNP’s Anne McLaughlin in  before Labour snatched it back.The constituency will be one of the Nationalists’ key targets whenever an election is called. But voting fever had yet to reach shoppers coming and going from the Springburn Shopping Centre last Friday.Raymond, an accounts manager, voted in  but said he would not do so next time. He described himself as a frustrated Leave supporter who was angered that Brexit had not taken place.“I was brought up to vote Labour as they were party of the working man,” he said. “But I don’t trust Jeremy Corbyn.”Council administration worker Linda, who was on her way to the shops after finishing for the day, told a similar story. “I voted Labour at the last election but I don’t like Corbyn. He’s weak. Nothing he says sticks with me.”But Sweeney, who was born and brought up in the constituency, said his local connections in the area put him in a strong position when it came to standing for re-election.“I’ve been a high-profile Member of Parliament,” he said. “I’ve been very visible in the community.“I knew this was a marginal seat, and an election could happen at any moment, but I have been determined to dispell the old steretype that you only see MPs at election time.“I have lived and breathed the job since I started.

This would be completed over the next two or three months, he said.On the issue of smell, the two sources are from the -metre chimney and from the hatches of the fish meal boats. The former was cleaned out last week after contaminants were discovered inside the base of the stack, said Mr Jonermark, and the amount of bacteria used to pury the air in a filter chamber has been increased. Highland Council would be approached to seethey would agree to a -metre extension to the height of the chimney.As far as the feed boats are concerned, Mr Nilsson said the problem arises when the hatches are opened so that the fish meal can be delivered to the plant. This will occur for about  hours per year, he said, and the firm is currently working on a solution to that.Mr Jonermark added: #We do not want this to be a problem for anyone. We do not want this situation to continue.#We want to make a positive contribution to the village and we will continue to invest to make sure the problems go away.

But this week the #Peatbogs# will be back on home turf to showcase their energetic brand of traditional-inspired electronica as part of this year#s Skye Live Festival.The rare Skye gig will mark the start of another autumn tour for the six-piece group, for whom constant re-invention has proved key to longevity spanning almost three decades.The sound that#ll boom out in the tent high above Portree Harbour this Saturday will be far removed from the group#s roots as a folk band playing in local pubs. But the Peatbogs, like more recent successors such as Niteworks, are a reminder that a grounding in traditional music is no barrier to a letime of instrumental experimentation.Le for the Peatbog Faeries began with a gig in Edinbane Lodge in the spring of . Peter Morrison and bass player Innes Hutton from Braes # the two constants in the line-up # were joined by Davie Tait, Ali Pentland and Alan Edmunds.Pubs and village hall dances became their early staple, but gradually more adventurous elements crept into their set and the audiences lapped it up.Morrison recalled: #We#d bring in a blues or a reggae sound, and we found it was these things that started to go down best with audiences.#We moved to more of a world music sound around about , but we never expected much to come of it. We were just out to play at pubs and parties and have a bit of fun#.Their first tape # the #Great Ceilidh Swindle# # sold well locally and paid for a demo in Edinburgh, which in turn caught the ear of Greentrax Records, the specialist label in Scottish traditional music.With bands like Shooglenty and Martyn Bennett also arriving on the scene it proved a perfect time to be breaking new ground and the Peatbog Faeries# debut album #Mellowsity# would stay in Greentrax#s top ten for the next decade-and-a-half.Morrison remembers: #Because of our size and sound, bands like us and Shooglenty cost a lot more to record than other folk bands at the time. So there was a worry at the start.#But as soon as we signed to Greentrax, we quite quickly got an agent and we got sought-after slots at Glastonbury, Nomad and Celtic Connections.#We didn#t really notice what was happening, in a way # it felt like one day we were playing in the pub, the next day playing in front of thousands.#There weren#t that many precedents for bands like ours. Most folk bands just played in pubs. There were some accordion bands that were full-time or groups like #Silly Wizard#, but for us coming out of Skye we never thought it would turn into a full-time occupation.#We just went with the flow and luckily for us it proved a lot more popular than we thought it would be.#The band#s line-up has changed several times, and in turn, each addition helped explore new sounds # the most dramatic sht coming when Rick Taylor and Nigel Hitchcock arrived on Skye in the s to add a three-piece brass section.Taylor # who passed away earlier this year # was a revered musician who had toured with Elton John, while in recent years the Peatbog#s fiddler Peter Tickell left the group to take to the road with Sting.The current scaled-back line-up has seen Morrison and Hutton joined by Edinburgh-based Tom Salter on guitar keyboard player Graeme Stafford from Ardnamurchan drummer Stu Haikney and Shetlander Ross Couper on fiddle.For Peter Morrison, the global tours, the record deals and the Glastonbury stage all owe their origins to the chance he got to learn the chanter in the long-since closed Vatten Bridge primary school.He explains: #Every year Norman MacLeod # the teacher#s husband # and John Laing used to pipe us all in to the Christmas Party, so that was where I first heard the pipes.#Every pupil got the chance of learning the chanter at school, and I think nine of us started playing. It was either that or an hour of maths.#I think I was the only one who carried on into secondary school, but I got the bug. I didn#t like the competing part, but I enjoyed listening to the pipes and learning to play them.#My pal Donnie MacAskill from Roag also played the accordion, so I learned to play drums along with him and from about the age of  I was always in bands.#Morrison#s early piping tutor was Cameron MacFadyen, and he received additional help from Nicol Campbell # another well-known local piper and character from Dunvegan, whose memory has been honoured across the globe.Morrison added: #When he passed away Nicol left me his kilt, which has since been worn on stages in Japan, Africa and America.#A joiner to trade, who also worked for aperiod as a hotelier in Dunvegan, Peter Morrison has seen attitudes to traditional music change over the years, and with it opportunities flourish.He still lives in Roag with we Johan and grown-up kids Jenny and Calum, and it#s no surprise to hear him promote the virtues of free access to music tuition in local schools.He continues to be #amazed# at some of the local talent learning traditional instruments, some of whom he can be heard playing alongside at regular music sessions laid on in the Edinbane Inn and the Old Inn in Carbost.#It#s changed a lot since when I was a youngster whenyou wanted to learn music the only real opportunity was the pipes,# he recalled.#Things like the fis movement have been really helpful in creating opportunities. There now seems to be a constant stream of really good young musicians coming out of Skye.#When I started you would never have thought of making a career out of it, but now with some of these youngsters, it seems to be the only thing they think about. #A lot of these kids are now at a standard that in previous years only a handful of people in Scotland were achieving.#In Skye you have the likes of Daimh, Niteworks, Bridghe Campbell # the list goes on and on. #At these regular sessions there are some great young local players going along like Anna Scott, Dugald McKiggan, Archie and Isobel Maclean and Malin Lewis.#Morrison continued: #Recently over in LorientI saw a great act. It was a Sikh beatboxer, accompanied by step-dancer Sophie Stevenson along with Catherine Tinney from Portree singing puirt-a-beul.#This was another Skye person on the international stage, singing to an incredible standard, but she was someone I#d never heard sing before. #In the past, going somewhere like Lorient,there was a person from Skye on stage you would know exactly who it was # they would be an established name. Now you can go somewhere like that and get a surprise.#It shows the strength in depth there is now.#Some of that west-coast musical talent will be showcased at Skye Live this weekend among a ied line-up that will also include some of the country#s top nightclub DJs.Morrison urged the local community to rally behind the festival weekend, which this year starts with a Thursday-night concert to the Waterboys.He added: #We played at the very first Skye Live five years ago and are looking forward to getting on stage at the Lump in Portree again.#It#s an iconic setting, but organisers have kept the festival to a level that is comfortable for the place.#A capacity of , people is about a fth of the population of Skye and is manageable. When you start to go into the tens of thousands it brings pressures, and it#s a risk to go too big without the infrastructure to support it.#Whenever anyone organises a festival there will always be people who might want to pick holes in it or knock it in some way.#But people need to remember that these guys are putting on a  for so many types of music.#It#s something people of all ages can go to and hear some of the best music in Scotland in Portree. I would hope local people can support it in any way they can.#The Skye Live festival runs from Thursday th until Saturday th September.

The volunteers cover quite a large area, including Broughshane, Kells, Ballymena and the surrounding rural local areas.The group has  volunteers, however by August it had responded to  purple and red incidents in support of the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service.This translates into  inidual responses. The group prefers to send more than one responder to each patient in case their needs are beyond the capacity of a single person. Cardiac arrest is a case in point and while only three of patients have been in this specic condition, many more have been suffering from chest pain.Responders grow in experience and expertise, with the group aiming to have an experienced person at each incident to support them. The four committee members have ided this task between them.The more active members are learning fast, particularly through their exposure to NIAS crews and rapid response paramedics, who have been patient and helpful with them.The group held their second monthly members meeting and training event at the end of August and used this to reflect on their experiences, share what they had learned and build vital patient care competence.More members are needed and they are asking people to get in touchthey want to volunteer.

In truth, the margin of defeat flattered St John’s who, for the second game running, failed to fire.They got out of jail at the weekend when an injury-time Pearse Donnelly goal almost plundered an unlikely victory before Conal Delargy kicked the equaliser. The general consensus was that Casements had missed the boat and that the Johnnies would win the replay, but Portglenone boss Barry Dillon said he knew his players could better Sunday’s performance. “We sat back too deep on Sunday, it was our own fault,” said Dillon. “Maybe the fear of winning made them a bit apprehensive, but we knew we had more in us. “In the first half of the drawn game, we showed we are the better team and we had that belief coming into this game that we could go and finish it.” While Portglenone fielded an unchanged team from Sunday’s drawn game, St John’s started Domhnall Nugent, Brian ‘Bam’ Neeson and Sunday’s goal-scorer Donnelly. Yet, as was the case on Sunday, it was Casements who made the brighter start with a hat-trick of frees from Conal Delargy and Ronan Kellyhelping them establish a - to no score lead after a cagey opening  minutes. It took the Johnnies  minutes to open their account following a well-worked move finished by Matthew Fitzpatrick, but Paddy Kelly responded in kind for Portglenone minutes later. Peter McCallin got his side’s second score on  minutes with St John’s struggling to break down a well-organised Portglenone defence. The Whiterock Road men then lost Donnelly to a black card and Delargy converted another free to move his side - to - ahead. When Kieron McKenna added another from play, Portglenone looked in a strong position approaching half-time and a Paddy McBride free with the last kick of the half was badly needed by the under-par West Belfast outfit. The second half was just four minutes old when Portglenone cut a dash through the heart of the St John’s defence to score a brilliant goal with full-forward Michael Donnelly firing past Padraig Nugent. Less than a minute later, St John’s hit back with a goal of their own. Having been off-target with a few efforts from frees,Neeson’s fortunes changed when an attempt at a point dipped under the crossbar and beyond the reach of Portglenone goalkeeper Ryan O’Neill. That should have been the catalyst for St John’s to kick on, but instead it was Portglenone who regained control of proceedings as another Delargy score moved them four clear once more. St John’s continued to squander chances at the other end with Neesonand Fitzpatrick firing wide of the posts. McBride converted a free before Dermot McAleese broke forward to score for Casements. Ryan McNulty landed a stunning point from play with  minutes of normal time remaining, yet their hopes of another rousing comeback were dented when they lost centre-forward Conal Kelly to a second booking. McBride briefly reduced the gap to two points while Nugent was forced to make a great save to deny Niall McKeever at the other end. Michael Kelly scored an excellent point moments after his introduction for Portglenone and a Ronan Kelly free gave them a four-point cushion approaching full-time. Rather than sit back and defend their lead as they did last Sunday, Dillon’s men went for the jugular and further points from McKeever and midfielder Fergal O’Kane put them six clear. There was one last surge from St John’s with Michael Bradley’s sideline being fisted into the net by Fitzpatrick deep into stoppage time and the Antrim star had a second goal-bound shot blocked with the final play of the game. Yet Portglenone were the better team over the two games and they progress to a semi-final meeting with Lámh Dhearg on Saturday, September  at Creggan.

For Martin Moreland, Principal of Mercy College, it was very dferent indeed.Born on the Ormeau Road in South Belfast, Martin was the youngest of six children. Having left school with no exams, Martin’s road to the classroom and education sector began as an engineer.“I never really thought I would be a teacher because I never had the confidence to be one,” he explained.“It was a dream in a sense but I never really thought it would be a reality.“I left secondary school with no exams. I went out into the world of work – it gives you a lot of le experiences or the real world as I call it.“I went into engineering and had several jobs. My we has a job in education and she told me about a course up in Derry that gave you access into university. I went and got a GCSE in English and Maths and spent three years up in Derry doing the course.Martin was accepted into St Mary’s University College and after his first teaching job in West Belfast, has moved to the North of the city.“With my engineering background, my first job was a Technology and Design teacher in St Colm’s in Twinbrook and I spent  years there. I loved it there, it was a great community and a school that was thriving.“I moved on to Mercy where there was just  kids. I started off as a teacher before becoming Principal and I’ve been in the role for ten years.”Martin then reflected on the many changes in education over the years, not least the challenges and successes of Mercy College.“When I came in, it was about building up confidence and profile of the school, given our location in North Belfast.“Pupil numbers now are  but our challenges now is very much to do with space and classrooms.“We have been co-educational for a few years now which is fantastic. We have a   ratio girls and boys in Year . Our LLS programme is still really successful and we were the first school to start that.“The standards are amazing – % of girls are getting three A-Levels from A* to C which is very unique. % of our GCSE students got five GCSE’s at the top grades and there are not many other schools in the North that can boast such results.“Finances remain a huge challenge for us. There is no room for any extra money in the system. It is not easy at all.”Away from school, Martin is kept a busy man being a father of ten children.“I am a family man. I am a father-of-ten so at home it is a very busy household, with the kids ranging from  to .“I am very much an outdoor person. I like nature and sunshine. I am also big into running and gardening. With my technology background, I like a project such as a pond or a patio to keep me entertained.”As for the future, Martin is content at Mercy College but would love no more than see a new building for the school in his working le.“I am  now and I suppose you start to think about how many more years I can give in education.“I probably have another ten years in me. I am happy at Mercy College – there are so many challenges every year.“I really want to see our newbuild come for the school which is in the pipeline – just need Stormont up and running to approve it.“The future of the school is very bright. There is a lot of work still to be done to maintain our standards and results and improve facilities for the kids.“"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"meabh set to sing the anthem at croke park","story":"AN Under- Lámh Dhearg footballer will perform Amhrán na bhFiann in front of thousands of GAA fans on Sunday ahead of the Dublin -Galway All-Ireland Senior Ladies Football Final. -year-old Méabh McNeill told Daily Belfast that she is “super excited” to be singing in front of up , fans at Croke Park ahead of the finale to the ladies football season. “When I was seven myself and my brother went to Scéim Samhraidh at our club, Lámh Dhearg,” she said. “One of the events was learning and singing the national anthem.

National elections are on Tuesday.Mr Netanyahu has promised to extend Israeli sovereignty over the Jordan Valley and to annex Jewish settlements.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Palestinian Bedouin homes are seen in the Israeli-occupied West Bank The move sparked a cascade of international condemnations. Critics say it could inflame the Middle East and eliminate any remaining Palestinian hope of establishing a state.In Israel, it was widely viewed as Mr Netanyahu’s latest campaign stunt to draw right-wing voters.He has also alleged fraud in Arab voting areas, claimed to have located a previously unknown Iranian nuclear weapons facility and said another war in Gaza is probably inevitable.In an open letter in the Yediot Ahronot newspaper, Mr Netanyahu said with President Donald Trump planning to unveil his much-awaited Middle East peace plan, the conditions have “ripened” to apply sovereignty to all “settlements and areas of strategic and national importance” in the West Bank.Instead of having a country that is only a few kilometres wide, it is a country with strategic depth and strategic heightBenjamin NetanyahuSeated in a makesht tent and flanked by his ministers against a backdrop of Israeli flags, Mr Netanyahu said at the Cabinet meeting that he was proud to establish what he expects to be the country’s future eastern border and officially incorporate its settlements into Israel.“It’s not just the eastern gate of Israel, it is the defensive wall from the east, because the Jordan Valley, together with the territories that will be part of Israel, guarantees that the military will be here forever,” he said.“Instead of having a country that is only a few kilometres wide, it is a country with strategic depth and strategic height.”The vow has widely been regarded across the political spectrum in Israel as the latest Netanyahu campaign stunt to appeal to wavering right-wing voters.His Likud party is locked in a dead heat in the polls with the centrist Blue and White party and re-election seems to be his best shot at avoiding having to face pending corruption charges against him in a courtroom.Mr Netanyahu hopes to form a narrow government of hard-line parties that will support granting him immunity from prosecution.With his grand visions and fearful rhetoric, Mr Netanyahu appears to be replicating the campaign strategies that have previously secured him dramatic come-from-behind victories.Over the last week, he has alleged fraud in Arab voting areas and unsuccessfully pushed for legislation to place cameras in polling stations on election day.He also claimed to have located a previously unknown Iranian nuclear weapons facility, said another war against Gaza militants is probably inevitable and boasted his close relationship with Trump has resulted in the exploration of a possible defence pact between the two countries.The Jordan Valley gambit looked to be a winning move domestically since keeping control of the territory enjoys wide backing.The area is widely considered a key security asset because it provides a buffer zone against potential attacks from the east.But by vowing annexation so close to the election, Mr Netanyahu has politicised the issue.His chief challenger, retired military chief Benny Gantz, also supports retaining control over the territory but dismissed Mr Netanyahu’s announcement as campaign theatrics.Israel captured the Jordan Valley, along with the rest of the West Bank and east Jerusalem from Jordan in the  war.More than . million Palestinians now live in occupied territories, in addition to nearly , Jewish settlers.Israel already has annexed east Jerusalem in a move that is not internationally recognised.The international community, along with the Palestinians, overwhelmingly considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank and east Jerusalem illegal.The Jordan Valley is sparsely populated by Israeli settlers, most of whom are secular farmers and far less ideologically driven than those deep in the West Bank.Palestinians, however, say there can be no independent state that does not control the border.With annexation they would lose a fertile area home to many Palestinian farms and one of the few remaining areas of the West Bank with open space for development."},{"url":null,"title":"thousands gather to support italian hardliner salvini","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER

There are other guys in Derry who are on the edge of that, the problem with this is and Declan Morgan was right, there is a human cost, a psychological cost, a physical cost.“People are getting their hopes built up thinking something is going to happen and then they’re deflated again, you can only pull yourself up so many times.“I’m having dficulty pulling myself up week by week, to continue fighting this, and it would be a hell of a lot more dficult for people who aren’t aware of the detail and the argument that goes into getting this far.”For victims it is about much more than monetary compensation, that comes secondary to an apology from the state and institutions responsible and a package that enables them to move on with their lives in a better way – which includes appropriate healthcare and support.Last Friday, Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland Sir Declan Morgan said it was \"shocking\" that victims are still awaiting action.He revealed that before Sir Anthony Harte, who chaired the Historical Institutional Abuse Inquiry, died, he had expressed \"profound disappointment\" at the lack of progress.Sir Declan said it \"epitomises how the lack of an assembly impacts negatively on the lives of Northern Irelands citizens\".‘Absolute disgrace’The Historical Institutional Abuse Redress Bill was listed amongst parliament business on Monday but was not dealt with because of prorogation.Mr McCourt believes the suspension of parliament by Prime Minister Boris Johnson has essentially “killed off” the Redress Bill.“To all intents and purposes the Redress Bill is killed off. If the legislation is not passed and hasn’t gone through the House of Lords and received the royal seal of approval then it is killed off.“The fact that it hasn’t been dealt with at this stage is an absolute disgrace, Declan Morgan is right to bring it back up again.“Even at this point they are still talking about it being a devolved matter, the hope of having this dealt with through the NI Assembly does not exist, the only avenue for this to go forward is through Westminster.\"Speaking at Westminster on Tuesday, Independent Unionist Lady Sylvia Hermon said she was \"extremely annoyed and disgusted\" that the motion to discuss historical abuse in NI wasnt even moved because of prorogation.\"By proroguing parliament tonight, the Prime Minister has wilfully and deliberately deprived victims of a -minute debate. He has sent out a clear signal that those victims to not even merit a debate.“It’s appalling, I ask the Secretary of State to demand that the Prime Minister comes to NI, sits at the meeting and looks the victims of HIA in the face and explains to them why he is so disrespectful and discourteous of the hurt and the suffering that they have had to endure.”Unexpected and emergency debates were to blame, Julian Smith explained, and he apologised for the change in business which he said “in no way diminishes how seriously I’m progressing the issues or affected the commitments I have made.”Mr Smith said officials have prepared the policy and lawyers the draft law and he has asked that it be included in the Queen’s speech as a matter of urgent priority.He was however challenged about why legislation hasn’t been brought forward and was told that the state is failing victims yet again.Scotland’s progressIn Scotland their inquiry is ongoing, the report is not written, but the Scottish First Minister has instructed the civil service to initiate an advanced payment scheme. Anyone over  years of age or with a terminal illness can now apply for an award of £, – which is not their full and final settlement.Some child migrants who were taken from homes in Northern Ireland and shipped off to Australia have also received payments.Mr McCourt believes the same could have been done for victims in Northern Irelandthere had been the political will to do it.The HIA inquiry studied allegations of abuse in  homes and other residential institutions between  to .These were run by the state, local authorities, the Catholic Church, the Church of Ireland and the children’s charity Barnardo’s. The largest number of complaints related to four Catholic-run homes.A report in  recommended that victims should receive compensation, however, the process of securing compensation stalled when devolution collapsed in the same week.After a four-year Inquiry and over two and a half years since the publication of the report, the government has still failed to deliver a promised apology and financial redress.In recent weeks Secretary of State for NI, Julian Smith, gave assurances to victims that a Redress Bill would be fast-tracked through Westminster. But Brexit, and the suspension of parliament, has placed yet another roadblock in front of victims.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshPhoto: Termonbacca where historical institutional abuse took place.  Campaigner Jon McCourt has highlighted that another HIA victim has passed away before receiving compensation."},{"url":null,"title":"derry homeowners left shaken burglary waterside area city","story":"Detectives are appealing for witnesses and information following the report of a burglary at a house in the Grovemount Court area of Altnagelvin, Derry, on Thursday  September.Detective Sergeant Boyd said: “It was reported that entry was gained to the property between am and pm on Thursday.

Members were told that a key element of this innovation project was the provision of mechanism to support the transfer of skills and expertise to company staff and university students.Personalised MedicineIn relation to the prioritisation of the Future Fund of £m and the further anticipated match funding from NI Government and other partners, the emphasis is on advancing with projects such as the Graduate Medical School as a key catalyst for the much-needed expansion of the Ulster University Magee Campus. The delivery of a Personalised Medicine Centre of Excellenceat Ulster University and Altnagelvin is also a priority for this fund as is the provision of an integrated, Council-wide, multi-skills employment pathways intervention support programme.The report advised that work on these innovation projects as well as the proposed SMART and digital city projects were advancing in close collaboration with local industry and partners and relevant government departments, while the strategic outline cases for major regeneration projects for Derry City and Strabane Town Centre are at an advanced stage of progress.The Personalised Medicine Centre of Excellence intends on harnessing the power of Genomics to predict and diagnose inherited and acquired disease, and to personalise treatments and interventions.The Ulster University representatives said it will expand its partnership with Genomics Ireland and other commercial enterprises to sequence the genomes of % of NI’s population contributing to a research database that can be interrogated to develop personalised medicine solutions with worldwide application and valuable I.P. and how it will also contribute to health improvement locally through a unique ‘community buy-in’ approach.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":"https://img.resized.co/derrynow/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL3MzLWV1LXdlc3QtMS5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tXFxcL3N0b3JhZ2UucHVibGlzaGVycGx1cy5pZVxcXC9tZWRpYS5yaXZlcm1lZGlhLmllXFxcL3VwbG9hZHNcXFwvMjAxOVxcXC8wOVxcXC8wOTEyMTkwNlxcXC9TVFJBQkFORS1ERVZJQ0UtLnBuZ1wiLFwid2lkdGhcIjo2NDcsXCJoZWlnaHRcIjozNDAsXCJkZWZhdWx0XCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL2NhY2hlLnJlc2l6ZWQuY29cXFwvbm8taW1hZ2UucG5nXCIsXCJvcHRpb25zXCI6W119IiwiaGFzaCI6IjhlOTFmNGZjY2ExNDE2YjZiOGFkN2MwMzExOGY0ZWQ0NThmOWJlMmIifQ==/strabane-device.png","title":"security operation creggan area derry following discovery mortar device strabane","story":"District Commander Superintendent Gordon McCalmont said: \"It is our assessment that the New IRA is responsible for the mortar device that was discovered outside homes in Church View Close in Strabane on Saturday morning th September.

For example, can lessons be learned from other towns which experienced similar problems or what about changing the sequencing of traffic lights in the town centre  he asked.ldquoIt has been said many times that there is no quick fix solution to Downpatrickrsquos congestion problem and while the layout of the town may pose problems for engineers, surely it is time for some innovative thinking Cllr Curran said he believes that all the key players need to get together, suggesting years of inaction has exacerbated the congestion nightmare faced by residents, businesses and visitors to the town.He added: ldquoIt is time to forensically examine the problem and come up with ideas on the way forward.

It was also an effective way to promote the work that we do and raise awareness among the regular customers to Asda. ldquoThe foodbank has noticed an increase in donations to our permanent collection point in the store since the campaign ands partnerships like this make our work so much more effective.Downpatrick store manager, Roger Croskery, said Asda has always always been proud to support the communities it serves.ldquoOur community champions work tirelessly to support charities, projects and initiatives that make a real dference to the people living around their Asda shop, he said.ldquoBut we want to do even more to help local communities across the UK to save money so they can live better. Wersquoll do this is by doing our part to tackle the growing issue of poverty in the UK and our Fight Hunger campaign is part of this work.Roger and Linda, along withy other staff members from the Downpatrick store, recently visited the Fountain Foodbank to see the impact the donations have made, to meet volunteers and find out more about how the foodbank works.The foodbank provides emergency food parcels to those who find themselves in dficult circumstances and has distributed over three thousand food parcels in the local area since opening in March .It also receives weekly donations of fresh food from Asda as part of an ongoing scheme with FareShare which has  yearsrsquo experience working with the food industry to safely ert edible surplus through a UK-wide network of frontline charities fighting food poverty.FareShare works with businesses and charities to get food to good causes in a way thatrsquos cost effective and makes sense for the business and the charities, with the Fountain Foodbank registered to receive some of this food.The volunteers say this particular initiative is an effective way to cut down on waste and help those who find themselves in dficult circumstances.Asda says that by the end of the Fight Hunger campaign, it aims to provide an additional  million meals every year by investing in the charitiesrsquo infrastructure and services so they can collect, store and transport more food.In addition, the store aims to provide , vulnerable people access to fresh food every year and make fresh food the norm in food banks and not the exception.Asda also wants to tackle the root causes of poverty, helping one million people with the food and support they need to help them out of the situation they are in and expand the companyrsquos existing food donation activities so every one of its stores has the ability to donate edible surplus food to local food banks and community groups..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th September 2019 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C September 4%2C 1979  ","story":"WARRENPOINT mdash A plea by Official Unionists to adjourn this weekrsquos meeting of Down Council because of the murders at Warrenpoint and Mullaghmore was rejected the SDLP and Alliance members.The motion to adjourn was defeated by ten votes to six and immediately the Unionists walked out mdash not in protest but as a gesture of sympathy to those bereaved by the murders.The motion was introduced by Saintfield councillor, Mr William Finlay, who said he looked back with horror at the murders, the victims including  soldiers at Warrenpoint, Lord Mountbatten, his grandson, Nicholas , the Dowager Lady Brabourne, and a  year-old boy, Paul Maxwell.Acting chairman, Mr Paddy OrsquoDonoghuesaid he would be impartial in the matter and was quite sure they all shared the revulsion, horror and disgust and would like to show their sympathy with those were bereaved ldquoin such a dreadful way.He pointed out that there had been two committee meetings of the council since the murders occurred, but since Mr Finlayrsquos motion was a procedural matter councillors must decide without any debate whether or not they wanted to adjourn the meeting.He added: ldquoHowever, whether or not the council decides to adjourn should not be interpreted as to whether or not councillors approve of the vile deeds which have been perpetrated.After the vote, in which the SDLP and Alliance members voted against the Unionists, Mr Finlay said he was sorry about the decision which the majority had made.NEWCASTLE mdash The fireworks display organised as the climax of the Newcastle summer season did not go down with a bang, but instead fizzled out.Torrential rain minutes before the fireworks bonanza was due to begin washed the show out and it now seems likely that the display will be held at Halloween at Downpatrick racecourse instead.Drumgath Accordion Band and Ballykeel Pipe Band were about to march into the arena to put on a marching exhibition when the rain came down.More than pound had been spent on the fireworks, but the rockets, roman candles, catherine wheels, shells, mortars and numerous other favourites were saved from the rain.

It is already a couple of months behind schedule because of a host of supply dficulties, the cement strike among them.Once it is handed over it will have to be equipped and sterilised before it can be commissioned. That could take a couple of months.BALLYNAHINCH mdash The September Flower Show organised by the Presbyterian Womenrsquos Association connected to st Ballynahinch Presbyterian Church proved to be a huge success.The Huston Hall was crammed full of baking, handiwork, flowers and vegetables.

The proposed new school will also be in the trusteeship of the De La Salle Congregation.St Patrickrsquos Grammar has maintained its opposition to the merger proposal since it was muted in , while both De La Salle and St Maryrsquos support the merger.Mr Joe McCann, St Patrickrsquos Grammar principal, said he is ldquodisappointed that an apparent EA source had broken the news of the merger plan locally before his and the other schools were formally notied.St Patrickrsquos parent body mdash The Parents and Friends Associationmdash said that it will ldquovehemently fight these proposals with every means necessary, through the courts and, unfortunately, in the media.PFA spokesperson, Cormac Artt, criticised the EA on how the news was leaked ahead of the schools being notied last Thursday and the argument that local children will be educated together and the likelihood of capital funding for a single-site school build.Mr Artt continued: ldquoThis proposal cites an enrolment of  pupils and alleges that this yearly intake will be made up of up to % who will be admitted by academic selection.ldquoHowever, the census figures suggest thatall those who live within a three-mile radius and those for whom the school is the nearest Catholic grammar are admitted automatically without sitting the GL entrance assessment, there will be very few,any, places for those applicants seeking admission via academic selection.Mr Artt suggested that the outworking of this means that the rural communities and primary schools who have been an integral part of the grammar schoolrsquos -year history, will no longer have a place in this proposed super school, including those in Teconnaught, Loughinisland, Strangford, Kilclief, Dundrum, the Ards peninsula, Castlewellan and Newcastle.ldquoThe choice for boys in these areas who wish an academically selective education will therefore be travel to Newry or Belfast to try to secure a selective grammar school place in Catholic schools that are already heavily oversubscribed, he said.ldquoThe alternative for those who wish to keep the tradition and connection with Downpatrick will be to attend the state academically selective, Down High School. Aside from the injustice of this on the rural communities, is the impact this will have on families.While the EA said that the proposals have ldquoalready been subject to formal stakeholder consultation with parents, staff, governors and pupils, Mr Artt disputed that.ldquoParents of students from St Patrickrsquos Grammar requested a meeting with the De La Salle Trustees in April to discuss the Trusteesrsquo vision going forward. They finally responded in June by refusing to meet the parents citing rsquoit is not clear what,anything, will be gained by a meeting,rsquo which clearly makes the parents think that they do not care about the pupils of the school where they are Trustees.ldquoThe Board of Governors, staff and parents are overwhelmingly opposed to this proposal and for the De La Salle Trustees, who are the only stakeholder supporting this vision, to refuse to speak to the current parents is a disgrace.De La Salle principal, Ciaran Maguire, said he was ldquodelighted to see the proposal going to full public consultation.He told the Recorder: ldquoItrsquos been a long time coming. I am reassured now that the families of the greater Downpatrick area will have an opportunity to finally get behind the vision to secure the town as a model of good practice, where childrenrsquos education is a priority.ldquoThe De La Salle Congregation have been working on bringing post primary education in Downpatrick into the st century. In , they first proposed that St Patrickrsquos Grammar should become a co-educational school.ldquoThe Department of Education at the time wanted to see a proposal that was reflective and inclusive of all schools in the Downpatrick area. That advice was taken by the De La Salle congregation and they have been working, in partnership, on a solution to ensure that all children in the greater Downpatrick area have an education system that they can be proud of.Mr Maguire said the origin of the transfer test ldquowas a solution to a problem back then, suggesting the problem is dferent now and a new solution is needed.He added: ldquoWhat we need now for our children is something radical and exciting for all those involved. If we are the child-centred schools we say we are, then this is undeniably the right thing to do, not just for my pupils, but for the St Maryrsquos girls and St Patrickrsquos boys.Mr Maguire contended that while some may see the proposal as ldquoas an attempt to wipe out a schoolrsquos history and tradition, itrsquos an opportunity for them to continue their great work in preparing our children for le.He said that it will cater for all children from the local feeder schools, without the fear of having to sit and possibly fail a test.Mr Maguire added: ldquoWe are removing barriers those same barriers that our children currently struggle with, the fear and anxiety of not fitting in, not being good enough. I urge all parents to get behind this proposal, your opinion matters and should count.Welcoming the proposed merger, St Maryrsquos High School principal, Ms Rosemary McLaughlin, said ldquoit has the ability to deliver.She added: ldquoWe are very proud of our school as a centre of excellence and we look forward to this new opportunity of proposed change to serve all young people..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/11th September 2019 Migle.jpg","title":"Migle thanks foster parents for help in education success  ","story":"A BALLYNAHINCH woman has thanked her foster carers for the key role they played in her educational success.Miglehas revealed how growing up in foster care helped shape her future career as the Regional Adoption and Fostering Service launches a new campaign encouraging more people to become foster carers across the Provincersquos health trusts.Migle was fostered by South Eastern Trust foster carers Michael and Martha eight years ago and is currently studying Computer Science at Queenrsquos University Belfast.She moved in her with foster parents when she was  and admits she would not be where she is today without their support.ldquoBefore I went to live with Michael and Martha I never even thought about going to university, said Migle who moved to Northern Ireland in  from Lithuania.ldquoThey were able to help me choose what I wanted to do with my le.

Over the past three years Irish Lights has proactively engaged with the local community and relevant state agencies to establish the best approach to the site. he continued.ldquoWe have now developed and tested new technology to achieve a sustainable solution that will enable retention of the historic lens and sweeping beam at St. Johnrsquos Point. I look forward to meeting with the community to discuss these plans in more detail.The Lecale Lightkeepers say that while they accept there is some concession on CILrsquos part in proposing to keep the sweeping beam at the lighthouse, they have been informed by the Commissioner that the range of the beam will be reduced by up to nine miles. They also claim that the beamrsquos iconic ldquoloom will be lost, robbing the lighthouse of what they describe as its ldquointangible heritage.A spokesperson for campaigners said that through their freedom of information requests for communication between CIL and others, they have found a ldquolack of appreciation for the intangible heritage of lighthouses and a disregard of the views of coastal communities.ldquoWe have seen examples of modernised lights and none have retained their original characteristics. The new light source proposed for St Johnrsquos Point would be an LED which, in itself is suspect, as according to the Royal Society Publication April , LEDs have detrimental effects on Epaunal Marine Communities.Campaigners say Newry Mourne and Down Council has already voted unanimously to protect the sweeping beamrsquos current mechanism and trustsrsquos that CIL will not be given planning permission to proceed with its proposal.ldquoThe lighthouse is a listed building and its character, the light, must be protected, declared the campaignersrsquo spokesperson.ldquoWith the loss of the historic lights at Fastnet, Mew and Tory it is even more vital that St Johnrsquos Point should be kept for heritage purposes. Moreover, it is a beautul feature of our nocturnal landscape, much loved by the local communities.Turning to concerns about the mercury in the current lighthouse mechanism, the spokesperson said mercury vapour is a known toxic substance, arguing that vaporisation only occurs in certain circumstances, notably in very warm conditions where there is poor ventilation.ldquoThe St Johnrsquos Point lighthouse is fully automated and the lantern room is well ventilated.ldquoAccording to the late attendant Henry Henvey, the mercury had not needed any attention in at least  years nor were there ever any concerns about its safety.Next Wednesday eveningrsquos meeting in Ardglass starts at pm..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/11th September 2019 Red.jpg","title":"Red High 25 group in fundraising drive  ","story":"NEARLY  years on, the loss of Ballynahinch teenager Mark Quinn is still keenly felt today mdash by his grieving family, schoolmates and his fellow soccer players.The  year-old took his own le on December , , with his funeral service one of the biggest his home town has ever seen.Earlier this year, Markrsquos former classmates at St Patrickrsquos Grammar School in Downpatrick joined together to fundraise in support of community mental health initiatives in his memory coming up to his anniversary.The former students, now grown men, many with sons of their own, all found that Markrsquos death hit them in dferent ways then and throughout the following years.The group, known as Red High , decided that they wanted to raise money to help support other young men who may feel in despair.Markrsquos family is fully behind the initiative and other planned events which will go to support Ballynahinch Counselling Services and The Edge Youth and Community Centre.The gesture comes with the knowledge that Ballynahinch has one of the highest suicide rates in the district.World Suicide Prevention Day was marked yesterday and Department of Health officials announced plans to reduce suicide rates in Northern Ireland by % over the next five years.Speaking of behalf of her parents, Peg, and the late Hugh Quinn, and siblings Lynda, Michael, John, Patrick, Jarlath, David and Jemma, Markrsquos sister Katie Cassidy said they were ldquooverwhelmed to have been contacted during the summer holidays by Markrsquos school friends from the Red High.Katie said: ldquoTheir effort to keep Markrsquos memory alive while also raising awareness about mental health issues is more relevant now than ever.

Talking can make all the dference, we wish we knew then what we know now.ldquoThe pain and devastating reality of living without your son, brother, nephew or uncle truly causes physical pain. But there is also help in dealing with the loss of someone to suicide. In the early days after Markrsquos death when our faith was extremely tested, we received tremendous support from our parish community.Katie also asked for support for the upcoming football tournament at St Patrickrsquos Grammar next Saturday, September  and for Ballynahinch Olympicrsquos annual fundraising effort.She said: ldquoWe hope everyone will come along to the Red High next weekend to enjoy the football tournament. Itrsquos sure to be good day and all money raised will go to Ballynahinch counselling services and The Edge, as we feel that the Edge contributes enormously to the youth of our town.

He said: ldquoSo far the lads have raised over pound, with great support from past pupils, ex-teachers and of course Quinnyrsquos family.ldquoThese are dferent times now compared to . Mental health awareness is something that people are much more open about these days.

Although UK citizenship law, in the form of the British Nationality Act , is abundantly clear that persons born in the United Kingdomare automatically British citizens.Letter to the editorDe Souza – who, despite being born in the UK, claims she is not a UK citizen – has been attempting to argue that this is superseded by the Belfast Agreement. As a legal argument, this fails at the first hurdle, since international treaties require legislation to be given direct effect in law. .ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button The Belfast Agreement was given legal effect by the Northern Ireland Act , which did not amend the  Act. The Home Office, therefore, had no option but to appeal a bizarre tribunal ruling that had previously found in favour of De Souza. On strictly legal grounds, therefore, De Souza is bound to fail, but we can be sure that her campaign, supported by Sinn Féin, will move beyond the courts and into the political arena. They will seek to have the  Act amended so as to remove automatic UK citizenship from people born in Northern Ireland. In doing this, it will be argued that the Belfast Agreement, which provides a ‘right’ to identy as Irish, British or both, requires UK citizenship to become merely an option. This is despite the very same provision of the Agreement referring also to a right to hold ‘both British and Irish citizenship’. The agreement, therefore, rightly distinguishes between identity and citizenship, affirming a right to acquire Irish citizenship in addition to British citizenship, but separate to how we might choose to identy. The De Souza case is based on the misunderstanding that identity and citizenship are the same, and that being a UK citizen prevents somebody from identying as ‘Irish only’. The implications of this are signicant: to accept such an interpretation would be to equate Irish identity to citizenship of the Republic of Ireland, implying that the many unionists who identy as Irish are not really Irish at all, unless they choose to become Irish citizens and to envisage a ided society in which one section of the community is encouraged to opt out of citizenship of the state in which they live.This campaign exposes an unspoken truth about nationalism: it has never honestly or genuinely accepted the implications of the agreement’s affirmation of Northern Ireland’s membership of the United Kingdom. They do not, therefore, accept that this means that UK citizenship is the default, or that the appropriate use of UK symbols is legitimate, but seek to change, restrict or undermine such basic manestations of sovereignty. Ben Lowry: DUP has put its faith in Boris Johnson, but he is losing control of events Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"As well as not understanding the terms of the agreement, neither do they understand its nature as, literally, an agreement with unionists. Unionists did not agree that UK citizenship law should be changed, and that is why the agreement does not say that it should be, and why the law was not changed. The Belfast Agreement is not a  for nationalists to undermine Northern Ireland’s place within the United Kingdom, but the ongoing failure of unionists to defend it in the face of the De Souza campaign , means they are currently pushing against an open door.J.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I gave her a shot of adrenaline and it didn’t really do anything.“Then I gave her a second adrenaline pen and it seemed to work until the ambulance arrived.“She required two more in the ambulance but from what I’ve heard she seems to be good now, thank God.“I’m also trained as a doctor so I think that certainly helped.”He added: “It’s not the sort of thing you expect to see and I’m glad I was able to help.”Emmett, whose long term ambition is to work in anaesthesia, has been in touch with the lady’s family who expressed their gratitude for his lesaving actions: “Her daughter contacted me and said she couldn’t thank me enough.”Emmett’s family back in Lurgan have expressed their pride in the young doctor’s heroic actions.His aunt Margaret McManus said: “We are very proud of him. He lost his twin brother, Finbar, three years ago and he has worked so hard. His mum dad and granny Eilish and sister Emma are so proud of him.”Emmett said: “My family has been through a tough time, I lost my brother when I was studying for my medical degree, I couldn’t focus on my exams.

Several motorists were warned about their speed but the sad thing was that two motorists received Fixed Penalty Notices for speeding.“On top of this one motorist obviously didn’t see us driving behind him when he decided to lt his mobile and start chatting to a friend instead of concentrating on the road. As a result this motorist also received a Fixed Penalty Notice for his misjudged action.“I would prefer to inform you that we had a successful day and caught nobody as it truly saddens me to issue these fixed penalty notices but some people just will not learn.“What I also noticed today was that not one person waved to us. That also saddened me as we are only out trying to keep everybody safe, so when you see us out and about please wave at us as it makes our day go in that bit quicker.”Family appeal for missing cat

We speak to founder Daniel Crawford and his team about the journey so far A spark in the mind of Daniel Crawford as he studied for his masters degree in Glasgow just a few years ago has grown into a business at the sharp end of technology. axialD is tasked with turning the complicated and laborious process of converting D medical scans into D models – and producing them for use by surgeons and medical professionals. It’s an ever-growing business, spun out of Ulster University, which is expanding its reach across the UK, Ireland and now into the US where it’s targeting a burgeoning fresh marketplace. The company has been involved with Catalyst since , been directly involved with a host of its programmes, and is participating in the EU INTERREG funded North West Centre for Advanced Manufacturing , managed by the Special European Union Programmes Body . Catalyst is Northern Ireland’s leading technology hub, home to  companies and around , staff. Daniel has a strong team around him – growing to  staff based in Belfast city centre, including Niall Haslam, chief technology officer, Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships and Cathy Coomber as operations manager. While studying medical visualisation and human anatomy in Glasgow, Daniel was exposed to the raft of imaging available – including CT, MRI and ultrasound, and began examining how the crucial data could be better used. The biomedical physics undergraduate grew the idea into his thesis – looking at converting D data sets and converting them into fully D printable files. “That allows us to turn images into D models to allow surgeons or registrars, to understand digital pathologies, before going in to theatre,” he said. “But we discovered it wasn’t just good for that and surgeons also wanted to get their hands on the D models.” That gave Daniel greater scope for developing the concept. In one early case, a surgeon was able to use one of the D prints to identy small fractures in a patient who had suffered a motorcycle crash, that weren’t initially apparent using more traditional methods. The company was thrust into Catalyst’s Springboard programme in  – a  week scheme which allowed a would-be entrepreneur, fresh out of university, access to business training and development, which included working with PathXL’s Stuart Harvey. From there, it was into the Halo programme – bringing axialD together with angel investors in order to get the start-up off the ground. It landed £, through Techstart and private investors, which allowed the company to get the ball rolling. Through Catalyst, Daniel also got the opportunity to visit MIT and the entrepreneurial development programme, Way to Scale, bringing axialD to Massachusetts and the Boston area – the global heart of the health technology sector. Niall Haslam is axialD’s chief technical officer. He said a Belfast and Boston partnership has helped strengthen the links between the cities, bringing firms from Northern Ireland to the US for both networking and scoping out the potential for setting up shop across the Atlantic. “The Way to Scale program brings entrepreneurs together. It’s a great networking opportunity,” Niall says. axialD is now a partner in the EU INTERREG-funded NW CAM, which brings together a network of research institutes, universities and enterprises to carry out research in advanced manufacturing. It is working with Ulster University on a number of projects, including looking at developing custom designed jigs for hospitals to produce D models. Cathy Coomber has been with axialD for three years. “What we have done in that time is looking at standardising the processes,” she says. “Biomedical engineers from Ulster University and those across the UK are producing data, manually segmenting thousands of medical images in order to help them develop an algorithm. “That allows us to massively improve our standardised process and reduce the time involved in producing those files.” That could mean reducing the time down from up to five hours, to as little as an hour. “When the company started, Daniel was able to get those early users excited in Glasgow, and then setting up in Belfast there were key surgeons which helped set the pace,” Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships said. The company has since been involved with NHS frameworks as a means to help remove as many bottlenecks as possible. This involves developing and marketing the products to the NHS and HSC in the Republic – helping them to learn about the product, the process and what area of specialism it can be used in. “In the last  months with the development of the algorithms, we are moving in to the US,” Katie said. “We’re seeing a lot of growth in the US.” And the axialD team is also growing fast. “We have  staff at the moment but are looking to expand in  months,” Daniel said. “That includes new staff in the US to help grow and manage that market as we further expand our software team back home.” The success of axialD mirrors the overall success of Catalyst, since its inception  years ago. It’s an independent not-for-profit organisation across its four sites – including its largest base at the Titanic Quarter in Belfast, alongside its Londonderry hub, Ballymena, along with the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub at Danske Bank in Belfast city centre.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/jm_1.jpg","title":"how do you retain staff and keep them enjoying their job","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by Ulster Business With such intense competition for talent, the challenge for employers isn’t just finding prospective candidates, it’s also keeping them, writes John Moore, managing director of Hays NI Astonishingly, almost half of professionals surveyed in the Hays What Workers Want Report said that they left at least one new job within the first  months because it didn’t match expectations formed during the application process. A signicant number of our employees at Hays have been with us for , ,  and even  years, and we pride ourselves on growing our own talent and promoting from within. Although there are times when employees leave due to circumstances employers can’t control, organisations can create the right conditions to retain their staff for as long as possible. We believe there are three key areas. A sense of purpose Across ages, cultures and sectors, professionals need to get up in the morning knowing that they can make a dference. No matter how big or small, recognising a clear and meaningful purpose in your role is a huge driver for staff. Communication is key for employers. By prioritising employee progression, offering regular feedback and communicating the wider objectives of the business, employers can ensure their staff come to work each day with a strong purpose. Variety each day While not every task can be exciting, and some parts of a job will inevitably be more stimulating than others,the mundane becomes the usual, employees will think about moving on. Injecting iety into each week and staying interested at work partly falls on employees themselves, who can proactively seize opportunities. But a good employer should also push their staff and encourage them to work outside of their comfort zones. This ensures professionals can keep growing and developing within an organisation rather than move where. A strong network The people we work with have a huge bearing on our happiness levels at work. You simply can’t stay in a role long-termyou don’t enjoy working with those around you, so the importance and impact of these relationships are not to be underrated. Employers can help their staff develop a network of inspiring and admirable colleagues from their first day by making sure they receive proper introductions and support contacts. Workers who have these strong bonds feel a greater sense of belonging which keeps them wanting to work in their organisation. With these three points in mind, it’s important to consider how someone’s organisation and role makes them feel, rather than just how impactful their salary or bonus might be. After all, this is what can’t easily be replicated across organisations and can keep an employee with an organisation throughout their career.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"new  bedroom boutique hotel planned for belfast","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by John Mulgrew A listed Belfast building could become a new hotel and restaurant as part of wider plans for a £m revamp of the city centre. Tribeca Belfast, formerly Royal Exchange, will see UK developer Castlebrooke redevelop much of the north side of the city centre. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. As part of the revised plans it wants to turn the listed former Assembly Rooms building at the corner of North Street and Waring Street into a new -bedroom hotel, with a restaurant and bars. That would involve knocking down part of the newer extension to the building, including the rear part of the former Northern Bank and the adjacent - North Street to “accommodate the new extension to form the proposed boutique hotel”. “The proposals for the existing building are similar in scope to that which was included as part of the extant approval. It is proposed to conservatively repair the existing historic fabric of the former Northern Bank,” a design statement says. “A key feature of the proposed extension is that the interface with the rearelevation of the existing listed bank building will be improved by setting back the footprint of the proposed extension so that the north west corner of the original building is readable.” The scheme includes the re-use and adaptation of the existing building as well as an extension on the footprint of the existing s extension on North Street. The extension will be set over five floors, with a rooftop bar, while upper floors are set back with metal cladding to the facades to “reduce the overall massing of the building and reflect the roofing materials or upper story treatment of surrounding buildings”. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. This summer the developer ran a fresh public consultation amid revised plans for the scheme, which included signicantly reducing a huge -storey building to around , retaining additional facades and dropping plans for an underground car park.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/da1.jpg","title":"clarity telecom building telecoms from the ground up","story":"Posted on Monday September  by Ulster Business Clarity Telecom helps businesses of all shapes and sizes develop their communications needs from the ground up, and is now rolling out its fast-growing cloud software across the UK and Ireland. Founder and managing director David Whelan speaks to Ulster Business about a business which boasts the right tools for the job David Whelan’s vision and mantra for what is now one of the leading telecoms businesses is clear – telecommunications services are only as good as the foundations on which they are built, with engineering front and centre. He’s the entrepreneur behind Clarity Telecom – a successful Belfast-based full-service telecommunications solutions company with almost  years under its belt, helping develop top-end connectivity – including lines, calls, mobile, broadband and cloud software – for businesses across Ireland and the UK. And for David, telecoms is all about engineering at the core of finding the best comprehensive solution to its customers, having the right tools for the job, and having world class people. For Clarity Telecom, it’s about developing a bespoke system for companies, focusing on engineering from day one. Since its inception in , Clarity Telecom has grown to have a greater engineering capability than any other independent telecommunications company in Northern Ireland, and is now rolling out its leading byphone VoIPsystem throughout the UK and Ireland. David also says through Clarity Telecom and its burgeoning byphone technology, the company could double revenues in the next three years as well as growing its workforce. “The phone network stops at a plug in the wall and from that point on, you have to provide the infrastructure and management,” David says. “What we do is focus on the engineering. It’s all about how well it works and adapts to your business. “By focusing on that we are looking at the way things are being built, and we can then get insights on how we can change and improve things.” Led by engineering, the Clarity team is driving change within the telecoms industry ensuring client infrastructure is fit for purpose and for the future. That starts with assessing a business’s needs, making sure the network is suitable, reviewing the workforce needs and bandwidth requirements. From there, Clarity Telecom can develop a bespoke solution – from cabling, to switching, cloud services, routing and phone systems. Clarity Telecom now has a team of  staff – a third of whom work directly within the engineering side of the business. But that number could grow further still, as the company expands its business across Northern Ireland, and develops its byphone technology. The company developed its subsidiary, Voxbit, in  – specically to design engineering solutions. And through that has come one of its most successful products, byphone. A simple to use VoIP , byphone is a drag and drop system that allows users to configure their own phone set up suited to the exact needs of the organisation and enables a range of analysis tools that can help business owners drive up efficiencies. “In  as VoIP started coming along, I realised that was a signicant opportunity,” David says. “Where the communications industry is going is into the cloud. It’s going from traditional storage within buildings, into something in the cloud. The traditional telephone systems are evolving. “We started making a series of innovations surrounding cloud technology. We realised you can make it simpler – we were asking ourselves, can you make it work without a manual, for example. “If you can, in the same way as Apple’s iPhone made things easier for users, people will start using the services. It’s about making everyone’s le easier. “The end user wants to be able to use the system easily, from managing their telephone number, to having access to voicemail. It’s about the ‘power of simple’. “We now have around  resellers for the byphone system in the UK, and we are looking at trebling or quadrupling those sales,” he said. One of Clarity Telecom’s customers is Mid  East Antrim Borough Council. The firm was tasked with bringing together the complex communication needs of the new ‘super council’ following the amalgamation in . “With bringing three councils together, one of the main problems was having a single phone number that people could call. If you have numerous sites, spread across three council areas, that would involve a lot of rip and replace,” David says. “But we gave them one telephone number and then managed the routing to all those bits of equipment across the council areas.” Hotel giant Andras House – which operates seven hotels and , rooms in Belfast including the Crowne Plaza at Shaw’s Bridge and the new Hampton Hilton – is also another major customer. “Businesses trust us to be able to provide the engineering solutions in order for them to run their companies,” David says. So, why should a business consider Clarity Telecom for its crucial and comprehensive connectivity needs  David says Clarity is all about improving how companies interact with their customers – making it easier, and thus, improving revenue and sales. “As you manage your telephone connections you become better at dealing with your customers – you become more efficient at dealing with them, and they will have a better experience. It’s about improving customer contact. “As a business you are able to do a lot more, such as listening to call recordings, access to statistics and using data which will help manage that contact, as well as saving on costs and making your business more efficient. “What solution depends on your business. That is where we come along. We never put a system in without doing a full engineering visit.” Some of the connectivity includes the ability to connect landline with mobile phones, call forwarding and being able to access voicemails as digital recordings, by phone or computer. “When companies deal with us, they can come along and say ‘this is what we are trying to do’, and we are able to work the engineering and infrastructure, before then providing the services,” David says. “It’s also about fighting against the view that it’s all about price. Yes, you have to be competitive, but you need the right infrastructure. For example,a shop loses connectivity for two days, then they lose two days of sales, simply because they don’t have the back-up for the credit card payment system. “It’s about getting businesses to think about the infrastructure and all of the issues. It’s not just about how cheap you can make a call. It’s about how customers can engage with your business – and we are at the heart of making that happen.” For further information, contact Clarity Telecom on    or visit www.clarityteleView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/greggssss.jpg","title":"greggs to open new belfast city centre store","story":"Posted on Tuesday  September  by John Mulgrew Greggs looks set to open a new store in the heart of Belfast city centre, it can be revealed.
