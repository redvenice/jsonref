She might have been a relative. \u0027It wasn\u0027t until I saw the news that I realised Dale had died. It\u0027s a shame as he seemed a nice man.

Since then, he spent a lot more time in Florida.\u0027A man who lives opposite Winton\u0027s former residence said: \u0027He was a very nice man. Very agreeable and cheerful. He always gave me a big hello on the street. He was very neighbourly.\u0027A bouquet of white roses lay on the doorstep of Winton\u0027s old house with a card that said: \u0027The kindest man I knew.

He adored being in show business \u0026amp loved meeting fans. He devoted his life to making everyone else happy, his friends, the public \u0026amp his godsons, even though he found it hard to be happy himself. I pray he has found peace\u0027. In June 2016, two months before he was last seen in public, he said: \u0027I would not leave the house for five years. I didn\u0027t want to put one foot in front of the other outside the house. I had a bad break up and I had health issues and I thought, \u0027I want to withdraw\u0027.\u0027A year earlier he failed to make it to his close friend Cilla Black\u0027s funeral, sparking concerns about his health, and had undergone four operations in four years to fix crippling pain in his knees and shoulders.In his 2002 autobiography he came out as gay but revealed his regret at not telling his mother before her death saying in 2008 that nobody had really ever asked him about his sexual orientation. This year he had relaunched his TV career with a new Channel 5 show Dale\u0027s Florida Fly Drive but he died before the series was shown in full. His friend Davina McCall led the tributes last night as she described him as a \u0027lovely, warm, kind, sensitive, generous soul with a touch of naughty!\u0027Comedian David Walliams also said he was \u0027heartbroken\u0027 to hear of the death of his friend, who spoke openly about his battle with depression two years ago.But describing how much fun he was to be around he said: \u0027One night Dale \u0026amp I were going out to dinner \u0026amp he stopped off on the way to buy diet lemonade from a corner shop. He was in there about 20 minutes. When he finally got back in the car I asked \u0027what took you so long?\u0027 \u0026amp he said \u0027sorry David I am very big with the Indian community!\u0027In another anecdote he said: \u0027One afternoon Dale \u0026amp I were out shopping \u0026amp some policeman were standing on the street corner.

He has had some bad picks\u0027.In 2016 Dale  admitted he was too depressed to leave the house after a messy break-up with another man but never revealed publicly who he was dating.An only child, Dale\u0027s happy childhood ended when his father Gary collapsed and died on the day of his bar mitzvah when he was 13 and he came home aged 21 to find his mother Sheree had killed herself with a drug overdose in her bedroom. His own sudden death yesterday came just a month before his 63rd birthday and the 41st anniversary of his actress mother\u0027s suicide, which he admitted he \u0027never got over\u0027.Dale Winton dead at 62: This Morning causes OUTRAGE over...Dale Winton said he\u0027d \u0027had enough and didn\u0027t want to age\u0027:...\u0027I pray he has found peace\u0027: David Walliams leads tributes...Dale Winton: Tributes for Supermarket Sweep host who died...Davina McCall leads celebrity tributes to \u0027generous soul\u0027...Share this articleDale started his career in local radio and had little work for eight years until he spent nearly a decade hosting Supermarket Sweep before fronting the National Lottery show In It To Win It on BBC1 for 14 years and the Pick of the Pops show on BBC Radio 2 for ten years.But the star, known for his sunny disposition, bright smile and tan, disappeared from public life two years ago admitting he \u0027wouldn\u0027t leave the house\u0027 because of depression and regrets that he had failed to admit he was gay until he was 45.Not telling his mother was one of his great regrets.He told Ok Magazine in 2008: \u0027She heard me on the phone to my then boyfriend, who was very obviously gay, very camp.\u0027She said to me: \u0027I never want you to feel there\u0027s something you can\u0027t tell me, and I will never judge or discriminate\u0027.\u0027That was the point I should have gone: Mum, I\u0027ll tell you I\u0027m gay\u0027.     Dale failed to make it to his close friend Cilla Black\u0027s funeral in 2015, sparking concerns about his health and he later admitted he couldn\u0027t leave the house    Dale Winton had an unlikely friendship with Liverpool and Scotland hard man Graeme Sounness and his wife KarenDale Winton had an unlikely friendship with Liverpool and Scotland hard man Graeme Sounness.The friends met in a London restaurant after Dale flirted with the former footballer\u0027s wife Karen.Dale shouted across to Mrs Souness \u0027You\u0027re gorgeous, you are\u0027 before turning to her husband and saying: \u0027And so are you\u0027.Graeme would later appear on his mockumentary  wedding to Nell McAndrew where he was Dale\u0027s best man and organised his stag do.Later explaining what their relationship was like Dale said: \u0027It\u0027s great. People always do a double take when I -camp-as-Christmas Dale - walk into a restaurant with the hard man of football and Karen. \u0027Having had so many hard knocks himself in life, Graeme is a brilliant people manager. \u0027And because he isn\u0027t in the same business as me he is able to bring a completely fresh perspective to my problems. I love asking him for advice\u0027.                                                      "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/19/10/4B4F6DF800000578-0-image-m-49_1524130292624.jpg","title":"JANET STREET PORTER Charles replace mother head Commonwealth","story":"    Prince Charles dons a traditional feather headband for an Aboriginal welcome ceremony in AustraliaThe 53 men and women who gathered in the lavish state rooms at Buckingham Palace this week knew what was coming - the Royal family has been mounting a charm offensive for months, culminating in Prince Charles touring Australia in searing heat.He even wore a white feather head dress to meet tribal elders, although he refused to remove his shoes or shed his suit on the beach.The Queen has just opened the formal meeting of the Commonwealth Heads with a heart-felt plea for her eldest son to take over her role as their leader, declaring that it was her ‘sincere wish’ that they vote for Charles to succeed her. Should her wish be granted?This group of nations - from Canada to Cameroon, Australia to Antigua - is made up of countries and small islands which Britain inherited, conquered and used to advantage as we built an Empire.We used their people as slaves and cheap labour. We plundered their resources, dumped our convicts on their shores and took hundreds of years to belatedly allow them to claim independence.There’s a strong argument that- in the 21st century - the Commonwealth represents a paternalistic, outdated view of the world.The Queen tells world leaders that it is her \u0027sincere wish\u0027...Theresa May promises to introduce a ban on the sale of...Share this articleNevertheless, ever since the Queen took over as Head following the death of her father George VI, she has enchanted and beguiled the most republican of member states.Elizabeth made the Commonwealth her special project, travelling thousands of miles to visit the 53 territories and realms, and has shown huge compassion and understanding of the issues facing its disparate members.          Her majesty and the heir to the throne (pictured together) are followed out of the ballroom by the Duchess of Wales following today\u0027s Commonwealth summitNow, at 92 on Saturday, she’s anxious to step down, and gave up long-haul travel in 2013.Unlike most of the Commonwealth leaders, Elizabeth was born into immense privilege - she inherited wealth and far-flung places that have few ties to the United Kingdom.There are plenty of reasons why the Commonwealth should not work as a loose grouping of states - but amazingly, it continues to survive, providing a useful forum which draws countries together, rather than apart.Given that the British throne rules a diminishing number of Commonwealth nations - why should the next leader come from the House of Windsor?Would it not be fairer to let the Commonwealth Heads of Government hold a secret ballot and choose who should replace the Queen?The UK’s current immigration crisis - over the British subjects who arrived to work from the Caribbean as part of the ‘Windrush’ scheme, is an embarrassing disgrace during this week of Commonwealth ‘unity’.          The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall are pictured riding in a car along The Mall in London after the formal opening in Buckingham Palace of the Commonwealth Heads of Government MeetingThe Windrush workers were invited to the UK to help rebuild Britain after the war, and are valued members of society. They were not shirkers, but newcomers who have enriched British culture.A blame game is going on, as politicians squabble over who is responsible for destroying the entry papers of over 50,000 Windrush immgrants, many of whom have been refused the right to work, to claim benefits and receive healthcare, and to obtain a British passport, all because the original documents showing their status cannot be found. Some have even been deported by mistake.This unfortunate cockup reveals how some white British politicians and the Establishment secretly view the Commonwealth.At the Commonwealth Games in Australia the other week, many of the British medal winners will be the grandchildren of Windrush families - we’re proud to call them British when it suits us.The Commonwealth countries need a leader who can speak out in these situations, and demand justice, not someone served by footmen in knee breeches.          The Commonwealth countries need a leader who can speak out in these situations, and demand justice, not someone served by footmen in knee breechesIn 2018, the Commonwealth can’t re-inforce the stereotype of a Regal head, someone who dishes out patronage and attends meaningless ceremonies and military events all over the world.The Commonwealth includes countries who still enforce the death penalty, who are not receptive to gay rights and who don’t think women should be allowed abortions. Navigating all that and pushing for change requires diplomacy, tact, and people skills - something which the Queen possesses in spades.To succeed her, a career politician or a charismatic leader is required. The only downside? They might not own palaces, sycophantic staff or be able to afford champagne and swanky canapes.Is Prince Charles truly the best candidate? He rarely looks at ease in these situations, his life has been spent waiting on the sidelines, being indulged and spoilt, and his relationship with his children has only recently improved.His relationship with his former wife was disastrous. Sensing that the handover might be tricky with some Commonwealth members, the Queen has been using her brand to reinforce the notion that the Royal family are willing to take on new challenges involving young people and sexual equality.Highly paid PR people and Private Secretaries are mounting a charm offensive to launch a second wave of junior Royals into key roles.Princess Eugenie - 8th in line to the throne and 15 other Commonwealth realms, according to her Dad’s website - turned up at a reception this week wearing a short dress and scuffed suede boots - hardly a suitable outfit for someone aspiring to ‘lead’ another democracy.Prince Harry - 5th in line to the UK throne and 15 countries - has just been appointed Commonwealth Youth Ambassador by his granny.He introduced Meghan Markle, his bride to be, to the assembled youth leaders as if they were leading a world-wide crusade for gay rights. It all sounded a bit like a rehearsal for their wedding next month.The notion that Meghan Markle will be touring the world telling other countries about human rights is patronising in the extreme.I don’t doubt for a moment that the couple are sincere and well-intentioned - but will any political leader be swayed by a woman from a TV soap? You might as well send Bono or Sting.           In 2018, the Commonwealth can’t re-inforce the stereotype of a Regal head, someone who dishes out patronage and attends meaningless ceremonies  all over the world"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/19/21/4B54857D00000578-5635235-image-a-151_1524170360667.jpg","title":"The Queen Prince Charles welcome world leaders Buckingham Palace state dinner","story":"Look blooming beautiful like Beatrice in a floral gown by Needle \u0026amp ThreadNow reduced to £212.50!With the Duchess of Cambridge on maternity leave, we\u0026#39ve been looking to the rest of the Royal family for some style inspiration recently.So far this week Megan Markle, Sophie Wessex and Princess Eugenie have carried out engagements wearing labels like Altuzarra, Black Halo, Suzannah and Whistles, but how lovely is Princess Beatrice\u0026#39s dress here?

In November, students in Sussex, Bristol, Leicester, Manchester and London all took part in protests demanding an end to Prevent. It was part of a tour of campuses organised by the NUS.A previous tour in 2015 included events campaigning against Prevent at Birmingham, Glasgow and Swansea universities.Terrorism expert Professor Anthony Glees, of Buckingham University, said the protest targeting Mr Kaplan was ‘totally unacceptable behaviour’. Prevent is ‘not an obligation on lecturers to spy on students’, he said, adding that staff ‘have a duty of care … to prevent them being drawn into extremism’.‘The hounding of this man is unacceptable and inconsistent with what should go on in a university.’ Westminster University said it supports students’ rights to make their voices heard through peaceful protest, but a spokesman added: ‘The university condemns the public naming of a member of our staff and the calls for his removal.’A Soas spokesman said its approach to Prevent was primarily ‘safeguarding the welfare our students and staff’ but that this is ‘balanced against our fundamental commitment to academic freedom’.Mr Olatunji said: ‘Students from different universities and a wide range of student groups organised independently and protested against the implementation of the widely discredited Prevent duty at the University of Westminster.‘Yusuf Kaplan has been identified as a key figurehead in pushing for draconian implementation of this policy … The protest was intended to disrupt actions at the university and push for increased transparency … which it has successfully done.’Miss Koutteineh did not respond to requests for comment.  Poor, little rich kids who spout hatredMIDDLE CLASS CHEERLEADER FOR TERRORIST GROUPSFarah Koutteineh, an international relations student at Westminster University orchestrated the campaign demanding the sacking of Yusuf Kaplan. The 20-year-old identified the interfaith adviser as the ‘core problem’ at a meeting before the protest and led 30 demonstrators to his office where she egged them on in a chant of ‘shame’.As head of the student Palestinian Society she has held events celebrating women including Leila Khaled, the world’s first female terrorist hijacker and later leader of the terror group Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.The daughter of a charity director and a journalist, Miss Koutteineh is listed at the £530,000 family home in Twickenham, south-west London.EU ENVOY’S SON LED DEMO AGAINST CHURCHILL CAFEDimitri Cautain helped lead students who burst into a Winston Churchill themed cafe in January denouncing the wartime PM as a ‘racist’.

His father is now the EU ambassador to Pakistan, based in Islamabad.The social anthropology and politics student at the School of African and Oriental Studies is a union officer and lists ‘marching and pushing cops off campus’ among his interests.At the protest, Mr Cautain helped carry the giant loudspeaker through which chants of ‘shame’ were made against Mr Kaplan.

The prince has had to tread carefully, for fear of appearing too pushy on his mother\u0027s turf or, conversely, of appearing uninterested  There could be little doubt about the prevailing view among the members as they assembled at Buckingham Palace yesterday morning for the opening ceremony of the largest Commonwealth summit in the organisation\u0027s history.It came despite reports claiming that some Commonwealth leaders remain \u0027underwhelmed\u0027 by the Prince of Wales, while senior Labour figures, including leader Jeremy Corbyn, have questioned whether he should be honoured with the role.It fell to the Maltese prime minister, as the Commonwealth\u0027s outgoing chair-in-office, to speak on behalf of his colleagues.\u0027We are elated by the vigour with which the Prince of Wales actively participates in Commonwealth affairs,\u0027 said Dr Joseph Muscat. \u0027We are certain that when he will be called upon to do so, he will provide solid and passionate leadership for our Commonwealth.\u0027It remains to be seen whether the leaders decide to formalise this intention in today\u0027s end-of-summit communique. Since there is no constitutional rule about the headship, there is no requirement to do so.And although there is no vacancy yet, this was still a landmark moment. The prince has been quietly assuming more and more of the monarch\u0027s duties – investitures, overseas tours and, most recently, honouring the fallen at the Cenotaph on Remembrance Sunday.           The Queen\u0027s ringing endorsement of the prince was particularly striking because, until now, she has avoided interfering in the business side of things But the Commonwealth question has always been studiously avoided. The prince has had to tread carefully, for fear of appearing too pushy on his mother\u0027s turf or, conversely, of appearing uninterested.Yet having visited 44 of the 53 nations of the Commonwealth (he has been to ten in the past year alone) and having known all its leaders since birth, he probably understands \u0027the club\u0027 better than anyone alive, with the exception of his parents.Yesterday he spoke fondly of what has been \u0027a fundamental feature of my life for as long as I can remember\u0027 and of bygone Commonwealth statesmen such as Pierre Trudeau, former prime minister of Canada, and Jomo Kenyatta, former president of Kenya. Both men\u0027s sons – Justin Trudeau and Uhuru Kenyatta – have since followed their fathers into politics. Both of them were seated on the stage yesterday with the other premiers. The Windsors are certainly not the only Commonwealth dynasty.The Queen\u0027s ringing endorsement of the prince was particularly striking because, until now, she has avoided interfering in the business side of things.Over nearly seven decades she has held this argumentative organisation-cum-clan together, listening to their troubles in endless private audiences, wining and dining them, breaking up fights and generally keeping the show on the road.But this was the nearest she has ever come to an instruction.Cleverly, she talked of the prince continuing her father\u0027s work as well as her own.  The Queen has told foreign dignitaries of her \u0027sincere wish\u0027 that they pick Prince Charles to take over as leader of the Commonwealth during a large summit at Buckingham Palace Commonwealth summits are unlike any other, not least because there are no interpreters. The family atmosphere was evident even before the start yesterday as the leaders gathered in the Blue Drawing Room at Buckingham Palace.Usually, royal guests in the state apartments stand around nervously, trying not to touch anything. This lot swaggered in, many giving each other bear hugs, and cheerfully plonked themselves down on priceless sofas and chairs, making themselves thoroughly at home.It is one of the reasons why the Queen has always enjoyed these summits, and why there was an added poignancy to yesterday\u0027s proceedings. For this was a farewell of sorts – not that anyone put it quite like that.The Queen, who celebrates her 92nd birthday tomorrow, no longer undertakes long-haul travel. These Commonwealth summits, held every other year, take place in Britain only every 20 years or so. The next one is scheduled for Malaysia, and the Prince of Wales will represent the Queen there.She will continue to play an active part in Commonwealth affairs and meet its leaders when they are in Britain. But her days of far-away summits are over.It explains why this gathering had attracted the largest number of premiers in Commonwealth history, with 47 heads of government present among 53 delegations.She attended her first gathering of its leaders as a princess, when her father, King George VI, created the modern organisation out of the remnants of the British Empire. There were only eight members of the Commonwealth when the Queen came to the throne.          Britain\u0027s Prince Charles greets India\u0027s Prime Narendra Modi in a receiving line for the Queen\u0027s Dinner on Thursday night In 1953, she was the dazzling debutante head surrounded by grand old stagers like Churchill, Menzies and Nehru. She would entertain the Commonwealth prime ministers on their annual trips to London until they decided to rotate these gatherings among the member nations. In 1971 the first Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (or CHOGM) took place in Singapore.Prime Minister Edward Heath formally advised the Queen not to attend. He warned that there would be a row over British arms sales to South Africa and that there would be a toxic atmosphere – as indeed there was. The Commonwealth came close to imploding there and then.The Queen was adamant that she would never miss another one. She has been turning up ever since, holding her audiences, her banquets and her receptions (with the exception of 2013, when the new long-haul ban ruled out a journey to Sri Lanka). All through the 1970s and 80s, all through the bust-ups over Rhodesia and South Africa, she was there in the wings, defusing the tension, raising the tone, nudging the organisation towards consensus rather than polarisation.Along the way, the Commonwealth would enjoy great triumphs – notably the end of apartheid, the return of South Africa to \u0027the club\u0027 and the creation of an independent Zimbabwe.          The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall are pictured riding in a car along The Mall in London after the formal opening in Buckingham Palace of the Commonwealth Heads of Government MeetingThe fact that dozens of ex-colonies have maintained such a close bond with the once-loathed ex-imperial Crown has been, in no small part, down to the way the Queen has personally reframed that relationship.In recent years, the Commonwealth may have lost its way at a political level, eclipsed by a myriad of grander, flashier copycats – the G20, the EU and so on. Its critics suggest it is an outdated, clapped-out post-imperial has-been. But it still does its best work at the people-to-people level through numerous grass-roots associations, plugging away on tiny budgets.It has plenty of admirers and jealous rivals. The French have done their best to emulate it. There are many nations who want to join.This is a unique outfit with a unique character, forged through shared bonds of history, language, law and sacrifice. Last night\u0027s dinner was proof of that. State banquets at the Palace always have a U-shaped table with the Queen at the top. Not this one.     Last night, the Queen ordered round tables of ten so that no one was below the salt Missing his Markle: Harry and William join the Queen as she...British fishing firm can appeal against a controversial...How and when will we know if Prince Charles will succeed the...King of Swaziland renames the country Kingdom of eSwatini to...Share this articleLast night, the Queen ordered round tables of ten so that no one was below the salt. She sat between Dr Muscat of Malta and president Adama Barrow of The Gambia (now a Commonwealth member once more, having recently ejected the madman who used to be in charge).All the Royal Family were there, with the exception of a convalescing Prince Philip and a heavily pregnant Duchess of Cambridge. Spread all around the Picture Gallery was that old ex-imperial family to which the Queen pledged herself on her 21st birthday.By tradition, a summit newcomer had been invited to raise the toast to the Queen at the black tie banquet. President Nana Akufo-Addo of Ghana struck a somewhat melancholy note as he expressed \u0027our collective regret that she will no longer automatically be present at our proceedings\u0027.But he voiced a \u0027fervent hope\u0027 that \u0027her deep love for this association will continue to light the way for all of us\u0027.

A second guy was smashing another vehicle, which was also an A-class Mercedes like mine.\u0027I came flying out wearing a pair of pyjama shorts and a summer jumper and one of them ran round the car and just came straight at me, which was the reason I managed to stop him.\u0027I used to play a lot of rugby, so I hit him with a shoulder and then I punched him a couple of times. I broke the visor clean off his helmet, which was one of those half-helmets with no jaw protector.\u0027He swung a quick sequence of frenetic punches, clearly shocked by my intervention. We exchanged a few blows, but the idea was simply to stop him. I didn\u0027t want to give him a kicking, but we did exchange blows.\u0027A second masked moped rider then stormed over to help his accomplice.He added: \u0027He grabbed my jumper and began to lay into me. I was fending one off and hitting the other one. Then I think it dawned on them. They thought, sh**, I\u0027ve just run into someone I don\u0027t want to be running into.\u0027Seeing he was outmatched, the second man got back onto his moped and raced away, leaving his partner facing Mr Canny alone.\u0027Not a lot was going through my mind,\u0027 he recalled. \u0027My only thought was, those absolute f****** b*******, breaking into my car. The second guy\u0027s hands were in back of my car.\u0027 Of the remaining suspect, he said: \u0027He was strong for small guy and from the look in his eyes I could tell he was off his head on something. He smelled strongly of marijuana.\u0027He was just lashing out at me and trying to push me against the wall. We started grappling and I tried to sweep him.\u0027It didn\u0027t work, but then I managed to get behind him and fold his body in two. I knew that he would eventually run out of steam.\u0027It was the sheer weight advantage allowed me to overpower him and stop him from getting away.\u0027We heard sirens. At that point he panicked, and for a good minute-and-a-half he was really kicking off to get away.\u0027Then he started apologising and offering to pay me and pay for the damage to the car.\u0027I told him to calm down and said I wasn\u0027t going to hurt him, but he had to stay here until the police came to take him away. I told him to stop fighting me, as I didn\u0027t want to have to hit him back.\u0027By this time, the man was sweating heavily and his helmet had entirely come off. He was struggling to breathe, and pulled down the balaclava he was wearing underneath the helmet to catch his breath.\u0027That was when he started to threaten me,\u0027 Mr Canny said. \u0027He said that he knew where I lived and that he would come back. I didn\u0027t take very kindly to that.\u0027I said you\u0027re not coming back anywhere mate, you do not threaten me like that. And we exchanged a couple more punches.\u0027Mr Canny admitted that he put himself at risk. \u0027If he\u0027d have pulled a knife, I\u0027d be in a lot of trouble,\u0027 he said.\u0027When I went out there I didn\u0027t know what I\u0027d find. There\u0027s huge risk involved in putting yourself in that situation.\u0027He added: \u0027I don\u0027t feel like a hero. I\u0027m just a person in the right place at the right time – or the wrong place at the wrong time, depending on how you view it.\u0027\u0027The police were extremely thankful. They said thanks to you catching him in the act, we have potentially solved 10 crimes by catching this guy. \u0027I had no time to think, I just acted. But it was great that the police thanked me and didn\u0027t give me a moment of bother.\u0027                                                      "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/20/09/04B1CFAC000007D0-0-image-a-2_1524213218020.jpg","title":"North South Korea open telephone hotline leaders","story":"    North and South Korea have opened a telephone hotline between leaders as they look at resolving their nuclear standoff.

A 2015 U.N. report suggested that North Koreans working overseas earned Pyongyang between $1.2 billion and $2.3 billion a year. Other estimates put earnings in the hundreds of millions of dollars.The major markets for North Korean workers are China and Russia, but the Gulf also hosts thousands. Despite many living in poverty, North Korea is understood to spend up to a fifth of its annual GDP on the military. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/20/11/4B541CCC00000578-0-image-m-11_1524220327026.jpg","title":"Toddler nail clipper lodged stomach swallowing accident","story":"An X-ray picture (left) shows the nail clipper stuck in the boy\u0027s stomach.

Piers with Wenger in 2000. He has since grown tired of his team\u0027s poor performances and has been calling for him to goThis season has been even worse than that.We\u0027re currently 6th in the League, out of both domestic competitions, and all that\u0027s left to play for is the Europa League, the ugly sister to the Cinderella-style Champions League that no big club wants to play in.As performances on the field have fallen, so has the size of the crowds.The Emirates stadium, supposedly our bold new platform to the elite of world football, has resembled a half-empty graveyard at times during recent games.Yet still Wenger\u0027s excuses have kept coming there\u0027s always a reason for our persistent failure in big competition, which has nothing to do with him.In the end, there is one statistic that says it all: Sir Alex Ferguson has won the Premier League five times since Wenger last won it, and he\u0027s been retired for five years.It\u0027s been so sad to see the slow, inexorable demise of our once great titan.          Some Arsenal fans have long waged a campaign calling for Wenger to be sackedArsenal legend Ian Wright put it well recently: \u0027Watching Wenger now is like witnessing the ageing Muhammad Ali against Larry Holmes or Brazil\u0027s Ronaldo when he got fat. The problem with Arsène is there is no one in his corner prepared to throw in the towel.\u0027Well, now he\u0027s done it himself.Or perhaps he was urged to throw it by board members at Arsenal? I know at least one who told me a few months ago he was hoping to persuade Wenger to finally see the writing on the wall.It doesn\u0027t really matter.Wenger\u0027s going and it\u0027s the end of one of the longest and most extraordinary reigns by any manager of any football club.          Nobody, least of all me, has enjoyed seeing him reduced to a pale shadow of the manager he used to beIt\u0027s a bitter-sweet moment, even for people like me who\u0027ve been demanding it happen for nearly a decade.Before the comparative misery of recent years – just three (devalued) FA Cup wins in 14 years is not a return \u0027big club\u0027 fans paying the highest ticket prices in Europe should reasonably accept - Wenger was a God to all Arsenal fans.We won the Double in his first season 19978, and again in 2002.Then in 2004, we became the first – and to date ONLY – team to go through an entire English league season unbeaten.The \u0027Invincibles\u0027 as they became known were a dazzling side, bursting with incredible talent like Thierry Henry, Dennis Bergkamp and Robert Pires, and a ferocious fighting spirit led by captain Patrick Vieira that cowed many opponents into submission before the game even started.When we won the League that season, at the home of our bitter North London rivals Tottenham Hotspur, I was a guest of Lord Sugar\u0027s in the Spurs boardroom.Understandably, it had emptied long before Arsenal\u0027s players stopped celebrating out on the pitch.(Sugar was half way back to Chigwell before the final whistle, so desperate was he to avoid my inevitable gloating.)In fact, there was just me and my dad, ironically a lifelong Spurs fan, left when the door suddenly swung upon, and in walked Wenger and his long time No2, Pat Rice.I embraced them both like they were surgeons who\u0027d just saved my life – arguably, preposterously, this achievement felt even sweeter than that.Then I ordered the most expensive bottle of French red wine the boardroom stocked, at Lord Sugar\u0027s expense obviously, and the four of us sat alone together for an hour chatting about football.I met Wenger many times in those glorious early years and football was pretty much all he ever talked about.But he did it with such passion and knowledge.As anyone in the game will attest, Wenger\u0027s an erudite, well-read and charismatic man who is totally obsessed with football.          Wenger was a God to all Arsenal fans and he\u0027s an erudite, well-read and charismatic man who is totally obsessed with footballHis idea of a great night is sitting at home watching a lower league Swedish reserve game on TV.For my part, that hour I spent in the Spurs boardroom with him remains one of the greatest experiences of my life.I can genuinely say I\u0027ve never loved any man more than I loved Arsène Wenger that day.By yesterday, 14 years on, that love had dissolved into a feeling of such despair I could barely look at the man.As Socrates said: \u0027The hottest love has the coldest end.\u0027And yet now, as I finally write Wenger\u0027s Arsenal obituary and remember the incredible highs I experienced under him in that first epic decade, those old feelings stir once more.Like any elongated orce, this has been a painful process for all Arsenal fans.Nobody, least of all me, has enjoyed seeing him reduced to a pale shadow of the manager he used to be.I particularly loathed seeing him showered with vicious personal abuse in the street from time to time by a few idiotic yobs.Contrary to popular belief, I have never hated Wenger the man I\u0027ve only hated his refusal to step down when it was obvious he should, especially when brilliant potential replacements like Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola came on the market and were swooped up by Premier League rivals.But now, finally, he\u0027s done so and that allows me to pay tribute to Arsene Wenger, rather than incessantly moan about him.          Wenger pictured when he first arrived at Arsenal\u0027s then-home Highbury in 1996For eight years, he rivalled Sir Alex as the best manager in the world and based on that period alone, he was the best in Arsenal history.He\u0027s won 10 trophies in 22 years and over 1200 games.But his true legacy will be the way he transformed the way English football was played and how the players conducted themselves.Out went the beer, in came the scientific diets and fitness regimes.More importantly, Wenger drove his teams to play exhilarating one-touch, high-speed football of such exquisite skill and style that it made us the envy of the world.\u0027My never ending struggle in this business is to release what is beautiful in man,\u0027 he told L\u0027Équipe in 2016.That struggle grew harder in recent years as Wenger\u0027s powers lessened, but this is not the day to dwell on that.This is the day to look back with gratitude for the great times he gave us.Wenger\u0027s announcement hit the perfect note.\u0027I managed the club with full commitment and integrity,\u0027 he said, which is entirely true.Then he added: \u0027I urge our fans to stand behind the team to finish on a high. To all the Arsenal lovers, take care of the values of the club. My love and support forever.\u0027          I have no doubt Arsenal fans, for so long bitterly fractured by contrary views of Wenger, will now rally as one to salute him into his Arsenal retirementWhether you were Wenger Out, or Wenger In, that\u0027s a sentiment to bring a lump to the throat.I hope we now go on and win the Europa League for him.That would be the best way to send Wenger off.It won\u0027t be easy because our semi-final opponents are the very capable Atletico Madrid whose manager Diego Simeone is just the kind of youthful, ruthless, dynamic firebrand that Wenger used to be.But I have no doubt Arsenal fans, for so long bitterly fractured by contrary views of Wenger, will now rally as one to salute him into his Arsenal retirement.The Emirates stadium will be packed for every one of the final few home games, and the roars of \u0027One Arsene Wenger\u0027 will once again be heard all over North London.That is no less than he deserves.It\u0027s time for Wenger\u0027s most ferocious critics like me to get off his back and say what we have wanted to say throughout these long, tortuous years campaigning for his exit: \u0027Goodbye, Arsene, and thank you.\u0027"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/20/15/4B5ABBEC00000578-5638857-image-a-26_1524233083082.jpg","title":"Owner mansion ordered chop huge trees neighbour complained kept shadows","story":"    Dr David Hamilton owns the property Isla Bank House in Keith, Moray, a 12-bedroomed property that was built around 1892 and boasts antique furnishings and extensive gardens          A prolonged row between Dr Hamilton and his neighbour Stacey Chalmers over a \u0027green wall\u0027 of western red cedar trees has seen council bosses order a large section of the 230ft long hedge be cut down Mrs Chalmers said efforts to reach an amicable settlement with her Norfolk-based neighbour had failed despite numerous attempts in the past three years.She claimed the shadow cast by the enormous trees opposite her home forced her to have her kitchen lights on all year round and starved her back garden of sunshine.She used high hedge laws in a bid to have Moray Council order to take action after claiming the attempts at negotiating an agreement had left her \u0027stressed and overwhelmed\u0027.A report issued by council planners following site visits resulted in victory for Mrs Chalmers and an order to chop the trees issued last month.Planners said: \u0027The hedge is currently between approx 45 and 52ft high and therefore results in a significant impact on the applicant\u0027s conservatory and kitchen windows and rear private garden space. Elephants on the rampage in north London: Incredible...My brand new £700,000 house stinks!

You must be stupid\u0027. Canny, 33, a commodities broker from Essex, told MailOnline after the incident: \u0027Of course I\u0027d do it again. If it happened again tonight, I\u0027d do the same thing again and I wouldn\u0027t even think about it.\u0027He added: \u0027Why should I allow people to break into my property and damage my vehicle? Where I come from, that\u0027s not acceptable.\u0027I\u0027m absolutely not having someone rob my car with me sitting upstairs. If I\u0027m out and it happens, there\u0027s nothing I can do about it.

There were about 20 people watching in the end.\u0027 Before targeting the investment banker, de Silva and a pal stole over £1,000 in goods in thefts from Chelsea and Fulham residents earlier that night.          Former amateur rugby player Stephen Canny tackled the robbers in a pair of pyjama shortsOn Ellerby Street, Fulham, de Silva robbed lawyer Stephen Wisking and stole a Dell Laptop, an Apple iPad Pro, £100 euros, a blue canvas bags containing paperwork and another black bag from his BMW X5.He went on to Roskell Road, Putney, and stole Bose headphones and a red bag containing books and documents belonging to William Bond.In a third robbery at Beaufort Street, in Chelsea, he stole from Ashley Fromberg a black holdall and ID documents.The two Mercedes belonging to Stephen Canny and his girlfriend were the thieves\u0027 fourth target.He pinned de Silva onto the ground opposite Gordon Ramsay\u0027s Maze Grill restaurant in Chelsea, central London, as passersby watched on in horror at around 9.30pm on 7 March.          Mr Canny says he has four brothers so is not strangle to a bit of rough and tumbleMr Canny told MailOnline about why he tackled de Silva in an interview after the incident.He said  \u0027I got out the front door, one guy had smashed the window to my car. A second guy was smashing another vehicle, which was also an A-class Mercedes like mine.\u0027I came flying out wearing a pair of pyjama shorts and a summer jumper and one of them ran round the car and just came straight at me, which was the reason I managed to stop him.\u0027I used to play a lot of rugby, so I hit him with a shoulder and then I punched him a couple of times. I broke the visor clean off his helmet, which was one of those half-helmets with no jaw protector.\u0027He swung a quick sequence of frenetic punches, clearly shocked by my intervention. We exchanged a few blows, but the idea was simply to stop him. I didn\u0027t want to give him a kicking, but we did exchange blows.\u0027A second masked moped rider then stormed over to help his accomplice.He added: \u0027He grabbed my jumper and began to lay into me. I was fending one off and hitting the other one. Then I think it dawned on them. They thought, sh**, I\u0027ve just run into someone I don\u0027t want to be running into.\u0027Seeing he was outmatched, the second man got back onto his moped and raced away, leaving his partner facing Mr Canny alone.\u0027Not a lot was going through my mind,\u0027 he recalled. \u0027My only thought was, those absolute f****** b*******, breaking into my car. The second guy\u0027s hands were in back of my car.\u0027 Of the remaining suspect, he said: \u0027He was strong for small guy and from the look in his eyes I could tell he was off his head on something. He smelled strongly of marijuana.\u0027He was just lashing out at me and trying to push me against the wall. We started grappling and I tried to sweep him.\u0027It didn\u0027t work, but then I managed to get behind him and fold his body in two. I knew that he would eventually run out of steam.\u0027It was the sheer weight advantage allowed me to overpower him and stop him from getting away.\u0027We heard sirens. At that point he panicked, and for a good minute-and-a-half he was really kicking off to get away.\u0027Then he started apologising and offering to pay me and pay for the damage to the car.\u0027I told him to calm down and said I wasn\u0027t going to hurt him, but he had to stay here until the police came to take him away. I told him to stop fighting me, as I didn\u0027t want to have to hit him back.\u0027By this time, the man was sweating heavily and his helmet had entirely come off. He was struggling to breathe, and pulled down the balaclava he was wearing underneath the helmet to catch his breath.\u0027That was when he started to threaten me,\u0027 Mr Canny said. \u0027He said that he knew where I lived and that he would come back. I didn\u0027t take very kindly to that.\u0027I said you\u0027re not coming back anywhere mate, you do not threaten me like that. And we exchanged a couple more punches.\u0027Mr Canny admitted that he put himself at risk. \u0027If he\u0027d have pulled a knife, I\u0027d be in a lot of trouble,\u0027 he said.\u0027When I went out there I didn\u0027t know what I\u0027d find. There\u0027s huge risk involved in putting yourself in that situation.\u0027He added: \u0027I don\u0027t feel like a hero. I\u0027m just a person in the right place at the right time – or the wrong place at the wrong time, depending on how you view it.\u0027\u0027The police were extremely thankful. They said thanks to you catching him in the act, we have potentially solved 10 crimes by catching this guy. \u0027I had no time to think, I just acted. But it was great that the police thanked me and didn\u0027t give me a moment of bother.\u0027                                                      "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/20/09/04B1CFAC000007D0-0-image-a-2_1524213218020.jpg","title":"North South Korea open telephone hotline leaders","story":"    North and South Korea have opened a telephone hotline between leaders as they look at resolving their nuclear standoff.

Well, it financed the private luxury of the Kim family, the nuclear programme and the army.\u0027Facing US and international sanctions, North Korea has relied on its overseas labourers as a way to get cash. Figures vary on how much North Korea earns annually from its workers. A 2015 U.N. report suggested that North Koreans working overseas earned Pyongyang between $1.2 billion and $2.3 billion a year. Other estimates put earnings in the hundreds of millions of dollars.The major markets for North Korean workers are China and Russia, but the Gulf also hosts thousands. Despite many living in poverty, North Korea is understood to spend up to a fifth of its annual GDP on the military. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/20/12/015A2A4500001005-0-image-a-78_1524224842996.jpg","title":"Arsene Wenger marriage broke amid obsession football","story":"    Arsene Wenger split from his wife Annie Brosterhous after telling how his obsession with football was \u0027damaging\u0027 his family life because he was always thinking about the next game  Arsene Wenger driven out of Arsenal: Boardroom battles,...Share this article\u0027In my job I travel, but the problem is not so much the quantity of time you spend with your family, it is the quality.\u0027That is where this job is more damaging.

Critics say the doll does not reflect Kahlo’s heavy, nearly conjoined eyebrows, and its costume does not accurately portray her elaborate Tehuana-style dresses.Barbie is an American icon that has often been criticised as promoting an unrealistic body image and consumerist lifestyle. Kahlo was a lifelong communist who died in 1954. Last month, Mattel said in a statement that it worked with the Panama-based Frida Kahlo Corp, “which owns all the rights”. “The Frida Kahlo Corporation actively participated in the process of designing the doll, Mattel has its permission and a legal contract that grants it the rights to make a doll of the great Frida Kahlo,” the company’s statement said. The corporation said it got the rights through Kahlo’s niece, Isolda Pinedo Kahlo, more than a decade ago. The corporation said that it “celebrates the ideological contributions of Frida Kahlo which have transcended the borders of art and which will influence new generations as a world icon through the Frida Kahlo Barbie, which conserves the essence of Barbie and the legacy of Frida Kahlo”.Barbie marked International Women’s day in March by choosing 17 modern-day and historic role models to honour with a doll in their likeness.Included in the brand’s Inspiring Women series alongside Kahlo are the pioneering aviator Amelia Earhart and Katherine Johnson, the Nasa mathematician who broke race and gender barriers. Johnson, who is now aged 99, was featured in the recent film Hidden Figures.

I could watch Urs Fischer’s snails all day, not least because they’re not trying to tell me anything.Lubaina Himid’s deeply underwhelming painted cut-out dragons cross the vast atrium far above our heads at Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum. They look like leftovers from Chinese New Year. The installation is cumbersome and forced. Why am I here? The eighth edition of GI is full of false steps and wasted journeys. Sam Keogh has just emerged from some sort of cryogenic pod, marooned on the floor of Glasgow’s Gallery of Modern Art (GoMA). Keogh, artist-cum-astronaut, has seen better days, and so have I. He tells a very long tale of space exploration, gallons of human sperm and frozen eggs, as his craft malfunctioned somewhere on its mission to seed distant planets with the human race. Part sculpture, part-performance, with yards of plastic, tons of goo and electrical dreck, Keogh’s Kapton Cadaverine has some good gags, but its vision of the grubbiness of interstellar space travel is a familiar trope, especially to anyone who knows how trashed an airplane cabin looks after a long-haul flight. Richard Parry, formerly director of the Grundy Art Gallery in Blackpool, had less than a year to devise the programme. Cellular World: Cyborg-Human-Avatar-Horror, the group show he has devised in the difficult, overdecorated and pillared ground floor gallery at GoMA, plays on familiar tropes of failed dreams and dystopian futures. Jesse Darling’s washing line festoons the indoor sky with snarls of razor-wire, bunting, dishcloths, toys and babywear. John Russell’s billboard-scaled digital image is a kind of modern baroque version of architectural trompe l’oeil painting, continuing the galleries’ succession of pillars within the image itself, and filling the illusory space with a huge elephant’s head. The eyeless tusker looks back at us bleakly, as well it might. Small paintings are perched on the sofas in the British Heart Foundation charity shop. The faces of two young women smile and pout from under a pile of herbs and flowers and cut-out smiles in Linder’s little movie at the Glasgow Women’s Library. They stick out their tongues. Someone chases a herd of deer. Linder’s Bower of Bliss is an imaginary scene from the life of Mary Queen of Scots as if redone by Pipilotti Rist in the Scottish highlands. Graham Eatough and Stephen Sutcliffe’s reworking of Anthony Burgess’s Enderby novels, at Film City, are accompanied by fragments of the sets for their two films. The sets don’t add much and the films themselves are full of hammy, unfunny acting. Commissioned for last year’s Manchester International festival, the films apparently “cajole our notions of what comprises authenticity, posterity and the character of the artist”. They bring nothing new into the world, and my notions remain uncajoled. Over at Tramway, a deeply troubled figure is spotlit in a huge space. Enlarged from a small figurine in the Wellcome Collection, Mark Leckey’s Nobodaddy (titled after a poem by William Blake) is a seated god, full of wounds, holes and knobbly excrescences. His body hides speakers, and a voice fills the surrounding darkened space. A CGI apparition of the same figure hovers on a large screen across the gallery. We delve into his hollowed out innards. Leckey provides the voice of this abject figure, accompanied by horrible gurglings and rumblings and complaints. What a plight. Talk about the crisis of masculinity.The real strength of the citywide, sprawling festival rests on a few works. A live voice accompanies Tai Shani’s Tramway installation Dark Continent: Semiramis. Topless women wearing Spanx figure-shaping pantyhose walk on stage and pose themselves in a tableaux vivant. It is difficult to keep up with the labyrinthine text, apparently an extrapolation from a 1405 proto-feminist text, Christine de Pizan’s The Book of the City of Ladies. The staging is weird, the set a sort of mix of Joan Miró and new age nonsense, including a giant outstretched hand, hanging things that glow like ceramic jewellery, coloured balls and small platonic solids littering the floor, an orange puddle. A pink worm-like gut writhes across the stage. A female voice declaims, alternately soothing and erupting with sex and violence, pleasure and pain. I thought of Angela Carter’s Sadeian Woman and Pasolini’s Salò. To see one performance in Shani’s 12-part cycle is not enough. I need the text. I feel the whole thing is being snatched away even as I look.One of the bravest, edgiest works in this year’s GI, it repels as much as it compels. Shani’s cumbersome, ambitious and flawed performances led me circuitously to a bedroom in a Pollokshields flat, and an astonishing archival display of 1980s underground lesbian erotica, and then to a show of photographs and short films by the 75-year-old German film-maker Ulrike Ottinger at the Hunterian museum.Transgressive, erotic, alarming, unconscionable and marvellous, Ottinger’s work is a call to artistic freedom and formal rigour. Life-affirming and dangerous, she is an accidental mentor to the best younger artists here, and a rejoinder to mediocrity, to things I prefer not to recall. But as much as it is a showcase, or a baggy curatorial conceit, GI still has vitality, even if it feels spread too thin."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e290e57ac4672e5b0a88757cb23f31752e41a820/0_0_9421_7592/master/9421.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=ad7bfb154c27cec780ff8b66d82fc6fe 1240w","title":"mathieu asselin monsanto deutsche borse anniston alabama","story":"Almost a century ago, Monsanto opened a chemical factory in Anniston, Alabama. Mathieu Asselin spent years photographing this damaged landscape – including a creek where the water runs redIn June 1957, Disneyland in California added a new building to Tomorrowland, its vision of a carefree world to come. Made of plastic, the House of the Future looked suitably avant garde and was entirely mechanised. Sponsored by Monsanto, then one of the world’s biggest chemical companies, it attracted 20 million visitors over the next 10 years.However, as Mathieu Asselin points out in his book Monsanto: A Photographic Investigation, a very different vision of the future was unfolding in Anniston, Alabama. There, since the 1920s, Monsanto had been producing PCBs, chemicals widely used in the creation of lubricants, inks, paints and electrical equipment. PCBs were banned in the US in 1979 due to fears about their toxicity, but the damage to Anniston had already been done. Between 1929 and 1971, some 27 tonnes of PCBs were released into the atmosphere, 810 tonnes flushed into Snow Creek canal, and 32,000 tonnes deposited in an open-air landfill site near the city centre, according to a 2005 report by the Environmental Protection Agency.PCBs linger long in the environment and have been detected in water far from their original source of release. Prolonged exposure causes skin rashes in humans and changes in blood and urine that may denote liver damage. In 2013, the International Agency for Research on Cancer classified dioxin-like PCBs as human carcinogens.“I began the book seven years ago and I have often been shocked by what I have uncovered,” says Asselin. Using a mixture of his own photographs, archive material, court files, Monsanto’s own adverts and the stories of campaigners and ordinary citizens, his hard-hitting volume, which is shortlisted for this year’s Deutsche Börse photography prize, attacks Monsanto’s reputation and its practices. His approach is unapologetically crusading. “I am playing with fire for sure,” he says.Asselin’s often low-key landscapes show a town in decline: empty buildings, abandoned businesses, dilapidated houses overgrown by trees and weeds. His equally melancholy images of local residents include one of David Baker, 65, head bowed by his brother’s grave. The caption reads: “Terry Baker died at the age of 16 from a brain tumour and lung cancer, caused by PCB exposure. The average level of PCB in Anniston is 27 times higher than the national average.”In February 2003, residents of Anniston won a $700m (£491m) settlement from Monsanto in a now-famous court case in which they argued the multinational was responsible for polluting the town and harming its citizens – and that the company had been aware of the toxic effects of PCBs on human health and the environment for decades, but had done nothing about it. In 2007, high pollution levels from PCB dumping were still being recorded in the nearby Snow and Choccolocco creeks. In one 2012 photograph by Asselin, the water at Choccolocco creek appears to be red.As Asselin’s book makes clear, the 2003 settlement was just one relatively small legal skirmish in a much larger and longer battle that has pitted a global chemical corporation against communities across America and the globe. That ongoing battle sheds light on a US lobbying system that skews the democratic process and often results in politicians, scientists and experts siding with Monsanto against farmers and communities. “In America,” says Asselin, “the company funds both the Democrats and the Republicans. They don’t have a political standpoint, they just need to make sure everything is OK to make more money. This is the bigger point I am making – global business just cannot go on like this. It has to change.”Monsanto was one of the producers of the highly toxic defoliant, which is now linked to cancer and birth defects among the Vietnamese population, as well as physical and psychological issues affecting returning US servicemen. One arresting portrait is of Heather Bowser, a woman born with several fingers and part of her right leg missing. Another is a closeup of her deformed hand holding a photograph of her late father, Morris, who served in Vietnam and whose own myriad health problems were directly linked to exposure to Agent Orange.Asselin’s installation at the Photographer’s Gallery in London, where the work of the four Deutsche Börse finalists is on show, includes two wall-mounted tablets that have Deutsche Börse apps installed so that they can livestream the daily stock market prices of Monsanto and Bayer. (In 2016, Bayer announced that it was planning a $66bn takeover of Monsanto.) This should please the sponsors of the prize no end, I suggest. “I have to handle the nomination carefully,” says Asselin. “It is a recognition from my fellow artists and professionals – but it is also a prize sponsored by another big multimillion dollar company.” When I mention the Syngenta photo award, which purports to address issues of sustainability while being sponsored by a global pesticide manufacturer, he says: “It’s the biggest bullshit around.” Asselin is a breath of fresh air in a contemporary photography world where conceptual ambiguity too often undercuts social or political commitments. “I often don’t understand what photographers are trying to tell me,” he says, “so I try to make sure there is no room for ambiguity in my work. I want to make clear exactly what the problem is. There is just no time to waste being neutral.”• The winner of the prize is announced on 17 May. The Deutsche Börse exhibition at the Photographers’ Gallery, London, runs until 3 June."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7fec92bb9f43251291dd6c35e994d89d837e361d/0_0_5949_3959/master/5949.jpg?w=5750\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d1ee41eae275386ec46709855d2b0f7f 11500w","title":"50 years british photography twiggy whaling in pictures","story":"The Association of Photographers, which represents the UK’s professional photographers, is celebrating its 50th anniversary with AOP50, a retrospective of images curated by Zelda Cheatle.

Just over 80 years later, another American orcee, Meghan Markle, is set to give the British monarchy a new lease of life. Yet Wallis and Meghan have even more in common than just being American and orcees: they have both had biographies about them by me published this year. Some things are truly written in the stars.Meghan’s has been a remarkable journey. Much has been written about the fact that her mother, Doria, was an African-American woman with liquid brown eyes of slave descent, but what is less well known is that her father’s family can trace their ancestry back to Robert the Bruce. So you could say that Meghan was born into royalty, if you didn’t have much material and were desperate to pad out your book to 80,000 words.Although her parents split up when she was five, Meghan has always felt she came from a very loving and stable background. As she once told a Hollywood gossip column reporter when she was desperate to go into acting: “I come from a very loving and stable background. Do you know anyone who could give me a job?”From a very early age, it was obvious to all those around her that Meghan was possessed of a unique talent. At her private school in Los Angeles, she was even cast as the star in a production of The Princess Bride ahead of Scarlett Johansson, who had only just been born. One of the most formative moments of her early life was watching the funeral of Princess Diana on television. Little did she know that less than 20 years later, she would be marrying the young prince who was walking behind his mother’s coffin carrying a copy of Andrew Morton’s fabulous book, Diana: Her True Story In Her Own Words.Have I mentioned that Meghan is biracial? Being biracial has always been an integral part of Meghan’s identity. Largely because her mother was black and her father was white. Just thought I’d mention it. After leaving university, where she narrowly missed out on winning a Nobel prize, Meghan set her heart on becoming an actress and it wasn’t long before the parts came rolling in. Her first role was in a straight-to-DVD film whose name I can’t remember in which she had to say the word: “Hi.” As the producer later told me after hearing Meghan was getting married to Prince Harry: “She was the only actress we auditioned who could say ‘Hi’ as if she meant it.”Her big break came when she was asked to be a regular on Deal or No Deal, a gameshow in which she had to walk on set wearing next to nothing holding up box number 26. As the girl who carried box number 17 told me: “We could tell Meghan was a natural and was going to marry into royalty.” Filming for Deal or No Deal was a demanding process, yet Meghan still managed to fit in a pilates class and get in some charity work in preparation for meeting Prince Harry.At some point or other, Meghan married a film producer called Trevor, but once she had landed a leading part in a TV series called Suits, she decided to let him go by text, as she didn’t want to put him through the glare of publicity. “Meghan has always been really thoughtful like that,” one of her close friends told me.Have I mentioned that Meghan is biracial? Now that Meghan was a Hollywood star whom almost no one outside Hollywood had heard of, she devoted her life to helping others. Along with posting selfies on Instagram and setting up a website to promote organic kale and other lifestyle necessities for biracial women.After dumping various other men who couldn’t help with her career, Meghan had almost resigned herself to being single. But then Cupid’s arrow went a-quiver under the incandescent African skies. (God, who writes this rubbish?) So Meghan and Prince Harry met on a blind date and it was love at first sight. “Hi, I’m Prince Harry,” said Prince Harry. “You had me at Prince,” Meghan gushed.Things moved swiftly after that, and it wasn’t long before Meghan was invited to have tea with the Queen. Using all the skills she had learned as an actress, Meghan spent days rehearsing sipping tea from a cup and eating cucumber sandwiches. The big day went off splendidly and the biggest hurdle of her life had been cleared comfortably. On the way home, Harry asked Meghan to marry him. “I know it won’t be easy and you will have to give up your charity work, but I’d like you to be my wife,” he said.“Oh don’t worry,” she replied. “I’ve always wanted to be a princess. And you’re so hopeless, you can be my very own charity project.”Meghan immediately settled into her new role and every member of the royal family remarked on how brilliantly she shook hands with strangers. “She’s going to be a real asset,” said a minor royal who was still hoping for an invitation to the wedding.Life under the royal glare is never easy, though, and there are some who worry that Meghan may quickly get bored. But hey! If she does, she knows where to come to tell her story.

They would have been crawling v-e-r-y slowly back and forth past the houses of Theresa May, Amber Rudd, Nick Timothy and David Cameron – and those just for starters. Instead of the repulsive GO HOME message that adorned the infamous vans May’s Home Office sent out, which resulted in the eventual deportation of precisely 11 migrants, I would have something along the lines of STAY HOME. Stay home, permanently.Whether they would get the message is uncertain. Collectively, Britain did its very best to provide a hostile environment for May with the election result. The message was very clear: take a hike. Not a hiking holiday, but the full hike.Who are the Windrush generation?They are people who arrived in the UK after the second world war from Caribbean countries at the invitation of the British government. The first group arrived on the ship MV Empire Windrush in June 1948.What is happening to them?An estimated 50,000 people face the risk of deportation if they never formalised their residency status and do not have the required documentation to prove it.\u0026nbspWhy is this happening now?It stems from a policy, set out by Theresa May when she was home secretary,\u0026nbspto make the UK \u0027a really hostile environment for illegal immigrants\u0027. It requires employers, NHS staff, private landlords and other bodies to demand evidence of people’s citizenship or immigration status.Why do they not have the correct paperwork and status?Some children, often travelling on their parents’ passports, were never formally naturalised and many moved to the UK before the countries in which they were born became independent, so they assumed they were British. In some cases, they did not apply for passports. The Home Office did not keep a record of people entering the country and granted leave to remain, which was conferred on anyone living continuously in the country since before 1 January 1973.What is the government doing to resolve the problem?On Monday, the home secretary Amber Rudd\u0026nbspannounced the creation of a new Home Office team\u0026nbspdedicated to ensuring that Commonwealth-born long-term UK residents would no longer find themselves classified as being in the UK illegally.Yet the import does not seem to have got through to the prime minister, or the various arse-coverers around her. It’s fair to say we are dealing with a very specific class of unworthy here. There are few groups who take less responsibility for their actions, as this week in the Windrush scandal has laid starkly bare. Some of the most senior political figures in the land are – in the purest sense of one of their favourite terms – shirkers. They are feckless. They act like these things are happening to them, as opposed to because of them. Given the judgments they like to visit on the weaker members of society for comparatively minuscule transgressions, this makes them the most raging hypocrites too.In the Home Office, Amber Rudd can’t even commit to a personal pronoun. “I am concerned that the Home Office has become too concerned with policy and strategy, and sometimes loses sight of the inidual,” was the verdict of the specific inidual who is the actual home secretary, and who was clearly very much wishing people would lose sight of her. Complete tools always blame their workmen, and the civil servants union chief has now come out to imply this of Rudd.In No\u0026nbsp10 Rudd’s Home Office predecessor still, bogglingly, resists any personal blame. In one of his newspaper columns, May’s former chief of staff, Nick Timothy, claims – wrongly – that May was against the vans and was on holiday or something, while referring to the “so-called hostile environment policy” when it was literally called so by him and his boss. Meanwhile David Cameron – in pursuit of whose ludicrous back-of-a-napkin immigration targets all this was done – disembarked from the gravy train momentarily this week to ignore the subject entirely in a CNN interview.And on they all go. If the government is in any doubt as to why so many millions think it’s one rule for them and another for the little people, then this week couldn’t be a better primer. You lose one form and you lose your job, your cancer treatment, your benefits, your liberty you lose a generation’s forms and you’re the effing prime minister. Those condemned to battle the systems that ministers design know what happens if they make tiny errors. Furthermore, they know that if they messed up a tenth as badly in their jobs, they’d be sacked. But in the arse-over-tit world of government, you’re safe because your sacking would make the big boss – May – look weak. Just like your HR department, right? Except on crystal meth.I don’t want to fall back on a series of politicians’ best-loved cliches, but this level of irresponsibility is just scrounging with a red box. They play for high stakes – but never their own. It’s the sort of system-milking demonised in a benefits office in Grimsby but regarded as career progression in Westminster. It makes it appear there’s no glass ceiling in modern political life, just a reinforced lead floor. Once you’re in, you basically have to die to stop earning rewards. Take Timothy, who we can’t describe as back on his bullshit, because he’s never been off it. I’ve had yoghurts in my fridge longer than he was in the political wilderness. Or Cameron, whose CNN interview saw him still regurgitating his catchphrase “it was the right thing to do”. I do hope his forthcoming book embraces the absurdity, and is called All the Right Things to Do that I Did.Perhaps the most staggering part – for those of us not being imprisoned or barred from our mother’s funerals, I should stress – is how little self-awareness our leaders have about their failures and their own part in them. May still reckons the worst thing she ever did was run through a wheat field.I saw this show several times. Even if you weren’t the Self-Knowledge Impregnator’s target, you could still see the word every time you shut your eyes for ages afterwards. Don’t tell me we don’t invent beautiful machines in this country any more.Or at least we did. That was 21 years ago. Where is the Self-Knowledge Impregnator now? Has the hour of need ever been greater? Can’t it be strapped to the back of an advertising van and driven at top speed to the next cabinet meeting, in the name of human decency?"},{"url":null,"title":"colbert on michael cohen the word innocent is nowhere in this conversation","story":"Stephen Colbert and Trevor Noah talked about Trump lawyer Michael Cohen and America’s problem with over-policing black menLate-night hosts on Thursday discussed the upcoming talks between the Trump administration and the North Korean leader, Kim Jung-un, the likelihood Michael Cohen will flip on Donald Trump, and the arrest of two black men at a Philadelphia Starbucks.“Everyone is talking about Donald Trump’s potentially epic summit with Kim Jong-un,” Stephen Colbert began. “It’s the dispute of the ill-fitting suits. It’s the men with the nukes putting up their dukes.”“The stakes are huge,” the host continued, adding that Trump, according to reports, sees the North Korea crisis as his “Great Man” of history moment. “The greatest presidents end up on our currency. Donald Trump could end up on our hush money.”According to a source from Axios, Trump has said of the meeting: “Just get me in the room with the guy and I’ll figure it out.”“He’s going to wing it with a nuclear madman,” replied Colbert. “It’s like your surgeon going, ‘We’re just going to open you up and improvise.’Moving on to the president’s escalating legal troubles, Colbert said: “There are some doubts about the president’s current attorney and man-who’s-definitely-seen-the-Trump-sex-tape, Michael Cohen. Apparently, Trump and his advisers are increasingly worried that Cohen might be susceptible to cooperating with federal prosecutors.“One Trump team lawyer says Cohen’s loyalty depends on how much prison time he’s facing,” Colbert explained. He quoted from a Politico report in which a source said that, faced with just two to four years in prison, “Michael Cohen would be a stand-up guy. I think he’d tell them to go piss up a rope.” The source added: if “it’s 18 to 22, then how loyal is he?” “Michael Cohen disclosed Sean Hannity’s name in court after being asked twice,” Colbert shot back. “He’s not five minutes loyal.“Let’s just pause a moment to notice that they have jumped immediately to whether Michael Cohen will turn state’s evidence against the president of the United States to avoid jail time, which everybody believes is coming for at least one of these guys,” Colbert concluded. “The word innocent is nowhere in this conversation.”Meanwhile, Comedy Central’s Trevor Noah discussed the ongoing controversy involving two black men, Rashon Nelson and Donte Robinson, who were arrested for trespassing at a Starbucks while waiting to meet a friend.“If you’re a black person, you’re probably buzzing from some great news right now,” Noah began. “Kendrick Lamar just won a Pulitzer prize for music, the first time this award has gone to someone not in classical music or jazz. Other great news: Beyoncé tore the roof off Coachella. And guys, this was the blackest performance at the whitest festival.“All in all, it feels like a great couple of days for black America,” the host continued. “But unfortunately, if you’re a black person who is not on stage, not everything is going your way.”Noah then showed news coverage regarding Nelson and Robinson, who arrived at a Philadelphia Starbucks for a business meeting and were denied access to the restroom because it was only for paying customers. Moments later, a white store employee called 911 and police arrived on the scene to arrest the men.“How crazy is this? Two men arrested for waiting to meet someone at Starbucks,” Noah said. “There are some people saying, ‘Well, why were these guys in Starbucks doing nothing?’ Because that’s what Starbucks is for!”Noah continued: “If I can get serious for just a minute here: do you have any idea what it does to a person’s dignity to be arrested … by bike cops? Someone calls the cops on you, and instead of driving up with sirens wailing all bad-ass, they’re like ding, ding, ding ding.“America clearly has a problem with policing and black people,” the host added. “On the one hand, you have people calling the police because they see black people as inherently threatening. And then you have police who only know how to respond to a call with an arrest or violence.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc29fab12e09cbcdb3acda1b85fc12c0d5c3e092/0_4_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=2dc78b4f093fd9fbc1f0a960f38af205 1240w","title":"what steps can the uk take to reach net zero emissions by 2050","story":"The government has pledged to review its long-term climate targets. Renewable energy, housing and and transport are just some areas where new policies could cut emissions fastMore wind farms, solar power and electric cars: these are likely to be the future of the UK, under government plans announced this week to seek a zero-carbon economy in the next 30 years.Some of the less obvious effects could be just as transformative, however, involving innovations such as smart houses and smart roads, widespread changes to the countryside wrought by new tree-planting and new farming practices designed to conserve soils.There may need to be restrictions, too – in air travel, private transport, new building construction and our food and waste habits.At the meeting this week of heads of government of the Commonwealth, government minister Claire Perry made the surprise announcement that she would ask the Committee on Climate Change, the government’s statutory advisers on climate change, to consider ways the UK could become “net zero-carbon” by 2050. That is widely regarded as being in line with the goals of the 2015 Paris agreement on climate change, which require governments to hold global warming to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels, with an aspiration to hold warming to less than 1.5C, regarded as the limit of safety for small islands, which risk being swamped by rising sea levels.Dustin Benton, policy director at Green Alliance, a thinktank, said the government would have to bring forward new measures as a matter of urgency. “The government has made real progress on some issues, such as diesel cars and offshore wind, but there are glaring holes in areas such as energy efficiency and onshore renewables,” he said. “The UK can achieve net zero emissions, but to do so the government will need to fill these gaps and develop a new set of policies.”Benton highlighted waste, housing and transport as key areas in which new policies could cut emissions fast, and said progress on these could give the government the confidence to continue with the policies needed.Renewable energy is likely to be one of the chief beneficiaries. The industry has had a turbulent time in the last few years, with the removal or slashing of key subsidies and clear messages from ministers under the last government that onshore wind turbines were unwelcome.However, thanks largely to the growth in renewables, the UK’s electricity network was able to run without coal for two days this week, a landmark achievement.Emma Pinchbeck, executive director of trade body Renewable UK, said: “It is in the UK’s best interests for ministers to be ambitious on climate change action. The science shows we need to stay within 2C for the good of all nations, including the UK and Commonwealth countries. Meanwhile, rapid technology developments suggest that successful future economies will be those powered by low-carbon energy.”Noting that wind power is now the cheapest new form of power in the UK, she presented a vision of the UK’s low-carbon future in which society broadly would benefit, because it would mean “renewable energy, better quality homes, cleaner and more efficient transport systems and smart technologies”. She said: “What’s best for the planet can also turn out to be best for the economy and for people.”However bright the low-carbon future, hard choices will have to be made. Greenpeace’s executive director John Sauven spelled it out: no new runway at Heathrow. “The data show that the challenges posed by emissions from transport – land, sea and air – and our reliance on gas for heating will have to be confronted as a matter of urgency. The government must accept that no new runway at Heathrow will fit inside our carbon budget.”Less comfortably for many environmental campaigners, the government is also likely to have to consider new nuclear reactors. The plans for the UK’s first new atomic power plant in a generation, at Hinkley Point, have already run into controversy. The price paid to France’s partly state-owned EDF has been decried as far too high, and construction has proceeded slowly. On energy efficiency, too, the government will need a new approach. The flagship “green deal” policy aimed at encouraging householders to take on loans to insulate their properties proved a failure, and nothing new has been proposed to take its place. Ministers have shown little sign of wishing to grapple with the problem. Another technology that might have helped towards zero-emissions targets, carbon capture and storage, was scrapped under George Osborne and would be costly to revive.On a separate front, however, there have been important positive signals. As well as reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the UK could meet its carbon targets by increasing the absorption of carbon dioxide. Plans to grow new forests have been enthusiastically endorsed by Michael Gove, the environment secretary. This could provide a “carbon sink” to reduce the UK’s contributions to global warming. Likewise, better management of the soil by farmers could increase its carbon storage capacity, and Gove has made clear he sees this as a priority. If all these developments are not enough, ministers may also seek refuge in an often overlooked part of climate change policy. Since the Kyoto protocol of 1997, systems of trading carbon have been mooted and approved as ways of generating investment flows from the rich to the poor world. The idea is that rich countries that find it costly to cut their emissions can instead offset them by funding emissions reduction projects, such as wind farms or solar panels, in poorer nations. This is controversial, as many green campaigners insist that emissions cuts must be made at home, but it may be an option ministers wish to keep open."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9904d4ecc2676cc0c66d6ebe14e78213b4ef2d07/0_0_2828_1885/master/2828.jpg?w=480\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=7261c247eafac91e1b1d490d5a7dcdb1 960w","title":"al pacino scarface cast 35 anniversary tribeca film festival","story":"The team behind the crime classic reunited at the Tribeca film festival to celebrate the film’s 35th anniversary with some awkward moments• Sign up for Film Today and get our film team’s highlights of the dayWhen he declared that the world (and everything in it) was coming to him, the audience cheered. When he shot Robert Loggia (that chazzer) the audience cheered. When he wore a white brimmed ladies’ hat and flirted with Michelle Pfeiffer the audience cheered. But when he got blown away by a sawed-off shotgun at the end, the audience cheered at that, too. When people say they love Scarface, they love every bit of Scarface.The Oliver Stone-penned, Brian De Palma-directed rags-to-riches fable is 35 years old, and an anniversary screening at the Tribeca film festival was a reminder that this vulgar, brutal and, um, powdery gangster tale is every bit as entertaining as you remember. Though close to three hours, it zooms from the first electronic Giorgio Moroder beat to its final discharge of bullets. That a dazed, sourpuss Al Pacino slumping in a banquette surrounded by neon-lit mirrors half-listening to Richard Belzer make cocaine jokes is only one of this film’s indelible images tells you something.After the rowdy screening, De Palma, Pacino, Pfeiffer and Steven Bauer came out for a nearly 40-minute chat.Pacino, wearing a yellow scarf over a black shirt, was lively and gregarious, and explained how the film germinated after seeing Howard Hawks’ 1932 Scarface at a repertory theater in Los Angeles in the late 1970s. He dialed up producer Martin Bregman in New York, with whom he worked on Dog Day Afternoon and Serpico (and later Carlito’s Way and Sea of Love) and said: “I want to be Paul Muni.”Oliver Stone was commissioned to write a script and Sidney Lumet, who was the original director, had the idea to adapt it to the Mariel boatlift, in which 125,000 Cuban refugees came to Miami in 1980. Pacino and Bauer, who was born in Cuba with the name Esteban Ernesto Echevarría Samson, spent a month together, hanging out and creating backstories for their characters. “He helped me with everything Cuban,” Pacino said, who, in case you don’t know, is not Cuban, of Bauer.At its release, Scarface was notorious for its language. The F-bomb is dropped 207 times, or 1.21 times per minute. (It was a record holder until Eddie Murphy: Raw came out four years later.) “Bombast was part of what we were trying to say,” Pacino offered as explanation. This led to De Palma discussing the difficulty he had with the censors to get an R rating instead of an X.“I’d had battles with the ratings board on all the movies I made, and this was a last skirmish,” he said. He sent three different versions and when the final one still got an X, he went back to his original and said: “We’re going to war with these people. And we won.”Things got cringeworthy (but at least spirited) when the panel moderator, Jesse Kornbluth, asked his first direct question of Michelle Pfeiffer after the 16-minute mark. “As the father of a daughter,” he began, “I’m concerned with body image. The preparation for this film: what did you weigh?”The capacity crowd at the 2,800-seat Beacon Theatre booed and hissed, and one woman shouted: “Why do you need to know?!” As Kornbluth got defensive, Pfeiffer responded: “Well, okay, uh, I don’t know, but I was playing a cocaine addict, and that was part of the physicality of the part.” Being a pro, she was able to spin a yarn out of this inelegant question, and explained how it was supposed to be a three- or four-month shoot, but the filming went for six months. “I was starving by the end of it. I had members of the crew bringing me bagels, they were so concerned – I was living on tomato soup.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4930a23cd61a210bf82626eca03a7b493722865b/0_0_2932_1759/master/2932.jpg?w=1300\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=86d807adc70dea66f6b36c793a695dfa 2600w","title":"arsene wenger arsenal miracle worker lost his touch","story":"Few modern managers have had as profound an impact on one club as Wenger, whose long reign ultimately will be remembered more for the glorious history than underwhelming endLa Fin. And so the credits finally roll. Like reaching the end of some heaving biopic, it may take a while for Arsène Wenger to feel able to shake himself back into the real world, to emerge blinking from that life intensely lived as manager at Arsenal Football Club, to take off the red and white spectacles and not assess everything through that prism.Finally, now, he has reached that point that for so long seemed impossible, the trigger which has pushed the endgame button. The mantra that he would always respect his contract, the stubbornness that made it so implausible that he one day would do that, has been blown. The debate bubbled and frothed around him for years, for quite a lot of that turbulent second half of his tenure in London N5, but the truth is it was something that Wenger could not easily judge for himself because he was always so immersed. Bob Dylan caught the mood in inimitable style in one of his piercing love songs: “I could stay with you forever and never realise the time.” Wenger’s collaboration with Arsenal sucked them in deep, which is why, for club and man, this break will shudder through the both of them. Moving on, after such a long spell entwined, will be strange.Maybe it seems like yesterday, the cool January afternoon in 1989 when Wenger turned quizzically to the taxi driver who pulled up in the terraced streets near to Avenell Road and queried: “But where is the ground?” Retelling the story he remembers the reply – “We are here” – with the same mixture of bemusement and curiosity he had all those years ago. A very first visit to Arsenal, when he was the 40-year-old manager of Monaco passing through London, puzzled him most of all because he could not quite believe a grand and famous old stadium could exist amongst what appeared to be ordinary streets full of ordinary houses. He was charmed. Something of the romance of that first meeting never left him as he would in his later years occasionally drive by the façade of the old place, park up and indulge in some nostalgia.Maybe it seems like yesterday that he walked into a dressing room in the autumn of 1996 to find a squad coming to terms with the fact its inspirational captain, Tony Adams, had only days before announced his struggle with alcoholism. A predominantly British group, with stereotypically British qualities, would soon be open to progressive ideas even if a foreign manager was not initially everybody’s cup of tea. Adams described his own scepticism as “contempt before investigation” but would soon see how much there was to learn from a manager so different to those he came across before. Dennis Bergkamp was already in situ, a fresh-faced arrival with telescopic legs called Patrick Vieira had been ushered in on the incoming manager’s recommendation even before he arrived. Before long Wenger blended old and new perfectly to win the Premier League and FA Cup double.Maybe it seems like yesterday that David Dein, the Arsenal chief executive and friend of Wenger, signed a form to check the manager into a hotel at a gathering of football gliterati and on the section for profession wrote “miracle worker”. How about that for esteem. Arsenal were wowed by him in those early years. The “Arsene Knows” banner that aired frequently epitomised that. Back then dissenting voices were simply nonexistent.Maybe it seems like yesterday that the team were dubbed Invincibles for turning Wenger’s dream to complete a league campaign without defeat into glorious reality. Those peak years included a Champions League final, and a style of football that was widely admired. Some fans took to using the nickname “Wengerball” to explain the high-speed passing, injected with ingenuity and aesthetic combinations, which were a hallmark of the way they played at their very best. Nick Hornby summed it up by describing the surreal feeling for a fan who had seldom had the highest expectations to be watching some of the best players in the world play right there in front of his eyes in his club’s colours.Maybe it seems like yesterday that Arsenal bid farewell to their soulful home, Highbury, and moved down the road to the shiny, new bowl with naming rights that would be known as the Emirates Stadium. It was a change that would have massive ramifications, and conveniently enough, the two addresses are associated with the two contrasting periods of Arsène’s Arsenal.Maybe it seems like yesterday that the tide began to turn and title bids collapsed amid jokes about the top-four trophy. Years without silverware were clocked up and fingers began to point at Wenger as his new project, to attempt to build a successful team out of youth products educated to believe in the club and its ideals, was picked apart by richer, more ruthless, competitors.The more recent yesterdays have been brutal at times. There have been humiliations on the pitch, protests off it, and the atmosphere around the club deteriorated to the point where more seats lay empty on a match day as apathy set in, more of the disaffected sought to demonstrate against their manager and the way the club was run.A glorious history versus an underwhelming present was the nub of the argument that provoked so much friction. In one of his great quotes, Wenger predicted the problems that would ultimately fracture this great footballing relationship. “If you eat caviar every day it is difficult to return to sausages,” he said. It is hard to believe that quote stretches back to 1998, and the weeks after Wenger blazed a trail by becoming the first foreign manager to win the Premier League.Win 2-0 against Blackburn in Wenger’s first match in chargeDefeat Everton 4-0 to win Premier League titleBeat Newcastle 2-0 to lift FA Cup and complete the doubleWenger offers to replay Sheffield United following controversial FA Cup winLost 4-1 on penalties to Galatasaray in Uefa Cup finalWin 1-0 at Old Trafford to win the league titleA 2-2 draw at rivals Spurs confirms third league title winBeat Leicester 2-1 to complete The Invincibles’ unbeaten seasonFinal game at HighburyDefeated 2-1 in Champions League final by BarcelonaLose 8-2 to Manchester United at Old TraffordMarks 1,000th game in charge by losing 6-0 at ChelseaWins record-breaking seventh FA Cup with victory over ChelseaDespite defeating Everton 3-1, they finish outside the top four for first time in Wenger eraAnnounces he will leave Arsenal at the end of the seasonHow do you like your sausages? In many ways that sums up how and why the latter period of his Arsenal career has been so complicated. Arsenal’s owner, Stan Kroenke, and the board who act according to his business plan, have seemed perfectly happy with sausages and shown no obvious craving to do everything they possibly can to get their hands on some caviar.Here’s the thing. Wenger’s own apparent acceptance of more modest fare is perhaps the most intriguing element of all. He knew exactly what ingredients were needed to build a conquering team. So why settle for less? He could have left Arsenal at several points along the way, not least when he knew he was in for a few challenging seasons in the immediate aftermath of the move from Highbury to the Emirates. Finances were restricted, the football landscape was changing rapidly with the arrival of oligarchs and investors from far and wide. He chose not to be tempted by offers from some of Europe’s giants, clubs with more financial muscle and stability, to oversee a huge redevelopment. There was no trophy for that even if Wenger regards that period – keeping the club near the top – as one of his successes.It is interesting to remember there was no serious fan unrest in those first few seasons post-move. The mood has hardened in the subsequent phase, the years that Arsenal were supposed to be on an even keel and able to compete with anyone. The record signing of Mesut Özil in 2013 was symbolic of that shift. But, barring the not-to-be-sniffed-at phase of three FA Cups in four recent seasons, Arsenal’s same old problems of falling out of contention for the most eye-catching honours, the Premier League and Champions League, have loaded critiques at the manager’s door.It remains a mystery that a manager who saw the building blocks for success close up has veered away from those characteristics. Original Wenger teams were based on a defence with a loathing of conceding goals – first from the back four inherited from the George Graham years, and then rebuilt around the steel of Sol Campbell and company. Then came a midfield heart that had both steel and silk as epitomised by Vieira. The attacking embellishment dazzled – bold players who knew how to fight for the right to express themselves in the manner of Thierry Henry, Freddie Ljungberg, Robert Pires, Nicolas Anelka, Bergkamp.Original Wenger teams were powerful and fast. The more recent creations have become vulnerable, slower, more predictable. Was he stale? Could he not cut it any more? To the last, he resisted that notion and felt sure he could build one more great Gunners side. Even if critics thought he had been given too many chances his belief never wavered.All Wenger’s Arsenal yesterdays are now in the history books. In time those stories retold will be kinder to him than the critics who have become sharper and angrier than ever in recent times. Act One of his story will be remembered more than Act Two.Wenger has spoken often, and with feeling, about how Arsenal became “the club of my life” and the two decades and counting that came to an end encompassed numerous emotional hits. Along the way there have been spiritually uplifting highs, harrowing lows, and just about everything in between. He wanted to emulate Sir Alex Ferguson in the longevity stakes. He has always said that he wants to manage as long as he feels physically and mentally strong enough to do so and even during the difficult moments his inner resilience, his capacity to come out fighting, has been something he has been able to rely upon.Funnily enough, when he joined in 1996 he envisaged being Arsenal manager only for a few years. But the longer he stayed, the more the club got under his skin to the point that not being in the role was something to dread.Few other modern managers in England had as profound an impact on one club. Ferguson, in terms of trophies, trumps everyone. But in terms of putting an imprint on a club Wenger can stake a strong claim. He was fundamental to the building of a modern, lucrative stadium, pushed for the developmemt of one of England’s first high-tech training grounds, brought an international eye for recruitment that delivered some of the best players to grace the Premier League, and fostered a love for a beautiful style of football that was light years away from the “Boring Arsenal” tag of old.Historically, the influence of Bill Shankly over Liverpool, Matt Busby over Manchester United, Brian Clough on Nottingham Forest shine on to this day. Those managers became part of the fabric of their club, enmeshed in its soul. Arsenal had their first visionary in the 1930s in Herbert Chapman. But the obvious difference between all those luminaries and Wenger is that the others were all products of British football and a British cultural upbringing.Wenger came to Arsenal a foreigner with not much of a name or reputation on these shores at a time when English football was still quite insular and resistant to overseas ideas. Not that long before that it was banned from Europe, a kind of pariah which accentuated the sense of distance between the English ways and continental ways. “What does he know, coming from Japan?” Fergie pondered sharply when Wenger first began to make waves in England following his arrival from Grampus Eight, which was symptomatic of a mistrust of ideas that were perceived to be new wave or revolutionary to an English scene.Wenger became part of the furniture. By the end we all felt we knew him so well, foibles and all. He was a manager who always – always – stood by his values. For better or for worse he did his job with unstinting conviction. As Dein noted when he first came across this intellectual Frenchman with a name that made him think it was destiny he would at some point be associated with Arsenal, he was “different”.He thinks a lot about the human side of management. He prefers to regard his players as people first and athletes second. He has a keen interest in finances and social policies and a view of the world outside the football pitch. As a man, he has many characteristics that seem contradictory but all go to make up this unique manager. He has a razor-sharp wit but can be absent-minded and clumsy. He is kind and generous but a terribly sore loser. He speaks with confidence in public yet remains very private away from the game. He is addicted to the intensity of the best sporting challenges but loathes personal conflict. He is somehow one of the most liberal-minded of managers and also the most stubborn. As a man, his kindness and generosity are held in the highest esteem by those who know him.Whatever lies ahead – and there is as much chance of it getting better as getting worse – one man cannot easily fill the void he leaves. He is the last of the managerial overlords, the long-term managers who dedicate decades to one club. After all Wenger’s yesterdays, Arsenal without Arsène will take some getting used to."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a3d1e8698585dd2d1c2acfd9029f8bdf299830f/0_181_2742_1646/master/2742.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=0e396c541e63bfc86709b2f82f130a1b 1240w","title":"arsene wenger arsenals departing general deserves a fitting farewell","story":"No one will lead a top club for so long again. Wenger will stand as one the last of English football’s great Napoleonic managersAll things must pass. Even, it turns out, the glorious, unrepeatable and by the end strangely interminable reign of Arsène Wenger as manager of Arsenal Football Club. After 22 years in charge Wenger has announced that he will retire at the end of the current season.It is a departure that has been pencilled tentatively in to the footballing calendar for as long as anyone cares to remember but which still arrived on Friday morning like a long-delayed bereavement, jamming the phone-in switchboards and flooding social media with the usual mess of rage, regret and irresolvable argument over a hotly contested legacy.The news of Wenger’s departure came not from his own lips at one of his bi-weekly press conferences but via an official statement – fittingly so for a man entirely bound up in this footballing institution, who almost feels like a physical component of that looming glass and steel super-stadium.There will now be a sense of deep fascination around Arsenal’s final seven or possibly eight games of the season, a run that would take Wenger up to a mind-boggling total of 1,236 matches in charge. Not to mention, of course, an air of genuine sadness.Win 2-0 against Blackburn in Wenger’s first match in chargeDefeat Everton 4-0 to win Premier League titleBeat Newcastle 2-0 to lift FA Cup and complete the doubleWenger offers to replay Sheffield United following controversial FA Cup winLost 4-1 on penalties to Galatasaray in Uefa Cup finalWin 1-0 at Old Trafford to win the league titleA 2-2 draw at rivals Spurs confirms third league title winBeat Leicester 2-1 to complete The Invincibles’ unbeaten seasonFinal game at HighburyDefeated 2-1 in Champions League final by BarcelonaLose 8-2 to Manchester United at Old TraffordMarks 1,000th game in charge by losing 6-0 at ChelseaWins record-breaking seventh FA Cup with victory over ChelseaDespite defeating Everton 3-1, they finish outside the top four for first time in Wenger eraAnnounces he will leave Arsenal at the end of the seasonThroughout English football’s violent structural changes of the past three decades there has been something reassuringly immovable about that gangling figure with the hawk-like frown, the turban of grey hair, arms flapping at his sides like broken deckchair struts, utterly captivated at all times by the spectacle in front of him.Wenger will retire three months short of his 69th birthday, in the process bringing to an end one of the great, transformative, utterly distinctive careers in British sport. He joined Arsenal in the summer of 1996 from Japanese football as an almost total unknown in this country, an entirely left-field figure, but agreeably intense and jarringly articulate in his fourth language. All this at a time when the idea of a successful overseas manager in England was still likely to draw a frown of weary scepticism.Fast forward 22 years and during the Wenger era Arsenal have spent £750m, won 16 major trophies and fielded 220 players, almost a third of all players to play for Arsenal. In the process the manager has been the key figure in the total transformation of every part of the club, including the creation of a spectacular era-shifting North London stadium that Wenger took to as though it were his own hard-earned kitchen extension.More than this Wenger has been both a reforming force in British football and a figure that reached out way beyond the remit of his sport. Those first few years in England are notorious to the point of cliche for the infectious cultural changes enacted around a grand old club that had fallen into a state of lager-stained despond by the middle of the 1990s.These were the Grilled Broccoli Years, when Wenger strode the footballing landscape like our own thin white duke, bringing yoga and vegetables and a focus on a more refined, technical style to his initially sceptical, ultimately devoted squad of players.“Is it too much to hope that Wenger will usher in a new age of reason in English football as a whole and not merely at Highbury?” David Lacey wrote in the Guardian when Wenger was first unveiled with remarkable prescience as this is exactly what happened. Clubs everywhere aped the template of advanced conditioning and cosmopolitan staff, ushering in a period of fast-paced enlightenment for a Premier League product en route to global industry domination.Given this initial zeal perhaps the strangest thing about Wenger is the way his time in English football has pivoted around a single point of paradox. A manager who entered English football as a kind of fire-starter, junking the chocolate bars, taking his sledgehammer to a century of ossified certainties, has ended up dismissed by many as a stick in the mud, left-over and all-round emblem of pig-headed stasis. On the pitch Arsenal have undoubtedly declined in recent years, slipping form the edge of the European elite to a diminished position on the fringes despite some recent domestic trophies. Off the field Wenger has continued to run a brilliantly tight ship, leaving for his successor, and indeed his well-remunerated board, a set of well balanced books and an infrastructure that is sparklingly up to date. Despite this there has been a gathering unrest at the one-sided nature of this deal, the lack of a more reckless lust for glory in favour of steadiness and slow decline.The past few seasons have seen public protest, much-publicised fan-TV rants and even the silly but still quite funny proliferation of Wenger Out banners at events around the world, from political marches in South Africa to rugby matches in New Zealand. Wenger has been changed by this a little. A manager who came to England kicking against the pricks has tended to sniffing against the new and the short-term in recent years. Wenger talking with a sigh about the fact that “we live in a world where people always want instant resultsnew thingsperfection” has become a part of his own press conference bingo for a pack of occasionally exasperated but ever affectionate London football journalists.It is a separate judgment on the short-termism of English football’s celebrity news-style culture that nobody seems quite sure what kind of farewell one of the great English football managers can expect from here. Will there be hordes, a procession, a vast pile of flowers, an extended Viking funeral?It is to be hoped that history will cast Wenger’s time in England not as one of late-breaking angst, but as the love story it was so clearly at the outset.Players will remember Wenger’s charm and wit, his famously lively dancing (his status as Arsenal’s top choice as manager all those years ago was confirmed during a raucous dinner party in the company of the former vice-chairman). Fans might prefer to recall a football manager who helped construct not just a stadium but a new training ground and a modern, re-geared globally renowned sporting club.Premier League Manager of the Season\u0026nbsp(3): 1997-98, 2001-02, 200-04.League Managers\u0027 Association Manager of the Year (2):\u0026nbsp2001-02, 2003-04.BBC Sports Personality Coach of the Year (2):\u0026nbsp2002, 2004.Premier League Manager of the Month (15)Beyond this Wenger will stand as perhaps the last of English football’s great Napoleonic managers. The century-old fascination with the manager as something bound into the fabric of club and community, a magnetic force of benevolent personality has pretty much run its course, or at least been replaced by a more short term version.Nobody will manage a top-level club across three decades again. No one person will become quite so closely wound around the basic structure of these grand old Victorian social institutions, transformed now at the highest level into distantly-run PLCs.Wenger has been part of that change, just as Arsenal is now a club whose staff and business model reflect the priorities of the City financial institutions a few miles down the road. He will remain in the sport, whether as manager advisor or simply waspish TV pundit. For now English football simply owes its departing general the correct, suitably fond, suitably grateful farewell.

The day long expected to come arrived unexpectedly and now Arsenal fans are given until the end of the season to make their peace with Wenger. And there is still a Europa League to be won. One final Wenger fact: he has lost in the final of every European competition he has entered - Cup Winners’ Cup with Monaco in 1992, UEFA Cup with Arsenal in 2000 and the Champions League in 2006. Atlético Madrid lie in wait on Thursday. Can Arsenal’s players do it for Arsène?And Amy Lawrence looks back on 22 years at Arsenal.Gunners fan Toby Moses looks forward to that big farewell party. The fans have their say. To close out, let’s go through our news and features on the big story. Ok, to summarise further from Ivan Gazidis’ news conferenceGazidis suggesting Arsenal are yet to approach a successor. “Other clubs go out and conduct their managerial search in that way but for us, Arsène has made his decision and now that process begins.”Gazidis on the next manager. “Someone who plays exciting and progressive football. But I think there is also a significant thing at Arsenal in how the candidate represents the club. We need to make sure we don’t lose his qualities and his values.”Key points from Gazidis’ news conference. Gazidis on breaking the news to players and staff at London Colney today. “I think from the reaction at the training ground today, what I felt was an incredible amount of passion to give Arsène the send off that he deserves. The decision had to come at some point. Now it’s time for us to look forward.”More from Gazidis:  “We’re not going to find a replacement for Arsène Wenger, for a variety of reasons. He came into the game 22 years ago when it was a very different time.”Will Wenger retire? “He’s somebody who is in great shape and has a competitive edge but that’s a question for him.”It’s “too early” to say if Wenger will have a role at the club, says Gazidis, who says the process of finding a new boss “starts from today” but he will not be drawn on whether Wenger will play a part in that process. Gazidis will not be going into the whys and wherefores of Wenger stepping down but promises: The world will see the unity and power of this club. It’s my goal, my ambition that we build on his contribution.” Gazidis: “This has been an emotional day for all involved at the club... his achievements are extraordinary....there’s an affection for him across the whole sphere of football. Arsène changed the game, he set a totally new standard, to make art out of football.”Club CEO Ivan Gazidis is speaking at a news conference at the Emirates. Thierry Henry, perhaps Wenger’s greatest Arsenal player, spoke earlier to Sky Sports about his former mentor.I’m happy now we can talk about that legacy. Yes, let’s not forget we need to win the Europa League, let’s not get lost in celebrating, it would be an amazing achievement and a great way to give him an exit. But I’m finally happy that now, the talk we can all have his about his legacy. It was a bit of a mixed one it’s a sad day for me to see the big man leaving the club, and happy in the way that people are hopefully going to give him the exit he deserves.As the Arsenal suits prepare to give their side of the story, Stan Kroenke’s brief statement from before seems pertinent. Some rather large quasi-promises being made and something of an admission that Wenger’s day was done.This is one of the most difficult days we have ever had in all our years in sport. One of the main reasons we got involved with Arsenal was because of what Arsène has brought to the club on and off the pitch. We have high ambitions to build on Arsène’s remarkable tenure and to honour his vision by ensuring that Arsenal competes for and wins the biggest and most important prizes in the game.League Managers Association chairman, former Leeds and Sheffield Wednesday boss and schoolteacher Howard Wilkinson has dusted off his leather elbow pads to speak. “Arsène Wenger is without question one of the most significant managers to have graced the game of professional football here in England. From his arrival at Arsenal, it was patently clear that here was someone with tremendous foresight, fortitude and imagination. A man of high principles, he was never prepared to compromise his beliefs and, in so doing, he enhanced the history and reputation of one of the world’s great clubs.”As the speculation swirls, perhaps a good time to look back on these quotes from Thursday’s Wenger news conference on the subject of Patrick Vieira, currently manager of New York City FC. “He’s a guy who has the potential one day, yes,” said Wenger. “I’ve followed his managerial career. I think he does very well. But he works in the moment in New York and he works for Man City. There are plenty of former players who played here who have potential and the intelligence and the knowledge to do it. So there’s plenty of choice, don’t worry for that.”Mikel Arteta, currently Pep Guardiola’s right-hand man at Manchester City, is another former player and captain who has been linked. The tributes are slowing up a little but the news agenda may be about to shift when Ivan Gazidis, Arsenal CEO, holds a news conference at 5pm. We don’t think that’s going to be an announcement of the new man, more clarification and next steps. And perhaps what future role, if any, Wenger has to play at Arsenal. And if you want to sign up for The Fiver, here’s the linkHere’s today’s Fiver which is about...well, it’s not about Richard Garlick leaving West Brom. Guardian readers have had their say on WengerThe aforementioned Jupp Heynckes has had plenty to say about Wenger. More Rafa on WengerWhen he came here to England, to do things in the way he did and win in the way he was winning was a massive achievement. His behaviour has always been quite good. He is an example for everyone, but especially a foreign manager like me. He was fighting and winning before me, and it was really difficult to do that. He did really well. I think it is the last time we will see this. There is so much money in football now that everyone wants things quickly and want to change things after a couple of bad results, we saw that ourselves when we had a bad run. The reality is that you have to be patient and have an idea and a plan. If you stick with the plan you have more chances to do well and that is what he did for 22 years.Here’s what Wenger had to say on the occasion of Sir Alex Ferguson’s retirement five years ago next month. Makes for interesting reading and perhaps suggests he might continue in the game. There’s a few European clubs could do with someone like him, and Wenger in the Bundesliga or back in France seems in no way outlandish. Jupp Heynckes is still at it, and he’s 72, four years older, though due to retire this summer. Now, of course, not everybody has been a Wenger fan down the years and Stewart Robson has been, if not a lone voice in the wilderness, then someone who has never hid his views on Arsenal’s perennial manager. Robson spoke to the BBC earlier. He was fantastic in that period but, like a lot of dictators, they think they are going down the right road - but even when people are saying you need to change, he wouldn’t change. Arsenal under Arsene Wenger in the last few years have been too one-dimensional and behind the times in recruitment and physiotherapy. It is the best thing that could happen to Arsenal that he is leaving now.Simon Smith emails in: “I hope Kim Källström didn’t see that Wenger worst XI. In his autobiography he described scoring his FA Cup penalty as the best 15 minutes of his life – which considering he went to the World Cup with Sweden and won the French league a couple of times at Lyon is something of an achievement. Surely enough to keep him from the list?”In mitigation, Simon, his inclusion was more to do with his being signed injured in an injury crisis and then playing only four matches. He was a good player, no doubt, but maybe not for Arsenal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0483a8d9068aeae8a74f2aaeabf7d45fb0ca8a1/0_79_5212_3127/master/5212.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=e7d4c42cdef61f0890a1fc287cb411bd 1240w","title":"nintendo interview labo cardboard kits","story":"Developers at the gaming giant reveal the thinking behind their new range of hi-tech interactive cardboard construction kits, and the laughs they had while inventing themThe launch of a new Nintendo product always generates excitement, because you never quite know what you are going to get. In 2004, Nintendo abandoned the wildly successful Game Boy portable consoles in favour of an ugly silver clamshell with two screens, the DS. Two years later, when other games companies were focused on improving their consoles’ graphical power, Nintendo popularised motion control with the comparatively underpowered Wii. Both announcements attracted scepticism and even mockery from players and market analysts alike, and both sold more than 100m each.The company’s experimental approach is not always successful, however. Though Nintendo’s most recent console, the Switch, has been a huge success so far, its predecessor, the Wii U, was one of the worst-selling games machines of all time. Nintendo Labo, out today in the US and on 27 April in the UK, is one of Nintendo’s weirdest ever ideas: a set of cardboard construction kits that, combined with the game software packaged with it, can be used to create interactive toys.The key to this magic is the Nintendo Switch’s little controllers, which snap away from the screen. These JoyCons contain a bundle of sensors and feedback mechanisms including gyroscopes, an IR motion camera and rumble. Slotted into a cardboard fishing rod, they can sense movement and velocity tucked in the back of amini cardboard piano, they can see stickers on the back of the keys that tell the console which note to play. The game cartridge includes specially built games for each model, instructions for building them, and a “Discover” section that explains how they work in a kid-friendly but unpatronising manner.“After the development of Nintendo Switch, we worked on creating all kinds of different prototypes, with the theme of creating something that was straightforward and that only the Nintendo Switch and Joy-Con could make happen. Nintendo Labo came out of this process,” says Koichi Kawamoto, producer on the Labo team.Abandoned prototypes during that two-year effort included a model tank and a music box, according to Labo’s creators. “We made a music box prototype where you rotated a cylinder with reflective stickers stuck on it in a spiral shape,” elaborates Tsubasa Sakaguchi, project director. “By using the IR motion camera to detect the movements of the stickers, we could make the rotation speed of the cylinder determine how fast the music played. It was an interesting mechanism, but we thought that consumers wouldn’t actually have that much fun playing with it. The most important thing for us was whether consumers would find it exciting and fun.”The five models that have made the cut at launch include a little house with buttons and dials, a fishing rod with a string attached to an elastic-band reel, a simple remote-control car that judders across the floor powered by the controllers’ vibrations, an approximation of a motorbike with handlebars and a brake lever, and a working cardboard piano. There is also a cardboard robot suit, available in a separate kit, that can translate your movements into a game in which you are a giant robot smashing up a city.The Labo software has a garage mode that lets you experiment with elements of programming, opening up the possibility for players to create their own cardboard contraptions. One example from Nintendo is a cardboard guitar with elastic-band strings. Expect to see a flurry of these sorts of creations from the maker community in the months after Labo’s launch.“The fundamental concept of Labo came from thinking how we could leverage the JoyCon controllers,” elaborates Shinya Takahashi, GM of Nintendo’s development ision. “We wanted to see if there were any attachments that we could put on them, and cardboard was the material that came to our mind instantly. It’s a material that’s easy to modify, shape, and attach on to JoyCons – trial and error and repair are all easy. Through the experiment our development team realised that selling already created cardboard attachments may not be fun enough – the process of creating and learning the process and the mechanics behind it is rewarding in itself.”Like all of Nintendo’s products, Labo is oriented towards families and children. A six-year-old might spend three hours using pens and glue to make the perfect RC car, whereas an older child (or parent) might spend more time learning how the models work. The more complex models would be demanding for many children to assemble by themselves, but with parental help the process is collaborative and fun – reminiscent of hours spent with Airfix models or dolls’ houses in previous generations.When Nintendo announced Labo in January, the reactions ranged from perplexed delight to qualified scepticism: will people really pay £60 (or $70) for some cardboard? It might only be £10 more expensive than a “normal” game, but Nintendo’s madcap ideas often take some explaining before people buy in to them. The next few months will determine whether Labo becomes a fondly remembered curiosity, or another of the Switch’s big sellers.•Additional interviews by Keith Stuart."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b59ce9cae3173f5eec9bd1fc971dcdf49672194/0_19_1450_870/master/1450.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=182c3270eae68e240256e95ae320e778 1240w","title":"cant sleep insomnia identity","story":"There’s growing evidence that thinking of yourself as an insomniac is a major part of the problemNote to publishers: in my view, there’s an unfilled gap in the “wellness” market for a book on how sleep isn’t really that important. In contrast to the message relentlessly promoted by lifestyle gurus these days, this book would argue that four hours a night is probably fine, that caffeine before bed is no big deal, and that even severe sleep deprivation poses no real risk of poor performance, health troubles or early death. Admittedly, this might raise certain ethical issues, since that’s not what the science says. But you know what? Unlike all those other books, this one would help people sleep. Because take it from an intermittent bad sleeper: there’s nothing more likely to keep an insomniac up at night, or turn a good sleeper into an insomniac, than being told it’s completely essential they drift off.Actually, the ironies of insomnia are even worse than that, because there’s growing evidence that thinking of yourself as an insomniac – having an “insomnia identity”, in the coinage of the sleep researcher Kenneth Lichstein – is a major part of the problem. It’s not just that such a self-image makes it harder to sleep, though doubtless that’s the case. It’s that having an insomnia identity makes life terrible even if, in reality, you’re getting sufficient sleep. In a review of the research published last year, Lichstein concluded that “non-complaining poor sleepers” – who sleep badly but don’t define themselves as insomniacs – don’t suffer the high blood pressure commonly associated with severe sleeplessness. Meanwhile, “complaining good sleepers” – who get enough shut-eye, but are heavily invested in their alleged insomnia – were essentially as tired, anxious and depressed as those who genuinely didn’t sleep.And the worst part, arguably, is this: with an insomnia identity, seeking help is liable to make things worse. Drag your weary bones to the doctor and she may be willing to prescribe sleeping pills. But apart from the fact that they’re not very effective, and often very addictive, the benefits are likely to be outweighed by the very act of visiting the doctor: by doing so, you’ve doubled down on your insomnia identity, signalling to your subconscious mind that you have an intransigent problem, requiring medical intervention. Reading all this, some chronic insomniacs may protest that I’m making light of their own, far more serious condition, which really is intransigent. Perhaps. But do bear in mind that’s exactly what someone with a strong insomnia identity would say.The root of the problem, as Sasha Stephens explains in her book The Effortless Sleep Method, is that any external crutch on which you lean – not just pills, but herbal remedies and elaborate bedtime rituals, too – risks further eroding your trust in your ability to fall asleep on your own, and it’s that lack of self-trust that is insomnia’s main cause. (Obviously, don’t stop taking prescription drugs without consulting a doctor.) Few things have helped me as much as following one of Stephens’ many recommendations and training myself to remember, upon waking at 2am, that when I have a terrible night, the next day usually isn’t so bad. Once I’m OK with not getting back to sleep, it’s surprisingly hard to stay awake.A Roger Ekirch’s endlessly fascinating 2005 book At Day’s Close, a social history of night-time, argues that pre-industrial people slept in two phases, with an hour awake in between.

Here she talks about what it has been like to report on the story. In October, I was contacted by a small refugee charity, the Refugee and Migrant Centre, in Wolverhampton. It was really worried because its client Paulette Wilson, 61, a former chef who had worked in the House of Commons, had been detained pending imminent deportation. The charity explained that Paulette had moved to the UK in 1968 when she was 10 and had never left. Because she had never applied for a British passport and had no papers proving she had a right to be in the UK, she was classified as an illegal immigrant. Luckily she was released before she was deported, but she had spent a week in detention, despite having done nothing wrong. I went to interview Paulette at her daughter’s flat – by this point she was homeless because she had lost access to benefits – and was astonished at the way she was being treated. Although her MP had intervened to get Paulette released, the Home Office was still telling her she was liable for deportation. She was devastated.A day after we published that first piece, Sean Gordon telephoned to say his father, Anthony Bryan, was in the same position. I went to meet him the following day and could not believe how badly he had been treated. Since then, I have been contacted by more and more people, and time after time I have visited them at home and listened as they described how painful it was to be told they were here illegally after a lifetime spent paying taxes and contributing to Britain.Not really. The immigration charities and MPs I spoke to were a bit at a loss. Because the fallout from newly hardened “hostile environment” policies was only just being felt, there was no clear understanding that this was a massive issue. Some MPs, such as Kate Osamor, were beginning to see lots of cases others hadn’t heard of the problem. Mostly people assumed these were weird anomalies where something very specific had gone wrong. I realised how rapidly the problem was growing when the charity Praxis (a beneficiary of the Guardian’s annual charity appeal) said it was seeing more and more cases every year.My former colleague the home affairs editor Alan Travis was incredibly helpful. He suggested I contact the Migration Observatory in Oxford to see if it had any idea about the figures – that’s when I began to realise what a massive problem this was. The observatory told me up to 57,000 people were potentially vulnerable because although they arrived from Commonwealth countries before 1971, they had never applied for a British passport or been naturalised.The team of news editors was really encouraging, and I was given unlimited time to write about this. There was an instant understanding that this was something we needed to pursue. We were really happy to be able to report the occasional bit of good news too. When officials finally recognised that Paulette had a right to be here, we put her picture on the front page. When I got details from an former Home Office worker about the decision in 2010 to destroy the Windrush landing cards, the head of national news, Owen Gibson, and I spent a long time discussing the potential significance of that revelation.Sometimes over the past six months I’ve felt a bit like an immigration case worker – gathering people’s details, trawling through Home Office letters, contacting the Home Office to get them to comment on the problems they were having. It has been really exciting because almost every time I raised a case with them, the inidual having problems would unexpectedly see their cases – which they had been struggling with for years – suddenly get expedited and approved. But when I wrote about Albert Thompson, I was sure that the Department of Health or the prime minister was going to be so upset or embarrassed by his problems that they would back down immediately and offer him help. At the time of writing, they still haven’t done that.For a long time it was incredibly frustrating because the Guardian was publishing interviews I’d done with people whose lives had been ruined by this situation and no one in government seemed to care very much. It was only when the Barbados high commissioner revealed that Downing Street had rejected a formal request from all 12 Caribbean high commissioners to meet with Theresa May at the Commonwealth heads of government meeting that the story became huge. We put that on the front page, and then reported David Lammy’s outraged letter to the government signed by 140 cross-party MPs, and within 24 hours Amber Rudd was apologising for the “appalling” behaviour of her own department. The prime minister has apologised twice so far this week as a result of the Guardian’s Windrush reporting – it’s a positive outcome.Our readers have been so generous. Yesterday I opened letters with a cheque for £20 and an offer to pay the full £1,200 naturalisation fee for one person I wrote about.This story has further ramifications. Today my email inbox is jammed with Windrush people wanting to tell their story. But it’s wider than this group. We’ll be looking at the overall impact of the prime minister’s hostile environment policy next week."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45827a69eca7c7a8b6df505f7816b17bacfb8879/0_116_3473_2083/master/3473.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=b8d7eb258fb29e48baec2e225dbfec01 1240w","title":"lets move stockport greater manchester","story":"With staggering deprivation, and swathes of wealth in Victorian suburbs, it’s arriving fashionably late to the regeneration partyWhat’s going for it?

The one thing everyone knows about J Cole is that his albums almost never feature special guests – after his album 2014 Forest Hills Drive broke a Spotify streaming record previously held by One Direction, the phrase “J Cole went platinum with no features” turned from endlessly repeated boast to internet meme.One school of thought suggested the presence of kiLL edward was all an elaborate hoax, another that the “experimental” nature of his fifth album might include a slackening of his aversion to sharing space with others. It takes KOD a matter of minutes to announce that the latter is very wrong: “How come you won’t get a few features – I think you should?” Coles snaps on the title track. “How about I don’t? How about you just get the fuck off my dick?” And so it proves: kiLL edward turns out to be Cole himself, his vocals slowed down, the reverse of Prince’s helium-voiced Camille. You can mock his fans’ bragging about the “purity” of his achievements if you want, but there’s also a sense in which Cole has become famous by doing exactly the opposite of virtually every other major contemporary hip-hop artist. Their albums sprawl towards the hour-and-a-half-mark, stuffed with appearances by special guests that sometimes seem to speak less of artistic fraternity and more of ensuring every commercial base is covered. His have increasingly clocked in at a crisp, old-fashioned 45 minutes. As if to underline that J Cole albums come free of padding, KOD’s most emotionally impactful lyrics are on tracks labelled as interludes and outros, words that normally guarantee you won’t miss much if you hit fast-forward. Not here. The interlude Once an Addict turns out to be a heartbreaking, unsparing examination of his mother’s alcoholism and Cole’s own inability to intervene or help. The outro Window Pain concerns a child Cole met through his not-for-profit organisation the Dreamville Foundation, who attempted to make sense of her cousin’s shooting by suggesting it was all part of God’s masterplan, a signal that Jesus was coming back “so we can rejoice with him and have our time”.Nor does Cole much bother with the kind of hook-laden banger guaranteed to ensure radio play and crossover pop success. Like its 2016 predecessor, 4 Your Eyez Only, the music on KOD is sparse and understated: even its most uptempo track, ATM, is set to muted, jazzy piano chords, while listeners of a certain vintage might find the term “trip-hop” springing to mind unbidden when the meandering guitar and vibraphone sample of Brackets slouch into life. KOD’s sound exists in a curious, appealing area somewhere between beatifically stoned and slightly unsettling. Motiv8 revolves around little more than an eerie keyboard figure and a disembodied cry of “get money” from Lil Kim’s guest appearance on the 1995 Junior MAFIA hit of the same title – ripped out of context, it sounds bleak and despairing – and there’s something really haunting about Photograph, with its delicate two-note guitar sample and a chorus whose vocal appears to be slightly out of step with the beat.This is an album on which Cole sets himself up as the conscience of mainstream hip hop – the goofy, self-deprecating humour of his 2014 single Wet Dreamz and the warm contentment of Foldin’ Clothes are both conspicuous by their absence. Instead, we find Cole repeatedly raising a concerned eyebrow at drug use in the world of Xanax-fuelled rap and probing hip-hop’s obsession with money. It’s the kind of thing that could come off a little preachy but it doesn’t here, largely because Cole is always quick to implicate himself. He has, he claims, “sipped so much Actavis I convinced Actavis that they should pay me” while on ATM, he’s as guilty as anyone of allowing his wealth to define his self-worth. He’s also very good at unexpectedly flipping the script midway through a track. Brackets starts out sounding troublingly like a rich man moaning about having to pay tax, but ends up somewhere very different: an indictment of the inherent racism of US government spending.But KOD’s best track may be its closer, 1985, which is billed as a taster of his forthcoming project The Fall Off. It delivers hip-hop’s new generations of artists (by whom Cole is “unimpressed”) a wise, warm but firm talking-to that switches from practical advice, warnings about the fleeting nature of fame and the inadvisability of jumping on trends to a stark and impressively incisive suggestion they should think hard about the nature of their appeal: “These white kids love that you don’t give a fuck, ‘cause that’s exactly what’s expected when your skin black… They wanna be black and think your song is how it feels”. It’s clearly the stuff of which vast controversy is made – you can see the headlines about the rappers it’s addressing “clapping back” as it plays. But like the rest of KOD, it leaves you very eager to see where J Cole goes next."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65315a2aa9c4515c90de748213060849181bfa96/111_0_4333_4332/master/4333.jpg?w=4250\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7271621393158b204e5d69462c1d18c2 8500w","title":"wallets at the ready join our tour of the uks greatest record shops","story":"As Record Store Day returns, we go on ‘record store crawls’ around four UK cities with the country’s best new DJs, to find the bricks-and-mortar gems that keep pushing the culture forwardIt’s Record Store Day on Saturday, a juggernaut that is still picking up pace in its 11th year, with many exclusive special-edition records released as a way to focus music fans’ attention on bricks and mortar. And now there’s a new way to take it all in: in the US, the Record Store Crawl initiative has been set up to explore the wealth of stores in each city. With RSD looming, we thought this could be a model for a survey of the health of record shops in British cities: so, four writers have gone round four cities with some of the UK’s most exciting new DJs and producers, picking out their ultimate record-shopping routes.In London, Debi Ghose – aka Debonair – seems at home in Low Company. Not only is it her local spot, in Hackney Downs, but “their selection is really close what I play, I trust their curation”. Her club and radio sets tend towards the 1980s experimentalism of post-punk, EBM and early house. The chipboard and white walls of Low Company are decorated with 80s industrial music art, its sections are called things like “Strange  Dream  Avant”, and Kenny, the crop-haired Scotsman behind the counter, is playing unwell-sounding outsider punk in between nipping outside for rollups. The shop clearly revels in being on the margins. Not only is it not participating in Record Store Day, it had considered not even opening on the day as it’s the business’s first birthday the day before and they’ll all be hungover. Debi buys a ticket for the birthday party, laughing with Kenny about how many “reprobate” mutual friends will be there.In the quarter-hour it takes us to stroll into bustling Dalston, Debi details her record shop history. At school in Leamington Spa, she “wasn’t a rebel, did well, but got bored and needed something more to focus on”. As a teenage Smashing Pumpkins and Joy Division fan, the local Fopp Records “was heaven to me” at 15 she applied for a job there. She is endlessly thankful that the manager – a DJ known as The Lovely Helen, resident at Brum house institution Wobble – noted her enthusiasm and picked her over other (older, male, ostensibly more qualified) candidates. Behind the counter, she gained confidence talking about music, and expanded her own tastes dramatically: “I had disposable income and cheap records,” she laughs, “I bought so much!”We get to Eldica and are warmly greeted by Annie, who runs the place with her former rave producer husband Andy, and named it for her Trinidadian grandma. In contrast to Low Company’s austere hipness, it’s a piled-up Aladdin’s cave of second-hand vinyl, leaning heavily towards reggae, jazz and soul. “When I joined NTS Radio in 2011,” says Debi, referring to the taste-making online station, “it was great to have this place round the corner, as a connection to the older generation of music lovers already in Dalston. It’s a lovely spot, nothing’s overpriced, but you need three hours to properly dig here.”Sadly we don’t have that, as we need to get to Soho. After university, where she learned presenting and mixing on the uni radio station, Debi had a short stint working in an advertising agency. She was more interested in spending every lunchtime in Soho’s record shops, though, which didn’t go unnoticed: her leaving present from the agency was vouchers for Phonica. Phonica is now the West End’s main dance music hub constant house music plays as established DJs try out 12-inches at the listening posts, and Debi reels off great “in-stores” she’s seen here as her own DJ career began.Nick, who serves us, is a DJ too and runs the well-regarded Meda Fury label as Debi umms and ahhs over a Frankie Goes to Hollywood 12-inch, he shoves a fantastically weird new EP of Japanese electro-dub-folk songs and some Lyonnaise deep house into her listening pile, and passes me a moody electro 12-inch. He’s good: we buy all three, then walk a couple of minutes to Berwick Street, where Reckless hangs on in there, resisting gentrification, unlike most of that strip of secondhand-record shops. There’s no listening posts, only buying on spec, which Debi does often I snap up a Planet Mu acid house record going super cheap.It’s quite a schlep to southeast London with the rush hour starting. (We’re glad at this point that we left Notting Hill’s Honest Jon’s, and Debi’s very favourite shop, Alan’s in East Finchley, off our itinerary.) Sadly, Rat Records in Camberwell is closing as we arrive. So after briefly pressing our noses against the window like kids at a sweetshop, as Debi describes it – “just a really classic record shop, which was my regular place to go when I lived in Brixton” – we get a 171 bus five minutes down the road to Peckham.There’s no fear of Rye Wax being shut, mind. In the basement of Rye Lane’s vast Bussey Building – where grubby raving spaces sit alongside African churches, community groups and yoga studios – it’s also a bar and music venue, open late every night. A DJ is playing Latin jazz as we arrive. “It’s the perfect model of how a shop can be a real hub,” Debi says. “It’s not just a venue, but somewhere I’m guaranteed to meet other DJs and people I know.” Sure enough, it’s buzzing as Debi chats and browses, owner Tom tells me how they’re bypassing RSD releases and instead cutting their own single-copy dubplates. Once Debi has found an intriguing compilation of 80s Catalan DIY rarities, we settle down at a table for a drink, musing on what it must have been like for experimental Spanish musicians under Franco, and taking stock of our day. “It’s hard to know what will happen to record shops,” says Debi. “They’re never going to be what they were before downloading. But if they can turn into places like this, I’m happy!”“This is proper Bristol weather,” grins Omar McCutcheon, the latest star in the city’s long history of experimental dance music. The drizzle is unrelenting as we pace around the Stokes Croft area on our record store crawl, but even though it’s overcast, this cultural nerve centre vividly compensates. Lurid murals loom over the urban sprawl terraced houses are painted in fuschia and lavender. Every other shop is a quirky bar, vegan cafe or vintage clothing emporium. “You’re always getting creative stimulation in Bristol,” says McCutcheon.Under the moniker Batu, the 24-year-old is the next in a long line of Bristol musicians who create new forms from low-end frequencies: his mentors Pinch and Peverelist helped pioneer dubstep’s deep e into techno in the mid-2000s, followed by the latter’s cutting-edge collective Livity Sound, and now Batu has taken the baton and is veering off in an even more abstract direction. With his label and night Timedance, he pairs sound-system culture with techno to create sculptural club punishers that fizz with lambent ideas and curious samples, as do the young local artists he releases such as Bruce, Ploy, Lurka and Giant Swan.Idle Hands is the shop where the city’s new wave congregates. It’s a no-frills dance music specialist run by Chris Farrell, with well-curated racks of new 12-inches ning the UK underground. “It’s very important to me – a meeting spot, a hub of Bristol music,” says McCutcheon as he spots an old Bass Clef tune he’s been after for ages and locks straight into some headphones.Idle Hands is one of the new boutique record shops that have sprung up here in the past few years, after a wave of closures. Farrell says Record Store Day doesn’t make much of a difference to the shop in terms of sales, but because all the pressing plants are booked up with limited edition novelty items such as translucent green vinyl Doctor Who soundtracks, new stock doesn’t come through as readily in the weeks leading up to it. McCutcheon still finds a wedge of vinyl he wants, including a compilation of early experiments by Japanese musician Kuniyuki Takahashi, which recently came out on a leftfield label he admires, Music from Memory.McCutcheon is relatively new to the city, having moved here four years ago from Oxfordshire for the creative music technology course at Bath Spa University (“dubstep finishing school”, Farrell quips). His growing touring schedule means he doesn’t get as much time to shop locally as he’d like. Which may explain why we can’t seem to find next stop The Centre for Better Grooves. It was started by the founder of budget music chain Fopp but is, in contrast, “a wallet beater”, jokes McCutcheon. We pass Elevator Sound, a sleek shrine to modular synths, and bump into a postman who is by night a psychedelic DJ and points us in the right direction. Soon we are riffling through a luxurious number of jazz reissues with cosmic covers. Past a pair of congas, there’s a sizeable vintage rock section, but McCutcheon is less interested in that. “I’m more of a sound than a songs person,” he says, eyeing up a selection labelled “FX” that is ripe for sampling.Next we head to Wanted’s tiny record trailer, down a cobbled path in St Nick’s Market. McCutcheon immediately makes a beeline for the dancehall crates, and waxes lyrical over the Greensleeves Rhythm Album series, one of the longest-running of its kind, where various artists interpret the same rhythm. He has also recently been collecting reggae and dub 45s, the hub for which is Payback, around the corner. Paul Craine has been running this fir-green stall for 20 years and it’s where you can find Prince Buster 7-inches for £1, or more contemporary roots releases from Protoje or Chronixx. Payback is a window into the origins of Bristol’s obsession with making music so deep it can rattle your ribcage. The area’s African Caribbean sound-system heritage has laid the foundation for the subsequent genres of weighty, deep electronic music that have come through its streets: trip-hop, jungle, dubstep. For McCutcheon, that culture is also “integral to my identity. Living here, having family of Caribbean descent and growing up with reggae – all these ideas link back to where I see myself in the world.” No matter what record shop you’re in or producer you talk to, bass, says McCutcheon, is what unites the city: “It’s so ingrained in everything.”“Technooooo,” comes the jovial response from Henrietta Smith-Rolla when asked what section she gravitates towards in a record shop. “Always the techno section. I never go in with any idea of what I want to buy. I like not knowing.”Over coffee in Eastern Bloc, a cafe, venue and record shop in Manchester’s Northern Quarter, the hiss of the coffee machine whistles above the thudding techno pulsing from the speakers. “I’ve been doing music for over a decade but I didn’t know this was in me,” the 37-year-old says about Afrodeutsche, a project born two years ago whilst searching for her father. She learned that her Ghanaian roots also stretched into Russia and Germany, and thus found herself with a newfound identity and family history. The name, translating as African-German, was an epiphany that linked to the already eclectic music she was creating. “I just had this huge connection to it straight away. I never expected to realise myself artistically in this world.” Afrodeutsche blends techno, house, electro and anything else Smith-Rolla feels like throwing in, based on intuition. “Everything I write is always a translation of what’s going on with me. Even my NTS shows are just based on how I’m feeling,” she says, referring to her monthly radio show.As we walk upstairs and the throb of the beat grows louder, Smith-Rolla doesn’t nosee into the techno section but instead is greeted with a pile of 12-inches, recommended by Ben Marsden, the head house and techno buyer. This level of personal curation and assistance is crucial for smaller shops, he tells me. “I go in spurts of buying records,” Smith-Rolla says. “I’m not in shops all the time but when I am, I’m usually here.” She also buys online from places like Discogs and Boomkat. “I think record shops have got kinder,” she tells me, in-between playing Umwelt and Maelstrom on the listening turntable. “There’s been a change in how women are looked at and observed. There’s no surprise any more when a woman walks in to buy a Detroit techno record. I would get nervous going into shops when I was younger, but things have become more welcoming.”While the music of Afrodeutsche is deeply personal and emotional – she describes it as “dark optimism” – when Smith-Rolla DJs, it’s all about getting loose and dismantling the seriousness of some in the techno world. “I like to have fun. I don’t see myself as a DJ my sets are …” she stops mid-sentence and makes a series of explosive, chaotic noises. “As far as I’m concerned, anyone can do this. There isn’t a wall between us. There’s no bravado, it’s just fun times. Manchester is the kind of place that if you’re into good stuff then you’ll be invited to do good things it’s a small city and everyone is connected.” As we move around the corner onto Oldham Street on a bustling afternoon and into Piccadilly Records, Smith-Rolla shows her goofy side as I look over to see her doing the downward escalator routine, disappearing behind a rack of records, cackling away.Smith-Rolla lived in Devon and London before Manchester, and is positively glowing about her time here. “Manchester is a beautiful place because it is nurturing without question. It’s here where I felt I had complete freedom to make stuff.” This freedom to create has seen her work with 808 State’s Graham Massey, score a reinterpretation of the 1992 documentary Baraka, and become part of GRRRL, a group assembled by In Place of War, a project that works to mobilise and connect artists in conflict zones. The eight-piece, and their “insane, pure energy” live performance, recently played the Commonwealth Games’ closing ceremony.In Vinyl Exchange, she takes an armful of records to the counter. The man behind it sincerely asks how her music is going, telling her he’s heard good things about her live shows. On the way out, she reflects on this sense of community and support she finds in the record shops, clubs and people of Manchester: “I’m surrounded by encouragement. That’s what Manchester does, it makes you want to be involved and help people out.”Cratedigging and cardio may seem like two diametrically opposed pastimes but in Glasgow it is possible to combine both. Palais de Danse – a cramped but colourful garret stacked with preloved vinyl – lies behind a doorway on Sauchiehall Street. You just have to make it up four narrowing flights of stairs first. This is where Kenny Grieve and Dan Lurinsky of Dixon Avenue Basement Jams (DABJ) – local label owners and in-demand DJs – want to begin their Glasgow record shop crawl. Even on a miserable Friday morning, the elevated view from the fire escape makes it feel like an appropriate place to survey the city’s music retail scene, once we get our breath back. “Some workout, that,” Grieve says to Dennis, Palais de Danse’s wiry proprietor. “Try doing it with a box of records,” he replies, “it’s murder.” There are deep bins of house and techno, while a lone box of dubstep sits atop an ancient safe. Grieve and Lurinsky rifle through the stock with the flowing fingers of veteran vinyl spelunkers their eventual haul includes a hidden gem from Dave Clarke’s 90s techno imprint Magnetic North. Palais de Danse is one of a new wave of independent vinyl shops that have opened in Glasgow in the past three years. The next stop, Rubadub, is more of an institution: since 1992, it has been a hub for DJs looking to stock up on desirable new imports, upgrade equipment or just talk shop with fellow devotees. While some stores host a chaotic decor of ripped posters and countless club flyers, Rubadub has always been stripped-back, cool, clinical. A recent interior redesign has reinforced the monochrome look but retained the shop’s signature feature: a tightly-wound cast-iron spiral staircase leading up to a cluster of listening decks. Lurinsky is a longstanding Rubadub employee, and says practically all of the staff were – like him – regular customers first, drawn to the communal vibe. While the shop may not officially take part in Record Store Day (“I think most people feel it’s all got a bit commercial,” says Lurinsky) there will still be a day-long party on 21 April, to christen the refit. Next, we head south of the Clyde to visit Otherside, a narrow, seductive emporium that has offered both second-hand vinyl and eccentric vintage objects since 2015. JD Twitch, of Glasgow’s venerable Optimo club night, once offloaded so much excess vinyl here he had his own section it is perhaps the only place in the city where it is possible to pick up a happy hardcore classic from DJ Mental Theo and a Victorian carpet beater in the same trip. Having been invited to rummage through some unsorted stock, Lurinsky is elated to find a record by Detroit legend Claude Young he has coveted for years. Grieve somehow emerges with a hookah pipe and a chipped plaster statue of the Virgin Mary, decor for the new DABJ office-cum-studio by the riverside. Their label name was inspired by a raucous mid-2000s in-the-know after-hours party staged in a crudely converted basement flat on Dixon Avenue, and the final stop on our crawl is only a few streets away from that spiritual birthplace. Some Great Reward, a cosy cafe that doubles as a physical outpost for an online record store, opened earlier this month. In the main space, new releases like Unknown Mortal Orchestra’s Sex and Food are displayed on the wall with smart, snappy recommendation notes. Over coffee and a Bakewell slice, Grieve and Lurinsky tot up how much they have spent – almost £100, not including the Virgin Mary – and reflect on how the Glasgow music scene has waxed and waned over the years."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/78144587dd3cb9d61989c3bd8a22c967be117aab/121_118_2652_1591/master/2652.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=0ed4054d04696f12e46803fe4cb30ef2 1240w","title":"amber rudd boasted harsher immigration strategy leak reveals","story":"Exclusive: home secretary told PM she would give officials more ‘teeth’ to deport migrantsAmber Rudd privately boasted to the prime minister that she would give immigration officials more “teeth” to hunt down and deport thousands more illegal migrants and accelerate the UK’s deportation programme, a leaked private letter has revealed.In a robust private memo to Theresa May just months before long-settled Windrush migrants were threatened with deportation, Rudd set out her “ambitious” plan to increase removals and focus officials on “arresting, detaining and forcibly removing illegal migrants” while “ruthlessly” prioritising Home Office resources to that programme .The letter was sent on 30 January 2017. A few months later Paulette Wilson, a grandmother from Jamaica who had lived in Britain for 50 years, became the first of more than 20 Windrush migrants to tell the Guardian how they were facing deportation or a loss of rights to health, housing and work because of Home Office policy.The aggressive language and tone of Rudd’s approach to immigration enforcement emerged after the home secretary attempted to blame officials in her own department for the Windrush scandal in which it emerged up to 50,000 mostly Commonwealth migrants were facing possible deportation despite having lived in Britain for decades. Rudd claimed in parliament on Monday she was “concerned that the Home Office has become too concerned with policy and strategy and sometimes loses sight of the inidual”.That appeared to be an attempt to suggest she had inherited a hardline system from May, who as home secretary announced a policy to create “a really hostile environment for illegal migrants” across government departments.But in the private memo, Rudd said she believed in the fundamental importance of that hostile environment agenda, which she referred to as the “compliant environment”, an attempted rebranding of the policy by ministers a few months earlier.The culture that agenda inspired has been widely blamed for members of the Windrush-era generation being threatened in recent months with deportation and denied access to housing, healthcare and jobs.In 2016, 39,626 people were deported or left the UK voluntarily, according to the UK Migration Observatory, but Rudd’s letter to May indicates a home secretary determined to make her mark and toughen up even further an immigration enforcement regime which uses liveried vans that have become an increasingly common sight in areas with large migrant communities.Rudd told May her proposals to reduce the overall illegal population had been “informed by the review that you commissioned whilst home secretary”. She concluded: “Everything I have outlined above is aimed not just at radically reshaping and refocusing immigration enforcement but at increasing the public’s confidence in our immigration system.”Nowhere in the memo does Rudd mention the possible human cost of getting her immigration policy wrong.Rudd told May that her strategy was “informed by the review that you commissioned as home secretary”. On Thursday, Nick Clegg, who was deputy prime minister from 2010 to 2015, said May’s Home Office had pursued “nasty politics” over immigration.Rudd’s memo was sent as the government stepped up its attempts to bring net migration down into the tens of thousands. The previous year, the figure was 248,000. Four months earlier, May rebooted the government’s immigration taskforce, chairing a committee of 12 cabinet ministers – including the three key Brexit supporters, Liam Fox, Boris Johnson and David Davis – to ensure a new regime was introduced to slash the net number of arrivals into the UK to below 100,000 a year.Other measures she told May about included obtaining biometric data from countries such as Pakistan, which she said could be “a potential game changer in terms of the numbers we can remove”. She asked for the prime minister’s help to persuade the leaders of other countries to supply such data.Rudd also said she wanted illegal migrants who were being housed in detention centres before removal to either be sent back to their origin country, released into the community on licence, or tagged to free up beds for the new people that her immigration enforcement team will be picking up.A Home Office spokesperson said: “Illegal immigration impacts the whole of society, putting pressure on taxpayer-funded public services, leaving vulnerable people at the mercy of exploitative employers or landlords, and at worst, fuelling the abhorrent crimes of modern slavery and human trafficking.“People from the Windrush generation are of course here legally. The Home Secretary has recognised the huge contribution they have made to our society, and has apologised unreservedly to them. We are taking urgent action to help them to evidence their legal right to live in the UK, and have set up a dedicated taskforce to do so. “It is wilfully misleading to conflate the situation experienced by people from the Windrush generation with measures in place to tackle illegal immigration and protect the UK taxpayer. It is clearly essential that we continue to take action against people who are here illegally.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e3ee66de6b6c9c227cd6fb555408c3d1e2c9b8ff/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=70c9fbdcc009e8ff530c710697ec4e52 1240w","title":"its time to stop believing in these magic brexit solutions","story":"UK’s unlikely proposals to solve Irish border question leaves Brussels wondering if customs union may be most realistic optionFrom the minute the UK government first proposed its idea last August of maintaining “invisible borders” after Brexit, the convoluted plan was dismissed as “magical thinking” by EU officials. What has changed this week is that the time for pretending otherwise has run out.First, Downing Street reassurances were rejected on Wednesday by the House of Lords, where peers voted by a majority of 123 to push Britain toward a customs union – arguing it was the only practical alternative to wrecking the Irish peace process with a hard border.Now a fresh account of the latest withering exchange with officials in Brussels has made the front page of the Daily Telegraph, making it impossible for Conservative ministers to maintain the illusion any longer that the EU is being steadily persuaded to change its mind. If the government wants to avoid a more serious rebellion in the House of Commons when the customs union question returns for a vote after local elections in May, it has to convince anxious Tory backbenchers that it is on track to reach agreement at the EU summit in June. Reading in their house newspaper that the UK alternatives were this week subjected to a “systematic and forensic annihilation” and “detailed and forensic rebuttal” creates a cognitive dissonance that no amount of Downing Street spin can hide. “It was made clear that none of the UK’s customs options will work,” an EU source told the Telegraph. “None of them.”The UK could sign up to all the EU’s rules and regulations, staying in the single market – which provides free movement of goods, services and people – and the customs union, in which EU members agree tariffs on external states. Freedom of movement would continue and the UK would keep paying into the Brussels pot. We would continue to have unfettered access to EU trade, but the pledge to “take back control” of laws, borders and money\u0026nbspwould not have been fulfilled. This\u0026nbspis an unlikely outcome and one that may be possible only by reversing the Brexit decision, after a second referendum or election.Britain could follow Norway, which is in the single market, is subject to freedom of movement rules and pays a fee to Brussels – but is outside the customs union. That combination would tie Britain to EU regulations but allow it to sign trade deals of its own. A “Norway-minus” deal is more likely. That would see the UK leave the single market and customs union and end free movement of people. But Britain would align its rules and regulations with Brussels, hoping this would allow a greater degree of market access. The UK would still be subject to EU rules.A comprehensive trade deal like the one handed to Canada would help British traders, as it would lower or eliminate tariffs. But there would be little on offer for the UK services industry. It is a bad outcome for financial services. Such a deal would leave Britain free to erge from EU rules and regulations but that in turn would lead to border checks and the rise of other “non-tariff barriers” to trade. It would leave Britain free to forge new trade deals with other nations. Many in Brussels see this as a likely outcome, based on Theresa May’s direction so far.Britain leaves with no trade deal, meaning that all trade is governed by World Trade Organization rules. Tariffs would be high, queues at the border long and the Irish border issue severe. In the short term, British aircraft might be unable to fly to some European destinations. The UK would quickly need to establish bilateral agreements to deal with the consequences, but the country would be free to take whatever future direction it wishes. It may need to deregulate to attract international business – a very different future and a lot of disruption.It was telling that the British response to the story on Friday – though insisting things weren’t quite that bad – was to acknowledge that the other side was briefing aggressively against them and their scheme, which is never a good sign if you are trying to pretend everything is tickety-boo.For some, this may still come as a surprise. After all, the EU had shown a willingness to collude in postponing a showdown before the previous summit in March. It is possible that the hardball tactics now are a prelude to another last-minute fudge in time for the next one.The problem, however, is that the two UK customs proposals in question would require unprecedented levels of trust and cooperation – possibly even more so than the current arrangements between member states. Unlike, for example, the recent dispute over the post-Brexit financial settlement, there is no point simply negotiating through gritted teeth until both sides wearily agree to put the issue behind them. Without lasting faith across the EU that this will work, it almost certainly won’t.Both UK proposals require the EU to suspend more than its innate scepticism. They also require Brussels to be willing to ignore a substantial amount of future rule-breaking and potential smuggling in order to get the British government out of a hole.The first, and less ambitious, of the two proposals outlined in August, is a “streamlined customs arrangement”, whereby the onus is on businesses to police their own trade activity and report imports and exports that should be subject to duty. In Northern Ireland, where the highly integrated farming industry makes even this look too onerous, whole swaths of smaller traders would be exempted entirely from complying with normal customs rules.If this isn’t enough of an ask to make of the bureaucrats in Brussels, the UK would actually prefer a more ambitious option, a “new customs partnership”, to be implemented. In this scenario, the UK pretends (“mirrors” to use the technical term) that it still is in a customs union with the EU. This means not just collecting duties on overseas imports, as all members do now, but also tracking all goods after they arrive to make sure whether they are destined for UK or EU markets.As bewildered officials once again pointed out in Brussels this week, this requires a number of heroic assumptions for it to work. Firstly, the EU would need to trust a non-member state to police its most sensitive enforcement mechanisms. Secondly, it would need to impose red tape on businesses the likes of which has never been seen, even in the imagination of the most fervent Eurosceptics. Finally, it is all likely to cost a fortune in new systems, on both sides of the border.At the best of times, either of these two options would be a stretch: ignore, or recreate a bureaucratic nightmare many times more complex than that which exists today.But these are not the best of times, to put it mildly. Mistrust already abounds on all sides. The Irish government, in particular, fears the UK is not serious about its proposals but merely using them as a temporary sop to placate those worried about the peace process.More importantly the EU senses an even more significant victory could be looming. If it can persuade the government’s own MPs that there is no hope of British proposals coming to pass, then remaining in a customs union is now a realistic fall-back solution. Downing Street acceptance of the need for “close regulatory alignment” suggests continued single market membership may not be far behind either.Both would be an anathema to Brexit true-believers, but a relief to business, Brussels and much of Westminster. By playing hardball now, the worst-case scenario for the EU is that Britain becomes like Norway – a compliant, satellite state. By pinning all its hopes on “magical” proposals, which fail to emerge when the wand is waved, the UK may have left itself with nowhere else to go."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c6fc4fdb922afc97fea55dedca5f1a29bb5cf14/0_13_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=06f805a9f11900b878d4ed1131f303b0 1240w","title":"new power jeremy heimans social media","story":"Social media and online movements such as #MeToo are more potent than experts and elitist thinking, argue the authors of a manual on how to navigate the 21st century There is nothing out of the ordinary about a book that makes one angry. We have all read ones that provoke us, and the internet is an inexhaustible feast for anyone easily outraged. It is unusual, however, to read a book that makes one mad with oneself.The co-authors of New Power could not be more likable. Clever, witty and creative, Henry Timms and Jeremy Heimans are baby-faced wunderkinds of digital activism the type whose optimistic energy ought to make one feel hopeful for the future. So it is uncomfortable to confess that I hated almost every word, and wished more than anything for them to be wrong. The reason their book made me so cross with myself was that, if they are right, it means my way of thinking is old-fashioned and elitist – the very problem, in fact, they are trying to solve.New Power begins by contrasting a 20th-century model of power – “jealously guarded, closed, inaccessible and leader-driven”, typified by Harvey Weinstein – with a new 21st-century model – “open, participatory peer-driven”, exemplified by the #MeToo movement. No political or commercial organisation will survive, it argues, unless it abandons “old power values” of expertise, confidentiality, formal governance and managerialism, and adopts “new power values” of online crowd-sourcing, radical transparency, leaderless structures and amateurish enthusiasm. The future belongs to Airbnb and Black Lives Matter, in other words, and the book is a manual for us to learn how to be more like them.Heimans is Australian, but has just flown in from the US hours before we meet Timms is British, but based in New York, so takes part by phone. Heimans is 40, but looks as if he is in his early 20s, and we spend the first five minutes discussing his skin-care regime. He indulges my curiosity about moisturiser choices with self-deprecating humour, but small talk doesn’t feel like his natural register, and the purpose of the book is deadly serious. “The future,” it predicts, “will be won by those who can spread their ideas better, faster and more durably.” In 2018, as Heimans says, “It’s really hard not to make the argument that the forces of misinformation and extremism and nativism are in the lead.”He invites us to contrast the success of the new power recruitment strategy of Isis with the failure of the US state department’s old power effort to thwart it Isis recruits through a peer-to-peer network of youngsters sharing seductive intimacies on social media, which the state department sought to defeat with a calamitously ill-judged Twitter account bearing an image of its official seal and the instruction: “Think Again, Turn Away!”“This is really the reason why we wrote the book, and why we made the book quite practical,” Heimans says. “Because we want these tools to be in the hands of those on the side of the angels.” Timms agrees: “We’re going to need a lot of people – the scientists, the community organisers, the people who believe in enlightenment values – to embrace the new power tools and get really good at being powerful.” Their problem, of course, is that this target audience can be as sniffy about it as me.“Yes, there’s this emotional resistance,” Heimans reflects equably, trying, I think, to conceal his impatience with it. “There’s a complacency on the liberal side: ‘Why should we have to do this? Why should we get our hands dirty? Who needs a meme when you have a fact?’” That pretty much sums me up, I cheerfully admit. If others want to spend their time sharing amusing video clips on Twitter, they are welcome to, but why do I have to get involved? The question is semi-ironic his reply is arrestingly earnest.“The moral argument is, Decca, you care about these values that the newspaper you work for stands for, and we all have an obligation to learn these skills of building movements, spreading ideas, figuring out how to manage these communities.”The case he and Timms make for the superiority of social media-driven, open, mass participatory movements, loosely structured but cleverly engineered for loyalty, is unarguable. By deploying new power tactics, organisations as erse as Ted talks, Pope Francis’s Vatican and the National Rifle Association are thriving, whereas Uber – which treats its drivers with contempt – is in trouble. This doesn’t, however, alter my problem with the fact that the stunts that capture attention in the new power model are often toe-curlingly inane.Gormless frat-boy humour doesn’t, curiously, appear to trouble Heimans. He is a huge admirer of the Ice Bucket Challenge, which raised more than $115m (£82m) for charity in 2015. Then there is Reddit, whose highest-scoring post ever at one point was a message titled: “test post please ignore”, provoking what Heimans calls the “rebellious” instincts of the Reddit community, and others might call asinine. In 2016, the Natural Environment Research Council experimented with new power by launching a #NameOurShip social media campaign. When some bright spark proposed Boaty McBoatface, “the internet,” note Heimans and Timms, apparently amused, “of course agreed.” I am relieved when Heimans tells me he would not have voted for Boaty himself – but less so when he adds that he would have gone for the popular alternative option, “I Like Big Boats and I Cannot Lie”. Public subversion sabotaged the campaign because the NERC, the argument goes, was a new power amateur. Nevertheless, its decision to overrule the Boaty vote and call the ship the RSS David Attenborough instead was, Heimans maintains, a mistake.“You’ve got this really dull research vessel that no one would have paid any attention to, at a time when we’re trying to get people enthusiastic about science, at a time when the anti-science crowd is gaining potency. You could have had a crowd of people follow Boaty McBoatface on its journey. You could have had people help fund it. You could have had people engaged as citizen scientists. You could have created a whole community around that work that would have put people into the funnel of creating some intensity around science. Why wouldn’t you do that?”“Because it’s moronic!” I want to say – but am embarrassed by how stiff and snooty I sound. Heimans and Timms make me feel as if I have turned into Jacob Rees-Mogg. There is nothing snobbish about the next misgiving I raise. At the heart of every successful new power platform are what Heimans and Timms call “feedback loops” – reward systems of likes, shares and comments engineered to keep us coming back, craving the next dopamine hit of external validation. That this buzz is addictive is obvious the authors’ assertion that likes on Instagram “aren’t (just) ego boosts”, however, sounds laughably delusional. What other possible function can “Looking gorge, babe!!” serve? Has Timms, I joke, not seen Instagram?“We are not here to defend the culture of narcissistic selfies,” he says. “No. We want a healthcare system that works. We want a government that people actually like. We want an education system that gives people a sense of connection. The problem is most of those institutions were created in an old power context. They were built for the 20th century, and sometimes the 19th century, and so we have to start reimagining those institutions so that they don’t fail. You think about a millennial person whose life is full of these feedback loops – a lot of their life is mediated through these new power platforms, right. That’s what they want from their institutions now.”But the authors never mention the growing evidence of the psychological damage feedback loops are doing to young people’s mental health. If millennials are addicted to loops, of course they will want more – but if the relentless judging and ranking is making them ill, the state doesn’t have to oblige, does it?“I think mental health is a real concern,” Timms acknowledges. “But I think the really huge risk is the damage of distraction. We are all so engaged in our participation – but it distracts us from the things that matter. If feedback loops are only built around cat videos, that’s clearly a distraction. That’s clearly going to distract us from the things that matter the most.”Taxes, for example, matter. “They’re critical to any society. But as feedback loops go, the system does not perform particularly well. You essentially just give the government money, and have no real sense of where it ends up. Imagine a world where actually you’re getting much better feedback loops around your taxes, so you pay the taxes and you end up in a world where you find out where the money goes. Maybe you have some more power over how it’s spent. Maybe you hear about the impact along the way.”The possibility that anyone might not want this appears not to have crossed Timms’ mind. Personally, I don’t want a feedback loop with HMRC. But as I don’t want to share a meme, upload a video or name a boat either, to infer a contemporary trend from my preferences might be absurd. What is less clear, but more important, is whether Timms and Heimans’ temperamental bias similarly distorts their work on new power. Their authorial voice is reporterly, but the affectation of clear-eyed critical distance is misleading, for both are key protagonists in the new power movements they write about. It is hard, therefore, to know whether the power of the new power they report is objectively real, or just wishful thinking.The son of immigrants, by the age of 12 Heimans was already a precocious political pundit on national Australian TV. At 27, he founded a grassroots movement called GetUp!, which, according to their book, now has more members than every political party in Australia combined. He is also the founder and CEO of Purpose.org, an international activist organisation incubating political campaigns worldwide. Timms is the director of 92Y, a cultural centre in New York, and in 2012 founded a philanthropic movement called #GivingTuesday that brings new power tactics to the old challenge of fundraising. They are evangelical pioneers in the world they describe in their book, and I wonder whether this makes them more cheerleaders than observers.“We’re optimists,” Heimans concedes. “We do believe that there are inherent benefits to participation, if done well and smartly.” He would still have written exactly the same book, however, if he shared all my misgivings. “We’re very invested in getting this right, because we have to be, because the old world isn’t coming back. Like it or not, it’s just not coming back.”Both men see plenty of problems with the new world. Facebook comes out of their book very badly, accused of co-opting the rhetoric of new power while behaving more like the Kremlin. Writing long before the Cambridge Analytica revelations, they predict that “Participation farms”, which harvest our data for profit, will have to be tackled. Politicians such as Donald Trump, who deploy the power of social media for authoritarian ambitions, pose a grave danger, they warn, and leaderless new power movements such as Occupy can unravel into chaos. The Parkland students in Florida campaigning for gun control “get it,” Heimans says. “They know how to harness the energy of a connected crowd.” To succeed, however, they will need to partner with old power. Hashtags and marches won’t do it alone. “Our argument,” explains Heimans, “is not: ‘Throw away these old power skills that you’ve learned, the expertise, the understanding of how to navigate traditional organisational structures.’ We all still need those skills. The key is learning how and when to use old and new.”I think Timms might be trying to cheer me up when he agrees. “Elitists will still have a role. They will still be needed.” After all, he jokes, he had his appendix out a month ago. “And no one wants a group of hipster makers to crowdsource an appendectomy, right? No one wants that.”New Power by Jeremy Heimans and Henry Timms is published by Macmillan, price £20. To order a copy for £17, go to guardianbookshop.com or call 0330 333 6846.

Football fans scoff at its strict zones, which allow only one player to zip between each third and just two the opportunity to shoot. Others mock its rigid rules: no dribbling, no contact, and only taking two steps when in possession. But England’s nailbiting last-second victory at the Commonwealth Games last week proved that netball can be as thrilling as any Premier League match – even if the wingers aren’t allowed to score.Chris Evans set her alarm for 3.30am on Sunday, determined to watch the final live despite the punishing time difference with Australia. The 74-year-old has been a linchpin of Merseyside’s netball scene for 40 years. She still works part time as a PE teacher at Merchant Taylors’ school in Crosby and coaches two of the top local teams: Capricorn, who play in the regional league, and Greenbank, who on Sunday won Liverpool’s first ision.Known as Purple Chris because of her violet hair, Evans sat alone in her living room screaming at the TV as the Roses claimed gold with a 52-51 victory against the hosts. “I was jumping up and down like a maniac,” she said. “I was elated, shouting ‘Woah! Yesssss! Come on!’” Then she had her breakfast and set off to support Greenbank as they took the league title.England’s coach, Tracey Neville, said this week that funding constraints were like “a noose” around the sport’s neck. But Evans is optimistic: “Hopefully the fact we have won that gold medal will attract more sponsors to come on board and help raise our profile,” she said, before setting off for a match on the Isle of Man on Friday.With little fanfare, netball has become the UK’s number one female participation sport. Approximately 1.4 million women and girls play netball at some point in a typical season, according to England Netball, compared with 8.2 million who play football. It is the only women’s sport that enjoys weekly television coverage – on Sky Sports – throughout the Superleague season.Next year Liverpool will host netball’s world cup, making it – temporarily, at least – the home of netball. The city may no longer have a team in the Superleague, after Northern Thunder moved along the M62 and became Manchester Thunder. But at the grassroots level, the city region has 54 teams playing across five isions in the highly competitive Liverpool league, plus others in the commercial Simple Netball social league.On Friday, a group of women aged 50 to 73 gathered in a sports centre in Anfield to play walking netball, a slower-paced variant that is being pushed by health chiefs in an area where life expectancy is 10 years lower than in Liverpool’s wealthiest suburbs. The £3 sessions are subsidised by Red Neighbours, an initiative from Liverpool football club, and include a cup of tea.The games are run by England Netball’s Karen McVeigh, a former Northern Ireland national player, whose hardest task is making herself heard among the laughter and gossip. On Friday the women were keen to talk about the Commonwealth Games. “England were very lucky,” said Joan Leighton, referring to the last-minute penalty that bagged them the gold.On court, 64-year-old goal attack Ann Doyle was on fire, netting two goals in as many minutes. “When I was in school they wouldn’t even let me in the netball team,” she said. Maggie Thornley, 73, had come straight from tai chi. “Put it this way: it’s either come to this or watch Jeremy Kyle,” she said.One of the many joys of netball is its accessibility, according to Beth Munro, a community wellbeing officer with Macmillan cancer care. The 24-year-old, who has no left hand, plays in Liverpool’s first ision with St Marys. “I catch just using my one hand and thankfully my right hand is quite big compared to normal so that gives me extra width to cushion the ball,” she said.England’s Roses have inspired women all over Merseyside to put on a bib again, according to business analyst Eni Ann Riley, 31.

The English duo defied the odds, were up with the leaders throughout, and at the end finished in a big group which tied for second on 811, half a point behind the Croatian gold medallist, Ivan Saric.Jones, who was unbeaten, and McShane, who lost just once, were placed fourth and sixth on tiebreaks. No English player has ever won a medal at this championship, but Jones and McShane improved on all their predecessors and comfortably reached their primary target, two of the 23 qualifying places for the valuable 128-player 2019 knockout World Cup.The British champion Jones went on to the Dubai Open, where he was again unbeaten and finished sixth on 6.59. Then to the Sharjah Masters, where besides the usual corps of experienced GMs a flock of teenage talents entered from India, Iran and Uzbekistan. The prodigy generation is improving fast. Iran’s Parham Maghsoodloo, 17, won with 89, the world’s current youngest GM, Nodibirek Abdusattorov, 13, beat a 2700-rated opponent, while Jones suffered in a bizarre second-round finish.Jones wore down the Uzbek talent Javokhir Sindarov, 13, and slowly squeezed his way to an ending of two bishops against a knight. After a marathon 122 moves they reached Kf6, Ng2 v Kg4, Bs c6 and d2 where White’s g2 knight is stranded with no escape square and will be captured next turn. But the last capture was on move 72, so that Sindarov in this resignable position successfully claimed a draw under the 50-move rule.Thus Jones fell for an obscure rule and faded in the last three rounds, but what occurred to Nigel Short at the Bangkok Open this week was much worse. The former world title challenger is a regular at Thailand’s annual event, won it in 2017, began this week with 3.54, and as the No\u0026nbsp2 seed looked set for a strong performance. In round five Short steadily outplayed India’s youngest and newest IM, 11-year-old D\u0026nbspGukesh, and reached a won ending two pawns up.Then, disaster. Short gave a rook check, forgot to press his clock and after a few minutes his flag fell. He wrote on Twitter: “Lose with dignity\u0026nbsp… is a bit hard when your opponent is fully aware that you have not pressed your clock and jumps up and down with glee the moment your flag falls.”In one of the quickest GM wins at Sharjah, India’s Baskian Adhiban, who had the world champion, Magnus Carlsen, on the verge of defeat at Wijk 2017, crushed a 2700-rated Ukrainian in only 21 moves.The opening, a Caro-Kann where Black follows a Vishy Anand 3…c5 strategy, is level until White’s 12 Nc3? (12 c5 keeps control) gives Black the opportunity for piece activity by 13…Qxf6! since White is firing blanks on the a1-h8 diagonal.Shamkir, with Carlsen, and the US championship, with his challenger Fabiano Caruana, both continue this weekend and can be viewed live and free online with move-by-move grandmaster and computer commentary.

Notts closed on 53 for four, with only the New Zealander Ross Taylor resisting in helpful bowling conditions. Brooks struck three times, including twice in his first two overs as Notts slipped to six for three. After seven successive washed out days here, this was worth the wait for the Yorkshire membership.Notts, who beat Lancashire last weekend, started in fine fashion following an uncontested toss. Yorkshire’s loss of five wickets contributed to 37 falling across nine games before lunch. Make no mistake, this was a bowling day. Seven of the nine games are already into their second innings and another into its third at Chester-le-Street, where Durham were bowled out for 91, Kent replied with 169 and the hosts are 13 for one second time round.At Headingley Luke Fletcher was the pick for Notts with four for 47, including India’s Che Pujara lbw for two. His new ball partner Jake Ball had Alex Lees caught at third slip and Gary Ballance caught at point for a duck inside the first hour. Both were soft dismissals, owing little to favourable bowling conditions.The wicketkeeper Andrew Hodd contributed significantly to Yorkshire’s recovery with a determined 62. He shared 44 for the sixth wicket with Jack Leaning and 36 for the eighth with Josh Shaw. Yorkshire’s chances of one batting point were slim, never mind two. But Brooks and Ben Coad (18) added 44 for the last wicket. Then they put the skids under the Notts reply, with Brooks forcing Steven Mullaney to chop on for a duck and Chris Nash to glove behind. Coad then trapped Jake Libby lbw at the start of the fourth over. That soon became 39 for four as Brooks trapped Samit Patel lbw.Eighteen wickets fell at Chelmsford, where it is anyone’s game between last season’s two top in Division One, Essex and Lancashire. Peter Siddle did his best to match Brooks with 33 from No 10 in Essex’s 150 before Jamie Porter and Simon Harmer claimed four wickets each in Lancashire’s 141 for eight.Porter and Harmer were Essex’s standout performers with the ball last year, so this was no surprise. However, there will be a few raised eyebrows at Lancashire’s early-season batting woes given their strength.At Taunton it was a day for Australian batsmen and English seamers. Matt Renshaw, the Yorkshire-born Australian Test player, drafted into Somerset’s squad after the curious incident in Cape Town, was announced as a replacement for Cameron Bancroft only a week ago. Batting at No 3 rather than at the top of the order, he hit a battling unbeaten century on a pitch somewhat greener than those he is accustomed to in Brisbane.Renshaw’s debut innings against Worcestershire’s persistent seamers enabled Somerset to reach 202. Ed Barnard, the mini-Woakes, finished with career best figures of five for 52. For a while Renshaw was matched by Travis Head, another Australian left-hander, who struck a belligerent a belligerent 49 after Lewis Gregory had snatched three early wickets. In front of more than 2000 sun-drenched onlookers Worcestershire ended the day 49 behind with two wickets remaining."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb8e5cda423e1d48ce94fdcc2e256bd5ab3a32b5/0_120_5011_3007/master/5011.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=b8b54f861b102475a1dfea9dd3e48dee 1240w","title":"scarlets leinster james davies interview rugby union","story":"Not since Llanelli’s fabled win over the All Blacks in 1972 has west Wales felt so much love for its local rugby heroes. At last there is modern-day competition for sepia-tinted legends such as Ray Gravell and Phil Bennett, particularly if the Scarlets become the first Welsh team or region to win Europe’s ultimate club title. Even making the final at Leinster’s expense would out-rank all other Welsh efforts in the past 21 years.Whatever happens, last season’s Pro12 champions are already admired for their infectiously positive offloading style and, particularly in one inidual’s case, for bringing a smile to everyone’s face. To say James ‘Cubby Boi’ Davies is a popular figure is an understatement: if anyone embodies the Scarlets’ joie de vivre it is the 27-year-old younger brother of the Lions centre, Jon “Fox” Davies.Even at breakfast time on a wet midweek morning, the irrepressible Cubby (his parents ran the Fox \u0026amp Hounds pub in Bancyfelin, hence the siblings’ nicknames) is magnificent value. How many other top sportsmen would happily recall the drunken night in Las Vegas when his knuckles were tattooed for a bet, discuss his dog eating his lucky underpants or admit to being only the fourth-best rugby player from his home village near Carmarthen? If the openside flanker’s breakdown work in Dublin is as sharp as his comic timing, Leinster will be right up against it.Cubby’s guiding mantra – “If you’re going to be a bear be a Grizzly” – usually means he responds well to big occasions. He was brilliant for Great Britain’s medal-winning sevens team in the Rio Olympics and has never been one for holding back. “For years I’ve thought like that. What’s the point of being someone who sits in a corner and no-one knows who they are? It works for some people but I guess I just chose differently. When the big games are happening and the bright lights are on, that’s when I like to shine. Growing up in the pub my hero was Prince Naseem Hamed. I loved how he used to put on a show for everybody. When I was seven or eight I asked for a pair of his gly shorts for Christmas but Santa never came up with the goods.”Time spent around Davies junior is rarely dull. According to his brother, he “thinks he’s a rock star now” but not everyone always sees the funny side. His first cap against Italy last month should probably have happened some years earlier while his tattooed fists caused disquiet at home: “Mum came round pretty quickly but Dad took a bit longer. I remember showing him for the first time and all he said was: ‘There we are then.’ He didn’t speak to me for seven days. I think he was thinking about what job I could do after rugby. It’ll probably have to be something involving gloves – maybe a dentist?” At least it has raised his profile. “I call myself a marketing genius now. Subconsciously I think I always knew what I was doing.” Really? “Very subconsciously.”All of which prompts a serious question: would he have won more caps had he been a duller bloke? Breaking off from discussing his pet collie Desmond’s appetite for underpants – “He’s just had my training socks as well” – he is fairly sure he knows the answer.“Yeah, potentially. I don’t know if that’s been the case but, if it is, I’m quite happy with the route I’ve taken. At the end of the day I’d rather have fun and eventually achieve my goal rather than be more boring and have a lot more caps.”The deceptively-strong Cubby is far more committed than he lets on. As with the young Neil Back, there has been scepticism from those who expect top-class opensides to be a certain size and shape. “I’ve been doubted throughout my career. Since I was 16 people have said: ‘He’s not big enough.’ My brother’s a great player but, as a big lad back then, it would only take one game to convince someone. It would take me 20 games.” Escaping the shadows of Sam Warburton, Justin Tipuric and Josh Navidi to win his first cap, therefore, was a deeply satisfying moment. “It felt like I’d earned it. I enjoy myself but I work hard as well. To play the way I do you have to be fit. I work my butt off in the off-season.”It also means his currently-injured brother, the great Delme Thomas and another locally-reared Lion, Mike Phillips, now have lively company in the village hall of fame. Cubby has a theory about the origins of this impressive production line –“Delme’s of an age when he might have been going round knocking on doors at night” – but the Fox \u0026amp Hounds also offered a perfect athletic breeding ground. “Luckily the pub had a nice big park area which was our back garden. There were no iPhones or iPads so me and my brother would just be out playing football and rugby. That’s where my skill levels come from.” Who usually won? “Silly question. I used to run rings around him. Whenever anyone scored a screamer in football they had to lie on their back like Paul Gascoigne and be squirted with water bottles. Good times.”The post-match celebrations will be equally joyous if Scarlets repeat last season’s Pro 12 semi-final win over Leinster, when the versatile Davies was redeployed on the wing after Steff Evans was red-carded. He filled the same role – “I should have two contracts, shouldn’t I?” – against La Rochelle last month and will be among this weekend’s key figures alongside Tadhg Beirne, Ken Owens, Leigh Halfpenny et al. “Because a lot of the core players are from this part of the world you don’t get big egos or city slickers. I think that’s why everyone gets on so well. There are no cliques and we play for each other.”The other secret ingredient is the Scarlets’ collective desire to give it a real go. “It just allows players to express themselves a bit more. There’s so much talent in these boys when they’re relaxed.” Would winning in Europe mean even more than his Olympic silver medal or his Welsh cap? “These are my best mates. To achieve that kind of landmark with them would probably be the pinnacle.” The boys of ’72 will take some emulating but their successors are not done yet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0bae2a9292b8aaed40cc617fbf075527467db931/187_300_2975_1785/master/2975.jpg?w=1300\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=8dc3f554b361c664d936a316372f5cdf 2600w","title":"commonwealth summit leaders royal family prince charles winner","story":"Commonwealth’s 53 leaders chase all round London and, in the end, Prince Charles winsIt was billed as the biggest intergovernmental summit ever held in the United Kingdom the near week-long, 53-country Commonwealth conference whose costs are likely to amount to more than £10m and whose global influence remains limited despite the fanfare.The long agenda of events in theory presented repeated opportunities for Theresa May to talk about issues ranging from banning plastic straws to gay rights overseas, highlighting anything other than Brexit – but in reality required a panicked response to a Windrush immigration crisis.Its real winners though were the royal family – deploying the full trappings of the crown to ensure a success for Prince Charles as head of the organisation at what will almost certainly be the last summit attended by the Queen, at an event at which every serving member played a role.“The Commonwealth secretariat knows that the monarchy is its life-support system and the Queen recognises the importance of its headship,” said Philip Murphy, professor of Commonwealth studies at the University of London. “They knew that the issue of succession would dominate the news and for the UK government it would look like a win for Britain.”The engagement of the Queen was clearly also a draw. Previous Commonwealth summits in Sri Lanka and Malta only saw roughly half the heads of government turn up, but London had a very high turnout, including India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, with delegates staying en masse at the five-star InterContinental hotel in Park Lane. Costs for the summit are being met by the UK government, though ministers will not disclose how much has been spent on policing, security and the rest of the sprawling event until some time later. But as a benchmark, the previous summit in Valletta, the capital of Malta, cost €13.5m (£11.8m), with the costs of food and other hospitality alone amounting to €4.8m.Yet it began disastrously: with No 10 forced at Monday’s mid-morning lobby briefing to announce an emergency taskforce to deal with the problem faced by Windrush migrants in the UK, an issue that had been dragging on for five months but only became critical for the government after Caribbean countries complained they could not get the issue on the Commonwealth summit agenda. “The problem for the Commonwealth is that it isn’t able to generate its own news story so its agenda gets dominated by external rows,” Murphy said. “The agenda amounts to a confetti of good intentions, but issues like plastic straws are a drop in the ocean compared with the time when the organisation was dominated by the struggle against apartheid.”Some leaders took advantage to press a diplomatic case. Justin Trudeau, Canada’s prime minister, is seeking a seat on the UN security council. May met Modi to discuss trade after Brexit, and the Indian leader was also hosted by Prince Charles at the Science Museum, where a Tata-owned, zero-emissions Jaguar was displayed.Streets in London were repeatedly closed for a string of events as motorcades ferried presidents and prime ministers past, with the first forums beginning on Tuesday with a plenary session where May spoke at a roundtable event addressed by business magnate Bill Gates. On Wednesday evening, May hosted a welcome reception and dinner at the Sky Garden atop the Walkie Talkie building in the City of London.On Thursday, the action moved to the Buckingham Palace ballroom, where the pop singer Emeli Sandé sang the national anthem to open proceedings at the Commonwealth heads of government meeting. The Queen pleaded that it was her “sincere wish” that one day “the Prince of Wales should carry on the important work started by my father in 1949”. The opening ceremony was followed up with a three-course, black-tie banquet for 130 in thepalace’s picture gallery.Friday, the last formal day of the summit, saw leaders and the organisation’s secretary general, Lady Scotland, take over Windsor Castle without the royal family present for a summit “retreat” in which no advisers were present. The leaders resolved that Charles would take over, although few believed the succession had ever been seriously in doubt.Then on Saturday, as the Queen turns 92, many leaders are expected to stay on for the Queen’s birthday concert at the Royal Albert Hall, hosted by Zoe Ball and where Sir Tom Jones and Kylie Minogue have been lined up to perform at an event that will be broadcast live on BBC One. May will host her friend from Oxford University the Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, at Chequers.“The question is whether Charles’s succession will preserve the Commonwealth. It is more like embalming fluid the organisation and its summits will certainly keep going, but will it have the urgency to reform itself and make itself relevant,” Murphy said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af98407de24f229504932e19e9a4d26b1b32f2c7/0_117_3504_2102/master/3504.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=af11cee0b817c1ea033b400988573a29 1240w","title":"mexico congress politician legal immunity vote","story":"The vote to remove politicians’ immunity is meant to curb corruption and lessen perceptions Mexico’s political class can act above the lawMexico’s lower house of Congress has voted to remove politicians’ immunity from prosecution, a move meant to curb corruption and impunity and lessen perceptions the country’s political class can act above the law.Under the constitutional changes approved late on Thursday, the country’s president – who can currently only be impeached for treason and “serious crimes of the common order” – could be put on criminal trial while in office, but only after a vote in congress. “This bill will put an end to the impunity that prevails in Mexico’s political circles,” congressman Jesus Alvarez Lopez of the leftist Morena party told AP. Politicians from all sides were quick to claim credit for the changes – which have long been pushed by parties while in opposition but blocked by the party in power.Politicians’ immunity from prosecution helped fuel perceptions that some sought election as a way of staying one step ahead of the law. Over the past decade, several politicians with accusations of corruption against them or supposed ties to drug cartels have hid out in Congress, hoping to swear their oath of office and emerge untouchable.The bill was approved as Mexico readies for July presidential elections in which corruption has emerged as a central theme.The ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) has been badly hit by corruption allegations, and even elected a non-member as its candidate – former finance minister José Antonio Meade – in an attempt to clean up its image.But Meade has struggled to connect with voters, and one poll this week showed him trailing leftwing populist candidate Andrés Manuel López Obrador by 30 points. A string of PRI state governors have been caught up in graft allegations and several are in prison awaiting trial. Tomás Yarrington, former governor of Tamaulipas state on the Texas border from 1999 to 2005, was extradited Friday from Italy to the United States. Yarrington denies accusations of cartel money laundering.However, some observers remain skeptical that stripping politicians of their immunity will prompt any real change in the country’s political culture. “If you look at the politicians imprisoned in Mexico, they’re the product of political vendettas or the settling of scores, rather than acts of the justice,” said Aldo Muñoz Armenta, a political science professor at the Autonomous University of Mexico State. “As long as the prosecutor or investigators obey the president or governors, they’re not going to open an investigation into them so long as it’s not politically convenient.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3468540.1524243422!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"earth day in ireland list of main events this weekend","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t A display of plastic at Nolan’s supermarket in Clontarf, north Dublin,  explaining  how the supermarket plans to  tackle the problem of excessive plastics.   Photograph: Alan BetsonThe Irish TimesA “shop and drop” day of action on plastic packaging at supermarkets on Saturday and community cleanups of waterways, beaches and public areas over the weekend are being organised to mark Earth Day on Sunday.Pleasant spring weather forecast for Saturday is expected to help those organising clean-ups by community groups and volunteers who will be targeting polluting plastics and litter and cleanups of rivers and canals.Earth Day has been staged every year since 1970 “to demonstrate support for environmental protection” throughout the world.Irish Environmental Network co-ordinator Michael Ewing welcomed the decision by Earth Day organisers to push for an end to plastic pollution.“Infinite growth of the plastics industry and over-consumption of single use plastic is unsustainable,” he said.“The world had reached a tipping point in terms of our planet’s capacity to deal with “the deluge of plastic waste.“There can be no going back to the business-as-usual now. Earth Day is a great opportunity for citizens across the world to show their desire to rid the world of single-use plastics from our day to day lives.”The biggest single event in Ireland this weekend is Saturday’s “shop and drop” day of action on plastic packaging which will be held at hundreds of supermarkets across Ireland, which is being organised by environmental groups.Friends of the Earth director Oisín Coghlan said: “The Earth is our only home. And it’s a miracle of nature, a goldilocks’s planet’: not too hot, not too cold just right for human life.“But its ability to feed us and keep us safe is now at risk. Our pollution is destabilising the climate and depleting the soils and the seas.”“The huge public response to the issue of plastic pollution shows that people do get it and want to protect the environment,” he said.A new initiative called Dublin Waters Action Day will see a huge voluntary effort targeted at cleaning up Dublin’s rivers and canals on Saturday morning.Dodder Action and the Dublin Canals Group have joined together with Treasure the Tolka Swords Tidy Towns and Friends of the Camac to clean Dublin’s rivers and canals.Dodder Action volunteers will clean at 10 points from Old Bawn in Tallaght to the Irishtown Basin, through Firhouse, Rathfarnham, Milltown, Clonskeagh and Donnybrook. For more information see: www.dodderaction.orgDublin Canals will clean at nine points from Grand Canal Basin through Lesson Street Bridge to Crossguns Bridge to North Strand back to Spencer Dock. For more information see: dublincanalsactionday.ieMeanwhile smaller, community groups will clean the Tolka, Camac and Ward rivers.All these groups will welcome volunteers (at 10am for the Dodder and 10.45am for the canals).Equipment and gloves will be provided. “All we need is people, even if they just want to come along for an hour,” said Dodder Action chair Victoria White.The initiative is part of An Taisce’s National Spring Clean programme, and will be focussing on the proliferation of plastic.She also called for the introduction of a deposit scheme for bottles and cans which she said account for 95 per cent of litter.“We hope Dublin Waters Action Day will sharpen the focus of residents and politicians alike on the importance of keeping our waterways clear of pollution.”As part of Earth Day the Irish Peatland Conservation Council (IPCC) is marking the first World Curlew Day at the Bog of Allen Nature Centre in Rathangan, Co Kildare at 2pm on Saturday.It is giving a talk on the endangered curlew and hosting a guided walk to Lodge Bog – See: bogs@ipcc.ieIPCC conservation officer Katie Geraghty said staff and volunteers at the centre looked forward to the return of the Curlew to Lodge Bog each year.“We are privileged to have them in our locality and it is important that we all work together to help them breed successfully.”The Rediscovery Centre in Ballymun, Dublin is offering free information tours (at 11am and 3pm on Saturday). Located in the recently re-purposed Ballymun Boiler House, it “challenges conventional thinking about how we live, stimulates positive environmental behavioural change and highlights how we can use our resources wisely to achieve a low carbon, sustainable society”. It is also the national centre for the circular economy.Jim Lawlor from the Native Woodland Trust will give a talk on native woodlands - a “1,000 year project” - at the Cool Planet experience in Powerscourt estate, Enniskerry, Co Wicklow, on Sunday afternoon.For more details visit: https:cpe.coolpagesearth-optimism-dayAlso coinciding with Earth Day, a project raising awareness of the impact of microplastics on the Irish coastline was announced on Friday.“IMPACT: The Microplastics Awareness Project” is led by scientists from Dublin Institute of Technology (DIT) – it will host interactive science workshops “on the beach and in the classroom” over coming months to encourage young people to tackle the threat of microplastics and plastic waste in their local communities.Artists have created enormous works of art across Europe to protest against plastic pollution in the run-up to Earth Day. Sand etchings up to 30 metres in diameter depicting sea creatures battling with plastic waste have appeared on beaches in France, Spain, Portugal, the UK and Germany during April.A final piece is set to be created on the Dutch coast on Saturday by the artist Tim Hoekstra, who has campaigned against plastic pollution since 2013.“Every time I come to the beach, I see washed up plastic, mostly food and drink packaging. It has got much worse in recent years. It makes me sick to think that our kids might never know what a clean beach or water is really like,” Mr Hoekstra said.Thank you for signing up.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?The Crossword Club provides access to an archive of more than 6,000 interactive crosswords from The Irish Times.

Photograph: Eric Luke Former taoiseach Brian Cowen has described Britain’s Brexit secretary David Davis as a hardline right-winger who has never shown any interest in Ireland. In a rare interview, the ex-Fianna Fáil leader said the much-ridiculed remarks by Mr Davis last week that Sinn Féin was driving a hardened Irish Government stance on the border revealed how little the Tories understand the country. “That’s just another indication of where the right-wing Tory party is in relation to their knowledge of how Ireland works,” Mr Cowen told RTÉ’s Today with Seán O’Rourke. “He’s not a person who has shown much interest in Ireland in the past in my experience, and I was involved for a very long time. Speaking in London, Mr Davis said he had not anticipated Taoiseach Leo Varadkar’s tough approach in the Brexit negotiations, which he suggested was swayed by “quite a strong influence from Sinn Féin”.Challenged about the assertion, he replied: “Well you had a change of leader or a change in taoiseach. They’ve been playing a strong political role which they haven’t done historically, that I hadn’t foreseen.”A similar claim has been made by a number of other Conservative politicians in recent months, including former Northern Ireland secretary Owen Patterson. Mr Varadkar called the comments “strange” and “inaccurate”, while Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said they were “nonsense”.Referring to Britain’s stated objective of leaving the EU customs union while maintaining a soft border, Mr Cowen said it “defies logic”. “We will have to await the ingenuity of the Brits to see if they can come up with an answer,” he said.Striking a sceptical note, he added: “The whole Brexit agenda is being pushed by the right wing of the Tory party for some years now and I’ve never had much faith in their genuine interest in what impacts on Ireland as far as they are concerned.”Mr Cowen said he had remained “silent on this issue” for a long time because he wanted to hear the British position. “Initial reactions from Europe regarding their thoughts on the issue are not very reassuring,” he said. Mr Cowen also took issue with recent claims by former Northern Ireland First Minister and ex-Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble that Dublin’s negotiating stance could provoke loyalist paramilitaries. “Obviously one would listen to what Mr Trimble has to say, given role in the past, but I honestly believe that can’t come into the consideration of these negotiations or how Ireland views them,” he said. “The fact is we have national interests to protect, we are just as determined to protect them as the British are to protect theirs.”Thank you for signing up.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3468574.1524238727!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit britain remains committed to no hard border in north","story":"EU Commission president Donald Tusk says that\u0027s Britain\u0027s decision to leave the EU has caused the border issue in Ireland, and it is up the UK to help solve the problem. Video: EU Parliament\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA newspaper report has claimed British prime minister Theresa May has been told her plans for avoiding a hard border in Northern Ireland will not work. Photograph: AFPDowning Street has expressed confidence Britain can reach a deal with the European Union to avoid a hard border in Ireland, despite reports that all its proposals have been rejected by Brussels. “We are confident that in the coming months if all sides work together productively we can achieve a solution,” British prime minister Theresa May’s official spokesman said.“We have been clear that the UK is leaving the customs union and we need to find a solution that protects things like the Belfast Agreement, avoids a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland and protects Ireland’s place in the UK internal market. That continues to be our focus.”According to news reports, EU negotiators have rejected as unworkable both of Britain’s proposals to keep trade frictionless after Brexit, a “customs partnership” and a “streamlined customs arrangement”. A customs partnership would see Britain collecting tariffs on behalf of the EU for goods entering the country en route to Europe and applying its own tariffs to imported goods destined for the British market.The second, a customs arrangement, envisages technological and administrative measures ensuring that trade with the EU remains frictionless, with additional measures for Northern Ireland such as allowing small traders to operate across the Border unchecked.The EU is reported to have rejected the customs union because it does not want a country outside its supervision to levy duties, that it placed the burden of collecting tariffs on business, and that implementing the scheme on the EU side would be too costly. Its objection to the customs arrangement proposal apparently reflects a reluctance to turn a blind eye to possible irregularities along the Border.Britain last month rejected the EU’s language on the Border in a draft withdrawal agreement because it claims it only partially reflects the joint report agreed between the two sides last December.The joint report outlined the terms of a “backstop” arrangement if other measures fail to prevent a hard border, including regulatory alignment between North and South.A subsequent paragraph, promising no new regulatory barriers between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom, is not included in the EU’s draft withdrawal agreement.The House of Commons will vote next week on a motion calling on the British government to seek to remain in a customs union with the European Union in order to avoid a hard border in Ireland. The motion, which has been tabled by 10 select committee chairs including Conservatives Nicky Morgan and Sarah Wollaston, will be non-binding but the debate will increase pressure on the government to keep the customs union option alive following a massive defeat on the issue in the House of Lords on Wednesday.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orceThank you for signing up.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":null,"title":"there s a hole and someone went out southwest pilot tells air traffic control","story":"  April 18, 2018Plane violently depressurized after fragments from the explosion burst through window   April 19, 2018With horrifying suddenness, an engine exploded and a passenger was partly sucked through a broken window Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/04/12/TELEMMGLPICT000002395664_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq6L3Bx11x18zbsv4k04trOP3QFo7fDZgyggOOCRYToPs.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"cant think rationallywithout emotions feature not bug","story":"Future AIs might be susceptible to something like depressionDoes intelligence have to be conscious?

Neither did representatives for Mattel in Mexico or the Frida Kahlo Corporation.Kahlo\u0027s image and her extensive body of work have been widely commercialized as the artist\u0027s popularity has grown.Since her death in 1954, Kahlo, who was married to Mexican muralist Diego Rivera, has been regarded as one of the greatest painters of the 20th century for her moving and intimate self -portraits, reflecting her personal experience of pain and isolation.Mattel\u0027s Barbie also drew the family\u0027s ire because it lacks the artist\u0027s signature monobrow, which has become a symbol of her feminist stance.Please review our commenting policyBritish man with first case of \u0026#39super-gonorrhoea\u0026#39 is curedMeasles alert issued after holidaymakers return from Europe with bugPrince Charles \u0026#39deeply touched\u0026#39 to be confirmed as Queen\u0026#39s Head of the Commonwealth successorTwitter goes down around the world as woes continueThreatened 700-year-old Banyan tree put on intravenous drip Employers confused by new GCSE grading system as a quarter think bottom grade is the best markGirl outwits gang wielding baseball bats by hiding behind wallTom Courtenay gets a new lease of life after being cured of colour blindness at 81Former French PM Manuel Valls considering standing for mayor of BarcelonaNatalie Portman pulls out of \u0026#39Jewish Nobel\u0026#39 over recent events in IsraelSNP minister predicts second independence vote as soon as April 2019Democrats sue Donald Trump\u0026#39s campaign and Russia for interfering in 2016 electionThe Pacific Commonwealth islands on the front line of the plastic waste crisisInvestigation launched in Italy after one of world\u0026#39s rarest bears dies during capture by rangers\u0026#39Flamboyant\u0026#39 jihadi linked to 911 terror cell captured by Kurdish forces in SyriaBritish teen hacker made \u0026#39I own you\u0026#39 appear on US security chief\u0026#39s home TV, court hears German theatre under fire for offering free tickets to those who wear a swastika armbandWestworld recap: the story so far, ahead of season 2We rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/04/20/TELEMMGLPICT000160823328_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqPoURMoge4zyCm5RemNush9BJAZn0NjCZqoW0yjlVgN4.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"measles alert issued holidaymakers return europe bug","story":"A child receives a vaccination against measles by a family physician on April 16, 2018 in the Romanian capital, BucharestA measles health alert has been issued after unvaccinated holidaymakers returning from Europe lead to a surge in cases.Public Health England have urged people to protect themselves from the viral illness as more than 250 cases have been reported since the start of the year.A further 90 laboratory tests are also underway, meaning the number could be higher. Last year, just 243 cases were reported.Health officials suspect the rise can be attributed to holidaymnakers returning from the continent. In Europe, there has been a large outbreak in measles this year.Dr Yvonne Doyle, London regional director for Public Health England, said: “We are seeing a concerning increase in measles cases across  London which could lead to a wider outbreak in unvaccinated children and adults.Measles is a highly contagious infectious disease which usually starts with cold-like symptoms“Those who have not received two doses of the vaccine in the past — or who are unsure — should speak to their GP. There’s no harm in receiving an additional dose where there is any uncertainty.“It’s crucial pregnant women have been vaccinated with MMR, as rubella in particular can cause serious complications during pregnancy.”Measles is a highly contagious infectious disease which usually starts with cold-like symptoms, fever and red, sensitive eyes. It can spread very easily and can be caught by breathing in droplets from an infected person when they cough or sneeze.In rare cases, complications can include deafness, blindness and swelling of the

confirmed successor queen next head commonwealth","story":"Prince Charles is confirmed as the successor to Queen Elizabeth II as next Head of the CommonwealthThe Prince of Wales will one day succeed the Queen to become the next Head of Commonwealth, it was confirmed on Friday night, after leaders reached an agreement to honour Her Majesty’s “vision, duty and steadfast service” to the institution.The Prince will take on the honorary position in the Commonwealth at the same time he eventually becomes King, following the “sincere wish” expressed by the Queen this week.\u0026quotI am deeply touched and honoured by the decision of Commonwealth Heads of State and Government that I should succeed The Queen, in due course, as Head of the Commonwealth,” he said. “Meanwhile, I will continue to support Her Majesty in every possible way, in the service of our unique family of nations.\u0026quotTheresa May, the Prime Minister, announced the decision from the 53 Commonwealth Heads of Government after private deliberations at Windsor Castle on Friday.There, presidents and prime ministers from across the world convened to finalise plans for the future of the Commonwealth, enjoying the hospitality of the Queen’s home at the end of a week which has seen senior members of the Royal Family out in force.Nana Akufo-Addo, President of Ghana, said the decision to make the Prince of Wales the next honorary leader was reached by “strong consensus”, while Theresa May insisted it was unanimous.The Prime Minister of Grenada, Keith Mitchell, said he had been convinced the decision was a good one thanks to his belief that the young men of the Commonwealth need a strong male role model.The decision is a one-off, with Prince William, Prince George and future heirs not automatically in line to be awarded the non-hereditary position. Speaking at a press conference after the retreat, Mrs May said that the Commonwealth itself exists in “no small measure because the vision, duty and steadfast service of her majesty in nurturing the growth of this remarkable family of nations”.“On behalf of all our citizens I want to express the gratitude for everything Her Majesty has done and will continue to do,” she said.The Queen and the Prince of Wales at the official opening of CHOGM“Today we have agreed that the next head of the commonwealth will be His Royal Highness Prince Charles, the Prince of Wales.“His Royal Highness has been a proud supporter of the Commonwealth for more than four decades and has spoken passionately about the organisation’s unique ersity. “It is fitting that he will one day continue the work of his mother, Her Majesty the Queen.”  The announcement followed a concerted effort on the part of the Royal Family this week, beginning with Prince Harry and culminating in a speech from the Queen herself.  On Monday, Prince Harry had embarked on work as the newly-appointed Commonwealth Youth Ambassador to emphasise the family’s ties with the Commonwealth, paying tribute to his grandmother\u0027s long service and his father\u0027s foresight on issues such as climate change.  His brother, the Duke of Cambridge, swiftly followed, welcoming CHOGM delegates by warning them they would be “seeing a lot of the Royal Family” during the week with a twinkle in his eye.  \u0026quotFor us in the Royal Family, supporting The Queen who has dedicated her life loyally and without fail to the Commonwealth is an enormous honour,” he said.  On Tuesday, the Prince of Wales began his own work at the CHOGM forums, regaling attendees with his fond memories of his visits to each of their countries, and spending time with Prime Minister Narendra Modi admiring an exhibition about India at the Science Museum.  While the combined efforts of the princes were no doubt appreciated, the Queen left nothing to chance.On Thursday, as she spoke at the official opening of CHOGM at Buckingham Palace, she made a heartfelt address spelling out for the first time her hopes for the future of the Commonwealth, and offering her full support to her son.  “It remains a great pleasure and honour to serve you as Head of the Commonwealth and to observe, with pride and satisfaction, that this is a flourishing network,” she told the assembled heads,” she said.  \u0026quotIt is my sincere wish that the Commonwealth will continue to offer stability and continuity for future generations, and will decide that one day The Prince of Wales should carry on the important work started by my father in 1949.”  Leaders meet at Windsor for the CHOGM retreatWhile it was understood that the Prince’s position as future Head of Commonwealth has been quietly decided for some time, the Queen’s public words had a galvanising effect on world leaders.  In the same ceremony, Joseph Muscat, Prime Minister of Malta, said of the Prince: \u0026quotWe are certain that, when he will be called upon to do so, he will provide solid and passionate leadership for our Commonwealth.\u0026quot  Later that day, Malcolm Turnbull, the Australian Prime Minister, confirmed his country “strongly supports the continuation of the king or queen of the United Kingdom as the head of the Commonwealth.”   \u0026quotPrince Charles in time will succeed his mother,” he added.  Heads of government join the Commonwealth\u0026#39s Secretary General Baroness Scotland (right) for the Windsor Castle retreat\u0026quotThe head of the Commonwealth, which is a ceremonial role, a role of honour rather than one of political authority, that role I think should continue, and this is the very widespread view, with the Queen\u0027s successor.\u0026quot  Speaking to press, Justin Trudeau, the Canadian Prime Minister, said: \u0026quotI very much agree with the wishes of Her Majesty that the Prince of Wales be the next head of the Commonwealth.\u0026quot  And Ralph Regenvanu, the foreign minister of the Pacific state of Vanuatu, disclosed: \u0026quotWe see it almost naturally that it should be the British royal family because it is the Commonwealth after all\u0026quot.The Prince of Wales, Queen, Baroness Scotland and Theresa May at a Buckingham Palace dinner to celebrate the CommonwealthOthers had expressed frustration that the issue had overshadowed more important discussions.Prince Harry is to be the Commonwealth Youth AmbassadorFrom today, the Prince is expected to represent the Queen in the honorary role at future Commonwealth meetings, the next of which will take place in Rwanda in 2020.  He has previously attended the meeting four times, in Edinburgh in 1997, Uganda in 2007, Sri Lanka in 2013 and Malta in 2015 when he appeared with the Queen.  Since 1969, The Prince has visited 44 Commonwealth countries.

The biggest set of economic decisions over the course of the next few years are going to be taken in the Brexit negotiations and whatever deal we end up with. And then we will adjust to the impact of those decisions in order to keep the economy on a stable path.”Earlier on Thursday retail sales data for March came in worse than expected. This followed a bigger than anticipated decline in inflation in March.“We have had some mixed data,” Mr Carney said.“On the softer side some of the business surveys have come off. Retail sales have been a bit softer – we are all aware of the squeeze that is going on in the high street. We’ll sit down calmly and look at it all in the round.”Allan Monks of JP Morgan said the implication of Mr Carney’s words were that the Bank could pause in May and hike later in the year. or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Job prospects and and a disillusionment with politics are among the issues still pushing many millennials, like generations before them, to move away. Except now, things are supposed to be different. Brexit has the potential to undermine the Good Friday AgreementTwenty years ago, on 10 April 1998, peace came to Northern Ireland. After 30 years of brutal sectarian conflict, in which more than 3,600 people were killed, political groups agreed to reject violence and work together to solve problems democratically. It was called the Good Friday Agreement. A devolved assembly would be established for both sides to govern together and while unionists were assured of their British identity, a united Ireland was acknowledged as a legitimate political goal for republicans. Some 71 per cent of people in Northern Ireland voted to accept the agreement in a referendum, with the DUP being the only party to reject it. David Trimble and John Hume were pictured on stage with Bono after brokering the Good Friday Agreement (AFPGetty)The years that followed saw continued political instability and fringe paramilitary activity but largely, the deal held. By 2003, voting patterns in Northern Ireland shifted considerably. While Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader David Trimble and Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader John Hume had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts in 1998, their parties were gradually sidelined.Instead, the electorate moved towards more hardline options. The DUP, led by the formidable Rev Ian Paisley, with their staunch Presbyterian values, and unwavering loyalty to Britain overtook the UUP and Sinn Fein, the unapologetically republican party with former IRA prisoners among its ranks, effectively replaced the SDLP.And yet, they managed the unthinkable. In 2008, Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness led the two parties into power sharing for the first time, and were seen not just working together, but laughing together.But while violence faded from the streets, a cultural battleground began to open up politically – not just over the very narrative of the Troubles, but over parading, flags and language, with the DUP fighting for a retention of all things British, while Sinn Fein vouched for Irish culture to be given the equal weighting it was promised in the agreement. Naomi Long is the leader of Alliance, a small, centre ground party with members from both communities. She says even at the height of the conflict, politics was not as starkly ided as it is now.“I think there has been a reliance on the use of the politics of fear, and using that as a rather lazy means to garner votes in elections,” she explains. “The big political parties essentially ask people to vote for them to keep other people out, rather than as a positive expression of what their ambitions and aspirations for the future might be.”Power sharing has now been suspended at Stormont in Belfast since January 2017 (Getty)But whether the parties are setting the agenda from their offices at Stormont, or whether they are merely responding to the wishes of the people on the street, both the DUP and Sinn Fein are totally in step with their ever hardening bases.One of the best litmus tests is The Nolan Show, “the biggest show in the country” broadcast every morning on BBC Radio Ulster. The impassioned, angry, and often downright bigoted views expressed by callers have made the very name of the show synonymous with sounding off. A recent standoff heard a unionist man refuse to call Sinn Fein’s Mairtín O Muilleoir by his Irish name, because a previous republican caller refused to even call the country “Northern Ireland”. As they argued among themselves, Stephen Nolan spoke for many listeners when he muttered, “This is pathetic.”The DUP have found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights (PA)It would be pessimistic to suggest that the show’s more colourful callers are representative of Northern Ireland as a whole, but it would be a blatant dismissal of the region’s political stalemate to suggest it is not. Just as the callers cannot agree, increasingly, Sinn Fein and the DUP can’t either.On 9 January last year, Martin McGuinness resigned his position as deputy first minister over a political scandal that implicated DUP leader Arlene Foster – although she denies any wrongdoing. Declaring it “the right time to call a halt to the DUP’s arrogance”, Northern Ireland’s mandatory power sharing coalition meant his resignation also removed Foster from her position as first minister, collapsing the assembly.His statement, an astonishing swansong delivered two months before his death, also laid out a litany of claims against the DUP. After 10 years of working together, McGuinness concluded that, “the equality, mutual respect and all-Ireland approaches enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement have never been fully embraced by the DUP.”Martin McGuinness resigned in protest against the handling of a botched energy scheme (Getty)This brought everything crashing down, and in the election which followed, both the DUP and Sinn Fein increased their popular vote, but one side had clearly benefited. Unionism lost its overall majority for the first time ever, and Sinn Fein were suddenly just a hair’s breadth behind their rivals.To their detriment, the DUP have also found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights and abortion reform. The general election of June 2017 brought this to the attention of the British mainstream after their confidence and supply agreement with Theresa May’s Conservatives. Talks to restore power sharing remain unresolved, with Sinn Fein requests for parity with the rest of the UK on language rights and marriage equality being rejected by the DUP. Arlene Foster has been criticised for saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland (Getty)Michelle Gildernew was part of the first Sinn Fein delegation ever received at Downing Street by Tony Blair in 1997 and is now a Westminster MP. She doesn’t feel her party is asking for anything more than what people are entitled to.“We’re looking at rights that people have across these islands,” she says, “whether that’s legacy rights, rights for LGBT citizens, for Irish, Scots, Welsh language speakers. There are rights for people everywhere across these islands, except for the six counties. I think that is a completely unacceptable situation. I’m raising three children here and I want them to have the same rights as their friends and neighbours, wherever they are.”Talk to the average person on the street in Northern Ireland and they’ll criticise politicians, for putting cultural issues and minority rights ahead of health, housing and education – budgets for which have all been squeezed during the impasse. But every election returns the same reality. People vote in huge numbers for the DUP and Sinn Fein to hold their corners.Former Irish taoiseach Bertie Ahern signed the Good Friday Agreement alongside Tony Blair, and maintains that bigger hurdles were overcome then. The restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement signed by Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern, is vital (PA)“I think everybody has to compromise,” he tells me. “If you cast your mind back 20 years ago we were dealing with the big issues of prisoners’ release, decommissioning, a new criminal justice system – they were major issues. Now I don’t want to trivialise the issues now and say they’re minor, but they’re certainly not at the magnitude of what we had to crack in 1998.”The fundamental problem is that while the war is over, unionists and republicans remain locked in a psychological battle for the very soul of Northern Ireland. Is its future still within the United Kingdom, or are we moving towards a united Ireland? While the Good Friday Agreement acknowledged that Northern Ireland would remain a part of the UK, it was also agreed that when a majority of people in the north and the south of Ireland wanted to reunify, a referendum could be held, and the result would be honoured. Republicans saw this as a starting gun for their goal of reunification, and while this angered some unionists, most seemed confident it wasn’t of immediate concern – something leaders within the DUP and the UUP have felt the need to reiterate in recent weeks, with diminishing certainty.Murals in Belfast serve as a reminder of Northern Ireland’s violent past (Getty)For most of the past two decades, the public discourse has maintained that republicans cannot hope to win over a majority for a united Ireland because most centre ground voters are too well off in the UK – including many nationalists who are quietly accepting of the situation. But now that seems about to change.If Brexit stunned the country, it shook Northern Ireland to its core, where 56 per cent of people voted to remain. The European Union served not just as a guarantor for the Good Friday Agreement, but accommodated a kind of harmonisation across Ireland that contented many nationalists. An invisible border allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united.Gildernew’s Fermanagh and South Tyrone constituency shares a great length of that border with four counties of the Irish Republic.“I cross it probably every day,” she says. “People cross it for work, for business, for school, for caring responsibilities, to visit family, even just to walk the dog. We’ve spent decades trying to remove the border, not just the physical infrastructure, but in people’s hearts and minds, and any changes to that will be resisted by the communities on either side of it.”The invisible border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united (Getty)Indeed, the prospect of a border returning has also mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand, with taoiseach Leo Varadkar claiming that “no Irish government will ever again leave Northern nationalists and Northern Ireland behind”.It’s increasingly clear that by campaigning for a patriotic cause they probably never believed would have consequences, the DUP shot unionism in the foot. Suddenly, Sinn Fein were handed a card to play which made a united Ireland a plausible, realistic and economically sensible option. It would be lazy to assume that the 56 per cent who voted remain would automatically want to remain within the EU by means of a united Ireland, but it has certainly made the option much more appealing. In the past two weeks, Sinn Fein vice president Michelle O’Neill has called for a unity referendum to be held within five years, while Arlene Foster was criticised after saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland. The DUP were asked to provide comment for this feature, but neglected to put anyone forward.Alex Kane is a former communications director for the UUP and believes there are strong arguments to be made for staying within the UK.“Even if there was a referendum, I’m not convinced unionism would lose it at this point,” he says. “But I think there are more challenges for unionists now than there have been in my lifetime. I think it’s an existential challenge for unionism.”Michelle O’Neill (left) wants a unity referendum to be held within five years (Getty)Kevin Meagher is the author of A United Ireland: Why Unification Is Inevitable and How It Will Come About. He believes it could happen by 2022, as a result of a demographic shift in nationalism’s favour, and quite possibly, Jeremy Corbyn in 10 Downing Street. He warns that the vote could be won despite the apparent polarisation of Northern Irish politics.“An agreed Ireland is not a precondition for a united Ireland,” he stresses, “and what I’ve been saying to British politicians is if you think you can kick the can down the road until everybody gets on and everything is forgotten, you’re not going to have that option. The reality is, by 2022 you could have an electoral majority who want a united Ireland, and you’re going to have to facilitate that.”The ultimate irony is that by so flagrantly risking the interests of Northern Ireland to carry out the will of Little Englanders, the Conservatives have put Irish reunification further up the agenda than Sinn Fein ever could have done alone. Unionists may see this as their worst nightmare, but Meagher – a former special adviser in the Northern Ireland Office – believes it wouldn’t bother the British government much at all.“If presented with a way out that was reasonable and effective for British ministers of either party, frankly they would have had to take an option of Irish unity 20, 30, 40 years ago. It’s been looming in British politics that this is the direction of travel.”Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland (Getty)As government predictions show the GDP of Northern Ireland would be reduced by 12 per cent under a no deal Brexit, economic safety within the UK is no longer a certainty. The Irish economy, on the other hand, is growing three times faster than any other European country. The question now shifts from whether people want to risk their livelihood by joining a united Ireland, to whether people can actually afford to stay in the UK.As it currently stands, Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland, which is pleasing nationalists, republicans, the Irish government and the EU. She is also promising no border down the Irish Sea, to keep the DUP happy. And yet, she is carrying out the will of a British majority, whose primary concern in voting for Brexit was immigration Loughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandLoughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandEnda Craig, a member of the Loughs Agency Advisory Forum, holds a map of Lough Foyle in Moville, IrelandOyster farmer William Lynch puts on his wellington boots on his oyster farm on Lough Foyle in Culmore, Northern IrelandWomen walk along the shores of Carlingford Lough with Northern Ireland seen across the lough in CarlingfordA poster hanging on a wall of a house reads: No to the ferry, referring to a proposed new car ferry that would run from Northern Ireland to the Republic of Ireland through Carlingford Lough in GreencastleSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick (L) and boat owner Brian Cunningham navigate out of Warrenpoint harbour into Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandA woman with flowers walks past an old fuel station in Carlingford, IrelandA boat is seen at sunset on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandA mandries off after swimming in Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandA derelict house is seen on the shore of Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick dredges mussels from Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandBagged-up farmed oysters at a cleaning facility to get them ready for overseas shipping in Moville, IrelandA man walks his dog in matching hi-vis outfits on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandCarlingford Lough and in the distance Northern Ireland are seen at sunset from Omeath, IrelandA sign that reads: \u0027In 1771 nothing happened here\u0027 is seen on the shores of Carlingford Lough in Carlingford, Ireland. Will they really stand for the kind of soft or non-existent border the prime minister is promising Ireland? Someone, somewhere down the line, is going to be betrayed.Deputy leader of the SDLP Nichola Mallon says it’s now time for May to deliver solutions of substance, not just empty rhetoric.“This for us is not an orange and green issue, it’s not about the constitutional question on the island, this is about ensuring we have the best deal for people across the island, and we believe this is best served by Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union and the single market,” she says.The prospect of a hard border returning has mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand (AFPGetty)So Northern Ireland is waiting for a solution on the border, but also for a political landscape that works for everybody. Surely, after two decades, that isn’t too much to ask?“I thought within 20 years, something is bound to be different other than the fact we’re not shooting each other,” Alex Kane says, “and that’s good, but it’s not enough. Not killing each other is normal, but also normal is parties making decisions, going into government together, having choices. We don’t seem any closer to that.”I\u0027m ashamed of the state of the world, says PopeClinton says Good Friday Agreement anniversary is an chance for peaceThreat of \u0027serious trouble\u0027 in Northern IrelandBut the restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement, is a must. It may require unpalatable concessions from both sides, but a Stormont assembly is essential, whether you want to remain in a UK of devolved governments, or – as Bertie Ahern points out – if you are aiming for that referendum on Irish unity.“You have to have stable institutions and sustainable development going forward before you do that,” he believes. “The clause to have referendums is part of the Good Friday Agreement, so it doesn’t seem logical in my view to be talking about a referendum when you don’t even have the agreement fully in place.”The evidence suggests that the winds of change are blowing in favour of Northern Ireland’s nationalists, but the hard work of honouring the Good Friday Agreement is crucial to achieving a new Ireland of equals for all.Email cannot be used.

This is not how it works.” While Theresa May may yet impose sanctions against Putin-supporting billionaires in response to the attempted murder of the Russian spy Sergei Skripal, her government’s track record has been marred by procrastination and prevarication.   Privately, the prime minister regards the exploitation of London as a haven for dirty Russian money as a serious problem. She once listened in stunned silence as a senior MI6 officer briefed her on the activities of Russian organised crime and certain oligarchs in the UK. And in 2016 she authorised the National Security Council to review why and how wealthy Russians buy property in London. But she has been nervous about taking action. For the past three years she has dithered on implementing a legally-enforceable register that will force all foreign companies that own UK property to disclose the identity of their owners.Russia claims Skripals poisoned using toxin possessed by UK and USRussia has been spying on the Skripals for at least five years- UKRussia stock market crashes after US imposes sanctions on oligarchsFreezing property assets is the key to inflicting pain on the Russian state and its compliant plutocrats. Since 2004, £190m of UK property has been subject to criminal investigation as suspected proceeds of corruption. The London property market has been skewed by laundered money, as The Independent revealed exclusively in 2014. Prices are being artificially driven up by wealthy, influential, foreign men who want to hide their assets in the UK.Multi-million pound payments are accepted without their origin being questioned. Oligarchs hide ownership behind anonymous shell companies registered in secretive jurisdictions while a London address offers a veneer of legitimacy and prestige that helps launder reputations as well as cash. Transparency International estimates that Russians account for £729m of the £4.4bn acquired in UK property via what it regards as “suspicious wealth”.There is no suggestion that all London property bought by Russian oligarchs is derived from illegal or criminal sources. For some Russian plutocrats buying luxury property in London is a symbol that they have been accepted by the British establishment. This is illustrated by the eleven bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square that Oleg Deripaska, regarded as one of Putin’s favourite oligarchs, snapped up for £17m through an offshore company registered in the British Virgin Islands in 2003 and now worth £45m.Oleg Deripaska’s 11-bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square is seen as a symbol of acceptance by the British establishment (Alamy)Built in the 1820s, it was formerly the home of Sir Henry “Chips” Channon, society host, Conservative MP and notoriously indiscreet diarist. It was designed for entertaining royalty and diplomats with its grand staircase, Madame Récamier sofas and flamboyant decor. When Harold Nicolson arrived at the house for dinner, he exclaimed: “Oh my God, how rich and powerful Lord Channon has become.” The equally grand and historic mansion Beechwood House, set in 11 acres of land in Highgate, north London, was bought by the powerful oligarch Alisher Usmanov in 2008 for £48m from the Emir of Qatar. Usmanov is a major shareholder in Arsenal football club and has amassed a £14bn fortune from metals and commodities and has long been regarded as a pro-Putin figure. And his fellow football-loving oligarch Roman Abramovich owns houses on Kensington Palace Gardens and Chester Square, Belgravia, and apartments on Eaton Square and Manresa Road, Chelsea.  One Hyde Park, one of the wealthiest residencies in the world, was famously bought up by Russian oligarchs (Alamy)It is not just prestigious houses that attract Russian billionaires. The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return for their cash, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship.  Since 2008 iniduals have been able to obtain “golden visas” if they invest as little as £2m in a UK business. And for £5m, they gain the right to become a UK resident on a temporary basis and then, after five years, a British citizen. By 2014, almost 700 rich Russians had paid for entry using this method, with Roman Rotenberg, son of Putin’s former judo partner Boris Rotenberg, being the most prominent example. He owns a mews house on Cadogan Lane in Belgravia.The government is taking some action to stop London becoming what David Cameron described as a haven to hide “dodgy foreign cash”. The National Crime Agency (NCA) is investigating a list of wealthy iniduals, not just oligarchs, to assess if they have used the UK to launder their fortunes.An estimated 149 iniduals are restricted on their travel and ability to conduct business in the UK. And the Unexplained Wealth Orders is now law, whereby the NCA can demand that the oligarch explain the origin of his wealth. But the problem with this order, according to a Russian businessman, is that the inidual in question could too easily lie about his source of wealth and instead produce a document that shows his fortune was based on, for example, share idends. Roman Rotenberg gained entry to the UK using the ‘golden visas’ method (Getty)Boris Johnson protests that the government cannot act directly against the pro-Putin brigade because it cannot interfere in criminal investigations. But it could make specific changes to the law, notably an amendment to the Sanctions and Money Laundering Bill, which would give Magnitsky-type powers to freeze the UK assets of relevant iniduals, including intelligence agents or other officials who have abused human rights.  The government could also implement the register of inidual owners of foreign and offshore companies that own UK property. But that bill has been delayed until 2021 and campaigners smell a cover-up after the government announced that one reason for the delay is that the Business Department has commissioned research on the impact of the register on investment decisions. “This is a crucial moment for the UK’s future trading relationship with the rest of the world, and we must proceed with as good an understanding as possible of the potential impacts on legitimate inward investment,” said foreign office minister Lord Ahmad. Skripal attack aftermath – in picturesSkripal attack aftermath – in picturesInvestigators in protective clothing remove a van from an address in Winterslow near Salisbury in Wiltshire, as police and members of the armed forces continue to investigate the suspected nerve agent attack on Russian double agent Sergei SkripaA police officer on duty near the protective tent which covers the bench where a man and woman were apparently poisoned with what was later identified as a nerve agent, in SalisburyMilitary in protective clothing prior to removing vehicles from a car park in SalisburyPersonnel in protective coveralls and breathing equipment cover an ambulance with a tarpaulin at the Salisbury District HospitalHome Secretary Amber Rudd visits the scene of the nerve agent attack in SalibsuryMembers of the emergency services in hazard suits fix the tent over the bench where Sergei and Yulia Skripal were foundOfficials in protective suits check their equipment before repositioning a forensics tent A poice officer stands guard outside a branch of the Italian chain restaurant ZizziDetective Sergeant Nick Bailey, who assisted the Russian ex-spy targeted with a nerve agent, was also hospitalisedSergei Skripal days before he was exposed to a mystery substance that has left him fighting for lifeSergei Skripal speaks to his lawyer from behind bars seen on a screen of a monitor outside a courtroom in Moscow.Yulia Skripal, who is thought to have been poisoned along with her father, Sergei SkripalProgress to legislation has thus been painfully slow. An insight into why political rhetoric has not resulted in legislative action can be gleaned by the recent flotation on the London stock exchange of the Russian energy company En+, then owned by Deripaska and chaired by former Conservative energy minister Lord Barker. For it revealed a fundamental dispute between MI6 and the financial regulators on how to make oligarchs who park their assets in London more accountable and transparent.MI6 and the prime minister’s national security advisor, Sir Mark Sedwill, were furious with the Stock Exchange and Financial Conduct Authority for failing to consult them and conduct the required due diligence of En+. Their main concern was about whether Rusal, a subsidiary of En+, had been manufacturing aluminium powder used by Russian arms firms for military purposes. Rusal adamantly denied it – yet its own website previously indicated that the defence industry was among the users of the type of aluminium powder it manufactured.Sir Mark Sedwill was furious when the required due diligence of En+ was not carried out ahead of its flotation on the London stock exchange (Getty)The En+ group could be a candidate for new sanctions as the Russian state-owned VTB Bank is a major shareholder with a 4.35 per cent holding, while Deripaska is known for being close to the Russian President. Leaked US diplomatic cables described Deripaska as “among the two to three oligarchs Putin turns to on a regular basis” and is “a more-or-less permanent fixture on Putin’s trips abroad”.Indeed, when the US imposed sanctions on seven oligarchs and the 12 companies they own or control last week, shares tumbled. Deripaska was among those affected, as was Rotenberg.  Still, Britiain cannot follow suit. And the anger of National Security officials and MI6 En+\u0027s flotation last year stemmed precisely from their belief that it typified the complacent approach to Russian money in London, which the infamous oligarch Boris Berezovsky once told me was “70 per cent dirty”. The inability to impose sanctions is similarly emblematic.The London Stock Exchange has long been a vehicle for Russian companies and oligarchs to raise money in shares and bonds – an estimated $200bn (£140bn) since 2004. Last summer, Russia’s largest gold producer Polyus, controlled by Suleyman Kerimov, a Russian senator awarded the Order of Merit by Putin, raised $879m. There are now 57 predominantly-Russian companies listed on the London Stock Exchange, more than anywhere else outside Moscow.   The wealthiest Russian oligarchs who call London homeA little-noticed loophole to avoid sanctions is that Russian sovereign debt is permitted to be sold in London. “We are allowing Russian sovereign debt to be sold in the UK and that debt is being used to reimburse Russians to bring back their money onshore in Moscow terms,” said the Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. “As that gold is moving towards Moscow, we are quite extraordinarily enabling those bond and debt auctions...This is one of those areas where sanctions on businesses are being compensated by the Russian state.”Just hours after Theresa May’s retaliation against the poisoning of Sergei Skripal, Gazprom issued a $750m eurobond in London and the following day the Russian government joined in by issuing a $4bn bond in the capital. Within hours, the Russian Embassy issued a revealing tweet: “Business as usual?”Could the nerve-agent attack in Salisbury be the unwitting catalyst for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London? (Getty)But the irony is that it is the attempted assassination of a Russian spy and double agent living in Salisbury and the murder of Russian businessman Nikolai Glushkov in Surrey that could be the unwitting catalysts for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London.Mark Hollingsworth is the author of “Londongrad – From Russia with Cash’’ Email cannot be used.

Colin Drury delves into the inside story of the battle to save 17,500 trees being felled in a single cityJenny Hockey still shivers when she remembers the moment, almost 18 months ago, she was woken by police hammering at her door. It was 5am. When she looked outside, she momentarily wondered if a terror incident was unfolding.“It was that kind of scene,” the 71-year-old says. “Multiple cars, officers swarming everywhere, flashing lights. We had no idea what was happening.”It was 17 November 2016 and, under the cover of darkness, officers from South Yorkshire Police had descended on Sheffield’s Rustlings Road, one of the city’s most sought-after addresses. Cordoning off the street and banging on doors, they ordered residents to get dressed and move their vehicles or have them towed away. Within the hour, Hockey, a retired sociology professor, would become one of three neighbours arrested and locked up for eight hours.227-year-old tree planted by George Washington pulled down by windBut this dramatic pre-dawn raid – described by Nick Clegg, then the local MP, as like something “you’d expect in Putin’s Russia” – was not carried out in search of terrorists or criminals.Rather, it was in support of council contractors hired to chop down eight street trees, which residents had spent more than a year petitioning to save.Amid the confusion, Hockey and two others – including another woman in her seventies – attempted to stand under one of these century-old limes, only to be detained. All charges were later dropped.“We wanted to protect something we loved,” she says. “And our right to do that – our democratic right – was taken away, really, by state force. It was so horrible and disempowering.”Indeed, by the time the trio were freed, the trees which had always overlooked their homes were no more.Contractors cut down the final tree in Rustlings Road (PA)Yet a bigger battle was just beginning: one which has since spread across the city, seen mass protests and riot police on suburban streets, and ultimately revealed an astonishing secret plan – hidden within a £2.2bn PFI contract – to cut down almost 20,000 street trees…Sheffield has long boasted of being Europe’s greenest city – in part because a third of it sits in the Peak District. But it is also due to the sheer number of trees that line the roads. Some 36,000 of them arch over highways and footpaths.But around 2015, talk of what the Woodland Trust called a “tree massacre” started to emerge.Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a highways improvement scheme  (PA)The eight limes in Rustlings Road were not the only ones marked for the chainsaw. Under then-redacted clauses in a £2.2bn contract, Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a vast highways improvement scheme being undertaken by the infrastructure giant Amey.Company and council both said – and still say – such felling was necessary. Targeted trees, they argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing irreparable damage to roads and footpaths. Every one taken down, they added, was being substituted with a younger sapling: “We assess every single tree and only replace them as a last resort,” says Darren Butt, account director with Amey, today.Targeted trees, the council argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing damage to roads and footpaths (Sheffield Tree Action Group)Yet, as this felling increased, questions started to be asked. There was shock when two cherries commemorating Second World War heroes disappeared one day. At Christmas, a row decorated with charity festive lights were hacked back – with fellers cutting through wires and all.A feeling spread that perfectly healthy and safe trees were being chopped unnecessarily. A suspicion grew that the policy was actually about increasing Amey’s profit margins. Over the length of the company’s 25-year highway maintenance obligations, so ran the theory, a newly planted sapling is far cheaper to look after than older, larger arboreta.“People were going to work in the morning and coming home to entirely different-looking streets,” says Paul Selby, a city resident and leading member of Sheffield Tree Action Groups, known as Stag. “It was ecological destruction carried out, in secret, by a multinational company with the explicit support of the local authority and the police.“And people were angry. These trees were part of their lives and they didn’t want them taking. These weren’t anarchists or hardline activists from other towns. They’re Sheffielders furious they hadn’t been given a voice in what was happening in their streets. So they came out and fought to be heard.”Almost 6,000 trees have been chopped down. But in the face of overwhelming and increasingly nationalised pressure, a pause on felling was announced last week.Sheffield City Council has put this down to the “dangerous tactics” of protestors. Yet the support in favour of Stag – both within the city and from names including Jeremy Corbyn, Michael Gove, Ken Loach and Jarvis Cocker – probably had something to do with it too.Hopes are now high the whole policy can be reconsidered. “We don’t take anything for granted,” says Selby, a civil servant with the Department for Work and Pensions. “But, after so long fighting, surely dialogue is now the sensible way forward.”Tensions rose, with fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidation (Sheffield Tree Action Group)Certainly, it has been a troubled road to here: the irony perhaps being that this all started with a real city victory.In 2012 the government handed Sheffield £1.2bn to improve its roads, an economic godsend for a place locals had taken to calling Pothole City. Amey – a subsidiary of the Spanish company Ferrovial – won the work contract, promising to upgrade and maintain every highway, pavement, bridge, subway and street light for 25 years.“This is work that is good for everyone living here,” says Paul Billington, director of culture and environment with the city council. “It is already bringing investment and opportunities back into the city because it is making our infrastructure world-class.”Replacing damaging or dying trees, he argues, is key to that success continuing. Doing it now, he adds, is important because, as a 2007 survey showed, a large majority of trees are so old that to delay action would store problems for future generations.“No one disagrees that dying or damaging trees should be looked at – if they really do fall into those categories,” says Alison Teal, a Green Party councillor in the city. “But this went beyond that. We still didn’t know how many were due to come down but everywhere you looked, these magnificent trees were disappearing.”Demonstrations were civil enough to start with. People at home would spot Amey vans and go out to stand under targeted trees so they couldn’t be axed. Others started taking the bus to work, leaving their cars blocking access to endangered arboreta.Cups of tea were offered while people stood about. They debated the merits of the trees: their beauty, the environmental benefits, the wildlife. Occasionally, they talked about their favourite. An endangered elm in the Nether Edge area ended up being shortlisted for the 2016 England Tree Of The Year Award.Yet things hardened after the Rustlings Road raid (“In hindsight, it was poorly handled,” says Darren Butt). While many still supported the replacement scheme, opinion started to harden in favour of the so-called tree-huggers.

Stumps of trees already cut were painted blood red as a mark of anger. Stag supporters – now numbering in their thousands – took to organising daily spotter patrols and flying pickets.“When someone saw an Amey van near an endangered tree, they put a message in a WhatsApp group or online, and whoever was available would go and protect that tree,” says Teal.In this way dozens of limes, cherries, oaks and birches across several neighbourhoods were saved.But as tensions rose – with both fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidation – police started to appear.Jenny Hockey (left), Freda Brayshaw and a third neighbour were arrested and locked up for eight hours (PA)At one demonstration in leafy Chippinghouse Road in January 2017, nine people were arrested, some while stood in their own gardens. None were ever charged. At another picket last month, a specialist police protest removal unit turned up. It was the first time it had ever been deployed on South Yorkshire’s streets.Arrest numbers grew – yet there were vaguely comedic elements to many. A 57-year-old woman was detained after blowing a pink trumpet, while a retired couple – Dr John and Sue Unwin – found themselves being questioned by CID officers (and later cleared) about the suspected poisoning of a cup of tea they gave a feller.“It sounds like the plot from an Agatha Christie novel,” Dr Unwin told the Daily Mail.One 73-year-old was detained for intimidation. Alan Simpson, a retired firefighter and great-grandfather, says: “I’ve never been in trouble in my life and was there with my wife. I don’t think I could have cut a less intimidating figure if I tried.” His charge, too, has been dropped.“If it wasn’t so serious,” says James Whitworth, cartoonist on local newspaper The Star, “it would be farcical, and I mean that literally: there is enough material here to make an actual farce.“As a cartoonist, it’s a dream because the whole thing is so ridiculous. You think you can’t possibly say anymore on the issue – and then they arrest a woman for blowing a plastic trumpet. But as a city resident: I’m pretty neutral but, really, maybe leave our trees alone?”Local newspaper cartoonist James Whitworth’s take on the Sheffield tree massacre (James Whitworth)As news of the ongoing demonstrations spread, meanwhile, concern grew it was damaging the city’s reputation. When Sheffield was left off The Sunday Times Best Places to Live list this year, authorities blamed the campaigners: “it is regrettable the increasingly extreme actions of a small number of protestors is having this impact,” a council spokesperson declared.Demonstrators themselves were not above ridiculous assertions either: at a packed council meeting, one compared Amey’s workers to Nazi guards, just doing their jobs.Lavender and tea tree oils could be giving boys breasts, study warnsChina reassigns 60,000 troops to plant trees in bid to fight pollutionHow the Japanese fought suicide in the ‘Sea of Trees’For now, however, the potential turning point arguably came in March when a freedom of information request, asked by Paul Selby, forced the council to reveal it had indeed asked for 17,500 trees to be chopped down. The figure was so astonishing all three city MPs – all Labour – called for a rethink.In a disastrous interview on local radio, council cabinet member for environment Bryan Lodge – who declined to be interviewed for this piece – denied the figure was a target but could not explain what it actually was. Days later the suspension of felling was announced.What happens next is the question the city is asking itself.“We’ve already lost 6,000 trees,” says Selby. “Of course, there are some that should come down if they really are dying or doing irreversible damage to footpaths. But all other solutions should be sought first. Trees are a sign of a civilised city. We should be doing everything we can to save them.”Email cannot be used.

The biggest set of economic decisions over the course of the next few years are going to be taken in the Brexit negotiations and whatever deal we end up with. And then we will adjust to the impact of those decisions in order to keep the economy on a stable path.”Earlier on Thursday retail sales data for March came in worse than expected. This followed a bigger than anticipated decline in inflation in March.“We have had some mixed data,” Mr Carney said.“On the softer side some of the business surveys have come off. Retail sales have been a bit softer – we are all aware of the squeeze that is going on in the high street. We’ll sit down calmly and look at it all in the round.”Allan Monks of JP Morgan said the implication of Mr Carney’s words were that the Bank could pause in May and hike later in the year. or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

One of the people Dr Ilardo met told her he once stayed underwater for 13 minutes while hunting.The Bajau village of Jaya BaktiJaya Bakti homes from the waterA Bajau villager demonstrates the use of traditional wooden gogglesA young Bajau girl looks on in excitement as her father, a traditional Bajau er, returns to Jaya Bakti from a two-week fishing tripThe population was interested in learning about their genetic heritage, and Dr Ilardo used a portable ultrasound machine to measure spleen size in 59 Bajau.She then measured spleen size in 34 people from a neighbouring village inhabited by non- Bajau people so she could make a comparison.When she took her data back to Denmark to analyse, Dr Ilardo found Bajau people had spleens around 50 per cent larger than their neighbours. Spleens are involved in the so-called “human e response”. When a body is submerged in cold water the heart rate slows, blood vessels in the extremities shrink and the spleen contracts.This contraction injects a spurt of additional oxygen-rich blood cells into circulation, allowing the body to survive for longer underwater. Dr Ilardo and her collaborators estimated the enlarged spleens of the Bajau could provide them with around 10 per cent more blood cells than someone with a normal-sized spleen.As well as measuring spleen size, Dr Ilardo took spit samples from the study participants so she could investigate the genetic basis for the differences she was seeing. She identified several genes that were observed far more frequently in the genomes of Bajau participants, including one – PDE10A – that is involved with the production of thyroid hormone, which in turn is associated with spleen size.We believe that in the Bajau they have an adaptation that increases thyroid hormone levels and therefore increases their spleen size, said Dr Ilardo. It\u0027s been shown in mice that thyroid hormones and spleen size are connected. “If you genetically alter mice to have an absence of the thyroid hormone T4, their spleen size is drastically reduced, but this effect is actually reversible with an injection of T4.This is the first adaptation for ing ever observed in humans. Previous work appeared to show that sea nomad children had superior underwater eyesight, but those results have since been disproved.The findings were published in the journal Cell. Despite initially warning Dr Ilardo against undertaking the work due to the likelihood she would find no significant results, her supervisors Professor Eske Willerslev and Professor Rasmus Nielsen think her findings are significant for a number of reasons.This is the first time that we really have a system like that in humans to study, said Dr Nielsen. “Nature has made experiments for us that tell us how humans react and adapt genetically to a whole new set of physiological conditions, so that we can explore and learn much more about the interaction between genetics and physiology.Understanding the genetics underpinning the Bajau’s abilities could even have applications in medical research – specifically for those trying to treat the condition of acute hypoxia, when body tissue experiences a rapid depletion of oxygen.There is also a fundamental need to understand the ersity of genes found in the world’s indigenous populations, said Professor Willerslev.This really tells us how valuable and important indigenous populations are around the world that are living extreme lifestyles, in terms of understanding the function of various genetic traits and finding the underlying genetic background for various physiological traits, he said. Most of these populations are completely understudied, and I think there is a huge benefit, not only potentially to them, but also to the rest of mankind by actually paying some attention to them.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Polls suggest Labour may win a bigger share of the vote in the capital than any party ever has, and could take control of the flagship Conservative boroughs of Barnet, Wandsworth and Westminster.Commenting on the latest figures, Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, attacked Conservative councils over their “abject failure” on house building and accused them of “refusing to play their

incredible figures clearly show that Labour councils are building almost twice as much affordable housing as Conservative councils across London.“In doing so, they lay bare the massive difference in political priorities between a Labour Party that is committed to building the genuinely affordable homes Londoners need and a Conservative Party that isn’t.“Not only do these figures reveal that Conservative councils are refusing to play their part in tackling London’s housing crisis, they paint a truly damning picture of the Tory record on affordable housing in London – a record that is not only shameful, but utterly indefensible.He added: “I’m angry that Londoners living in Conservative-run boroughs have been so badly let down by Tory councils that are failing to build the genuinely affordable homes they need. If these boroughs had been run by Labour over the last four years, up to 6,000 more genuinely affordable homes could have been started for Londoners.” The Conservatives have been contacted for comment.The average Conservative borough has begun work on 720 genuinely affordable homes since 2014, when local elections were last held in London, while Labour councils started an average of 1,310.Labour claimed a further 6,000 affordable homes could have been built if it controlled the 10 boroughs that are currently run by the Tories.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: “These figures show what Labour in power can deliver for Londoners. Sadiq is building record numbers of homes that people can actually afford to live in – including new social homes, homes at the new London living rent set at a third of local income, and affordable shared ownership.“I am pledging that a Labour government would do the same for people across the country. Under the Tories housing has become about speculation for a wealthy few, pricing out millions of people from a decent, secure home.”Of the 38,514 genuinely affordable homes started in London since 2014, 26,202 were built under Labour councils – although this is only 2,200 homes more than would be expected given Labour controls almost two-thirds of London councils.While the average Labour-run authority began 1,310 affordable homes per year, many Tory-led boroughs managed less than half this. In four years, Hillingdon built 558, Bromley 548, Westminster 423 and Richmond upon Thames 308.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

But the feisty feline navigated the long journey back to his original home in Raleigh, North Carolina, so that he could be with them again.Rather than welcoming him back, his original family took him to a local animal shelter and asked if he could be euthanised.The \u0027happiest cats in the world\u0027 might just be in MoroccoHowever, instead of putting him down, the shelter made a call to animal protection charity, Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA), who took him into their shelter to be rehomed.When Toby first arrived at their shelter he was “laid back and “people-friendly”, but not too keen on other cats, the charity\u0027s communications manager Tara Lyn told The Independent.He has now found a home with mum, Michele, and her children, the charity said separately earlier this week.  He also has two other cats around the house to keep him company and his family says they are “getting along well”.Ms Lyn described Toby’s story as “heart-breaking”, adding that they did not know all the details about what the family asked for him to be put down but he got a second chance.Toby was rejected by the family he walked 12 miles to be with (Jenny Winston Photography)Toby the cat settles into his temporary home at the SPCA shelter in Raleigh (SPCA)Toby is infected with feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), which means that his immune system is weakened, but this should not prevent him from living a long, otherwise healthy life as long as he has people around him who look out for signs of secondary symptoms, and take him for regular appointments with a vet.Toby with his new mum Michele (SPCA)“If people are moved by Toby’s story, we ask that they take action rather than just commenting on the story online,” Ms Lyn said. “Toby wouldn’t have the happy ending that he has now if we didn’t have volunteers, staff and the funding to do the work we do. We hope his story inspires people to make a donation, consider adopting from a shelter or becoming a volunteer. Or all three.”The creature seems to be adjusting to life with his new family pretty well, with his mum Michele telling the SPCA it is like “he’s always been here”.You can see lots of Toby pictures and keep up to date with his new family life on his Instagram pageEmail cannot be used.

But, it is still too soon to determine what went wrong, NTSB Chairman Robert Zumwalt said Wednesday.“I know people would want answers right away. We would do a very methodical investigation,” Mr Sumwalt told reporters. “Right now, we just want to document everything that we can.”The NTSB is looking into whether a crack on the inside of a fan blade could have caused the engine to fail. The crack, according to Mr Sumwalt, was “certanily not detectable from looking at it from the outside.”Investigators have determined that one of the cracks on the blade was consistent with metal fatigue, and that the blade itself had broken twice in total — nearly halfway through the piece, and again the blade was attached to the hub.Southwest Airlines has said that workers had performed a visual inspection of the engine that failed, and that an X-ray and ultrasonic inspection was scheduled for December. The X-ray and ultrasonic inspections help inspectors to see the cracks that are harder for the human eye to detect.Jennifer Riordan died after being partially sucked out of a shattered plane window following an engine explosion.Tammie Jo Shults, hero pilot of Southwest 1380, kept calm and saved her passengers.Marty Martinez, left, appears with other passengers after a jet engine blew out on the Southwest Airlines Boeing 737 plane.The window that was shattered after a jet engine of the Southwest Airlines airplane blew out at altitudeA National Transportation Safety Board investigator examines damage to the engine.The Southwest Airlines jet sits on the runway at Philadelphia International Airport after it was forced to land with an engine failure.Pennsylvania Game Commission employees recover a piece of the Southwest Airline engine covering that landed in Penn Township, Berks County.Tammie Jo Shults was hailed a hero by passengers.The window that was shattered.A National Transportation Safety Board investigator photographs a Southwest Airline engine covering that landed in Penn TownshipThe exploded engine of Southwest Airlines flight 1380 during the flight from a passenger\u0027s window.US Navy Lieutenant Tammie Jo Shults in front of a Navy FA-18A in 1992.Damage to the Southwest Airlines plane after Jennifer Riordan died when the jet blew an engine at 32,000ft.Emergency personnel monitor the damaged engine.The Federal Aviation Administration has said that it will issue a new directive to airlines that would require the more thorough inspections after a certain number of cycles, and that airlines will be asked to quickly perform the inspections on the type of engine that failed.The Southwest Airlines plane was forced to land in Philadelphia after the engine exploded at 32,000 feet, resulting in a loss of cabin pressure after pieces of shrapnel hit the cabin. One woman was pulled partway out of the plane before being pulled back in, but later died. Several others were injured, but not seriously.The pilot was able to put the plane down after 22 minutes of chaos in which passengers managed to take videos and pictures. Some of those show people with the overhead oxygen masks over their mouths. Other photos, from after landing, show the damaged engine.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

He said his act was inspired by a discussion he had at a conference that raised the issue of lower caste communities being denied entry to temples. He said he told students about a well-known legend in which a priest carried a Dalit devotee into a temple. When they expressed scepticism that a Hindu priest would do such a thing, he decided to do it himself.There is a lot of discrimination against Dalits but this stems from society, not from religious scriptures, Mr Aditya told the BBC. I hope others do the same - it doesn\u0027t mean everyone should literally carry a Dalit man on their shoulders. But they must welcome Dalits into temples and to participate in rituals, he added.Mr Rangarajan said other priests told him they would now do the same in their own temples . A Palestinian slings a shot by burning tires on the Israel-Gaza border, following a demonstration calling for the right to return.

The British people were very clear in the referendum.\u0026ldquoWe are leaving the European Union. Leaving the European Union also means taking back control of our borders and our trade.Mr Gove added: \u0026ldquoBeing able to sign our own free trade deals is a compelling and persuasive one.\u0026ldquoI know that when that case is put to the House of Commons it will rally Conservative MPs and others behind it.\u0026ldquoA case endorsed by 17.4 million people in the referendum and one the Government has pledged to honour.\u0026rdquoLabour\u0026rsquos Yvette Cooper and Tory Nicky Morgan have also now drafted a motion that urges Mrs May to include an \u0026ldquoeffective customs union\u0026rdquo in her Brexit negotiations.Senior Tories fear the latest reverse in the House of Lords could be the start of a series of defeats during the Lords Report Stage of the legislation, with a hardcore group of Remain-backing having tabled dozens more amendments.Analysis by the Change Britain pressure group has revealed that 10 fanatical Remain-backing peers have proposed a total of 338 amendments aimed at frustrating or even reversing the country\u0026rsquos departure from the EU.The research from the group, which wants a full break with Brussels, showed that Labour peer Lord Judd had tabled a massive 62 amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill, which is designed to transfer EU law into the UK to ensure a smooth Brexit process.Fellow Labour peer Lord Adonis had tabled 59 amendments while Lib Dem Lord Wallace of Tankerness was responsible for 49 of them.
