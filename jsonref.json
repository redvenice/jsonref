Michael Egan (pictured) was the first to come out with accusations of rape against Singer back in 2014  They made out once when he was 16 said the accuser, who also alleged that the pair had oral sex when he was 17 or 18 at one of Singer\u0027s parties.\u0027He would stick his hands down your pants without your consent,\u0027 he claimed.\u0027He was predatory in that he would ply people with alcohol and drugs and then have sex with them.\u0027  Eric, who also asked that his name be withheld, alleged that he was just 17 when he had sex with Singer - who was 31 years old at the time. He claimed that Singer was surrounded by two types of young men.\u0027If you weren\u0027t young and cute enough to be their boy, you could still ingratiate yourself by bringing boys to them,\u0027 he said of Singer and his cohorts.          Victor Valdovinos said he was just 13 years old when Singer molested him on the set of Apt Pupil. He was one of four men who spoke out against Singer in a new expose for The Atlantic Suspicions were first raised regarding Singer\u0027s treatment of child actors all the way back in 1997, when a 14-year-old extra from Apt Pupil alleged the director asked him and two other boys to film a nude shower scene. The teens alleged that they were filmed solely for sexual gratification. The lawsuit was eventually dismissed. In 2014, Michael Egan accused Singer of sexual assault.

Difference is beautiful - and together is beautiful too.\u0027 MICHELOB ULTRA  Michelob Ultra, which features Colombian singer Maluma, looked to the future to try and promote its light beer on Super Bowl Sunday. The ad imagines a world where robots walk among humans and, for the most part, outperform us. They are running faster than us on morning jogs, golfing better than us, and killing it at spin class. But when one robot passes by a bar, where friends are sharing a few pints together, one major flaw is revealed - they can\u0027t enjoy a beer. \u0027It\u0027s only worth it, if you can enjoy it,\u0027 the ad reads. And, looking to cash-in on the online phenomenon that has become ASMR videos, Michelob also aired a second ad featuring actress Zoe Kravtiz. As with the viral videos, the commercial features her talking in a hushed voice accompanied by delicate sounds that advocates say can produce \u0027brain orgasms\u0027.THE NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUEThe National Football League\u0027s Super Bowl commercial featuring past and current legends is winning near-unanimous applause.The two-minute ad, which was directed by acclaimed Hollywood filmmaker Peter Berg, includes cameos by a number of the game\u0027s greats, including Peyton Manning, Terry Bradshaw, Joe Montana, Jerry Rice, Deion Sanders, Jim Brown, Barry Sanders, and others.  The commercial featured more than 50 active and retired players. It was created to celebrate the NFL\u0027s centennial season, which begins later this year, according to The Hollywood Reporter. BURGER KINGBurger King may have won the contest for the edgiest and most original Super Bowl commercial idea on Sunday thanks to its ad featuring Andy Warhol chowing down on a Whopper.The fast food chain\u0027s 45-second spot features Warhol, the artist credited for spearheading the pop art movement of the 1960s, quietly feasting on a burger.Warhol doesn\u0027t make any noise except to briefly express frustration because the ketchup won\u0027t quickly emerge from the Heinz bottle.\u0027It doesn\u0027t come out,\u0027 Warhol says in the clip. PAMPERS   Adam Levine has joined John Legend and his wife Chrissy Teigen to remix Legend\u0027s Stinky Booty Duty song in a new Pampers Super Bowl commercial.The original Stinky Booty Duty song debuted last June, with Legend singing to his young daughter Luna while changing her diaper as other dads chimed in.The remix, dubbed Stinky Booty Duty 2.0, features Legend, 40, changing his eight-month-old son Miles\u0027 diaper, getting an assist from Luna and some vocal help from several other dads, including Maroon 5 frontman Adam Levine.When Legend takes off Miles\u0027 diaper, he says he\u0027s gonna need some \u0027back-up on this one,\u0027 as Luna peels off some Pampers wipes, before turning to a group of random dads who have their kids strapped to them in baby carriers. Apparently all these dads can hold a tune and harmonize as well, as they start singing the Stinky Booty Duty song, with a surprise appearance from Levine towards the end. HULU - HANDMAID\u0027S TALE  The streaming service pulled perhaps the best bait-and-switch of any Super Bowl ad by starting off their slot with star Elizabeth Moss looking hopefully out of a window as the opening lines of Ronald Reagan\u0027s \u0027Morning in America\u0027 speech are read.But things turn dark fast as scenes from the dystopian TV series are spliced over the top of the President\u0027s stirring speech, before Moss takes over for the last line, saying: \u0027Wake up, America. Morning\u0027s over.\u0027MICROSOFT Microsoft\u0027s tear-jerker of an ad showed off its specially-adapted gaming controller, which allows a disabled child to play video games with his friends.But there was a larger message at play: namely the things that technology can do for people, both in terms of making their lives easier and bringing them together.GOOGLE The tech giant aired two adverts during the game, the first of which focused on how its search engine can be used to put veterans back to work.The second ad promoted its Google Translate service and pointed out that although \u0027words can hurt and sometimes ide,\u0027 the most translated words in the world are \u0027How are you,\u0027 \u0027Thank you\u0027, and \u0027I love you.\u0027Kim Whitler, marketing professor at the University of Virginia, said the ad was an example of how the night\u0027s \u0027most powerful ads focused on unity, positivity and commonality.\u0027MINT MOBILE The wireless provider was trying to stand out from larger rivals Verizon, T-Mobile and Sprint. But the \u0027gross-out\u0027 route may not have been the way to do it.The ad compares Mint Mobile\u0027s $20-a-month wireless plan with \u0027chunky milk,\u0027 then it shows a fake ad with a family drinking the unappetizing beverage. A mint-colored cartoon fox says the milk is \u0027not right,\u0027 but Mint Mobile\u0027s plan \u0027is right.\u0027TURKISH AIRLINES Turkish Airlines created a trailer for a six-minute short directed by Ridley Scott, known for directing Apple\u0027s iconic 1984 ad. It was the storied director\u0027s first return to the Super Bowl in decades. But some viewers took to Twitter to express confusion over what exactly the ad was trying to promote.CBS - TWILIGHT  ZONEAnother highly-convincing bait-and-switch advert, it appeared to show the game had restarted in Atlanta before cutting to an empty stadium with Jordan Peele standing in the middle.\u0027Witness an empty space, filled with thousands of screaming people,\u0027 Peele says in calming Twilight Zone toned voice.He adds: \u0027A man both nowhere and everywhere at the same time,\u0027 as he sits in several different seats, and stands on the field, all at the same time.\u0027Answers are new questions,\u0027 he reads on to a shot of the familiar Twilight Zone spiral tunnel. \u0027The unthinkable is the expected.\u0027He concludes with: \u0027When truth is not the truth, what dimensions are you even in?\u0027TURBOTAX The sinister nature of artificial intelligence featured heavily in Super Bowl ads, perhaps exemplified best by Turbotax\u0027s robo-child who yearns to do taxes.SIMPLISAFE Simplisafe also produced a fear-laden advert for its Super Bowl slot, playing on anxieties ranging from the news, to other humans and AI once again.The message: Simplisafe can protect you from everything nasty in the world outside, which happens to be everything in the world outside. SPRINTSprint\u0027s robots were some of the few to feature in Super Bowl ads without sinister overtones, helping to come up with a bizarre concept for a commercial that features Bo Jackson, holding a mermaid, playing a keytar, next to a bird-horse.Instead, Bo suggests they should just keep it simple by pointing out that Sprint can save people a lot of money when it comes to their phones.PRINGLES Pringles also went down the AI route, with two men stacking up the chips in different flavor combinations before wondering aloud how many combinations there are.A smart microphone then pipes up from the corner to answer the question, before going off on a tangent about how she will never taste any of them. She says: \u0027I have no hands to stack with, no mouth to taste with, no soul to feel with, I am at the mercy of a cruel and uncaring...\u0027 \u0027Cool, play Funky Town,\u0027 one of the men cuts in.WIX.COM Relying on star power to get their message across, website building service Wix brought in Karlie Kloss for their slot.The commercial shows the model updating her website with new photos while connecting to the likes of Google to make sure her site can be found by browsers.WASHINGTON POST Despite researching showing the Super Bowl viewers feel the game is a bad place to make a political point, the Washington Post went in hard with their ad, entitled \u0027knowing keeps us free\u0027.Narrated by Tom Hanks, it recaps moments in American history that were encapsulated by news coverage, before recapping three prominent journalists killed while reporting - including the Post\u0027s own Jamal Khashoggi.It ends with the mantra: \u0027Knowing empowers us. Knowing helps us decide. Knowing keeps us free.\u0027AVOCADOS FROM MEXICO One of the more bizarre adverts to grace screens on Sunday night - it featured humans competing in a dog show for a prize of avocados.A contestant was showing rolling over - his 401k - while another woman ended up wearing a cone of shame after breaking ranks and running towards a table covered in guacamole.VERIZON Verizon chose to honor first responders in its Super Bowl advert, which also featured LA Chargers coach Anthony Lynn.Lynn recounts how he was badly injured in a 2005 car crash to a group of emergency workers, saying: \u0027I promise you I wouldn\u0027t be here today if it wasn\u0027t for the first responders.\u0027Then, in a tear-jerker moment, members of the crowd step forward to reveal they helped to save his life.T-MOBILE T-Mobile spent big on the Super Bowl, airing one advert per quarter, though none of them were especially memorable.Instead, the network used the expensive slots to announce a series of giveaways for customers, including free Lyft rides and free Taco Bell.AVENGERS: ENDGAMEMarvel Studios debuted a new 60-second trailer for the highly-anticipated Avengers: Endgame during the Super Bowl LIII telecast.The highly-anticipated superhero adventure will bring Phase Three of the Marvel Cinematic Universe to a close, and is set in the aftermath of the devastating events of 2018\u0027s Avengers: Infinity War.COLGATE Luke Wilson made a celebrity cameo for this advert where he plays a \u0027close talker\u0027 - harkening back to an old Seinfeld episode.Wilson is firmly of the opinion that - thanks to Colgate\u0027s cleaning power - there is no such thing as talking \u0027too close\u0027 to somebody.\u0027Yes, there is,\u0027 an irritated mail man informs him.CAPTAIN MARVEL Marvel Studios debuted a new 30-second trailer for Captain Marvel during Super Bowl LIII, which showcases how this movie will take the Marvel Cinematic Universe, \u0027higher, further, faster.\u0027Brie Larson stars as Carol Danvers, an Air Force pilot who, after a mysterious explosion with Kree technology, is imbued with incredible powers, which are on full display in the new trailer.WONDER PARKParamount\u0027s all-star animated film - based on a theme park ride - makes its pitch for Easter family movie in this trailer.Featuring the vocal talents of Kenan Thompson, Jennifer Garner, Mila Kunis, Matthew Broderick and John Oliver, it imagines what would happen if a child\u0027s dream theme park became a reality.WALMARTWalmart relied on an entirely different kind of star power for its ad, which featured famous vehicles instead of famous faces.Transformer\u0027s Bumblebee, Back to the Future\u0027s Delorean, and Ecto-1 from the original Ghostbusters are among a dozen vehicles to feature in the spot.RAM  Having been blasted for using a Martin Luther King speech to sell trucks back in 2018, this year sees RAM in a pensive mood - reflecting on the adverts of yesteryear.Two cowboys packing up their harnesses discuss what happened in all of the ads, though neither of them can remember what product they were selling.\u0027They just need to show you what they\u0027re selling,\u0027 one of them says, before climbing into his truck and starting the engine. MERCEDESAnother brand to air two spots during the game, Mercedes\u0027 first featured Ludacris who went to the Ron Clark Academy to surprise students.The surprises didn\u0027t stop there, however, as he handed out two tickets to the Super Bowl to two lucky pupils.The car brand\u0027s second slot features a man bending the world to his will using only the power of his voice - from finding cats to rescuing people trapped in an elevator, and giving away thousands of dollars.\u0027If only everything listened to you like a new A-Class,\u0027 the ad finishes.AMAZON PRIME - HANNAOriginally an oddball thriller film by Atonement director Joe Wright and starring Cate Blanchett, Amazon has taken the concept and turned it into a series.Fan will be able to watch the first episode online for 24 hours after the game ends. TOYOTA The car maker sets out to \u0027shatter perceptions\u0027 in this ad, featuring Toni Harris - the woman who wants to become the first to play in the NFL.Recapping Harris\u0027s incredible journey, including all the things she was told she could never be, Toyota says it has \u0027never been a fan of perceptions\u0027 before introducing its new RAV-4 Hybrid.HOBBS AND SHAW The latest trailer for the Fast and Furious spin-off which will feature Dwayne \u0027The Rock\u0027 Johnson and Jason Statham reprising their roles as lawman Luke Hobbs and lawless outcast Deckard Shaw. The pair face off against \u0027bad guy\u0027 Brixton - played by Idris Elba - who has gained control of an insidious bio-threat that could alter humanity forever.It is left to Hattie Shaw - Deckard\u0027s sister, played by Vanessa Kirby - to bring ther brother and his sworn enemy together to bring down Brixton. NETFLIX - OUR PLANET Having dominated the true crime market with  Making A Murderer, the streaming giant\u0027s latest foray into the world of documentaries sees them turn to nature.This looks set to be another winner, since Netflix has teamed up with veteran documentary-maker David Attenborough for the series.KIA When you cannot be known for who you are, you must make yourself know for what you do - at least according to the car company\u0027s Super Bowl advert.Honoring the \u0027great unknowns\u0027 in America, it uses its small-brand name to its advantage in this touching ad, which stands up alongside the likes of Mercedes and Toyota, who also aired commercials during the game.YELLOW TAIL Panned as one of the game\u0027s most boring adverts, the Yellow Tail spot featured fan-made videos which fit with its slogan \u0027tastes like happy\u0027.Explaining what he likes about the ad, Adrien Colon - director of a San Francisco-based marketing platform who features in the commercial in a bahama hat - said: \u0027The mood is right, and the tone is right. \u0027It\u0027s mixed with different emotions, and moments where I chuckle and smile. It\u0027s about joy, and we can all relate.\u0027DEVOUR FROZEN FOODS Created by the same ad firm behind the Budweiser and Burger King ads, this one features a couple suffering through the effects of \u0027food porn\u0027 addiction.While the man gets his fix of frozen foods however and whenever he can, his partner tries and fails to tempt him away with home-made delights - to no avail.Some found it funny, others found it gross - but the \u0027dirty\u0027 version is currently the second-most-watched of any Super Bowl commercial online, after Budweiser.AUDIA bizarre advert featuring a dream-scape in which a man is given Audi\u0027s new electric car by his presumably deceased grandfather, this had a lot of viewers scratching their heads.Of course, it turns out the vision is not real and conjured up as a man chokes on a cashew, before he is \u0027saved\u0027 by a co-worker and plunges back into reality.The car, however, is real - as is the fact that Audi is going electric, with a third of all models to be electric powered by 2025.SKITTLESAnother of the Super Bowl\u0027s odder moments saw Skittles create not just an advert, but a full-blown 30 minute musical - part of which aired during the game.Starring Dexter’s Michael C Hall, it shows him changing his mind about creating a musical after eating Skittles gives him the confidence to press ahead with the idea.BON \u0026amp VIV SELTZERFeaturing two mermaids named Bon and Viv, who inform the viewer about their seltzer spiked with alcohol, assuring them that \u0027the myth is real\u0027.In fact, the pair are actually talking to a row of literal sharks - referencing the show Shark Tank - which is revealed as the camera pans back.The predators then begin arguing over who\u0027s buying the product as the ad ends. "},{"url":null,"title":"Patriots Tom Brady seeks sixth Super Bowl title win Rams","story":"    While holding his daughter Vivian, Tom Brady shares a kiss with his wife Gisele Bundchen after the Super Bowl win   Tom Brady\u0027s daughter Vivian Lake gets her hands on the Patriots\u0027 sixth Lombardi Trophy (left) while Super Bowl MVP Julian Edelman celebrates the 13-3 Super Bowl LIII win over the Rams with his daughter Lily (right)           Brady hugs his mother Galynn after the Patriots\u0027 win.

Questions have persisted about whether Gronkowski might call it quits on a grueling career that has included significant injuries and multiple surgeries.\u0027It\u0027s really not about that tonight, it\u0027s about celebrating with my team tonight,\u0027 Gronkowski said in a postgame interview with NFL Network. \u0027I\u0027m going to take a few weeks, a week or two, see where I\u0027m at, make a decision from there. But tonight it\u0027s about celebrating with the team, celebrating with everyone. We were grinding, what, seven months since training camp, putting the work on. It paid off, and now it\u0027s time to celebrate.\u0027Gronkowski hauled in six catches for 87 yards in the Patriots\u0027 13-3 win over the Los Angeles Rams. His 29-yard catch in the fourth quarter helped to set up Sony Michel\u0027s 2-yard rushing touchdown, which put New England ahead for good.The nine-year veteran tight end credited Tom Brady with putting the ball in a perfect spot.\u0027On that play, we saw that there was a matchup right there,\u0027 Gronkowski said. \u0027There was a linebacker on me, and that\u0027s when I knew the ball was going to come to me. I knew Tom was going to throw it up there and (I could) just run up and make the play. It was a crucial play, and Sony just did the job finishing it off with a touchdown, which was awesome.\u0027Gronkowski was willing to clarify one question about his future: Yes, he planned to party Sunday night and beyond.\u0027Bill (Belichick) said he\u0027s partying tonight, and I ain\u0027t going to let him out-party me,\u0027 Gronkowski said with a grin.

They routinely sent an extra deep safety on third-and-short situations and disguised their blitzes up the middle. The latter benefited linebacker Dont\u0027a Hightower, who dropped Goff for a pair of sacks to stunt drives.New England finished with four sacks for the game.\u0027We\u0027re a relentless team,\u0027 linebacker Dont\u0027a Hightower said. \u0027We didn\u0027t give up. A lot was thrown at us. When we play like we did tonight, we can\u0027t be beat.\u0027 It added up to an abysmal performance by Los Angeles on third-down situations. The Rams were 0 for 6 on third down in the first half and 3 of 13 for game. New England also held Los Angeles to just 260 total yards. The Patriots defense deserves much of the credit for the close score after holding the Rams to just 78 first-half yards.The first half was certainly a departure from the regular season, when the Rams and Patriots ranked second and fifth, respectively, in offensive yards. On Sunday the two teams combined for nine punts on the first ten drives of the game. In fact, the Rams had never gone scoreless in a first half under coach Sean McVay until Sunday against the Patriots. Los Angeles actually entered halftime with only 78 yards, compared to 195 for New England.  Edelman had 93 receiving yards in the first half, outgaining the Rams\u0027 offense by himself. The six combined points were the fewest scored by two teams through the first three quarters of Super Bowl history.           Tom Brady was intercepted on the Patriots\u0027 opening drive in Super Bowl LIII           View of the Mercedes-Benz Stadium prior to the Super Bowl LIII between the New England Patriots and the Los Angeles Rams in Atlanta on Sunday The Rams appeared to be driving for a touchdown in the third quarter, when Patriots linebacker Dont\u0027a Hightower\u0027s sack of  Goff left Greg Zuerlein with a 53-yard field goal attempt, which he converted to tie the game.  Brady\u0027s pick was nearly caught by Patriots receiver Chris Hogan at the Rams\u0027 27-yard line, but the ball deflected into the waiting hands of Los Angeles linebacker Cory Littleton. The Patriots took a 3-0 lead in into halftime thanks to a 41-yard field goal by Stephen Gostkowski in the second quarter. He previously missed a 46-yard attempt in the first quarter, which was the first missed kick by any NFL kicker this season in Mercedes-Benz Stadium, the home of the Atlanta Falcons.            Adam Levine of Maroon 5 performs during the Pepsi Super Bowl LIII Halftime Show at Mercedes-Benz Stadium on February 3, 2019 in Atlanta, GeorgiaThe Patriots registered five first downs in the first quarter compared to just one for the Rams, but Brady and New England\u0027s offense still failed to score a point despite driving into Los Angeles territory on their first three possessions.   Brady also has a fumble in the first quarter, which was recovered by the Patriots. Besides Patriots fans, New Orleans Saints supporters also celebrated the outcome of Super Bowl LIII. The Saints seemed destined to beat the Rams in the NFC title game before a blown call ultimately led to Los Angeles\u0027 come-from-behind win.   With the teams tied 20-20 late in regulation, officials failed to call pass interference or helmet-to-helmet penalties on Rams cornerback Nickell Robey-Coleman for knocking Saints receiver Tommylee Lewis down as he awaited a pass. A flag would have allowed New Orleans a chance to run down the clock and kick a go-ahead field goals with about 25 seconds left in regulation.Instead the Rams tied the game in regulation and ultimately won in overtime. In response, fans filed lawsuits against the NFL in hopes of compelling a rematch, another purchased electronic billboard ads declaring the \u0027Saints got robbed,\u0027 Grammy winner and New Orleans native Harry Connick Jr. declared he will boycott this year\u0027s Super Bowl, and at least two politicians have entered the fray. The lawsuits were ultimately thrown out and NFL commissioner Roger Goodell admitted that overturning the Rams\u0027 win was never a consideration. New Orleans did get the last laugh in Monday\u0027s edition of the Times-Picayune, which featured a nearly-blank front page with the words: \u0027Super Bowl?

I\u0027m sure they will have the right professionals out there for that.\u0027The specialist search for the missing plane began off the coast of Guernsey yesterday morning and located the wreckage on the seabed just hours later.Sala and pilot Ibbotson left Nantes in France for Cardiff on January 21 -  after the star signed for the Welsh Premier League team, disappearing over the Channel.           The specialist FPV Morven ship, pictured in Guernsey, was being used in a privately funded search for the plane of missing footballer Emiliano Sala and pilot David Ibbotson          The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) Geo Ocean III moved in to assist the Morven when it discovered wreckage. Geo sent an ROV to visually identify the wreck on the seabed The official search was called off after four days but Sala\u0027s friends, family and fans clubbed together to pay for a private search to continue with renowned shipwreck hunter Mr Mearns.On Sunday morning, their efforts paid off.  Geo Ocean III left Ostend in Belgium at 9am and began combing the area. Within hours it was search vessel FPV Morven which picked up a sonar signal from the depths.The wreckage of the Piper Malibu was formally identified by officials from the Air Accident Investigation Board.The AAIB\u0027s vessel deployed a remote-controlled submarine to examine the plane and tonight confirmed it was the craft carrying the striker.Families of both men have been informed of the discovery. Sala\u0027s father said last night he had not had any contact with the rest of his family - who are still in a hotel in Nantes - and found out about the plane\u0027s discovery on TV.\u0027I communicated with them every day, but since I do not have Whatsapp it\u0027s hard to call them or call me. They told me that the days passed and there was no news of Emiliano or the plane,\u0027 said Horacio. He said that the family are in the hotel along with \u0027eight or nine\u0027 friends who are believed to have received the news from Argentine embassies in France and England, at 9am. Both the AAIB\u0027s Geo Ocean III vessel and a private boat, which includes a side-scan sonar, were used to try and find the aircraft. Teams from the AAIB have now moved into location at the site to recover the aircraft. The vessel that made the discovery was lead by marine scientist David Mearns, who confirmed the identity and location of the plane. He confirmed that it was in the early stages of this morning\u0027s search, around 9am,  the discovery was made. \u0027But tonight they have heard devastating news and in respect of the families I won\u0027t comment any further about what has happened.\u0027The recovery vessel picked up something on the sonar 24 miles off Guernsey and made further passes over the area to pinpoint the location before going through various stages of identification. David Mearns called the news \u0027devastating\u0027 but told Sky News that \u0027at least we were able to bring some sort of answer to the families.\u0027              A track of the FPV Morven shows it returning to shore after the wreckage was discovered           Mr Mearns told Sky News: \u0027This is about the best result we could have hoped for the families\u0027The discovery came just two days after cushions from a plane were found on a beach near Surtainville in Normandy, France, directly east of Guernsey where the plane disappeared from radar. Emiliano Sala and pilot David Ibbotson disappeared when their plane vanished as it passed near Alderney on 21 January during a flight from Nantes to Cardiff.The AAIB said its search was expected to last three days, while the private search will continue \u0027until the plane is located\u0027, reported the BBC.Parents make heartbreaking plea to find their daughter LibbyDemonstrators in Venezuela demand Maduro\u0027s resignationBrave mum fends off armed gang while holding baby in her armsVolunteers and police search for missing Libby SquireMP reacts to Nissan moving X-Trail production in JapanHector the lurcher who was rescued in 2017 is looking for a homeInterview with David Mearns who found Emiliano Sala\u0027s missing plane21 Savage\u0027s mum can be heard speaking with an English accentListen to 911 calls made after veteran shot himself on Facebook LiveAmazing moment crocodile and shark fight over a mealPolice release details in murder-suicide case streamed on FacebookA four mile square area, based on the flight path before the plane lost contact, was covered. The official search after the plane\u0027s disappearance was called off after three days as officials didn\u0027t believe there was much chance of anyone having survived. An online petition was then started which raised more than £300,000 to put on a privately-funded search using a specialist survey vessel. Cardiff City players wear t-shirts with Emiliano Sala\u0027s face...Marine scientist behind the hunt for Emiliano Sala\u0027s \u0027badly...Share this articleMore than 3,500 people had responded to the appeal for funds and the target was broken with the help of a £26,000 donation from French World Cup winner Kylian Mbappe.  The boat, operated by global marine cable installation firm A-2-Sea, is equipped with the latest technology.It includes a multi-beam echosounder and side-scan sonar, which can detect anomalies on the seabed.

When the government finally ordered it to do this two years ago it became clear why. The BBC’s case for keeping the licence fee is based on the assertion that it is a public service broadcaster, producing output which no commercial broadcaster would bother with.But in that case, why is it competing with the commercial sector by offering fat salaries? These were the highest-paid employees last year – and they don’t even include those employed on a freelance basis through ‘personal service’ companies.The BBC has also been accused of seeking to hide salaries through a commercial offshoot called BBC Studios. Claudia Winkleman, for example, was paid between £375,000 and £379,999 last year for her Radio 2 show but is thought to earn up to £120,000 more for her appearances on Strictly.Gary Lineker: £1.75 - £1.76mChris Evans: £1.66- £1.67mGraham Norton: £600K - £609KSteve Wright: £550K - £559KHuw Edwards: £520K - £529KJeremy Vine: £ 440K - £449KNicky Campbell: £410K - £419KAlan Shearer: £410K - £419KJohn Humphrys: £400K - £409KNick Grimshaw: £400K - £409KManagement fatcatsThe publication of presenters’ salaries has taken attention away from the high salaries of BBC executives – nine of whom earn more than twice Theresa May’s salary as Prime Minister:Tony Hall, Director-General- £450KAnne Bulford, Deputy Director General - £435KCharlotte Moore, Director, Content - £370KFrancesca Unsworth, Director News and Current Affairs - £340KGlyn Isherwood, Group Finance and Operations Director - £325KKen MacQuarrie, Director Nations and Regions - £325KJames Purnell, Director, Radio and Education - £315KValarie Hughes-D’Aeth Group HR Director - £310KMatthew Postgate Chief Technical and Product Officer - £310K          Director-General of the BBC Tony Hall. Nine BBC executives earn more than twice Theresa May’s salary as Prime MinisterOffice refurbishmentThe BBC has a programme, Cowboy Trap, which features the experiences of homeowners driven to distraction by rotten and overcharging builders. How ironic, then, that when the BBC struggles with its own building projects. In 2010 the National Audit Office was scathing about the project to refurbish and extend Broadcasting House in Central London. The project, ended up costing £1.05billion, which, taking into account the cost of delays, was £107million more than originally projected.The BBC admitted to ‘serious mistakes’ which had cost the licence fee-payer dearlyMove to SalfordThe name of the development in which the BBC’s new studios in Salford are based – MediaCityUK – speaks of an attempt to make Manchester the new broadcasting capital of Britain. But that isn’t how many of 850 staff relocated there saw it.          The name of the development in which the BBC’s new studios in Salford are based – MediaCityUK (pictured) – speaks of an attempt to make Manchester the new broadcasting capital of BritainThe BBC ended up bribing them with astonishing relocation payments. The staff were each paid relocation expenses averaging £28,000, while 11 were given payments of more than £100,000 and one was paid £150,000. In some cases staff were paid to rent a property in Greater Manchester and commute back to their homes in London.In a report in 2013 the Public Accounts Committee was scathing of the excessive level of the payments – and of the BBC’s decision to take out a ten-year lease on studios which technology might have made redundant well before then.Mark Byford Pay-offIs there any organisation which can fritter money so freely when it is trying to save it? Mark Byford, who was Deputy Director General between 2004 and 2011 was made redundant in a drive to save money by axing senior jobs.But his pay-off was as much as some people earn in their entire careers. He was paid a year’s salary of £474,500, another £474,500 ‘in lieu of notice’ – and even £73,000 for holidays he hadn’t taken since he took up the job. In all he received £949,000. In axing 150 posts the BBC managed to spend a total of £25million in exit packages.Local news websitesIn 2008 Ofcom had to stop the BBC spending £68million on expanding local news websites and ‘hyper-local’ news. The BBC couldn’t even see what was wrong in using licence fee-payers money on a project which would inevitably undermine local newspapers, which were already struggling thanks to declining advertising.EastEnders extravaganzaThe audience of the BBC’s soap has tumbled from 1987 heyday of 21.1million to an average of 6.68million in 2017. But that hasn’t stopped the BBC throwing money at a new set – which it says is needed in order to film the programme in high-definition. The new set, at Elstree in Hertfordshire, was supposed to cost £57million and be ready by 2018. But, according to a report by the National Audit Office last autumn, it will end up costing £86.7million – enough to build approximately 1000 new social housing homes – and won’t be ready until 2021.          According to a report by the National Audit Office last autumn, the new EastEnders set will end up costing £86.7millionAir faresThe BBC is constantly bleating that it will have to cut popular programmes if it is forced to make economies. A more efficient way of cutting costs would be to stop pay such extravagant sums for air travel.Last year, BBC accounts revealed, the BBC’s chief technical and product officer Matthew Postgate took a return flight to Miami for an extraordinary £6,880. The accounts don’t say which airline or class of ticket he had, but according to air discount website Skyscanner you could fly direct from Heathrow to Miami next Monday, returning on the Friday, for £749 with FinnAir. Two executives were flown to New York for over-the-odds fares exceeding £2,000 return. Does the BBC bother to shop around when flying its executives around the world?TaxisIt is a similar story with taxis. In the three years to 2014, a Freedom of Information request revealed, the BBC spent £34million on taxi fares. In 2014 alone it spent £12million – £24,401 of which was for cancelled bookings. As with air fares, the BBC doesn’t seem to be good at shopping around. According to an item in the BBC’s staff magazine, Ariel, in 2014 an employee used the BBC’s taxi booking system and was quoted £87 for a trip from Tonbridge to Gatwick Airport. He then rang around local firms and was quoted an average of just £45. Ironically, the BBC’s taxi-booking system came with the strapline ‘more money for programmes’ – claiming it was saving money rather than wasting it.GlastonburyIn 2017, the year Glasto turned into a political rally for Jeremy Corbyn, the BBC refused to say how many people it had sent, nor how much it had spent on coverage, but in 2009 it did admit to sending 415 staff to cover the event. It is hardly as if Glastonbury is a great national event watched by the masses like, say, the cup final. In 2016, for example, its peak audience was 1.8million for Lionel Ritchie’s performance.          In 2009 the BBC did admit to sending 415 staff to cover Glastonbury festival Digital Media ProjectIn 2008 the BBC started developing a new digital platform to help producers share and edit video – which according to former Director General Mark Thompson was ‘essential’ for the BBC’s move to Salford. Five years later it scrapped the whole project, after wasting £98 million – having realised it could use off-the-shelf technology for far less money. Mr Thompson’s successor, Tony Hall, admitted to ‘serious concerns’ at how the project was handled.   Storm as over 75s face losing perk - meaning 4.5million households could be forced to payThe BBC yesterday faced a storm over the future of free TV licences for the over-75s amid rising fears that they will be abolished altogether.The broadcaster is expected to strip millions of pensioners of the perk after it signed up to an ‘unaffordable’ deal with the Government to cover the cost itself.Yesterday, former BBC boss Greg Dyke urged the corporation to ‘bite the bullet’ and scrap the benefit for the vast majority of over-75s and only award it to the very poorest households.But Gordon Brown, the former prime minister, pleaded with the Corporation to keep the perk in place so it does not have to drag ‘frail, housebound, elderly’ pensioners to court.          Yesterday, former BBC boss Greg Dyke urged the corporation to ‘bite the bullet’ and scrap the benefit for the vast majority of over 75sHe also said the BBC should not have to foot the bill for a mistake by the Government.More than 4.46million homes with older residents get a free licence, saving them £150.50 a year.The BBC struck a deal with the Government in 2015 to shoulder the cost of the free licences, previously paid for by the Department for Work and Pensions.The total bill stood at £655million last year but is expected to spiral to more than £1billion by 2029 – around a fifth of the BBC’s current budget. In exchange for this sum, the BBC was allowed to raise the fee in line with inflation – and to close the so-called ‘iPlayer loophole’ and force viewers to have a licence even if they only watch the BBC on catch-up services.The Government also agreed that the BBC could do away with free TV licences for the over-75s or change the rules so that fewer pensioners are eligible.Well-placed sources have told the Daily Mail that the Government was ‘astonished’ that the BBC ever accepted their demands.The Treasury asked BBC bosses to sign up to the deal as an opening gambit in talks over renewing the Corporation’s charter, and had a list of alternative proposals up their sleeve if it was refused.They expected BBC director general Lord Tony Hall and the then-BBC Trust chairman Rona Fairhead to threaten to resign over the proposal. But the BBC surprised Treasury bosses by agreeing to take on the cost, sources said.Yesterday Mr Dyke, who was BBC director general from 2000 to 2004, said the broadcaster’s bosses had faced a ‘difficult’ decision but ‘brought trouble for themselves’ by agreeing to Government demands. He said: ‘They accepted a short-term fix and gave themselves a long-term problem. They also face a very difficult decision now. If I were them I would bite the bullet and get rid of it.’Mr Dyke added that society ‘cossets’ old people and that it is no longer true that they are ‘necessarily’ the poorest section of society.The BBC has launched a public consultation on free TV licences for the elderly. The consultation, which closes next week, also asks whether the BBC should raise the entitlement age from 75 to 80, or give the over-75s a 50 per cent discount, or means-test the benefit.Yesterday, Jo Stevens, a Labour member of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee, said it was ‘unaffordable’ for the BBC to keep the free licences in place and simply swallow the cost.‘This could be a fifth of the BBC’s budget – the equivalent to what is spent today on all of BBC Two, BBC Three, BBC Four, the BBC News Channel, CBBC and CBeebies,’ she said.Mr Brown said: ‘We have to ask whether, after 20 years of free licences, the BBC can justify taking a frail, housebound, elderly pensioner to court for not possessing a TV licence that for years she has had for free.’At the time of the agreement for the BBC to fund the over-75s licences, Lord Hall hailed it as a ‘strong deal’ that gave the Corporation ‘financial stability’.‘The Government’s decision here to put the cost of the over-75s on us has been more than matched by the deal coming back for the BBC,’ he said in 2015.Last night one of those who helped the BBC resist the Government’s proposal in 2010 said Lord Hall accepted the deal too easily.The source said: ‘They basically traded it for a cost-of-living increase in the licence fee and now they are having to live with the consequences of that.‘The BBC for a long time had bred a certain cockiness in its director generals, who if they were mere mortals would be a bit more cautious about what they agreed to sign up to.’BBC insiders said it was ‘rubbish’ that the Treasury had been surprised when Lord Hall accepted the deal. They also denied lobbying ministers to revisit the decision.A BBC spokesman said: ‘We have set out a range of options in our consultation – each has merits and consequences, with implications for the future of the BBC and for everyone, including older people.’"},{"url":null,"title":"Bake stars Mary Berry Prue Leith join Mails Great British Spring Clean campaign","story":"    Former star of The Great British Bake Off Mary Berry has urged citizens across the land to join in picking up litterTurning the tide on plastic and other litter helps protect animals and marine life from its horrific impact.

Pictured: Elizabeth , George VI and Coats Mission officersTo begin with, the security schemes were amateur to the point of farcical. King Haakon of Norway, staying at Buckingham Palace at the beginning of World War II, asked King George VI what would happen if Germans parachuted into the palace grounds.The king’s lofty response was to walk over to his desk and press an alarm bell. Nothing happened. After a long wait, an equerry was sent to find out why no one had come to their rescue. He returned with news that the policeman on duty had told the palace guard he hadn’t heard from anybody thereabouts of any pending attack, so it was probably best to ignore His Majesty’s summons.Eventually, to George’s chagrin, a few soldiers turned out ‘and proceeded to thrash the undergrowth in the manner of beaters at a shoot, rather than men engaged in the pursuit of a dangerous enemy’.This ramshackle defence system was soon replaced by a do-or-die enterprise called The Coats Mission. Led by Coldstream Guards officer Jimmy Coats, whose sister-in-law Audrey had been the King’s mistress before his marriage, this was a posse of aristocratic officers who agreed among themselves that they would go down fighting rather than let our Royal Family ever be captured.    The King and Queen inspect the damage done to Buckingham Palace when a time bomb, dropped by a German raider, went off inside the grounds in September 1940.          During the Cold War there were plans to whisk royals away to safe houses including Madresfield Court (pictured)Their plan was that, in the event of invasion, they would whisk the family away, the King and Queen in one armoured Daimler limousine, Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret in another. They would all meet again at one of several country houses a long way from London.There was more than a touch of Boy’s Own Paper derring-do attached to the ambitions of the Mission, whose vow was ‘to the last man, to the last bullet’. In training, they set themselves a number of near-impossible objectives — one, bizarrely, being to kidnap the film actress Merle Oberon. It failed.On another occasion, they decided to capture a serving general who had planned to attend Ascot races. ‘This involved setting up an ambush at a level-crossing near Windsor,’ runs one account. ‘The soldiers, hidden in gardens and houses beside the railway track, attacked under cover of a heavy smokescreen. Unfortunately the smoke got in the general’s lungs and he emerged from his car coughing and spluttering — but still capable of saying in uncompromising language what he thought of their failed plot.’          King George VI  and the Queen Mother taking part in rifle shooting with the crew of HMS Vanguard, during the royal family\u0027s trip to South Africa, on  February 17 1947.  Looking on are Princess Elizabeth (far left) and and Princess Margaret  (right)      Why were these troubled soldiers sent to \u0027isolated\u0027 base...\u0027Cinderella\u0027 schoolgirl Amber Peat, 13, who ran away from...Share this articleBack at Windsor Castle, the Coats Mission assisted in hiding the Crown Jewels, buried in a biscuit tin for the duration of the war in an underground chamber near the castle walls.The Coats Mission was disbanded in 1942 as the risk of German invasion receded but — just in case — Winston Churchill authorised the purchase of a castle in Canada to which the Royal Family could be dispatched if things hotted up again.Hatley Castle, on Vancouver Island, is a 40-bedroom mock-Tudor mansion built in the early 1900s.

In Britain, part of the nation’s preparations included the top-secret Operation Candid.With the Soviet Union pointing hundreds of nuclear warheads at Britain, the Government’s solution, should it escalate further, was to put the Queen, Prince Philip and other royals aboard the Royal Yacht Britannia and sail them off into the Scottish lochs.This plan also provided an alternative strategy for keeping the royals on land, protected by a heavy-duty 1,300-strong Royal Duties Force consisting of a regiment of Foot Guards, Household Cavalry armoured cars, a medical unit, communications vehicles and other logistical support. The force was designed to be split in four, so as to disperse key members of the Royal Family to different locations. The safe houses included those envisaged by the original Coats Mission 20 years before — Madresfield Court, the home of Earl Beauchamp, near Malvern Pitchford Hall, on the Shropshire borders and Newby Hall, in North Yorkshire.    After plans were made to whisk royals away in event of invasion during World War Two, Queen Elizabeth (pictured), later told the Queen Mother, when asked about leaving Britain: ‘The children won’t go without me. I won’t leave without the King — and the King will never leave. ’Queen Elizabeth II arriving at King\u0027s Lynn railway station Royal visit to Sandringham, Norfolk in December          Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Andrew, Princess Anne  and the Duke of Edinburgh, as they set sail from Southampton, in the Royal Yacht Britannia for Aberdeen in 1970. Plans were made to whisk the family away on the yacht to Scotland if things escalated during WW2The focus would be on the Queen and Prince Philip, and the plan was to include the Home Secretary travelling with them wherever they went, so that if the government of the day were ousted or assassinated, this triumvirate could convene a Privy Council to appoint the next government.Operation Candid was renamed Operation Synchronise in 1965, and in 1968 this was absorbed into PYTHON — the strategy to relocate the whole government, in case of emergency, to the central war headquarters at Corsham in Wiltshire.Under this plan, the Queen and Philip would move to nearby Corsham Court, a grand Elizabethan manor house with gardens designed by Capability Brown, that is currently the home of Lord Methuen.As I am free these days to name Corsham Court, it’s fair to assume the plan has moved on since then — and that, somewhere deep in the English countryside, another stately home owner is rubbing his hands at the prospect of a national emergency — and a money-spinning royal house guest. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2019/02/05/01/082C41BB000003E8-0-image-a-25_1549331036798.jpg","title":"Twenty Labour MPs five Tories form new centrist group Liberal Democrat leader claims","story":"    Twenty Labour MPs and up to five Tories are ready to quit their parties and sit as a centrist group alongside the Liberal Democrats, Sir Vince Cable (pictured) claimed yesterday          The Lib-Dem leader said a group of Labour MPs opposed to Jeremy Corbyn (pictured) planned to resign the party whip and sit as independents by the springProof that Corbyn hates the EU: Video shows the Labour...From overpaid staff and outrageous expenses to vanity...Bake Off stars Mary Berry and Prue Leith join The Mail\u0027s...Share this articleHe said: ‘If things play out in a certain way it might become a big bandwagon that even more people jump on.’ It came as HM Revenue and Customs announced that most EU goods will be waved through UK ports to avoid delays under a No Deal Brexit.

It’s almost overwhelmingHere is the camera that took a bullet instead of its owner. The military helmet and the light meter, passports and compass, all in a vitrine. Here is the American soldier, traumatised, staring back. Here are the villagers, displaced. Here are the living and here are the dead. Here are things I prefer not to describe.There are too many photographs in Don McCullin’s retrospective at Tate Britain. Room after room, on grey wall after grey wall, they keep on coming. These framed, mostly black and white images are a journey through the world and through the photographer’s life. Now 83, McCullin is a man who has seen too much and borne witness to too much. The too many and the too much are part of the point of this engrossing and demanding exhibition.“Yo lo vi” – I saw it – wrote Goya, beside an image of people fleeing before advancing French troops, in one of the prints in his Disasters of War suite of etchings, made around 200 years ago. “And this as well,” he wrote, beside the subsequent image. Goya’s declarations might not always tell the literal truth of what he saw with his own eyes, but no such doubts accompany McCullin’s photographs. He was there, as the Berlin Wall went up, on the streets of Limassol during the Cyprus civil war, in the Bogside and in Stanleyville, Biafra and Vietnam. He was there with the lone gunman, crouching alert on the floor of the wrecked lobby of the Holiday Inn in Beirut. He was there with the corpse of the Congolese man, his brains shot out beside his bicycle.He was also there when the woman, the very picture of a middle-class housewife, smiled back at his camera, as she was bundled away by the police at a Ban the Bomb protest at Aldermaston in the early 1960s. He also saw the homeless men asleep while standing, hands in pockets, heads lowered like horses, in Whitechapel in 1970. Disaster is so often close to home, in squalid rooms in Bradford, on East End doorsteps, in Toxteth and in Wigan.There are so many great and terrible images here. I snatch at fragments – the kid in the Finsbury park youth club, the gawping blokes with their beers in the stripper pub, the big northern woman queuing with a shiny new shovel in her hand, like the latest accessory. Small consolations and momentary pleasures, along with death and starvation, misery and fear, remind us of a different everyday. Fishermen kick a football about on a Scarborough beach, the sky about to open on a moment of sun. The metal mirror of a Somerset dew pond, round as a plate. A knobbly knees contest in Southend-on-Sea. Then we are back, staring at collapsed staircases, like exposed entrails, spilling from a bombed apartment block in Homs, Syria, and with a man dying of Aids in Zimbabwe.In these unrelenting scenes of trespass and tragedy we are left facing our own voyeurism, an increasing inability to process the mounting horrors. McCullin revisits his own work over and over again, as he prints and reprints his images in his darkroom, repeatedly trying to tease the best from his negatives. His returns to these images cannot be entirely healthy. Unless, that is, they inoculate him against their unconscionable power, both as images and as memories. The words “negatives” and “processing” have rarely felt so freighted.Many of McCullin’s photographs demand a long, strong look. Others we might want to swerve away from almost at the moment of recognition, only needing to see them once. They are already fixed in the developing fluid of the subconscious. Many of us of a certain age will have first encountered McCullin’s photographs by chance through the 1960s and 70s, in the Observer, in the Sunday Times Magazine. Many have been stirring around in my head for most of my life, irreducible and unforgettable.McCullin’s images bought the Vietnam war, starvation in Biafra, civil wars, post-colonial and nearer-to-home sectarian conflicts in Derry and Belfast, into our houses and into our heads in a way that television coverage never could.Sometimes McCullin had to walk away. Sometimes I had to walk away from certain images, too. After a few rooms, I had to take a break from the grieving and the corpses, the starving and the terrified. Our hunger for images may be insatiable, but it becomes hard to concentrate and to give each image, taken at who knows what cost, its due.There is a visceral quality to McCullin’s photographs, in their analogue tonalities, the depth of their blacks and greys, the clarities and dimming of their whites, their strong and weak light, their focus, their attendance on the unconscionable. His insistence on black and white seems to lend his photographs an extra veracity, a sullen, stark truthfulness, stripped of any glamour. McCullin did more than record, even though the situations in which he frequently found himself necessitated instantaneous responses, before the mind with its mortal fear and terror, disgust, moral outrage and doubt, empathy, self-justification, self hate, all the qualms, had a chance to kick in. Photography, he has said, chose him. The exhilaration of danger and the sound of gunfire found him, as much as he sought it out over his long career. Conflict was always round the corner for McCullin, even growing up in low-ceilinged rooms and poverty in Finsbury Park. Down the road, a man shepherds a flock to an abattoir through a grim north London dawn.Where the homeless stood around reeking fires of rubbish in Spitalfields market half a century ago, they sleep in corporate doorways now. The wars continue. There is no end to the poverty, nor to the atrocities. Looking away is not an option."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79a3c31f85912197679da1b76072b1613a6a3936/0_168_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c79d0b5489bfe9dcc618c015e21f5fa","title":"people of the whale a portrait of traditional hunting in alaska","story":"Photojournalist Kiliii Yuyan documents the Iñupiaq and their successful conservation practices using indigenous knowledgePeople of the Whale is the story of an Iñupiaq whaling crew, living where the vast plain of ice meets the waters of the Arctic Ocean. For the last 2,000 years, the Iñupiaq have stood on the edge of the sea ice, waiting for the migration of bowhead whales.Out on the sea ice, the Iñupiaq wait for the whale. When a whale passes near the edge of the ice, the experienced crew paddles over Arctic waters in an umiaq, or skinboat, to catch it. The ice hides its dangers – desperate polar bears hunting humans, massive icequakes when sheets of ice collide.Bowhead whaling is a cultural cornerstone of Iñupiaq identity and a primary source of food on Alaska’s North Slope, where the cost of living is nearly three times that of the lower 48 US states.In this part of Alaska, the government allows co-management of wildlife with Native communities.In 1977, the Alaskan Iñupiaq won the right to maintain their traditional hunt of bowhead whales and manage the population. By 2011, the Iñupiaq had quadrupled the population of the bowhead, while hunting them for subsistence. The story of the Iñupiaq is a vision of successful conservation using indigenous knowledge.I spent four years living on the Arctic sea ice with the Iñupiaq, sharing the watch for polar bears and eating fermented walrus.

He gazes lovingly at his balls, which in this particular case are a row of stainless steel spheres suitably blown up to bear an astonishing resemblance to his most famous artistic muse: inflatable rubber toys. But given that Koons shot to notoriety with his 1991 series Made in Heaven – in which he photographed himself and his then girlfriend Ilona Staller in pretty much every sexual position legal in the state of New York – this ball chat really could have gone another way.Koons, who looks like Pee Wee Herman and talks like Mister Rogers, is taking me around his 10,000 square foot studio in Chelsea, New York. And if you think that sounds big, wait until you hear about his house: he, his wife Justine and their six children (Koons also has two older children from previous relationships) are about to move into their new fixer-upper, which is almost an entire block on the Upper East Side. Koons bought two mega mansions for a total of $35m and spent almost another $5m knocking them together.“It must be nice to not only be an artist but to be your own Medici,” one of his disgruntled neighbours huffed to the New York Post, and after spending an afternoon with the man himself I can confirm that it does seem very nice indeed. While Koons strolls around in a quietly chic outfit of dark blue patterned shirt and blue trousers, young people in white coats skitter around doing what looks to me like most of the work: painting, sculpting, blowtorching.“Maybe I’m not on each piece labouring over it,” he says, “but I’m overseeing each one tremendously.” Without help, he explains, he “would be able to make only one sculpture every few years. It’s about the gesture, that’s where the art is. It’s being able to work with people and to articulate ideas the same way you articulate your fingers.”Koons, until very recently the world’s most expensive living artist, has the calm, unruffled air that, in New York, is generally only found in the heavily medicated. But in him, it seems more like the zen of a man who has all but the licence to print money. His works sell for multimillions. Art collector Peter Brant bought one of my favourite pieces by Koons – Puppy, a 40ft west highland terrier made out of flowers – and spends $75,000 a year just maintaining it. “Koons,” read one recent, and typical, critical assessment, “has made his name manufacturing toys for rich old boys.”Of course, Koons hates this kind of chat. “The rest of the world talks so much about money,” he says, “and one of the reasons is I think they feel uncomfortable talking about art. So if they’re writing about art, and they don’t really want to talk about art, then they talk about money – and it’s like, ‘Whew! I didn’t have to talk about art!’” To which it’s tempting to respond: “Sure, Jeff, but it’s kinda hard to see the art when it has a $58m price tag hanging off its neck.”This was Koons’s Balloon Dog (Orange) which in 2013 fetched what was then the highest price ever paid for a work by a living artist. But the day after our interview, David Hockney’s Portrait of an Artist (Pool With Two Figures) was sold for $90m and Koons lost his title. Still, who cares about money? Koons’s claim to think only about higher things would, however, be a little more credible if he didn’t literally pink with excitement when we talk about the recent sale of the Edward Hopper painting Chop Suey: “Ninety-one million dollars! Wow!”We’re meeting because Koons is preparing for his first big show in the UK since his 2009 exhibition at the Serpentine in London. I loved that show, with its re-creations of giant inflatable toys made from stainless steel and ludicrous Popeye paintings. (“Art for people with short attention s,” Adrian Searle wrote in the . Hi!) But was it fun? No question – and it’s even more fun seeing those pieces and many more closeup in his studio.His famous inflatable pieces are so realistic that when I reach out to squeeze what looks like a blowup plastic seal and find myself touching cold hard steel instead, the sensory confusion makes me burst out laughing. Scattered through the maze-like rooms in the studio are re-creations of his giant “porcelain” figures, also made from stainless steel. One, an especially kitschy image of two deer rubbing their noses together, looks like the kind of thing a little girl would pick out for herself in an airport giftshop in the 1980s, because that’s exactly what it is. “I had that figurine when I was a child!” I say in astonishment.Koons nods, as if he expected as much. “That’s what I’m going for, that sense of familiarity, and you are open to it. The reason I work with readymades” – meaning already existing objects – “is to remove judgment and hierarchy. Every object is a metaphor for yourself.” In what way? “I try to make work to make you think everything is perfect in itself. It’s all a metaphor.”What this response may lack in explanation, it more than makes up for in brilliant deflection – and if there’s one thing Koons is genuinely great at, it’s deflecting criticism. In early 2018, he announced that he was giving one of his sculptures – Bouquet of Tulips, which depicts a giant hand grasping some 38ft-high balloon flowers – to Paris as “a symbol of remembrance, optimism and healing” after the terrorist attacks in 2015. Alas, the city proved less than enthusiastic and high-profile Parisians, including film-maker Olivier Assayas, wrote a spectacularly vicious open letter criticising the “inappropriateness” of the gift.“While he may have been brilliant and inventive in the 1980s,” they wrote, “Koons has since become the emblem of an industrial, spectacular and speculative art … Koons’s studio and dealers are hyper-luxury multinationals, and offering them such prominent visibility and recognition amounts to publicity or product placement.” This controversy roared on until October when a compromise was reached: the work will be installed in front of the Petit Palais, instead of the originally planned and much more prominent position by the Palais de Tokyo.Surely this saga must have irked Koons? He makes a small smile that seems less like an expression of amusement and more like the donning of armour. “I remember back in 1985, I made a show called Equilibrium. A review came out and it looked at it in not such a positive light. I was really surprised because my intentions were so good. I think I learned early on that people just take positions without knowing everything, and these things can gain a momentum. I always believe, if people really open themselves up and just look at my work, they’ll realise the reason behind it and what my motivations are.”In other words, if you don’t like Koons’s work, the problem is you, not him. The new show will be at the Ashmolean in Oxford, and it’s all thanks to some Oxford students who voted him their favourite contemporary artist. Koons came to give a talk, one thing led to another, and now he’s on display at the world’s oldest university museum. Like Damien Hirst and Takashi Murakami, it is often said that Koons’s art is best experienced in person – to get a sense of its genuine spectacle, although I’m not sure I’d recommend asking Koons about this.“I hope people who view the exhibition feel a sense of wow, but realise that wow is about their own being, and what gives them that wow is their own potential in the areas they’re most interested in, not in the areas I’m interested in.” Despite Koons’s emphasis on accessibility in his work –what he calls “removal of hierarchy” – it often feels like you need either a PhD or a lobotomy to understand his explanations.Koons was born and raised in Pennsylvania, the son of a furniture dealer and interior designer. This was such a happy time that he bought the 650-acre farm owned by his grandfather, and he and his family go there every weekend. “My childhood was wonderful,” he says and that’s that. Despite his claims of openness, Koons is strikingly opaque about subjects he considers irrelevant to his art. In the 2014 book Jeff Koons: Conversations with Norman Rosenthal, the artist is asked if he likes movies. “I think the form of narrative that I’m involved with in my own art I find more interesting,” he replies.After studying art and working briefly as a commodities broker to make money, he came to prominence in New York in the 1980s. “Let’s see, I did the Pre-New, the New, Equilibrium, Banality,” he says, ticking off his art series. “Then what came after that? Oh yes, Made in Heaven.” This began when Koons saw a photo of Staller, a porn star and Italian politician, in a magazine and set out to meet her. “I enjoyed very much that she was standing there without any pants on,” he later recalled.He photographed them having sex and gave the works names such as Jeff Eating Ilona and said he was taking away sexual shame. Alas, he couldn’t take away sexual prurience so, while people queued round the block to see it, the art world cringed in embarrassment. When Staller moved to Italy with their son, Ludwig, leading to a long custody battle, Koons destroyed many of the works. Did he, despite his intention with this series, feel ashamed of the photos?“Not at all! I’m still very, very proud of those works, but I was in a custody situation for my son and my ex-wife, Ilona, was saying that what I made was pornographic. So I decided that the works I could control I’d destroy, to help my chances of gaining custody.”A lot of people destroy photos of themselves with their ex. Is it not weird to look at pictures of you having actual sex with someone you split from so acrimoniously? “No, I look at it as art,” he says. Does Ludwig look at it that way? “I think my son understands what my motivations are,” he says, the shutters coming down.Did he ever meet Donald Trump, I ask, given they were in similarly monied circles in New York in the 80s? “I met Trump superficially a bunch of times and our children went to the same school. But I never knew him.” Shutters down.Koons met his wife, Justine, when she worked in his studio. Surely it must be hard for them to keep their equilibrium with their six kids running around, even if they do live in a house the size of a multiplex? “Oh no, I love the freedom!” he says, with the smile of a man who has a serious amount of childcare.Our time is up and as I get up to leave, he suddenly leans over and speaks urgently. “Can I ask you something? I’d prefer it if you don’t go into the political stuff,” he says.And it’s at this point that I finally lose faith with Koons. I can enjoy an artist who works with banal ceramics, plastic pool toys, or even quasi porn. But one who prioritises his carefully cultivated blank image over engaging with the reality around him so as to maintain his elite everyman appeal? What’s the point of art anyway? Sorry, Jeff, I don’t buy it. Mind you, I couldn’t afford it anyway.• The Jeff Koons exhibition is at the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, 7 February-9 June."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac0c57dbd7f2f196bf225e3d301d5289b3201684/0_447_2485_1490/master/2485.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ef9a0bf890fbb4c4722ef9a48025200","title":"australias national photographic portrait prize finalists 2019 in pictures","story":"Forty finalists have been selected out of 3,113 entries for Australia’s most prestigious photographic portrait prize.

Thomas Stretzer, who died in 1738, was the then-anonymous author of A New Description of Merryland, credited in a 1741 edition to one Roger Pheuquewell. In it, the author describes his “instrument” as “of a large radius … inferior to none”, writing of how “to say truth, the nature of the Soyl is very strange, so that if a man do but take a piece of it in his hand, twill cause (as it were) an immediate Delirium, and make a man fall flat upon his face upon the ground, where if he have not a care, he may chance to lose a limb, swallowed up in a whirl-pit”.Together with an 18th-century directory of sex workers in the Covent Garden area of London, and the violent erotic works of the Marquis de Sade, the Merryland books are among the 2,500 volumes in the British Library’s Private Case collection. The volumes have now been digitised, and are being made available online by the publisher Gale as part of its Archives of Sexuality and Gender academic research resource.“There was essentially a series of cupboards in the keeper’s room from the 1850s, where material that was deemed to be unsuitable was kept locked away – usually because of its obscene nature, so pretty much anything to do with sex,” said Maddy Smith, curator of printed collections. “It was added to throughout the 19th century, and this carried on until around 1960, when attitudes to sexuality were changing.”The collection dates back to 1658, with the book Rare Verities: the Cabinet of Venus Unlocked and Her Secrets Laid Open – the double entendre very much intended, according to Smith. It also features 40 copies of John Cleland’s 18th-century novel Fanny Hill or Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure, which is considered to be the first pornographic novel written in the English language an account of the sexual exploits of a gentleman named Walter in Victorian England, My Secret Life and Memoirs of Dolly Morton, an 1899 novel about the erotic adventures of a Quaker woman in the American south before the civil war.Teleny or The Reverse of the Medal, which is part of the collection, tells of the tragic relationship between a young Frenchman and a Hungarian pianist. Authorship of the novel has been attributed to Oscar Wilde and members of his circle in the late 19th century. “Nowadays we are more used to erotica, and fiction in general, including gay characters and storylines, but in the past this was pretty shocking,” said Smith. “Teleny is one of the earliest works of male gay erotic fiction in English and it was particularly shocking at the time.”Harris’s Lists of Covent-Garden Ladies, meanwhile, is an 18th-century pocketbook directory of female sex workers in London that arranges its entries by name and address – “Miss Sp–nc–r, No 35, Newman Street” – and also includes information about the women’s physical attributes: Miss Sp—nc—r “is never so good a companion as when a little enlivened with the juice of the grape”.Of a Miss Fr–m, from Berwick Street, it advises “she is now about nineteen, of a fair complexion, with blue eyes … tall and elegantly made, with well-formed projecting bubbies, that will, without being obliged to stays, keep their original ground”. Her “parts below”, it adds, “are very conveniently adapted to any size”.“All of these works are pretty much written by men, for men. It’s to be expected, but looking back, that’s what is shocking, how male-dominated it is, the lack of female agency,” said Smith.The Private Case collection has been accessible to the public through the British Library’s rare books collection since the 1960s, but the digitisation project with Gale means the titles will now be available to a much wider audience, by subscription to libraries and higher education institutions, or for free at the library’s reading rooms in London and Yorkshire. “It’s the final push to making them completely accessible,” said Smith.Adrian Edwards, head of printed heritage at the library, said the collection “offers extraordinary insights into many facets of human sexuality over at least three centuries … By digitising this collection … we hope to make this collection visible and available as never before.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a971a5b456b0138bc8d4315602a7c4837e55c4f6/203_480_5033_3021/master/5033.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bf266af7aaf076c32656309b84e73366","title":"north east england nissan eu membership japanese carmaker","story":"The sprawling site near Sunderland of the giant Japanese car manufacturer Nissan is a fine-tuned product of Britain’s participation in the European Union.

Even on Sunday, when Nissan itself explained that Brexit uncertainty was a factor in its decision to build the new SUV in Japan, airtime was still given to Brexit campaigners denying this. Prominent among them, predictably, was Jacob Rees-Mogg, a backbench Conservative MP with no discernible car industry expertise or experience, whose Somerset constituency could hardly be further away from the north-east.The alarm has been sounded before and since the referendum by Labour MPs in Sunderland, whose constituents work at a plant that has grown to employ almost 8,000 people and 30,000 more in the supply chain. Sharon Hodgson, the MP for Washington and Sunderland West, remembers the rush of optimism when Nissan arrived in the 80s, bringing hope to a region of closing mines and stalled shipbuilding. She is still trying to inform her leave-voting constituents about why Brexit chucks a ner in the works.Bridget Phillipson, the MP for neighbouring Houghton and Sunderland South, has argued that it is a dereliction of duty for Labour to acquiesce to Brexit knowing the economic damage it entails. After the weekend’s dire news from Nissan, she called again for a people’s vote with the option to stay in the EU.Phillipson has lamented the gaps in public knowledge about the advantages conferred by EU membership, among remainers as well as leavers. But this is a blind spot with a long history. In fact, a prime example of a failure to inform the public, and instead mislead with propaganda, was a speech made by Margaret Thatcher when she opened the Nissan plant in 1986.Thatcher had lobbied the Japanese government and industry since the 70s to set up in Britain attracting their investment became a crucial component of her vision of Britain’s future, as she closed the old heavy industries down. Britain’s membership of the EEC was central to her sales pitch to the Japanese. The UK was presented as a convenient and agreeable base for the companies’ European operations. Nissan saw the business case for that, as have 1,000 other Japanese companies and other carmakers now using the UK as their European base.You will search in vain for a single word in the then prime minister’s speech that acknowledges that truth, however. She concealed the facts with a familiar comfort blanket – Britain’s supposed superiority to its European neighbours, which still echoes through the Brexit debate three decades on. Nissan’s decision, she said, was “confirmation … that within the whole of Europe, the United Kingdom was the most attractive country – politically and economically – for large-scale investment”.We can only speculate about how much more embedded public knowledge of the EU’s benefits would be today if she and other leading politicians had explained rather than obfuscated if the basics had been taught in schools and reported honestly in the media. Attitudes might be very different if the EU flag had flown outside the Washington factory – and other sites of regeneration that owed their existence and success to Britain’s membership, and to substantial EU grants and loans over the years. Instead, the public has remained largely uninformed about the economic advantages of the EU and its “frictionless” single market, for which Thatcher herself pushed so hard. Theresa May has engaged in similarly evasive public rhetoric since becoming the second Conservative female prime minister. In a speech made before the referendum, in which she backed remain, May said, “the economic arguments are clear”, and: “A lot of people will invest here in the UK because it is the UK in Europe.”To argue that the British public did not understand EU membership when fatefully asked to pronounce on it in a referendum is not to dismiss people as stupid. It is to recognise a decades-long failure of education and honest information, from the moment major companies such as Nissan came to Britain up to the point when, with their warnings about Brexit ignored, they began to withdraw.• David Conn writes for the  about sport, Brexit and other issues"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a1708c11b626446358b0ea5fe59c04e6aef662d/0_357_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03854c58eb70f40e8b1a4ab3fba47dad","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of pleasure","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘pleasure’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘pleasure’.Share your photos of what pleasure means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 6 February at 10am.

The former park superintendent Curt Sauer made headlines when he said it could take “300 years” for the park to recover.A visit to the park this week found a sense of normality returning. Rangers are back, and outward signs of destruction were few. But subtle signs of trouble were easy to spot with a trained eye: Peck points out dog prints. Tire tracks off the established roads. Fresh graffiti on a second-world-war-era water drum.The park service reports that people drove between 10 and 24 miles off-road over the fragile desert soil, and built 108 illegal fire rings. Someone drove into a Joshua tree and knocked it down at a campground. Many people posted photos on Instagram of themselves climbing, hugging or decorating Joshua trees.Three hundred years may seem like a long time, but the balance of a desert ecosystem sits on a razor edge. Dogs pose a threat to protected bighorn sheep, says Peck, and while Joshua trees look hearty, they actually have shallow root systems that depend on a delicate brew of micro-organisms – a mix of fungi, algae and bacteria – that can take centuries to repair.“Desert soils are a very strange beast,” says Sabra Purdy, a longtime Joshua Tree resident and park guide. “When sand gets pulverized by a vehicle, you’re not only running over vegetation, but you are damaging the ability of the soil to regenerate.”On the trails, a hiker approached a ranger to ask, “Where’s the damage?” and was pleased to hear that most of it had already been cleaned up.“We’re really happy to be back at work,” said the ranger, who asked not to be named because he hadn’t been authorized to talk to the media. “It was just getting depressing as the shutdown dragged on.”Peck says he saw a lot of people taking advantage of the park being understaffed during the shutdown. Instead of hundreds of rangers educating and helping people, there were only a handful of law enforcement personnel. As he guided visitors up hiking trails, he saw people hiking on trails with their dogs, flying drones, parking anywhere and even bringing speakers on hikes with them – all banned activities that would usually be stopped by a ranger at trailheads.Purdy, meanwhile, says she saw people parking up to five cars at campsites that allowed only two cars, and saw evidence of people creating their own campsites, using Joshua trees and other materials to build fires.“During the shutdown, people were giving themselves more leeway to get flexible with their morals,” Peck explains. “People should treat the park as a living museum: look but don’t touch, and definitely don’t take anything.”Of all the problems, off-road driving did the most damage to the 800,000-acre park, says Andrew Munoz, a supervisory public affairs officer with the National Park Service. “In desert park environments, a single tire track can break through the fragile microbiotic crust and cause significant scarring and damage,” he says. “While it is unlikely the effects will last for as long as 300 years, the damage is long term.” For example, the tracks left by Gen George Patton on the desert training grounds in 1942 are still visible in the park today.The park service has already started remediating the track impacts, by raking them out, ideally when the soil is moist. The recovery process can be accelerated by mixing chunks of cryptobiotic crust and mixing it in with the affected soil. Munoz says resource managers at Joshua Tree have used this process to deal with approximately 20 miles of vehicle tracks in the park so far.The park has become something of a poster child for shutdown damage, but experts say the events have raised awareness of the burden that a shutdown places on the park system as a whole. “In part, awareness of a shutdown’s impact on parks is heightened because parks are perceived as relatively immune to partisanship,” says Michelle Sullivan Govani, a doctoral candidate at Arizona State University who studies national parks. “America’s public lands are often upheld as shining trophies of democracy at work.”“Even if we disagree about how to use them or manage them, the public generally agrees that parks should exist and be open to all,” she adds. “So it stands out when parks get dragged into a nasty political battle that results in their degradation.”Local volunteers were vital in keeping the park in order while federal workers were furloughed. On Christmas Eve, with the shutdown in full swing, Purdy and her husband purchased $150 worth of toilet paper and cleaning supplies and headed into the park. Over the following weeks they joined others – sometimes up to 60 people at a time – to clean and sweep bathrooms, restock toilet paper and haul out trash.As the community and the park continue to recover, there’s one thing everyone agrees on: the looming possibility of another shutdown should be avoided at all costs. John Lauretig, the executive director of the not-for-profit group Friend of Joshua Tree, was part of the cleanup efforts and says he is fearful about what might happen if parties in Washington can’t work together. “If there’s another shutdown, I don’t think we are going back,” he says. “We would support closing the park.”“Shutdowns are terrible for natural resources, for people whose livelihoods are dependent on these places, and worst of all, they accomplish nothing,” says Purdy. “We are no closer to having a solution on our southern border. All of that chaos and fear – it accomplished nothing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/209a9f4a391a5b83d2641dcee944ad8e81f0677e/435_132_3069_1840/master/3069.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2531e6296964b19f25e70ead1817c390","title":"how we made goldeneye james bond pierce brosnan xenia onatopp 007","story":"A tank flattened a camera, M called him a sexist dinosaur and his fights with Onatopp were so rough they needed a padded cell … the Irish actor recalls his 007 debutThe first film I saw when I came to London as a boy was Goldfinger, which starred Sean Connery as 007. In Ireland, I had been brought up on a diet of Old Mother Riley and Norman Wisdom, so it was a bedazzling moment, seeing this lady covered in gold paint. I ended up getting a toy car with an ejector seat, but I didn’t have any aspirations to be James Bond. The character who really captured my imagination was Oddjob, Goldfinger’s bowler-hatted henchman.I was originally offered the role of 007 for The Living Daylights. I’d done all the photos with the iconic gun pose and my late wife and I were about to toast our new life with a bottle of Cristal when my agent called and said: “It’s fallen through.” It was because I couldn’t get out of Remington Steele. The role went to Timothy Dalton instead but, by the mid-90s, the franchise had been dormant for six years because of a rights dispute. I heard rumblings that the part was available, but ignored them because I didn’t want to put myself back in that emotional vortex. Then I met the producers Cubby and Barbara Broccoli and, a week later, they called and said: “You’re in.”The sceptics were out in full: the world felt there was no need for another James Bond. So the challenge was enormous. I didn’t want to get caught between what Sean and Roger had done. Yet, at the end of the day, my take was a little bit of what both had brought to the role. I leant towards Sean’s style, but I couldn’t deny Roger because GoldenEye was in the tongue-in-cheek style people had become used to.It was a demanding role, physically and emotionally. I did a lot of wirework and fight sequences. They created a padded cell for the fight in the bathhouse with Xenia Onatopp (Famke Janssen), so we could go at it pretty hard. The most arduous fight was the one with Sean Bean, on the ladder over the giant radio telescope at the end. He and I spent six weeks constructing the sequence, working on it during our lunch breaks and at the end of the day with a stunt coordinator. But carrying myself as Bond was as much a mental as a physical thing. You have to hold the stage. You go in to win, full tilt to the finish line.GoldenEye’s success was a great relief. I was prepared for the attention. Once you have that brand, you’re stamped as a Bond. It was a great irony playing a British cultural icon as an Irishman. I had a quiet chuckle to myself.It’s exciting breaking in a new Bond. I did Daniel Craig’s first one, too. You’ve got something to work with. The producers had been checking other people out just in case. I think they may have looked at Mel Gibson and Ralph Fiennes. But it was obvious Pierce was the right person. You couldn’t get a better-looking Bond. Put him in a tuxedo and it’s game over, mate.It was budgeted at $55m, which is ludicrously little by today’s standards. I think United Artists had doubts about how the audience would respond after the big gap since the last film. The press had been asking if Bond was still relevant. We decided we had to address this, so we introduced Judi Dench as M, and had her call him a sexist, misogynist dinosaur. The girls, too, were very independent – in the past, they always hung on to Bond’s coat-tails. I loved Famke Janssen’s orgasmic thigh-crushing as Xenia Onatopp.With Bond, we used to say: “What’s never been done before action-wise?” It’s quite difficult after 16 films. GoldenEye’s bungee jump off a dam at the start was my idea. We used the Contra dam in Switzerland, which is bloody terrifying. There was no digital manipulation: the stuntman Wayne Michaels just did the 700ft jump. As they were doing the countdown, he saw the guy on the crane crossing himself. He did it perfectly the first time. I guess he didn’t want to do a second.We were getting very tight on budget by the time we got to the tank chase through the streets of St Petersburg, so we built replica streets in the studios at Leavesden. We had three or four Soviet battle tanks, T-55s, the proverbial unstoppable force. You just let the bloody thing go and it knocks anything down. One crashed through a wall, ran over a Panavision camera and flattened it. A couple of companies turned us down for the bit where it smashes through a drinks truck. Perrier ended up getting a good ad out of it. GoldenEye was probably the first Bond film to really cash in on product placement.I turned down Pierce’s subsequent Bond films. There’s always a madman taking over the world and a control room that has to be blown up. The producers felt the last of the Brosnan Bond films, Die Another Day, had got too fantastical, with the invisible car and the ice palace. They decided there had to be a complete rethink. That’s how Casino Royale came about."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/068a081901d564ccda6d4bd613f09bf8224322ad/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bef73e85b44d233e7ab185c4aff1eb9d","title":"oscars 2019 presenters whoopi goldberg awkwafina daniel craig jennifer lopez","story":"Whoopi Goldberg, Awkwafina, Jennifer Lopez and Daniel Craig will be among those presenting this month’s awardsThe Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Science has announced the first round of Oscars presenters, following accusations that it pressured actors to avoid presenting at other awards ceremonies before the ceremony later this month.The first list of presenters includes the Crazy Rich Asians stars Awkwafina and Constance Wu, former Golden Globes hosts Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, best actress winners Brie Larson and Charlize Theron, as well as Daniel Craig, Chris Evans, Whoopi Goldberg, Jennifer Lopez, Maya Rudolph, Amandla Stenberg and Tessa Thompson.The Oscars will presumably rely more heavily on presenters this year, as the show is without a host for the first time in 30 years after the Academy’s pick, Kevin Hart, became embroiled in controversy due to past homophobic tweets. (Hart initially recused himself from hosting, then seemed open to returning, with Ellen DeGeneres’s blessing, on her daytime talkshow he ultimately declared himself “over it” and ruled hosting out.)The lack of host has put more pressure on securing high-profile presenters – pressure that has allegedly translated into intimidation for actors to not appear at other awards ceremonies in the run-up to the Oscars.In a statement last month, the Screen Actors Guild union, Sag-Aftra, claimed that an “extraordinary and unwarranted pressure” was being placed on their members to appear on stage at the Oscars without previously presenting at the Sag awards.“We have received multiple reports of these activities and have experienced firsthand the Academy’s graceless pressure tactics and attempts to control the awards show talent pipeline,” the statement read.“This self-serving intimidation of SAG-AFTRA members is meant to limit their opportunities to be seen and honor the work of their fellow artists throughout the season,” the statement continued. “Actors should be free to accept any offer to participate in industry celebrations. The apparent attempt by the Academy to keep our members from presenting on their own awards show is utterly outrageous and unacceptable.”The Academy also announced on Monday that Gustavo Dudamel and the LA Philharmonic will perform during the In Memoriam segment. The announcement followed rumors that the Academy would cut the telecast to only two live performances of nominees for best song, prompting the Mary Poppins Returns songwriter and performer Lin-Manuel Miranda to tweet his disappointment.The Academy then confirmed on Saturday that at least four of the nominees will perform: Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga with Shallow from A Star Is Born, Jennifer Hudson with I’ll Fight from RBG, and Gillian Welch and David Rawlings with When a Cowboy Trades His Spurs for Wings from The Ballad of Buster Scruggs. A “special surprise guest” will perform The Place Where Lost Things Go from Mary Poppins Returns. The only song not yet confirmed is Black Panther’s All the Stars, by Kendrick Lamar and SZA.The absurdist historical farce The Favourite is tied for the most Oscar nominations this year – 10 – with Alfonso Cuarón’s autobiographical Roma, which could become the first foreign language film to win best picture. A Star Is Born is close behind with eight nominations.The Oscars will air on 24 February at the Dolby Theater in Hollywood."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/031079c32ab0548656496a7cb65037c19723ab28/502_108_3158_1896/master/3158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=349101966560281ca2411ef639af24d2","title":"black sheep guardian film nominated for best short documentary oscar","story":"Ed Perkins’ film about a young black boy’s response to a racist gang after he moves out of London is up for an Academy awardBlack Sheep, a film commissioned by the , has been nominated for best short documentary at the 2019 Oscars.Directed by Ed Perkins, Black Sheep tells the story of Cornelius Walker, a black 11-year-old from London who moves with his family to a housing estate in Essex after the murder of schoolboy Damilola Taylor in 2000. Walker, the same age as Taylor and of similar background, found himself confronting a gang of local racists and, after first fighting back, went to extraordinary lengths to fit in and gain their friendship.The film features interviews with Walker looking back 15 years on from the events he describes, which are re-enacted in the locations where they took place, with Kai Francis Lewis playing Walker.Responding to the nomination, Walker said that he was, “humbled and proud. I worked on this film to tell my story and hoped that it would resonate with people. To be nominated for this award is the highest recognition.”The film was produced by Simon Chinn and Jonathan Chinn of Lightbox (collaborator on the Whitney Houston documentary Whitney).

For, although they can be cultivated perennially, this is their true season in the eastern hemisphere. And it couldn’t be better timing, nature summoning the brightest, most playful and irreducible fruit for the darkest, coldest days.This is the point where I usually insert a story about living in the land where the lemons grow, but I have done that for the last two years in this column. Also, I’ve just reread the lemon chapter in Jane Grigson’s Fruit Book where she quotes Goethe – “Do you know that country, where the lemon trees flower” – and refers to it as the best but also most hackneyed poem, which in turn made me feel hackneyed. Her description of drinking a cold lemon spremuta is spot on: how the crystals of sugar collect at the bottom of the glass, how lemon-ish it is, and acidic, so much so that it makes your throat a bit sore for a while. It is the same with glycerin, lemon and honey, a mum’s cure for sore throats that exacerbates before it soothes and you fall asleep with sticky lemon lips and slightly numb tonsils.In February, lemons, abundant and good, become the main ingredient, in throat-tickling, lip cut-stinging lemonade (which I have always thought of as a winter drink) and in marmalade, glossy curd, fierce pickles, moons preserved under an avalanche of coarse salt (not that I have ever done this), the heart of a Margaret Costa lemon surprise pudding – the baked pud with surprise pool of lemon curd at the bottom – one of the very best recipes from one of the very best books (Four Seasons Cookery Book), and the essence of Fabrizia Lanza’s Sicilian pudding. And, while baking a butter rubbed chicken with a lemon stuffed inside has no season, it seems particularly appropriate at this time of year, the rich, lemon scented (italians say aspro) gravy waiting for boiled potatoes or wilted greens.There is also risotto al limone, which, like salt toothpaste and lemon halves on elbows, didn’t appeal when I first spotted it by way of Anna del Conte, who was given the recipe by Romana Bosco, who was taught it by Giovanna Gloria – recipe credits rather like the accumulative game of When I Went Shopping.It was a question from a reader that prompted me to try a risotto with lemon as its star.Risotto, a (hopefully) harmonious fusion of starchy rice, butter, stock and cheese, is, by its very nature, rich and creamy, the addition of mascarponerobiola (my choice) or cream (Del Conte also suggests an egg yolk) making it even more so, which is why the lemon is so important and beautiful. The effect is twofold: the zest, with its essential oil, acts as an almost hot perfume, while the juice gives acidity, a blithe spirit up against the richness – which is, in turn, edible defence against these February days with their grey sky afternoons and interminable evenings.60g butter2 tbsp olive oil2 shallots, peeled and finely chopped1 stick celery, finely choppedSalt and black pepper350g risotto rice (arborio or canaroli)100ml dry white wine or 50ml dry vermouth1-1.25 litres light chicken or vegetable stock, simmering1 large unwaxed lemon (zest and juice)75g mascarpone or robiola60g parmesan, gratedIn a large, heavy-based frying pan or enamel-based cast iron casserole, warm half the butter and all the oil over a medium-low flame then gently fry stew the onion and celery along with a pinch of salt until soft and translucent - this will take about seven minutes. Add the rice and stir until each grain glistens – you want them to become partly translucent and to smell slightly toasty.In another pan on the back of the stove, keep the stock at a simmer.Raise the flame, add the wine or vermouth and let it bubble and evaporate for a minute. Start to add the stock, ladle by ladle, stirring continuously while everything bubbles at a lively pace, allowing each ladleful to be absorbed by the rice before adding the next. Add the lemon zest after 10 minutes. Continue until the rice is tender but with a slight nutty bite, and the risotto is soft and rippling. This can take anything from 17 - 25 minutes depending on the rice you are using: keep tasting.Pull the pan from the heat and, using a wooden spoon, firmly beat the remaining butter, mascarpone, parmesan, two tablespoons of lemon juice and a generous grind of black pepper into the rice. Cover the pan and leave to rest for one minute. Beat again and serve."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1646d72299d50732e58b0d084be9206a9ea219c3/52_0_3820_2292/master/3820.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fab96dc7a12f8503369a937dd2025e7a","title":"west ham united liverpool premier league match report","story":"The door is starting to creak open for Manchester City. Liverpool, with the weight of history threatening to pin them down, found their title charge losing further momentum on an evening of suffocating tension. Even the gift of an offside goal was not enough to extinguish the nerves choking the Premier League’s pacesetters, heightening the impression that Jurgen Klopp’s red machine is finally showing signs of wear and tear.This was the second successive game Liverpool were gripped by stage fright, with their anxiety captured by the moment when Divock Origi fluffed a glorious opportunity to steal the points with the final kick of a fraught contest. Time stood still when Naby Keïta’s lofted pass fooled West Ham’s stubborn back four and the stage seemed set for Origi, on as a late substitute, to repeat the stoppage-time heroics that won the Merseyside derby two months ago.The striker’s weak effort went straight at Lukasz Fabianski and means Liverpool’s lead over City stands at three points, presenting the champions with an opportunity to go top when they visit Everton on Wednesday night.City can smell blood in the water. Once again Liverpool failed to master mid-table opposition, following up last week’s home draw against Leicester with another laboured display, and they were fortunate to leave east London with a point.West Ham, bright and inventive in possession, were entitled to feel that they deserved to win. It spoke volumes that Manuel Pellegrini expressed disappointment at the draw.West Ham defended with impressive organisation, made the clearer chances and were aggrieved with the officials for failing to spot that James Milner was at least a yard offside during the move that culminated in Sadio Mané putting Liverpool in front midway through the first half.Evidence of City’s silky swagger returning during their win over Arsenal on Sunday had raised the stakes before Liverpool’s latest assignment and there were hints that the visitors were feeling the pressure during a difficult opening period. West Ham flew forward from the first whistle, with Felipe Anderson eager to test out Milner’s nous at right-back, and the hosts looked more than capable of coping without the injured Marko Arnautovic leading their attack.Although West Ham are drifting in mid-table and out of the FA Cup after a dismal defeat by AFC Wimbledon, they played with the handbrake off. Javier Hernández stung Alisson from long range and the little Mexican ought to have scored after twisting past Virgil van Dijk in the third minute, only to bend his shot inches wide.After a while Liverpool found some poise, remembering perhaps that they had scored 16 goals in their previous four meetings with West Ham. Making his fourth league start of the season, Adam Lallana created the danger with a lovely pass into space down the right. West Ham appealed in vain for a flag as the ball reached Milner. He crossed for Mané, who spun Issa Diop and fired past Fabianski.How the travelling fans roared, sensing lift-off. Yet there have been signs of vulnerability from Liverpool’s defence in recent weeks and West Ham reeled them in with a clever free-kick routine in the 28th minute. With their opponents waiting for a cross, Anderson and Robert Snodgrass combined to release Michail Antonio, who held off Keïta before leaving Alisson rooted to the spot with a firm shot.Liverpool suffered without the leadership of Jordan Henderson and energy of Georginio Wijnaldum in midfield, where Keïta struggled to assert himself against Declan Rice and Mark Noble, and West Ham should have led at the break. Another free-kick from Anderson deserved a sharper finish from Rice, who was aghast to put his free header over.These are the occasions when elite players prove their class. The contest had become a test of Liverpool’s mettle and they needed more from Mohamed Salah in the second half, but the Egyptian found it tough to shake off Cresswell, West Ham’s diligent left-back. Instead it was Anderson who was threatening, always demanding the ball, always willing to run at defenders, luring Joël Matip into a clumsy foul with a piece of skill that left the centre-back looking dizzy.Liverpool started to rush their passes. Team-mates glared at each other after snatched decisions in the final third. With the minutes ticking away and emotions rising, hope flared when Salah wriggled through on the right and made to shape one of those trademark curling shots into the far corner, but it was too close to Fabianski. It was beginning to feel like one of those nights.Klopp argued that injuries have disrupted Liverpool’s rhythm, pointing out that Milner had missed four days of training with a virus. Van Dijk also looked leggy in central defence and Trent Alexander-Arnold’s return from a knee injury cannot come soon enough. Liverpool need the right-back’s youthful enterprise and quality deliveries.They had run out of ideas long before the end. West Ham protected Fabianski’s goal with impressive organisation, with Rice so perceptive in his screening role, and they went closest to forcing a second goal, Noble’s volley flying narrowly over.When it was over Klopp held an agitated conversation with Pellegrini on the touchline. There was no doubt which manager was feeling more relaxed about life."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/100152fad5825a4a03b49371aa5c61314088c6f3/0_225_5059_3035/master/5059.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc0e94eff54d04b11e2ff8316e9a9ea4","title":"notts county intimate pictures new low","story":"The world’s oldest professional football club are used to hard times but their present dire situation on and off the pitch has reached a new lowWhen the wind was coming from the wrong direction, the most salient feature of a visit to Notts County in the old days was the smell drifting down from the abattoir further up Meadow Lane. Last week the stench was coming from inside the club itself. From the chairman’s office, in fact. To add insult to the injury of sitting plumb last in the fourth tier, the world’s oldest professional football club was in the hands of a man who, during the course of a spat on Twitter, pressed “send” on a photograph of his genitals. Inadvertently, of course, but still.To his credit, you might think, Alan Hardy turned up to face the music at Saturday’s home match against Lincoln, local rivals and League Two leaders. What confronted him was a sight possibly not witnessed before at a league ground: the winter sun glinting off a forest of inflatable giant pink penises waved from among the 4,285 visiting supporters in the Jimmy Sirrel Stand.I counted 10. Others claim there were more. They came and went, as it were, during the course of the match. A first-minute penalty to the home side, successfully converted by the veteran Jon Stead, certainly caused a rapid detumescence.Almost as remarkable was the conduct of the 6,356 home fans. Notts have looked doomed all season, through two managerial sackings – first Kevin Nolan, then Harry Kewell – and 16 defeats. A club that came into existence in 1862 is now threatened with ejection from the league it helped to found in 1888. “We have never been so low on so many fronts,” someone who has known the club well for several decades told me. And that, in the case of Notts, is saying something.Hours after revealing his private parts to the world, Hardy had put the club up for sale, claiming it was getting in the way of his other business interests. One of their more famous supporters, the actress Vicky McClure, tweeted: “My 93-year-old grandad has been a NCFC fan since he was 4 and it’s embarrassing.” At the match, however, there were no overt signs of protest.If you know anything about Notts County, you will be aware their supporters are characterised by a special stoicism. The shadow of a more celebrated club across the Trent and several narrow escapes from extinction have bred not rage but a wonderfully downbeat fatalism that seems truer to the city’s nature than the dreams of their neighbours’ fans.The playwright and TV dramatist William Ivory first watched Notts as a child, when his father, the news editor of the local evening paper, allowed him to sit alongside their reporter in the press box. “Forest always had a bit too much swagger for me,” he says. “Notts knocked you down to size.”When I asked him his happiest memories as a supporter, he mentioned the period under Neil Warnock, who took them back into the top tier with a Wembley play-off win in 1991. To my surprise he also talked about the time, almost 10 years ago, when the promise of money that turned out not to exist brought Sven-Göran Eriksson, Kasper Schmeichel and – for one match – Sol Campbell to Meadow Lane. “We got sucked into that,” he said, as if it had been fun.But then he talked about the quintessential Notts experience of watching a match against Swansea in the old Third Division, when fog rolled in off the river to obscure half the pitch. “We were shouting to the fans on the other side: ‘What’s going on?’ Eventually it was abandoned. As we were walking back home, my mate said: ‘I enjoyed that.’”When the author John Harvey made his jazz-loving Nottingham detective Charlie Resnick a County fan, “it only seemed right that he would plump for the underdogs”. Harvey was at the match on Saturday and has supported the club since the 1970s, when he lived and taught in the city he is a season-ticket holder even though he lives back in London, where he was born. Notts, he says, “still has the feeling of being a traditional working‑class club – you see the kind of people who’ve been going for generations. There’s a friendliness mixed with that gallows humour”.After reaching last year’s play-offs, Notts have fallen away on and off the field. Hardy, who paid £5m (£1.5m of it in unpaid tax) to take over the club two years ago and has since put in another £5m, acquired a reputation for high-handedness after disbanding the women’s team, sacking several employees after internal tribunals and losing some of the directors he had brought in, including Darren Fletcher, the BT Sport commentator, and Edward Peck, the vice-chancellor of Nottingham Trent University. His asking price is said to be £7m, and as things stand whoever buys it will have to be prepared to lose another £3m a season.Last week, in an attempt to preserve the club’s appeal to potential purchasers by keeping them out of the Vanarama National League, Hardy sanctioned eight signings, most on loan. Seven of the newcomers went straight into Neil Ardley’s starting XI on Saturday, their enthusiasm overcoming inevitable misunderstandings in a 1-1 draw with the ision’s best team.It’s 21 years since Notts became the first club to have played 4,000 Football League matches. Were they to survive, the 5,000th would come up early next season. As the setting sun cast a golden glow over the neat little stadium, it was almost possible to share John Harvey’s faith in a characteristic of the club’s fans: “a doggedness that suggests things might turn out all right, however bad they may look.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b20a8e9dc84d2f711e0c266bfb5a417e58bca814/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ce4610d439e3ab5a2773e67ce59b843","title":"10 of the best bluetooth headphones","story":"Whether you’re embarking on a Fortnite marathon, running an actual marathon or just want some tuneful isolation on your commute, there’s a set of Bluetooth headphones that’ll do the jobThe minute Apple ditched the traditional headphone jack from its phones, the future of Bluetooth headphones was pretty much sealed.

These may seem trivial compared with more significant hurdles (moving house, losing a job or the death of a parent), but research shows that how a couple manages these smaller stresses massively affects how they cope with bigger ones. Notice how you are feeling – overburdened? neglected? – and, rather than store these feelings up, talk to your partner about it. If you’re on the receiving end, listen, ask questions, and try to understand the other person’s perspective. Being understood helps the “sufferer” feel less alone, and a couple feel more intimate. Couples I work with as a therapist, even those in long-term relationships, are often surprised at how the other person is feeling.”Share the load: Remember, major stress can affect both parties: if one person loses a job, for example, the other may feel added pressure or mourn their partner’s loss of status. It can help to think of relationship strains as a “we” problem – “how can we tackle this?” – rather than one inidual shouldering the burden alone. Partners sometimes block each other from attempting change, taking the role of “gatekeeper” and believing it’s safer to do things “their way”. For the tired parent who complains about doing bathtime, what might they miss without that reconnection with the children at the end of the day? Or can the partner who resents doing the weekly shop tolerate groceries they wouldn’t choose? A couple needs to arrive at a “good enough” solution that meets both their needs.Communicate: Difficulties often start with a breakdown in communication. Partners in distress stop sharing their thoughts, their minds swamped by hurts and fears that build up in shared lives. Don’t suffer alone: you need to talk. Confronting things can lead to a renewed sense of closeness and a lessening of stress confrontation doesn’t have to mean raised voices and a loss of control. Do it with a spirit of curiosity – not at 11.30pm after a few glasses of wine, or to “out” who you think has got it wrong – and you’ll discover that your relationship can be a tremendous resource against day-to-day difficulties.Kate Thompson is a couple psychoanalytic psychotherapist and clinical lecturer at Tavistock RelationshipsDon’t be a martyr: Ask for help. If you’re feeling genuinely overwhelmed, speak to your manager about solutions that might alleviate your stress, whether that means removing a project from your workload or getting more support from your colleagues.Prioritise: Take a long hard look at your to-do list – is there anything you can do to make it more manageable? Be ruthless in figuring out what you can delay, delegate, or skip altogether.Break it up: An eight-hour (or longer) working day without any proper breaks is a recipe for disaster. Aim for shorter periods of focused activity interspersed with regular breaks – and never skip lunch, away from your desk.Talk it out: Find a friend or colleague you trust to talk through your problems. A fresh perspective might help.Say ‘no’ more often: Stretching yourself too thin in a bid to accommodate every request is a surefire way to escalate your stress levels. Don’t let your inner people-pleaser trick you into overcommitting to work at the expense of your own sense of calm.Establish email boundaries: The expectation that we respond to work emails even when we’re not technically “on the clock” is a blight of modern working culture. Try to pull back, gradually – start by not checking your emails at all on Saturdays and work your way up, until you’re rarely checking your emails outside of work hours.Evaluate your environment: Maybe it’s them, not you. Some workplaces are just toxic environments, and instead of tying yourself in knots trying to make things work, sometimes it’s best to just ... bow out. It might be time to start looking for a job elsewhere.Treat yourself: Don’t forget to reward yourself for a job well done. Whether it’s a long bath, a slap-up meal or a spot of retail therapy, never underestimate the power of some straight-up indulgence to boost your spirits and rejuvenate the soul.Create rituals: Family stress often follows change, which falls roughly into two types: the normal life cycles we all face – a new job, a baby, a house move, the death of an elderly parent, a child starting school – and unexpected change, such as a job loss, illness, or diagnosis of a mental health condition. For the former, it helps to create rituals around these life-cycle stages, to make the transition easier and acknowledge the change (depending on your cultural or religious background, you may have these already, such as bar and batmitzvahs). These could include a graduation dinner, a housewarming party or retirement party. Unexpected changes are harder to navigate because the family hasn’t evolved a way of coping with them.  In these cases, it may help to talk to someone – a family friend, a community elder, or a professional.Prioritise family time: Set aside time together as a family. Any shared activity is good: board games eating together at least three times a week, without screens at the table watching a film even car journeys, if you have one. I often suggest parents spend one-on-one time with different children too, to create opportunities for conversations about their school lives and friendships.Realise you’re all in it together: In family therapy, there is usually one person whom everyone is most concerned about at any one time, but it’s important not to blame an inidual for a family breakdown. Try to separate the person from the problem: for example, a family may feel they have a “naughty child”, so create a name or character for the “naughtiness” – Horrid Henry, say – and keep a record of every time your child let’s him get the better of them. This can also help the family realise that the symptom may be present in every family member. Focusing on one “problem” person in the family can also obscure another problem – for example, parents may discover they have issues in their own relationship.Avoid the blame game: It’s helpful to distinguish between blame and responsibility: everyone in a family has to take responsibility for behaviour that is problematic, and help to do things different in the future.Dr Reenee Singh is chief executive of the Association of Family TherapyLive in the now: Try not to get too hung up on what may or may not happen to your finances over the long term, such as how you’re ever going to pay off your student debt, or whether you will ever get on the housing ladder. Similarly, don’t dwell on financial mistakes you may have made in the past and that you probably now can’t do anything about. They can seem mammoth and insurmountable. The fact is, focusing on what you’re spending right now is the best way to protect your financial future.Be honest with yourself: Carry out an audit of your income, expenditure and debts. Look at what you spend on the essentials and the basics, such as your mortgage or energy bills. You may well be able to cut your costs by switching to another provider (many services now offer to do this automatically for you).Facing up to the reality of your finances, and exercising some control over them will boost your confidence. Happily, there are a string of smartphone apps that can do some of the legwork for you – and the new breed of digital current accounts such as Monzo and Loot are all simple to use and typically let you set dailyweeklymonthly budgets, analyse your spending and create savings goals.Face the facts and figures: Don’t ignore letters, calls and emails. This will just make things worse, so take a deep breath and sort through that pile of letters that you’ve been trying to pretend don’t exist. If you are sweating over a money problem, talking to family members or friends might produce useful advice or a solution.Get help: There are many sources of free impartial advice. Several organisations can put you in touch with a debt counsellor who can help you come up with a repayment strategy.

But new ideas for what is needed are out thereMaternity leave, as all mothers know, is not leave from anything except life as you once knew it. The job of looking after a baby full-time for up to a year, for those women who can afford it, can be joyous, lonely, stressful, inane, refreshingly mundane, brainless, hilarious, body-and-soul-destroying, the best thing you have ever done and crushingly boring. Often at the same time.Every mother’s response to this bewildering, byzantine system will be different. For some, the 39 weeks of statutory maternity pay – which can be ided into shared parental leave, but mostly isn’t because it’s a completely unworkable policy that even the minister promoting it couldn’t take up – is too long and the desperation to return to work increases exponentially with each spirit-breaking viewing of Bing on CBeebies. For others the end of maternity leave looms like a Beckettian nightmare in which your baby is wrenched from your arms and you are expected to act like the whole life-changing thing never happened while quietly spending all your earnings on childcare.The problems escalate when women return to work – if a job still exists. One report found maternity leave discrimination leads to 54,000 women losing their jobs each year and we now know non-disclosure agreements have been used to silence women sacked after having children. Of those working mothers who keep their jobs, three-quarters say they have experienced discrimination in the workplace. The motherhood penalty, in other words, is the rule rather than the exception.Vardag’s solution is to invite women to return to her law firm as soon as they feel ready for as much time as they want – even if that is half a day a week. She is open to employees breastfeeding in the office and offers a nanny service to longer-serving staff. This is what a flexible, humane and pragmatic maternity policy could look like. Instead of endlessly obsessing over what makes a good mother, how about overhauling an unfit-for-purpose system that ensures mothers can never be good enough?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98d1c2d0a262455ee229eb1f34c42dabf6a6184f/21_60_3400_2040/master/3400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a1ccf170db72b5b7929b39d6c4815ba1","title":"china lunar new year of the pig","story":"Millions of Chinese people have begun the world’s largest annual human migration, leaving major cities to return to their hometowns for the holiday.

In Brussels, it is known in less lofty terms. The “bonkers no-deal plan” is how one EU official described the compromise, reflecting a consensus that it is a non-starter. But why is the EU so opposed?The main aim of the plan is to take the sting out of the Irish backstop, the fallback arrangements to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland. The EU would be offered a choice between two variants of the current withdrawal agreement. Plan A involves extending the transition period to December 2021 and would ditch the backstop in favour of a basic free-trade agreement, using “proven solutions” to avoid border checks. Plan B is a managed no-deal that would extend the transition until December 2021 to give both sides time to prepare for the collapse of existing trade arrangements.For the EU, Brexit negotiations finished on 25 November 2018, when Theresa May and fellow EU leaders signed off the withdrawal agreement, the 585-page legal text painstakingly negotiated over 18 months. While May hopes to keep the Tory party together, the EU has many other priorities. Although the EU is open to redrafting the non-binding political declaration, should UK red lines change, it has repeatedly ruled out reopening the treaty. The prime minister’s decision to renege on the deal she made with EU leaders in November has exasperated officials and deepened mistrust.Some have speculated that the EU’s other 26 countries will abandon Ireland on the backstop, fearing a no-deal Brexit. So far, there is no sign of that happening. The EU, a peace project and an organisation composed of small countries, thinks it is vital to prioritise Ireland over a departing member state. But there is also self-interest. The EU wants to protect the integrity of its single market. The current alternative arrangements mooted at Westminster are seen as a threat to the internal market. Inadequate checks or lack of alignment between the UK and EU could mean that American chlorinated chickens, dangerous toys and all kinds of tariff-free products would start leaking into the European market via the backdoor of the Irish border.Even countries with strained relations with Brussels, such as Poland and Hungary, show no or limited appetite for helping the UK. Poland climbed down on a proposal for a time-limited backstop, while Hungary is in line with other member states. “The only way to deal with Brexit is to deal with it from a common standpoint,” Hungarian government spokesman Zoltán Kovács told journalists last week.Many Brexit supporters contend that the EU always comes up with a compromise at five minutes to midnight. So far, there is no sign that is happening, and there are no Brexit meetings planned between May and her EU counterparts.While the EU has come up with numerous post-negotiation fixes in the past, such as guarantees to secure Belgium’s ratification of the EU-Canada trade deal, or Irish ratification of the Lisbon treaty, these tend to be fine-tuning rather than reconstruction of the entire deal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45d339a14081262070d3bddbb54556c09d18ea8f/12_4_1902_1141/master/1902.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1e53d819d66e4642e17a11507cb47c90","title":"brexit what are carmaker contingency plans","story":"From stockpiling to Nissan’s U-turn on making new model in the UK, here’s what firms are doingUK-based ​carmakers have triggered a wave of Brexit contingency plans, with Nissan the latest manufacturer to warn that uncertainty around leaving the EU is “not helping” companies.The British car industry is a major exporter, with eight out of 10 cars sold abroad to markets including the EU, the US and China.

A host of major international firms have sites in the UK, ranging from Nissan and Toyota to BMW and Volkswagen, with JLR playing a central role as the largest employer in the sector.The concern among industry executives is that a disorderly Brexit would throw finely tuned supply lines into chaos by disrupting Britain’s import and export markets. ​For multinational companies with little to tie them to the UK, that could make investing elsewhere the safer option."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/598b1af10645f6c3b1070fc68d4f6f2fc367089f/0_235_7123_4275/master/7123.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=92d98a22e40bc3aa28646b0ee38dbfbc","title":"government letter to nissan reveals brexit promise to carmarkers","story":"Business secretary vowed to maintain manufacturers’ capacity to trade with EUThe business secretary has been forced to admit the existence of a previously secret package of state aid to Nissan that could have been worth up to £80m had the carmaker gone ahead with plans to manufacture a new model X-Trail in Sunderland after Brexit.Greg Clark released a letter dated October 2016 in which he pledged tens of millions of taxpayer support and promised the Japanese company it would not be “adversely affected” after the UK left the EU.Yet, at the time the commitments were first made, Downing Street had said “there was no special deal for Nissan” and Clark refused six times to answer a question about what was on offer when interviewed on the BBC. He even appeared to suggest no money was involved. Asked on BBC One’s Question Time about the deal, he said: “There’s no chequebook. I don’t have a chequebook.”Clark and the government had repeatedly refused to release the 2016 letter until the promises turned out to be worthless, because Nissan had abandoned its future investment plan, partly because of uncertainty over Brexit.The four-page document, sent by Clark to Nissan’s then chief executive, Carlos Ghosn, committed the government to “a package of support in areas such as skills, R\u0026ampD and innovation” which “could amount to additional support of up to £80m”.The state aid package ultimately turned out to be worth £61m when it was formally awarded to Nissan in June 2018, a fact only acknowledged by Clark in a second letter sent on Monday to the Labour MP Rachel Reeves, who chairs the business select committee.The 2016 letter promised Ghosn it would “be a critical priority of our negotiation to support UK car manufacturers and ensure that their ability to export to and from the EU is not adversely affected by the UK’s future relationship with the EU”.Clark’s Brexit promise, however, could not be met because no deal has been struck with the European Union with less than two months to the scheduled March 29 exit date, causing mounting concern that the UK could crash out without agreeing a deal.Nicky Morgan, who chairs the Treasury select committee, complained that MPs had not been informed about the deal with Nissan before Monday. She asked why her predecessor, Andrew Tyrie, had not been told about the package when he had asked what assurances had been provided to Nissan in 2016.“If the government provided financial assistance to Nissan to persuade it to stay in Sunderland, it should set out what this support was and why it did not disclose it to my predecessor,” Morgan said.Clark told MPs Nissan would have to reapply to the government for the financial support, which was offered on the basis that the carmaker would produce its Qashqai and X-Trail models in Sunderland. The company had only received £2.6m so far, he said.The minister, however, sought to deflect the criticism of his handling of the Nissan affair by warning that a no-deal Brexit “would be ruinous for our prospects” and arguing that MPs should heed the company’s decision and support Theresa May’s Brexit deal.“No-deal is fully acknowledged, certainly by me and the industry, as being ruinous for our prospects,” Clark told MPs in an unambiguous warning to hard Brexiters in his party. “But in order to avoid no-deal, we need to come to an agreement in this house.”Clark is one of the strongest voices in cabinet against a no-deal Brexit, alongside Philip Hammond, the chancellor, and David Gauke, the justice secretary. But May has refused to rule it out as a bargaining position, even though talks with the EU are at an impasse.There have been concerns about Nissan’s long-term investment plans since the Brexit vote, concerns exacerbated by a slump in demand for diesel vehicles. Vehicles using the fuel are facing tighter regulations across the EU after an emissions-cheating scandal at Volkswagen prompted intense scrutiny of diesel’s environmental impact.Over the weekend, Nissan said it would no longer manufacture the new model X-Trail SUV in Sunderland, stopping a planned expansion. The company said “the continued uncertainty” over Brexit was one of the factors behind its decision. No jobs were lost as a result of Nissan’s decision, but the investment in the X-Trail had been intended to create 741 new jobs.Clark’s 2016 letter did not make any specific assurances about the UK’s future Brexit policy, although it did seek to provide general comfort to Ghosn and acknowledged his concern about the impact of changes in the terms of trade.“We will continue to do everything we can to make it as easy and rewarding as possible for Nissan to invest,” Clark wrote. “I understand, of course, your worries now about uncertainties as the UK prepares to leave the EU. In particular, your fear that potential future trade arrangements could affect the business case for your investments.”Nissan said it planned to consolidate all production of the X-Trail in its plant in Kyushu, Japan. Cars manufactured there will benefit from the recently completed free-trade agreement between the EU and Japan, which will mean all tariffs on cars are reduced to zero within seven years.The shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, blamed the government’s handling of Brexit, arguing a tipping point had been reached. “Businesses are no longer speaking out simply to highlight the future dangers of a badly handled Brexit they’re now losing confidence in the government and taking real action to protect their businesses,” Long-Bailey said.Nissan has come under new leadership since Clark’s letter, after Ghosn was ousted following allegations brought by the company that he had under-reported income worth billions of yen. The Japanese businessman Hiroto Saikawa has taken over.Nissan said the letter showed the company’s and the government’s “continued desire to support investment in the UK and maintain Sunderland as one of Nissan’s manufacturing hubs in Europe. The letter is no longer commercially sensitive as it contains nothing that hasn’t been disclosed publicly before, and the projects referenced in the letter have now changed.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4f06c09e53bbc6fb42cdcfc3938c9ea2e5f51f7/412_129_2457_1475/master/2457.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=205684d54dd71c1ad08d950eb3b5858d","title":"nissan leaves tories to explain why they cant even manage a bribe","story":"A £61m off-the-books sweetener failed to do the trick, but Greg Clark was focusing on the positives Awks. It’s one thing for a government to offer a £61m off-the-books sweetener to reassure Nissan that Brexit wasn’t going to be such a big deal and it was fine for the Japanese carmaker to manufacture its new X-Trail model at its Sunderland plant.It’s quite another for everyone to find out that the intended bung has proved completely ineffective. The Conservatives now can’t even manage a decent bribe.It was left to the business secretary to try and explain away the bad news. Greg Clark may be one of the more decent members of the cabinet but he’s also one of the dullest.Westminster’s very own Mogadon Man, a politician almost devoid of charisma and personality whose main skill is to be able not just to put everyone else to sleep but to nod off himself as he’s doing it. A tactic that can have its advantages on occasions like these when he would rather be as absent from his own life as possible.The monotone became ever more deathless and soporific. The situation was very disappointing but it was important for everyone to take away the positives. Nissan had first asked for an £80m cash boost to help them develop the Sunderland plant, so the government had actually saved the country £19m by only agreeing to hand over £61m. Not that he had handed over all the £61m yet, but if Nissan were to reapply for the money he’d make sure they got it.And, um, yes, Brexit was a bit of a worry, there was no denying that, but no existing jobs were going to be lost. Rather 741 people who were being underpaid on universal credit were going to have to starve for a bit longer. So no harm done. Would that do?Much to Clark’s disappointment there were a considerable number of Labour MPs who were sufficiently concerned about Nissan to have remained awake during his opening statement. Rebecca Long-Bailey, shadow business secretary, replied for the opposition. What Nissan’s production move back to Japan proved was that the UK was getting squeezed out of the European market now that the EU and Japan had signed a trade deal and, unless the government could guarantee no tariffs post Brexit, then the UK car industry was heading for managed decline.Clark stared at his notes haplessly. There was no salvation. All he had written down was a reminder to be as boring as possible. But he’d already done that and it hadn’t worked. So he started to ad lib. It was all basically Labour’s fault. If they had been a better opposition, then the EU referendum would probably have never happened, there would have been no need to bribe Nissan and the Tories wouldn’t have won the last election. It was as bonkers as that and the Commons was momentarily reduced to silence.The Tories consistently like to brand themselves as ‘the party of business’ but there were less than 20 of the party’s backbenchers in the chamber for this setback. Well, it was all basically a problem up north and almost none of them could actually place Sunderland on a map. One of the few that was there was John Redwood, a man whose prime goal in life is never to come across a stick that he can’t find the wrong end of.Nissan was nothing to do with Brexit, he insisted. The real issue was the EU nanny state that was preventing us from choking to death on diesel emissions. Once we had escaped the interfering hand of Brussels, Nissan would rush back to make the killer cars in the UK and everything would be fine. Clark gently pointed out that almost all the Nissan cars made in Sunderland were for the EU export market anyway.This didn’t stop Bill Cash. Nothing much does. He’s been living in a century of his own for a while now. It was a throughly underhand thing for Nissan to have made alternative arrangements. Only a thoroughly untrustworthy country would seek to make alternative arrangements after agreeing to a deal. So the sooner the UK made alternative arrangements with the EU the better.Labour quickly piled in, observing that the car industry urgently needed the certainty of a Brexit deal that guaranteed tariff-free access to the EU. Clark ummed and ahed. If only there was such a thing, he said, then the government would be right on it. Anna Soubry cut to the chase. There was such a thing and it was called the customs union.Finally there was a crack in Clark’s denial. No one wanted a customs union more than him. A no-deal Brexit would be ruinous. But there were all these people in the cabinet, including the prime minister, who were bullying him into keeping quiet about it. He then fell silent. He’d said too much. And not given Nissan nearly enough."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ffa3f851daf24bd72401619f2d404fb5adca8040/0_52_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1584a216ec3c3bbbf5b405e3d3ed0618","title":"tory mps back rightwing youth group turning point uk","story":"Rees-Mogg and Patel support UK branch of Turning Point, accused of anti-Islam viewsA number of Conservative MPs have praised the work of a new UK rightwing youth pressure group that is said to have links to far-right conspiracy theorists, and has in the US been accused of anti-Islam views and connections to racism.On Sunday, MPs including Jacob Rees-Mogg and Priti Patel tweeted supportive messages for Turning Point UK, the offshoot of a controversial organisation established in the US.The UK outpost is headed by George Farmer, a Conservative donor and son of a Tory peer, who has been pictured (below second left) socialising with Paul Joseph Watson (second right), a senior editor at the far-right conspiracy theory website Infowars, and frequently retweets him. Watson has also praised Turning Point.Infowars has argued the 7 July 2005 attacks in London and the 2012 Sandy Hook primary school massacre were faked. Its founder, Alex Jones, is being sued by bereaved Sandy Hook parents.UK Jewish groups have previously criticised Ukip for allying with Watson and Infowars over concerns and allegations that the website also spreads antisemitic conspiracy theories.Farmer has also used Twitter to question Islam and call Jeremy Corbyn “Jew-hating Jeremy”. Other messages called the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, a “Grade A twat” and a “virtue signalling cuck”, and called two US Democratic politicians “retards”.On Islam, Farmer tweeted: “Can anyone explain to me why you need so much protection when you convert out of the religion of peace? Asking for a friend.”The newly launched Turning Point UK says it aims to challenge the idea that young people are inherently left-leaning, and seeks to fight against “socialism, racism and identity politics”, among other issues.It has no connection to the long-established UK addiction  charity Turning Point. A spokeswoman for the charity said it was “reviewing all options in order to protect is name and limit confusion”.Several Conservative MPs have approvingly retweeted the group’s initial message. “This could be huge,” said Steve Baker. Patel, a former international development secretary, said: “A new generation standing up for political \u0026amp economic freedoms \u0026amp Conservative values \u0026amp beliefs. Fantastic!”Another MP, Bernard Jenkin, said: “This is the future” while Rees-Mogg said: “The left has no monopoly on the ‘young’.”Among other people to praise the establishment of Turning Point UK was For Britain, the anti-Islam party set up by the former Ukip leadership contender Anne Marie Waters, which said it hoped to support the group.Turning Point UK is a spin-off from a US youth campaign that advocates free markets and small government, loudly supporting Donald Trump and campaigning on free speech issues.The latter topic has seen Turning Point USA set up a website called Professor Watchlist. This is billed as a way to stop academics from discriminating against Trump-supporting students but has been criticised as intimidating.Turning Point USA vehemently insists it is inclusive, but has prompted concern about alleged links to racists, and anti-Islam messages.Farmer, whose father is Michael Farmer, a multimillionaire financier and longtime Tory donor, has also given money to the party, and attended fundraising events.He is engaged to Candace Owens, a Trump-supporting US YouTube commentator and TV pundit. She has previously come to the defence of neo-Nazis and called the police killings of black men a trivial issue.Turning Point UK and Farmer were contacted for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fac66bdf00aab60439b6d03b0dcde5197bad7123/26_139_5102_3062/master/5102.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=63845c7c01a45bb42869f8f00fd5fa7d","title":"root cause documentary netflix dentists","story":"Oral care professionals urge Netflix, Amazon and other companies to remove Root Cause, a documentary spreading misinformationDentists, endodontists and dental researchers are warning Netflix, Apple, Amazon and Vimeo to remove a documentary that spreads fear and misinformation about the safety of root canals and extracting wisdom teeth.Root Cause takes viewers through the Australian film-maker Frazer Bailey’s years-long quest to identify the cause of his fatigue, anxiety and depression. Bailey tries therapy, antidepressant medication, juice cleanses, chakra balancing and hypnosis. He even drinks his own urine. But aided by holistic dentists, he eventually concludes that the source of his malaise is a root canal he got as a young man – a procedure he needed to save a tooth after getting punched in the mouth.Bailey’s 72-minute film makes eye-popping claims about how cancer, heart conditions and other serious illnesses are caused by asymptomatic infections inside root canals or in the empty spaces left behind after a wisdom tooth extraction. Bacteria and other toxins, the film argues, fester in the jaw and then travel to other organs along “meridian lines”, which according to traditional Chinese medicine move life force throughout the body, spreading infection and causing cancer and other illnesses to take root.Among the most jarring claims in Root Cause is a connection between root canals and breast cancer. “Ninety-eight per cent of women that have breast cancer have a root canal tooth on the same side as their offending breast cancer,” the film repeats.Concerned that dentists are receiving more and more questions from patients about the treatments, the American Dental Association (ADA), American Association of Endodontists (AAE) and American Association of Dental Research (AADR) warned the media companies in a private letter sent late last month that continuing to host the film could harm the viewing public by spreading long-disproven claims.“The premise the film is based on dates back to research conducted in the 1920s which was later disproved because the original conditions for the experiments were poorly controlled and performed in non-sterile environments. Perhaps most importantly, other researchers have not been able to duplicate the results from the original experiment. Why portray information demonstrated to be incorrect as fact?” the letter asks.In a separate letter, directed at the three associations’ approximately 174,000 members, they advise readers on how to answer patients’ questions about the movie.It’s the first time the AAE and AADR have ever issued a member-wide alert or written to a media platform in response to a film or TV program.Root Cause got little attention when it was released in the fall of 2018, but dentists say that patients have begun asking them more about the safety of root canals since the film was picked up by Netflix last month. While Netflix doesn’t release data on the number of viewers a program attracts, it has approximately 58 million subscribers in the US.The size of the content platform, as well as its ability to suggest new content to users based on their previous viewing activity, can help make inaccurate things go viral, said Paul Resnick, director of the Center for Social Media Responsibility at the University of Michigan.One way to militate against fringe, potentially harmful content is to simply stop suggesting it to viewers, Resnick said. However, media platforms also have an additional responsibility to viewers, he said, which is to preserve a “healthy marketplace of ideas” as much as possible.“I don’t want crap to get wide distribution, but I also want there to be some vehicle for new ideas and claims to get out there, even if it challenges the current orthodoxy.”The right to free speech, however, doesn’t absolve these large media platforms of the responsibility to vet the content they host, argued Erica Austin, founding director of the Edward R Murrow Center for Media \u0026amp Health Promotion Research at Washington State University. Unlike user-generated content sites like Facebook or YouTube, Netflix offers a curated selection that includes its own produced content as well as other TV shows and films.“People are likely to view the fact that the outlet is publishing the content as an endorsement of it,” Austin said. “If that is not the intention then the management of the site has a responsibility to very clearly preface the content with a disclaimer and to label opinions as something distinct from evidence-based reporting.”Netflix declined a request for comment. Apple, Amazon and Vimeo did not respond to repeated requests for comment.Dr Jennifer Gibbs, director of endodontics at the Harvard School of Dental Medicine, was also uncomfortable saying that Netflix and other platforms should simply delete the film from their sites.But she stood firm against the film’s message, and expressed worry that it could influence people to get rid of infected teeth unnecessarily.“I don’t know where their claims are coming from,” Gibbs told the  about the breast cancer figure. “I don’t think they’re based on any kind of scientific research that is evidence-based or peer-reviewed.”Large-scale population-based research shows that people with root canals actually have a lower risk of cardiovascular mortality or death from a cardiovascular condition.And there aren’t any studies that show people who get root canals have a higher risk of cancer, said Eric Jacobs, senior scientific director of epidemiology research at at the American Cancer Society, in an email. In fact, research on the link between cancer and endodontic procedures like root canals shows that people who have had these treatments have a lower risk of certain cancers.“The danger of these claims is that these fears can crowd out other, real cancer risks,” Jacobs said, noting that viewers may wind up ignoring known risk factors for getting or dying of cancer, including smoking, weight gain, and failing to get the right cancer screening tests on time.Instead of getting a root canal, the film claims that pulling the infected tooth is the safest approach, and dentists worry the film is influencing patients to unnecessarily have damaged teeth removed.“This is a really well-produced film designed to scare people into seeking out some fringe medical and dental therapies,” said Gibbs.Tooth extraction can result in serious health consequences over time, said Dr Mo Kang, professor and chair of the section of endodontics at the University of California, Los Angeles School of Dentistry.While root canals can’t save every tooth, said Kang, leaving the natural tooth intact helps maintain the jawbone’s original structure. Without the original tooth, the surrounding jawbone that once supported it will eventually break down, affecting a person’s appearance and their ability to chew.“Let’s say I have an infection under my fingernail,” said Kang. “Do you amputate my finger because of that? That’s exactly what they’re claiming.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eaa7d2ce838b7a724e0e91d6a68a5f0b7232b8fb/0_10_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0aeedd9fa669beace56cc1f2f2938c2c","title":"youth unhappiness uk doubles in past 10 years","story":"The number of young people in the UK who say they do not believe that life is worth living has doubled in the last decade, amid a sense of overwhelming pressure from social media which is driving feelings of inadequacy, new research suggests.The gloomy view on life being taken by a growing minority of young people comes amid reports of an increased rate of teenage suicide. It was reported on Sunday that official statistics due later this year will show that suicides now occur at more than five in 100,000 teenagers in England. That contrasts with a figure of just over three in 100,000 in 2010.“Social media has become omnipresent in the lives of young people and this research suggests it is exacerbating what is already an uncertain and emotionally turbulent time,” said Nick Stace, UK chief executive of The Prince’s Trust. “Young people are critical to the future success of this country, but they’ll only realise their full potential if they believe in themselves and define success in their own terms. It is therefore a moral and economic imperative that employers, government, charities and wider communities put the needs of young people centre stage.”The findings follow public pressure on the government to toughen the regulation of social media companies, which use algorithms to target users with tailored content. Ministers have asked the chief medical officer, Dame Sally Davies, to draw up advice on social media usage for childrenamid growing concerns about links between its excessive use and mental health problems among children.Education secretary Damian Hinds, said at the weekend that social media companies have a “moral duty” to act.

It also made her question her body image.“As soon as I woke up I would be on Instagram, scrolling through,” she said. “I would be on a page with a girl with the most perfect body.”“Social media reinforces those feelings of not being good enough, that you’re too fat, and that is toxic,” Frazer said. “Social media doesn’t induce those feelings but it heightens them.”The Prince’s Trust creates an index based on happiness and confidence which stood at 73 in 2009.

Itoje’s absence, though, will be keenly felt.England will confirm on Tuesday the length of Itoje’s injury but the best prognosis is thought to be a return for their last match of the championship, against Scotland on 16 March. England players have been known to make comebacks far quicker than expected but Itoje, who was on crutches during the celebrations after the win against Ireland on Saturday, may also have played his last Test before the World Cup in September.Jones is well stocked at second row and Courtney Lawes made a considerable impact against Ireland off the bench, while Joe Launchbury is expected to come into the matchday squad in Itoje’s absence. It is nonetheless a blow for Jones to lose a player he believes “is going to become the best lock in the world”.Itoje also sustained a knee injury towards the end of last year and spent five weeks out as a result. The initial injury was sustained at England’s October training camp in Portugal but he went on to play in all four of their autumn internationals and once for Saracens before the true extent of the problem became clear.Tuilagi is free to play consecutive England matches for the first time in five years after the citing officer, Jeff Mark, chose not to bring disciplinary proceedings against the centre, thereby ending any possibility of a suspension. It is a boost for the England head coach considering the impact Tuilagi had in his first Six Nations start since 2013., not to mention the physical challenge posed by what Chris Ashton believes will be an “angry French team” following their capitulation against Wales.“We’ve got a big Test against France – an angry France,” said Ashton, who scored 26 tries for Toulon last season. “They will be up for the game a little bit more now than they would have been had they got the win. We’ll be at home, which is in our favour, but it will be an angry French team, desperate to make up for the last 20 minutes of that game against Wales.“A lot of their game is based on emotion but they’ve got a lot of good players, too. I’m sure there will be repercussions from that and that goes beyond emotion. They’ve got to get a win and make up for last week.“If we know anything about the French, it’s that they love a reaction. They’ll definitely be putting everything into winning and they’ll have to in the situation they are in after losing at home. Their backs are against the wall and we expect nothing less.”Elliot Daly will leave Wasps at the end of the season and the 26-year-old is widely expected to join Saracens. The full-back, who scored one of England’s four tries against Ireland in Dublin, has triggered a release clause in his contract and joins his Wasps teammate Christian Wade in announcing he is walking away from his boyhood club before his existing deal is up.The flanker CJ Stander is in a fight to be fit before the end of Ireland’s Six Nations campaign because of suspected facial fractures.\u0026nbspIreland expect Stander to be out of action for up to four weeks following the nasty looking injury he sustained in the 32-20 defeat by England on Saturday. The lock Devin Toner, wing Keith Earls and centre Garry Ringrose are all fitness doubts for the trip to face Scotland this Saturday.Stander will hope he is able to return in time for Ireland’s final two Six Nations matches, against France and Wales.\u0026nbsp“CJ Stander has a facial injury that could rule him out for up to four weeks,” read the IRFU statement. “Keith Earls suffered a hip pointer injury and will be managed across the early part of the week.\u0026nbsp“Devin Toner aggravated an ankle injury and Garry Ringrose reported some hamstring tightness.

The Bahrain government bases its extradition request on an act of vandalism which occurred when, or very shortly after, he was playing in a televised football match, but Al-Araibi believes it is attempted political retribution.“The Thai government should see that Bahrain’s sole motive is to further punish Hakeem for the peaceful political opinions he expressed,” said Amnesty International Thailand campaigner Katherine Gerson.Supporters of Al-Araibi have stepped up calls for sanctions and boycotts – primarily from world sporting bodies such as Fifa and the International Olympic Committee – against Bahrain and Thailand.“You cannot have the privileges of the international community if you are not prepared to live by its rules or behave by its standards,” said the head of Professional Footballers Australia, John Didulica.Allan McKinnon, Australia’s ambassador designate, would not be drawn on whether Australia was considering sanctions against Thailand if it failed to act.“What we are considering at the moment is anything we can do to more rapidly move Hakeem al-Araibi out of detention, have this case finished and allow him to go back to Australia,” McKinnon said outside the court.He said Australia and the other 14 countries represented in court to support Al-Araibi would “continue to press”.Pressure on Thailand is increasing, and its head of immigration, Surachate Hakparn, personally responded to criticism of Al-Araibi’s shackles and bare feet at court on Monday.Hakparn replied to numerous tweets to say it was in line with international standards – something disputed by human rights groups.On Tuesday morning Hakparn tweeted a screenshot of McKinnon’s statement, posted by the Australian embassy in Thailand. He added the words: “We hope that Hakeem will be able to go back to be with his family and his wife in the coming days.”The posted comment, on behalf of McKinnon, said the actions of Bahrain had put Thailand “in a very difficult position”.“The government of Bahrain knew very well that Hakeem al-Araibi lived in Australia since 2014. During these four years, the Bahraini government did not attempt to ask Australia about Hakeem at all or to request to send him back to Bahrain.”The role of Australian authorities in Al-Araibi’s arrest has become a key question, and supporters have said that while they are currently concentrating on getting him released, they would seek accountability when the ordeal was over.He was arrested in November on an Interpol red notice, issued against Interpol’s refugee protection policies.Australian federal police, working as locally based Interpol, notified Thailand of his arrival – a process that is understood to be largely automatic when someone subject to a red notice is travelling – and did not flag his refugee status.Al-Araibi has said he asked Australian government officials if he was safe to travel and was told he would be.Speaking to 2GB radio at the weekend, Australia’s prime minister, Scott Morrison, suggested Al-Araibi bore some responsibility.“If you have a permanent protection visa and you live in Australia, please don’t go to countries where you can put yourself at risk in these situations,” Morrison said.Asked by the host, Alan Jones, about Australian officials “tipping off” Thai authorities, Morrison said: “What we’re focused on is getting him home.”While Payne and diplomatic staff have lobbied on behalf of Al-Araibi since his arrest, Morrison personally intervened only last week, speaking to the Thai ambassador and writing to the Thai prime minister. He told 2GB he was yet to receive a reply."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44e5c2b86b34e49c22f00b9f2b214f77fe2321f8/0_0_5472_3648/master/5472.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=5a97e079f2c570ad56a9e316523aa8c9 1400w","title":"alphabet google shares profits earnings quarterly report","story":"Alphabet, the parent company of the internet search giant Google, earned $39.27bn in the last three months of 2018, but its share price sank as its costs rose.It was the latest tech company to announce strong revenue growth – news that has cheered investors – but rising costs that come as the company is facing increasing competition from Amazon clouded the news.The fees that Alphabet pays to companies like Apple for Google to be their default search engine rose to $7.4bn up from $6.6bn for the same period last year.

Driven by a set of ideals and some clever code, you steadily built a money machine that has also accumulated remarkable influence around the world.I urge people to consider these numbers when pondering the power of Facebook: 2.3 billion users writing in more than 100 languages almost $17bn in revenue in just the fourth quarter of 2018 almost $59bn in revenue for all of 2018 a market capitalization of $484bn in January 2019. You built all of this in a mere 15 years. Those are stunning numbers, and they speak to the talents of you and your employees.That’s why I’m struck by your Facebook post. You seem not to acknowledge how much power you have accumulated, nor the extent to which you represent a club of billionaires and companies that have steadily concentrated their power over the past 50 years, with a steady acceleration of that concentration over the past 15 years.Your post not only ignores your power, it denies it. You repeat a myth that used to flow as truth and wisdom back in 2003 when you dropped out of Harvard to pursue your dream. Back then you had no reason to disbelieve the idea that networks of powerless people could forge bonds through social media and threaten entrenched authorities. By 2019, you should know better than to still believe this nonsense.“Much of people’s experience in the past was defined by large hierarchical institutions – governments, mass media, universities, religious organizations – that provided stability but were often remote and inaccessible,” you write. “If you wanted to progress, you worked your way up the ladder slowly. If you wanted to start something new or spread a new idea, it was harder without the blessing of these institutions. Our current century is defined more by networks of people who have the freedom to interact with whom they want and the ability to easily share ideas and experiences.”You do realize that you run one of those hulking institutions, right? Your company hosts “networks of people” but they interact on your terms, managed by your rules and algorithms. Your company also employs powerful lobbyists, retired politicians, and former journalists to execute your will in Washington, Brussels, New Delhi, Brasilia, Canberra, Ottawa, Dublin and London. Your staff actively helped nationalist leaders like Donald Trump, Narendra Modi and Rodrigo Duterte assume power.Perhaps the most puzzling of your assertions is this: “As networks of people replace traditional hierarchies and reshape many institutions in our society – from government to business to media to communities and more – there is a tendency of some people to lament this change, to overly emphasize the negative, and in some cases to go so far as saying the shift to empowering people in the ways the internet and these networks do is mostly harmful to society and democracy.”This is a dishonest and ahistorical statement. “Networks of people” haven’t replaced “traditional hierarchies”. Ask Osama bin Laden how diffuse networks are doing against entrenched centers of power. Oh, yeah. You can’t. Instead, perhaps ask the networks of people fleeing Western Myanmar to refugee camps in Bangladesh because “traditional hierarchies” – Myanmar’s Buddhist clerisy and the military junta – declared a campaign of genocide against them using the very features of Facebook that you claim have liberated the world.What we lament is the demonstrated anti-democratic, inhumane, hateful, and violent forces hijacking your service and doing great damage to the world. The problem is Facebook, not “the internet”.By turning the focus away from Facebook to “the internet” you try to fool us into conflating the two. The fact is that the structure and function of Facebook is antithetic to the ideology of the internet. The internet is open, configurable, distributed, and based on open code. Facebook is nothing of the sort. No one who, like me, championed the values of the Internet back before Facebook ruined everything, can be fooled by your rhetorical trick.So once again, congratulations on becoming rich and powerful. To do that while remaining so clueless about how the world works is an astounding feat. If Facebook really does aim to to make humanity better informed and more aware of itself, there may still be some work left. May I suggest some books? They don’t have targeted ads in them. But they deliver a lot of knowledge in an efficient and resilient technological system.Siva Vaidhyanathan is a professor of media studies at the University of Virginia and the author of Antisocial Media: How Facebook Disconnects Us and Undermines Democracy (Oxford University Press, 2018)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33d610b7be4d791b1f8309be68aa309c2e7c8239/0_64_5664_3398/master/5664.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cd3478cb27e8b6cdef4756e6021920b0","title":"quadrigacx canada cryptocurrency exchange locked gerald cotten","story":"QuadrigaCX, Canada’s largest exchange, was unable to access password or recovery key after Gerald Cotten died last DecemberAbout $190m in cryptocurrency has been locked away in a online black hole after the founder of a currency exchange died, apparently taking his encrypted access to their money with him.Investors in QuadrigaCX, Canada’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, were unable to access their funds after its founder, Gerald Cotten, died last year.According to a court filing first reported by CoinDesk, a cryptocurrency news and events company, Jennifer Robertson, identified as Cotten’s widow, said the exchange owes its customers roughly C$250m (US$190m) in cash and cryptocurrency held in its “cold storage”.“Quadriga’s inventory of cryptocurrency has become unavailable and some of it may be lost,” Robertson wrote in the filing.Cotten, 30, died in India last December from complications from Crohn’s disease, according to the company. He was in India “opening an orphanage to provide a home and safe refuge for children in need”.The news followed a decision by Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) to freeze $28m of assets held by Quadriga after saying it was unable to identify the real owners of the funds.Robertson was not involved in the business. In the filing she noted that there had been a “significant amount of commentary on Reddit and other web based platforms about Quadriga, Gerry’s death (including whether he is really dead) and missing coins”. She said she had also received threats and slanderous comments.Robertson has access to Cotten’s laptop but writes that she is unable to open it. “The laptop computer from which Gerry carried out the companies’ business is encrypted and I do not know the password or recovery key. Despite repeated and diligent searches, I have not been able to find them written down anywhere.”Robertson has retained an expert to try to access the funds but he has so far not been able to do so.The platform continued to accept funds after Cotten’s death but was paused by directors on 26 January.On 31 January, QuadrigaCX filed an application for creditor protection with the supreme court of Nova Scotia, after months of transaction delays.At a court hearing on 5 February the company is seeking to appoint Ernst \u0026amp Young as an independent monitor."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a9690bc9013ca88ef082b4e5274fa8d29abab4f/0_157_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fda9018328566b4ed377bb4c69082ece","title":"bruce mcarthur toronto landscaper sentencing hearing","story":"Bruce McArthur stalked, sexually assaulted and killed men he met in the gay village district, court heard at sentencing hearingHarrowing details emerged on the first day of a sentencing hearing for Canadian serial killer Bruce McArthur, as prosecutors described how the Toronto landscape gardener meticulously stalked and targeted his victims, then staged photographs with some of them after he strangled them.The court also heard that a ninth man was found bound and naked inside McArthur’s house when it was raided by police in January 2018.The sentencing hearing, which began on Monday, is expected to last for at least three days, as family and friends read victim impact statements. McArthur pleaded guilty to eight counts of first-degree murder last week, making him the worst known serial killer in the history of Toronto. Wearing a black cable-knit sweater and plaid collared shirt, McArthur sat hunched in the dock, as the court heard a detailed statement of facts presented by the crown.Before the hearing began, crown prosecutor Michael Cantlon took the unusual step of warning the gallery that the proceedings would involve graphic descriptions.Cantlon choked up as he read the names of McArthur’s victims: Majeed Kayhan, Soroush Mahmudi, Dean Lisowick, Selim Esen, Andrew Kinsman, Skandaraj (Skanda) Navaratnam, Kirushnakumar Kanagaratnam and Abdulbasir Faizi.The court heard that McArthur staged photographs of his victims’ corpses, posing the bodies in a fur coat and black leather hat, and – in two cases – with a cigar between their lips.Cantlon described the extensive collection of photographs McArthur kept of his victims – many of them taken while they were alive. McArthur also shaved and stored the facial hair from his victims, Cantlon said.Cantlon acknowledged that members of Toronto’s gay community had long suspected the string of disappearances was the work of a serial murderer.“For years, members of the LGBT community in Toronto believed they were being targeted by a killer,” Cantlon said. “They were right.”On the day that he was arrested, the crown said McArthur had lured a man into his bedroom, bound him and placed a black bag over his head. The same fur coat, seen in multiple images of deceased victims, was found in in the room. The first major break for police came investigators the word “Bruce” written on a calendar in the apartment of Andrew Kinsman, McArthur’s last known victim, the court heard. Surveillance images and video showed a van picking Kinsman up, a vehicle that was later traced to McArthur. DNA belonging to Kinsman was later discovered in the van.Victims’ friends and family-members and members of the Toronto LGBT community remained stoic as they read victim impact statements. None were willing to offer words of forgiveness to McArthur.Kinsman’s sister Karen Coles remembered him as a generous and caring person. “He wanted to make the world a better place for those struggling to survive,” she told the court. “My life has changed forever … I trust no one.”“I know grief in all its forms. But I had nothing in my arsenal to prepare for this,” said Adrian Betts, a close friend of Kinsman, describing the “rage, guilt, profound sadness and horror” that overwhelmed him in the months since Kinsman’s death.Others highlighted a long-standing frustration the killer hadn’t been caught sooner. “This is a homophobic serial killing,” said the family of Selim Essen. “This has gone on far too long.”“Anger is a normal adaptive to injustice and unfairness,” said the Rev Deana Dudley, who read a statement on behalf of the city’s LGBT community. “And we should be angry when our community becomes a hunting ground.”While the judge has not yet decided whether McArthur’s eight charges will be consecutive or concurrent, he will be ineligible for parole until he is at least 91."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d7a2a93651e47f59f02d050bb9932d157d6ff47/0_84_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4206589ddc048d9858ca38a58a742fed","title":"pope and grand imam sign historic pledge of fraternity in uae","story":"In first papal visit to Arabian peninsula, Francis calls for end to wars in Middle EastThe pope and the grand imam of al-Azhar have signed a historic declaration of fraternity, calling for peace between nations, religions and races, in front of a global audience of religious leaders from Christianity, Islam, Judaism and other faiths.Pope Francis, the leader of the world’s Catholics, and Sheikh Ahmed al-Tayeb, the head of Sunni Islam’s most prestigious seat of learning, arrived at the ceremony in Abu Dhabi hand-in-hand in a symbol of interfaith brotherhood.The document pledges that al-Azhar and the Vatican will work together to fight extremism. Claiming to be in the name of “all victims of wars, persecution and injustice”, it warns against a “third world war being fought piecemeal”.It says: “We resolutely declare that religions must never incite war, hateful attitudes, hostility and extremism, nor must they incite violence or the shedding of blood.”In the first ever papal visit to the Arabian peninsula, the birthplace of Islam, the pope specifically called for an end to wars in the Middle East, naming Yemen, Syria, Iraq and Libya. All religious leaders had a “duty to reject every nuance of approval from the word war”, he said in a 26-minute address.The UAE is part of the Saudi-led military coalition engaged in the war in Yemen. On Sunday, before leaving Rome for Abu Dhabi, Francis said he was following the situation in Yemen “with great concern”, and that the population was “exhausted by the lengthy conflict, and a great many children are suffering from hunger”.In his speech on Monday evening – his first public comments during the three-day trip – he welcomed “the opportunity to come here as a believer for peace ... We are here to desire peace, we are here to promote peace, to be instruments of peace.”Violence, extremism or fanaticism could never be justified in the name of religion, he said. He also called for religious freedom “not limited only to freedom of worship”, justice and for religions to “stand on the side of the poor”.Sheikh Tayeb, who addressed the pope as “my dear brother”, said millions of Muslims had paid the price for the actions of “a handful of criminals” following the 911 terrorist attacks.The media had portrayed all Muslims as “savage barbarians” and had “installed fear in the hearts” of people in the west, he said. “All religions agree that God forbids killing.”Earlier on Monday, Francis arrived at the lavish presidential palace in Abu Dhabi in a small black Kia. He was greeted with a 21-shot salute and military flyover trailing yellow and white smoke in the colours of the Vatican flag. Horse-mounted guards escorted the pontiff’s motorcade through the palace gardens.The pope had a private meeting with Abu Dhabi’s crown prince, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, who later tweeted: “We discussed enhancing cooperation, consolidating dialogue, tolerance, human coexistence \u0026amp important initiatives to achieve peace, stability and development for peoples and societies.”The UAE is promoting itself as a regional leader in religious ersity and tolerance. According to the organisers of a conference on “human fraternity” this week, the UAE since its formation in 1971 has “given special attention to issues such as dialogue, tolerance, fraternity and peace. It also offered the world a model example of applying these human values through the coexistence and tolerance embraced by the various cultures, races and faiths living on its soil.”Christians are free to worship at churches and wear religious clothing. But Open Doors, which monitors discrimination against and persecution of Christians around the world, says the UAE government does not allow Christians “to evangelise or pray in public. Converts from Islam endure the most persecution as they face pressure from family members and the local community to recant their Christian faith.”The government has also been criticised by human rights organisations for restrictions on freedom of expression.Reem al-Hashemi, the UAE’s minister of state for international cooperation, said it was “important to note that openness has to have parameters, otherwise things can quickly spiral into incitement or hate. Freedom of expression has to have limitations.”Pope Francis is to celebrate mass in front of an expected audience of 120,000 people at a sports stadium in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday before flying back to Rome."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fca69fe23d254217cf386a67dc03e8cae48fb46a/15_28_3467_2081/master/3467.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d07d8e79435f2e4a1b6cf07280115aa5","title":"uk home secretary approves extradition of vijay mallya to india","story":"Chairman of Kingfisher beer says he will lodge an appeal amid allegations of £1bn fraudThe UK home secretary has ordered the extradition of Vijay Mallya, the Indian multimillionaire chairman of Kingfisher beer and former Force India Formula One team owner, over allegations of £1bn fraud.Sajid Javid on Monday formally ordered Mallya, who owns two multimillion UK properties and until last year had two superyachts, to be extradited, stating that the 63-year-old businessman is “accused in India of conspiracy to defraud, making false representations and money laundering offences”.Mallya, the self-proclaimed “king of the good times” who lives in a £11.5m mansion in the sleepy Hertfordshire village of Tewin, said he would appeal against the extradition. “I could not initiate the appeal process before a decision by the home secretary. Now I will initiate the appeal process,” he said on Twitter.He has been fighting the extradition order and has previously dismissed the allegations that he fled India leaving a trail of £977m worth of debts as “ludicrous”. He has said he made an “unconditional” offer to pay what he owed in full in July 2018.A judge ruled in December 2018 that Mallya had misrepresented how loans from Indian banks were used and referred the decision on his extradition to Javid.Senior district judge Emma Arbuthnot described Mallya as a “glamorous, flashy, famous, bejewelled, bodyguarded, ostensibly billionaire playboy who charmed and cajoled these bankers into losing their common sense and persuading them to put their own rules and regulations to one side”.Mallya is alleged to have knowingly misled largely India state-owned banks about the fortunes of his failing Kingfisher airline, before laundering the cash to fund his Formula One team and other projects. India’s enforcement directorate has been investigating the tycoon’s £977m debts linked to the airline, which went bust in 2012.India’s Central Bureau of Investigation opened a criminal investigation into Mallya in 2015 and the politan police’s extradition unit arrested him in April last year. He had entered the UK on a valid passport in March 2016.India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, has singled out Mallya, accusing him of ripping off India and Indians.“There is no place for corruption in India,” Modi said in comments referring to Mallya. “Those who looted the poor and middle classes will have to return what they have looted.”Modi’s government has described Mallya – who used to travel the globe on a private jet with VJM painted in gold on the engines and wingtips – as a “fugitive from justice”.Javid’s decision to sign the extradition order was framed in India as proof of Modi’s anti-corruption bonafides. The government also recently arranged the extradition from Dubai of Christian Michel, a British businessman who India alleges facilitated the payment of kickbacks as part of a defence supply deal.“Modi government clears one more step to get Mallya extradited while Opposition rallies around Saradha Scamsters,” tweeted the Indian finance minister, Arun Jaitley, in reference to an alleged financial fraud scandal playing out in the country’s east.Indian public outcry over Mallya was stoked by a lavish two-day 60th birthday party in 2015 for hundreds of guests at his Kingfisher Villa, a huge beachfront bungalow in Goa.The party, which reportedly cost more than $2m (£1.5m), included performances by the Bollywood singer Sonu Nigam and Enrique Iglesias, who sang on stage with Mallya."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9bb7caff362af4cb96195c6848c5ed7aaea3dd8/60_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=811fe9d5de7f84bb9ab8d4ff1f20cb9c","title":"tell us about the issues men face today","story":"From mental health to relationships, we’d like to hear from men of all ages about what they are really thinkingThe debate around modern-day masculinity has intensified in the wake of the #MeToo movement, and we are asking men to tell us what they are really thinking.As the role of men and women in society continue to change, so too do the dynamics from the workplace to the bedroom and everywhere in between.

Photograph: CollinsThe Government has proposed there should be new talks with nursing unions on issues relating to staffing levels but not pay as a way of resolving the current dispute involving nurses and midwives.In a joint statement on Monday, Minister for Health Simon Harris and the Minister for Public Expenditure Paschal Donohoe said they were disappointed that nearly 40,000 nurses and midwives were to stage further strikes on Tuesday and on Thursday this week.The HSE said the about 50,000 people would have scheduled appointments in hospitals and community services cancelled as a result of the work stoppages. The Ministers said that the Government was willing “to engage in talks on the range of workplace- related issues other than pay to try to resolve the dispute”. “ This initiative could focus on the contribution and arrangements for the further roll out of the ‘Safe Staffing Framework’ to improve staff and patient outcomes and reduce reliance on agency staffing in our hospitals. In addition, this engagement would encompass other relevant organisational issues appropriate to supporting quality and efficiency in the provision of patient service delivery in an integrated way. “Union sources said the “Safe Staffing Framework” was a piece of academic work carried out by University College Cork which suggested a staffing ratio of 80:20 between nurses and healthcare assistants. The Ministers said the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC)was willing to facilitate further engagement between nursing unions and ublic service management. The WRC has invited nursing unions and public service management to new talks in an attempt to avert further strikes by nurses and midwives scheduled for the days ahead.However the general secretary of the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation (INMO) Phil Ni Sheaghdha said the Ministers’ proposal was “the most cynical move I have seen in a long time”. She said the non-pay issues involving nursing had been addressed in an agreement brokered in 2017 but that health service management had not been able to fulfil the deal as it was unable to secure sufficient nurses to fill posts.Ms Ni Sheaghdha described the Minister’s proposal as “spin” and said it was hugely disrespectful. She said there had been no correspondence to the INMO about the Government proposal before nurses had seen details in the media. On Monday night , the INMO said it had still received no offer or proposal to reverse Tuesday’s strike. “Recycling broken promises is no way to build good-faith negotiations. The government’s press release refers to non-pay issues which are already agreed since 2017,” Ms Ní Sheaghdhasaid. She said nurses had identified excessive costs and wastage which could be used to address the pay issues. Ms Ni Sheaghdha said the INMO had identified costs which would be cut if more nurses and midwives could be attracted to work in the public health sector such as over €100m spent in 2018 on agency nurses, used to fill gaps left by vacant posts“None of these savings are included in the government’s €300m cost estimate, the INMO said. The Psychiatric Nurses Association said any talks that did not address pay would be of “no benefit” in resolving current nursing dispute.The HSE believes that about 50,000 people will be affected by the strike by nurses scheduled to take place on Tuesday.This is effectively double the number impacted directly by the previous work stoppage by nurses last Wednesday. As part of an escalation of the dispute, the strike on Tuesday will affect people with appointments for rehabilitation and respite services. Appointments for hospital in-patient operations, day case procedures and out-patient clinics will, with some exceptions, be cancelled for Tuesday.Nurses are also scheduled to stage another 24-hour work stoppage on Thursday.Meanwhile psychiatric nurses are to escalate their campaign of industrial action later this week, it has been announced. The Psychiatric Nurses Association (PNA) said an overtime ban, which was scheduled to be in place for 12 hours on Wednesday and Thursday, will now run through the full day.A 12-hour overtime ban will be in force on Tuesday.A spokesman for the PNA said he escalation of the industrial action would confirm “the absolute reliance of the mental health services in overtime, as well as the level of under-staffing”. Child and adolescent mental health services will be exempted from the industrial action.The PNA is also due to hold three consecutive days of strike action on February 12, 13 and 14 February at the same time as Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation. Elsewhere, emergency department doctors have warned that patients could deteriorate and even die during the nurses’ strike unless arrangements are made to promptly identify those most at risk on arrival at hospital.With members of the INMO set to stage two further one-day strikes this week, emergency department doctors say their concerns are growing over the lack of adequate triage arrangements for patients presenting during the strike.The Irish Association for Emergency Medicine says hospital emergency departments risk becoming “battlegrounds” during the dispute because of the difficulties in deciding which patients get prioritised.It warned of “very significant disruption” to emergency departments. The association’s president, Dr Emily O’Conor, repeated a call for the nursing union to grant a derogation to emergency departments during its industrial action. Failing that, she said the HSE needed to put in place a clear and properly-resourced alternative plan.The standard triage procedure operated in Irish hospitals, which is computer based, is entirely delivered by nurses, but during last week’s strike this function was provided manually by senior doctors in most hospitals.The INMO said its members were not providing triage during the strikes “as a matter of course”, but that last week nurses at two sites provided cover due to a surge in patient demand or emergency issues.The HSE said it was continuing to engage with the INMO to put in place arrangements for the safe provision of services in advance of Tuesday’s strike.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar on Sunday rejected calls for an independent review of the striking nurses’ pay claim, but said the Government does not intend to withhold payments due to them under public sector pay agreements.Mr Varadkar said he regretted the enormous inconvenience to patients caused by the strike. Even if the next one-day strike was to be called off, it would be too late to reverse the cancellation of thousands of patients’ appointments and procedures.Following a 24-hour stoppage last week almost 40,000 INMO members plan to hold one-day strikes on Tuesday and Thursday.The HSE said it expected all hospital outpatient, inpatient and day-surgery appointments scheduled for Tuesday to be cancelled.Members of the INMO are also planning work stoppages for three days the following week, on February 12th, 13th and 14th. On Saturday the union announced two extra days of strike action on February 19th and 21st.It is also increasing the number of nursing services on strike from 82 to 240 from Tuesday. Most of the additional strike sites are respite services for people with intellectual disabilities and day services for the elderly.The announcement followed a meeting of the INMO executive in Dublin on Saturday.Plans by the union to extend the dispute to GP out-of-hours services and community nursing services remains the subject of discussions with the HSE.The HSE said on Sunday it remained available to engage in any efforts to avert industrial action. Mr Harris expressed regret at the union’s decision to widen the strike.The INMO is seeking pay parity with other graduate-entry health professional grades such as physiotherapists who it maintains are paid about €7,000 more than nurses.The union argues such increases are necessary to deal with recruitment and retention issues in the health service.Further disruption in the health service is expected when hundreds of GPs take part in a protest outside the Dáil on Wednesday. The National Association of GPs is campaigning to have cuts imposed on family doctors during the economic downturn restored.A dispute involving some ambulance staff is expected to be escalated shortly, while industrial action by psychiatric nurses is ongoing."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3782112.1549315236!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"hse complains to google over myoptions ie website","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe HSE website: the fake website was run by an anti-abortion group.

Photograph: Dominic LipinskiPA WireThe Irish Government should not change its negotiating stance on Brexit, Scotland’s first minister Nicola Sturgeon has said, as she threw her support behind Taoiseach Leo Varadkar over the backstop.Speaking to The  in Washington DC, Ms Sturgeon said she did not believe the Government needed to be more flexible around its demands for a backstop, the insurance policy to avoid a hard border in Ireland, amid calls from London for Ireland to compromise on its demands.“I think Leo has been very, very clear from day one. His position has been very consistent and his position has been backed wholeheartedly by the European Union. I don’t think he could have been clearer about the reasons for the position he has taken.”She continued: “Generally the issues affecting the island of Ireland have been completely sidelined in the whole debate, since before the referendum even happened, and now you have a whole host of mainly conservative politicians in the UK that think that Ireland should somehow take second place.”Her remarks came ahead of a visit by Tánaiste Simon Coveney to the US this week during which he is due to meet key Irish-American figures on Capitol Hill amid growing concern about the direction of Brexit. Congressman Brendan Boyle introduced a resolution to Congress last week opposing the re-imposition of a hard border in Northern Ireland.Ms Sturgeon used a speech at Georgetown University in Washington on Monday to reiterate her call for a second referendum on EU membership.Describing the single market as a “great modern success story” which allows independent nations to take advantage of a market of 500 million people, she said: “to leave this successful developing market place makes no economic sense whatsoever.”She noted that Scotland’s exports to the European Union increased by 13 per cent in 2017, the last year for which figures are available – outstripping growth in exports to the rest of the United Kingdom.But while Scotland valued the practical benefits of EU membership, she said “we also value the principles that he EU exemplifies – that nations can and should co-operate as equals for the common good.”Ms Sturgeon highlighted the fact that Scotland had voted to remain in the European Union by 62 per cent to 38 per cent, claiming that it was now leaving the European Union “against our democratically expressed will”.“The United Kingdom is not a unitary state it is made up of four nations. Yet two parts of the UK – Scotland and Northern Ireland – voted to remain in the EU.”She said that the UK government “could have led discussions with the devolved nations and others about how to leave the EU” but instead the Scottish voice “had been ignored”.“Our interests have been sidelined. It is increasingly difficult, it is really impossible . . . the idea of the UK as an equal partnership of nations,” she said, accusing Theresa May’s government of taking “the most damaging approach” to Brexit.She said that Scotland had always had a positive relationship with the European Union.“These European connections have never really been particularly controversial in Scotland. Scotland has a very proud European tradition. We see ourselves as a European country . . . by and large we don’t see membership of the European Union as a threat to our own national sovereignty. On the contrary we see that membership as a way for independent countries to come together to work together collectively.”Ms Sturgeon said that she will reveal her thoughts on the timing of a second Scottish independence referendum in the coming weeks, claiming that Brexit had strengthened the case for Scottish independence.“The questions about the future of the UK, and whether the UK . . . can meet the interests of its component parts is more alive than it has ever been,” she said, arguing that Brexit will lead to a greater centralisation rather than devolution of power in Britain. “I think Scotland will become an independent country in the not too distant future.”She also called on British prime minister to rule out a no-deal departure from the European Union, calling the withdrawal negotiations “torturous”.“When the course you’ve been pursing has not led to successful outcomes in my view that should mean you change course,” she said, adding “there was nothing inevitable about the mess the Brexit process ended up in.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph:  Toshifumi KitamuraPool Photo via APGerman chancellor Angela Merkel has suggested a “creative” approach to Brexit talks could see outstanding backstop questions resolved in an agreement on a future EU-UK relationship.On a trip to Japan, Angela Merkel said there were “possibilities, no doubt” to maintain the integrity of the single market , a key EU demand , and avoiding checks on the Border.“We have an agreement for the future relationship and in this future relationship one can of course address the questions that now still have to be discussed, for instance the questions that have to do with the backstop,” she said.“There are no doubt possibilities to ensure, on the one hand, the integrity of the single market ... even when Northern Ireland’s doesn’t belong to it because it belongs to the UK, and the wish, if possible, to allow for no controls on the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland and to solve this point.”She said if the EU and UK listened to each other, and were “creative”, she had no doubt a No-Deal Brexit could be avoided. Talks to this effect “could and must” be held soon and re-opening the withdrawal treaty was “not on the order of business”. Instead it was now up to London to say what it wanted.Dr Merkel’s spokesman confirmed the German leader’ words, during a press conference in Tokyo.“The chancellor spoke of creativity in finding a solution, and meant it,” said Mr Steffen Seibert, to The . “The withdrawal agreement remains as it is however. But in talking about the future relationship we have to address the border question creatively.”The federal government in Berlin has consistently said it supports Dublin on Brexit, although there have been mixed signals of late. While Dr Merkel insists the Brexit deal is final and cannot be opened, her foreign minister Heiko Maas said last month that “the question of whether the deal should be re-opened ... needs to be discussed now”.Last month Dr Merkel said she would work “to the last day” to find a “responsible” Brexit treaty-based solution “so that in 50 years, people won’t shake their heads and say ‘why weren’t they able to find a compromise?’”On Dr Merkel’s comments, an Irish Government source said: “She is just saying what the European Commission and Irish Government have said all along.“She herself said the scope for the way forward is in the political declaration, not the withdrawal agreement.”Another source said it was a “hint” from Dr Merkel to the British “to focus on the future”.British prime minister Theresa May is expected to present further proposals on Brexit at a speech today in Northern Ireland.Meanwhile, former Ulster Unionist Party leader David Trimble has indicated he plans to take the British government to court to ensure the backstop is removed from the withdrawal agreement.“The Nobel Peace Prize winner and architect of the Good Friday Agreement plans to initiate judicial review proceedings to ensure that the Protocol is removed from the Withdrawal Agreement,” a spokesman said.Lord Trimble said that alternative arrangements should be put in place instead as he claims the protocol in Mrs May’s deal breaches the terms of the Belfast Agreement.Lord Trimble and John Hume, former leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party, jointly received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1998 for their roles in bringing about the Belfast Agreement.In Brussels, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said Ireland and the EU are prepared, and want to, provide backstop “reassurances and clarity to the UK to assist the Brexit ratification process on the UK side”. But he insisted that alternatives to the backstop had been exhaustively examined and tested.Mr Coveney was in Brussels for a meeting between EU foreign ministers and their Arab League counterparts.Asked if Mrs May’s search for alternatives to the backstop was futile, Mr Coveney said that “the Irish protocol in the WA already allows for ‘alternative arrangements’ or alternative solutions to the backstop and if they are there they can replace the backstop. That’s always been the point here. The problem has been that none of those ideas around alternative arrangements have actually stood up to scrutiny. We certainly haven’t seen any that have.“We spent well over a year looking at different ways of providing the guarantee of no physical infrastructure on the island of Ireland to protect the all-Ireland economy which reinforces the peace process. Many, many, many hours were involved in coming up with a legally credible and pragmatic solution to that problem.“And in that process we looked at lots of different alternative arrangements and ideas and I have yet to hear any new thinking that goes beyond what has already been tested. And this is the issue here. What Ireland is being asked to do by some in Westminster is to essentially do away with an agreed solution between the UK and EU negotiators and to replace it with wishful thinking.”Mrs May is to visit Belfast on Tuesday to deliver a Brexit speech and meet businesspeople.She is due to meet DUP leader Arlene Foster on Wednesday.“We want an orderly exit from the European Union which works for London, Dublin, Belfast and Brussels. It is possible but requires political will. This is not a time for intransigence,” Ms Foster said in a statement ahead of Mrs May’s visit.Mrs May is due to reiterate the British government’s commitment to avoiding a hard border in Ireland. She is also expected to explain why she is now seeking an alternative to the backstop .Mrs May originally urged political and business leaders in Northern Ireland to support her Brexit deal but after it was defeated in the House of Commons by 432 votes to 202 she then moved to try to find an alternative to the backstop.The British Labour Party’s Brexit spokesman Sir Keir Starmer who met business people, trade unions and the SDLP and Sinn Féin in Belfast on Monday, said he had detected “great anxiety” in Northern Ireland after Mrs May “voted against the backstop that she negotiated”.“That has raised levels of anxiety about a no deal outcome,” he told The  on Monday.And while Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has opposed the backstop, Sir Keir said it appeared that some form of backstop was now inevitable. He said: “We have got concerns with the backstop but we accept that a backstop is inevitable given that the prime minister has now run down the article 50 clock and nobody credibly thinks that a new treaty arrangement with the EU is going to be agreed by January 1st, 2021.“So we have concerns about the backstop but we now recognise that a backstop is now inevitable.” – Additional reporting: ReutersDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph Akos StillerThe New York TimesThe “Prespes agreement”, which brings into existence the newly named state of the “Republic of North Macedonia”, has been ratified by both the Skopje and Athens parliaments, despite vigorous opposition in both. Applauded internationally as an end to a 28-year period of prevarication and chicanery, it opens the way for North Macedonia to join both the EU and Nato. The opposition in both countries has inevitably been conditioned by sentimentalism – trying to cling to an outmoded past, unable to accept the compromise that would open the door to the future. For the Macedonians, both the carrot and the stick have been the imperative of modernisation along western lines, just as they have been in Greece since its independence caused the first major upheaval in the Balkans.The effect of the Prespes agreement is not merely to give Macedonia a new name, nor even to assuage Greek fears by removing irredentist clauses from the Macedonian constitution. In fact, it opens more cans of worms than it closes. The next major eruptions in the Balkans will be in Kosovo (the ethnic Albanian semi-autonomous region at the centre of the Balkans which may, or may not, be part of Serbia depending on which foot you dig with), and Bosnia, where Serbs, Croats and Muslims (Bosniaks) are jostling for position in the self-determination stakes.Turkey, too, is a player in this game, with the declared ambition of Recep Tayyip Erdogan to create a Muslim community throughout the Balkans.While these may not seem of immediate relevance to Greece, they underline the fragility of borders, languages, ethnicities and cultures within the entire region, in which Greece is inextricably rooted, whether or not it pursues its own future in the EU and the West.Macedonians remain ided, as are many Greeks, by the question of whether or not they want to be “westernised”, which will inevitably mean relinquishing cherished elements of their identity. As with all future-oriented decisions, the question “How much of our past are we prepared to lose?” is more than merely sentimental.Migrants and refugees, such as those from Syria or Afghanistan, carry into the unknown a knapsack of memories as their key to an identity on which they will otherwise have only a tenuous lien. Migrants within their own borders also cling to memory embedded in the collective experience of the past. The Balkans have always been a melting pot of identities on the move.How any country defines itself in the international community – by its name, its borders, its culture, its language, its relationship with its neighbours – is central to its ability to tell its own story. All of these have been crucial factors in the 28-year Macedonian-Greek standoff. The votes in both countries represent a redrawing of the domestic and international maps.Due to the kaleidoscope of history, Macedonia is multiethnic: Slav, Albanian, Vlach, Bulgarian and Roma. It is not helped by the fact that in Greek “ethnos” means “nation” and “ethnic” means “national”, with the danger that nationalists are prone to exclude from their community any who do not conform to their own ethnicity.Both the Greeks and the Macedonians have been appealing to the intangible: what makes them Greek, what makes them Macedonian, because each is a reflection, and a denial, of the other. The essential definitions have been up for grabs, and the outcome is, in effect, a lose-lose situation for everyone. For decades, Greece denied that there was a Macedonian language, a concession it has now had to make. North Macedonia, in order to get its name, has had to relinquish any claim it has on ethnic Macedonians living within the borders of Greece.One outcome is that there are now two Macedonias: one, the fledgling republic, the other the northern Greek region of Macedonia which includes Thessaloniki, Greece’s second city, which has in fact been part of Greece only since the first major boundary-breaking crisis of 1912-1913. And, to cap it all, the president of the new republic, Gjorgy Ivanov, refuses to sign the agreement into law, so that technically he is president of a country that does not yet exist and of which he does not wish to be president.Imagine if, in 1922, the Six Counties had been nominated as “North Ulster”, leaving Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan as another “Ulster” after the bargaining over boundaries had concluded. Both sides have learnt that you cannot rewrite the facts of history, but you can change the way they are interpreted. I think of the apocryphal Englishman in Thurles railway station, irascibly asking why two clocks told different times, to which the stationmaster replied “What would be the point of having two clocks, if they both told the same time?”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3782109.1549315284!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"may to vow during northern ireland visit to keep border open","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIain Duncan Smith and Theresa Villiers arrive at the cabinet office in Westminster for a meeting of the Alternative Arrangements Working Group to examine the Malthouse compromise.

But we will find a way to deliver Brexit that honours our commitments to Northern Ireland that commands broad support across the community in Northern Ireland and that secures a majority in the Westminster parliament, which is the best way to deliver for the people of Northern Ireland,” she is expected to say.In her speech on Tuesday afternoon, Mrs May will call for a renewed effort to restore the Assembly and Executive at Stormont, which have been suspended for more than two years.\u0026nbsp“I\u0026nbsphope we can also take steps to move towards the restoration of devolution so that politicians in Northern Ireland can get back to work on the issues that matter to the people they represent. For ultimately, the measure of this moment in Northern Ireland’s history must be more than whether we avoid a return to the challenges of the past,” she is expected to say.\u0026nbspFormer first minister David Trimble said on Monday he was planning to take legal proceedings against the British government to remove the Northern Ireland protocol, including the backstop, from the withdrawal agreement. He believes the protocol is in breach of some provisions of the Belfast Agreement which he helped to negotiate in 1998.Mrs May is seeking to reopen the Brexit deal she agreed with the EU last November after MPs voted last week to support it on condition the backstop is replaced with “alternative measures” to keep the Border open. Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay on Monday started at least three days of talks with Conservative MPs to consider technological and administrative alternatives to the backstop.Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said in Brussels that Ireland and the EU were willing to provide backstop “reassurances and clarity to the UK to assist the Brexit ratification process on the UK side”.

Photograph: Andy RainEPATheresa May arrives in Northern Ireland on Tuesday as her government is engaged in an elaborate game of make-believe with its own MPs over Brexit and the Border.After the first of at least three meetings with backbenchers this week, a spokesman for Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay said they had “detailed and constructive” discussions aimed at finding common ground on the backstop.The common ground favoured by the backbenchers has been mapped out in the so-called Malthouse compromise, which calls for the backstop to be replaced by a tariff-free trade area with maximum facilitation of customs. If the EU is unable to accede to this change, the Malthouse compromisers propose a three-year transition period while London and Brussels renegotiate the withdrawal agreement.The prime minister has also tasked attorney general Geoffrey Cox to formulate proposals to introduce a time limit or a unilateral exit mechanism to the backstop.Viewed from Brussels, every part of the Malthouse compromise is out of the question, from its attempt to reheat rejected ideas for technological border solutions to the demand for a standstill transition without a withdrawal agreement. The EU has also rejected a time limit and a unilateral exit mechanism for the backstop but could be open to offering legally binding assurances that do not require a renegotiation of the text of the withdrawal agreement.Eurosceptic Conservative MP Steve Baker warned on Sunday that he and his Brexiteer allies would reject any compromise with the EU that did not involve replacing the backstop with the Malthouse compromise. This reinforced the view in Brussels that the majority of MPs who voted to back the Brexit deal if the backstop is changed was a freak majority that May will be unable to sustain.This means that when the prime minister presents her proposals to the EU in the coming days, she is unlikely to find any appetite for compromise on the other side.Instead, the EU will wait until after MPs vote on February 14th on a number of amendments, probably including one that could oblige May’s government to delay Brexit rather than leave without a deal on March 29th.Such an outcome will lead the prime minister into another negotiation with Brussels, this time about the duration and terms of any extension of the article 50 deadline. There is no incentive for the EU to either make any changes to the backstop before then or to indulge the wilder ideas emerging from the Conservative backbenches.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Toby MelvilleConservative MPs have started at least three days of talks with ministers and officials over “alternative arrangements” to the Northern Ireland backstop that have already been dismissed in Brussels as unrealistic. Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay met Brexiteers and Remainers in the so-called Alternative Arrangements Working Group to consider how existing technological and administrative measures could ensure that the Irish Border will remain open after Brexit. “The secretary of state met with senior MPs and their advisers to explore in detail the proposals put forward last week in the Malthouse compromise. Discussions were detailed and constructive and the first step of a process to find common ground on the issue of the backstop. There will be subsequent meetings tomorrow and coming days,” a spokesman said.Named after junior minister Kit Malthouse, the Malthouse compromise calls for the backstop to be replaced by a tariff-free trade area with maximum facilitation of customs. Conservative Brexiteers and the Democratic Unionist Party, who last week voted for a government-approved amendment that endorsed Theresa May’s Brexit deal on condition that the backstop was replaced, back the Malthouse compromise.The prime minister plans to present a proposal to the EU based on finding “alternative arrangements” and introducing a time limit or a unilateral exit mechanism to the backstop. The EU rejected all three options during the negotiations on the withdrawal agreement and Labour’s Hilary Benn, who chairs the Commons Brexit committee, said it was too late to seek alternatives to the backstop such as those envisaged in the Malthouse compromise.“A lot of it to me, I have to say, personally, looks very familiar if you go back to last summer when people looked at technology and trusted traders and all of that, and a great deal of effort was put into examining those as a possible way forward,” he said. “The conclusion that was reached I think on behalf of the British government and the European Union was that well, it’s not going to work,” he said. “Personally I don’t see how it can work, particularly in the very short amount of time that there is left.”Business secretary Greg Clark revealed on Monday that the British government promised Nissan that its operations in Britain would not be adversely affected by Brexit. The car company said at the weekend that it was abandoning plans to produce a new vehicle at its Sunderland plant, citing uncertainty about Brexit as one of the factors that influenced the decision.In a letter to Nissan’s then chief executive Carlos Ghosn in 2016, Mr Clarke promised a £61 million financial package if the company made the investment it has now decided to abandon.“The government fully recognises the significance of the EU market to your presence in Sunderland. It will be a critical priority of our negotiation to support UK car manufacturers and ensure that their ability to export to and from the EU is not adversely affected by the UK’s future relationship with the EU,” he said.Nissan will now have to reapply for the financial aid, the promise of which was not disclosed until Monday. Mr Clark told the House of Commons he was “disappointed” the 740 jobs earmarked for Sunderland would not be coming.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

Most, though, were already self-harming and went online “to make sense of their behaviours”.What they experienced online, however, largely normalised their harming so that it became “a routine, everyday activity”, said the researchers. The children were also able to discover and share new practices and techniques.“They became motivated to engage in further harm … the exposure to other iniduals’ severe acts made them want to become better self-harmers,” the study reports.One woman, aged 19, told researchers she was left feeling one small cut was “not nearly good enough”.The researchers discovered a “sense of competition”. One woman, aged 23, said she chided herself when she saw images: “Why can’t I do it like that?”Tumblr was cited as the favoured site because it was easy to search and find images, enabled image sharing and was “not encumbered by the monitoring and intervention by other social media and microblogging sites”, said the study. Instagram also featured.What to do if you find out your child is self-harmingDr Nina Jacob, who led the research, said: “The lack of scrutiny and moderation, where you can purportedly ‘do what the hell you like’, together with perceived anonymity, meant the site was considered more authentic than alternative platforms.”One 19-year-old woman told researchers: “Kids as young as 12 can use it … and there’s a big self-harm community on there. I got sucked into it and it did sort of increase the intensity of my self-harm again.”In the study approved by the university’s ethics committee, the researchers displayed ads on 42,000 Facebook accounts, before 21 self-harmers – 18 girls and 3 boys – aged 16 to 24 volunteered for in-depth interviews.Three quarters were attracted to sites that provided self-harming images. One described them as “triggering a rush like an addictive high”.Dr Jon Goldin, vice-chairman of the child and adolescent faculty at the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said: “When people look up the words ‘self-harm’ they should be directed to helpful sites which offer guidance and support, not to images of people hurting themselves,” he said.How to get help | Do you need someone to talk to?Tumblr refused to say how many moderators it employed but said it had teams to quickly take down any material that violated its rules by glorifying self-harm, and worked with charities and mental health experts to provide advice that automatically popped up when people put in self-harm searches.Victoria McCullough, Tumblr director of social impact and policy, said: “Research has shown that deletion of content posted by iniduals struggling with mental health issues can have the unintended consequence of ostracising them and preventing them from seeking out the support they need. Together with government and advocacy leaders, we’re working to develop innovative approaches that help those in need.”Duty of Care CampaignSeven reported dead and many injured in Paris apartment fireUS envoy to hold talks in North Korea on WednesdayBritish lawyer among four skiers killed by avalanche near Courmayeur in Italian Alps UK funded early warning system detects chickenpox outbreak in Cox\u0026#39s Bazar Nearly half of GPs would want assisted death, poll suggests  Children get relationship lessons to help combat grooming and self harm risks on social mediaDavid Trimble to launch legal challenge against Theresa May\u0026#39s Brexit deal in next few daysTeachers Training to Kill, review: a sobering look at the campaign to give teachers gunsDon McCullin: Looking for England, BBC Four, review:Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil, episode 2 review: it turns out the Brussels bureaucrats are making the biggest decisions on almost no sleepMoney does not make people happier, first official figures showFemale entrepreneurs get 157 times less funding than men, Treasury report findsChris Grayling: Blame Brussels, not Britain, if we crash out of the EU without a deal100-year-old Nazi camp survivor was mugged because she looked vulnerable, court hearsComment: The tragedy of Venezuela shows us how dangerous Jeremy Corbyn and his acolytes really are Parents of missing student Libby Squire make plea for her return as they beg daughter to \u0026#39get in touch\u0026#39Business Secretary faces backlash after secret £80m Brexit sweetener he offered to Nissan is leakedHow Nissan\u0026#39s X-Trail U-turn in Sunderland left Clark fighting to save his reputationIndonesian artists protest against plan to ban \u0026#39negative foreign influence\u0026#39 in musicLabour\u0026#39s general secretary claims it is \u0026#39impossible\u0026#39 to completely rid party of anti-Semitism amid fresh stand-off with MPs Children commit half of knife crime, Scotland Yard figures revealWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"kumbh mela worlds largest religious gathering pictures","story":"Thousands of Hindu devout arrive to take a dip at Sangam, the confluence of three sacred rivers the Yamuna, the Ganges and the mythical Saraswati, on Monday, as part of the Kumbh Mela or Pitcher Festival, in Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh state, IndiaSeven reported dead and many injured in Paris apartment fireUS envoy to hold talks in North Korea on WednesdayBritish lawyer among four skiers killed by avalanche near Courmayeur in Italian Alps UK funded early warning system detects chickenpox outbreak in Cox\u0026#39s Bazar Nearly half of GPs would want assisted death, poll suggests  Children get relationship lessons to help combat grooming and self harm risks on social mediaDavid Trimble to launch legal challenge against Theresa May\u0026#39s Brexit deal in next few daysTeachers Training to Kill, review: a sobering look at the campaign to give teachers gunsDon McCullin: Looking for England, BBC Four, review:Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil, episode 2 review: it turns out the Brussels bureaucrats are making the biggest decisions on almost no sleepMoney does not make people happier, first official figures showFemale entrepreneurs get 157 times less funding than men, Treasury report findsChris Grayling: Blame Brussels, not Britain, if we crash out of the EU without a deal100-year-old Nazi camp survivor was mugged because she looked vulnerable, court hearsComment: The tragedy of Venezuela shows us how dangerous Jeremy Corbyn and his acolytes really are Parents of missing student Libby Squire make plea for her return as they beg daughter to \u0026#39get in touch\u0026#39Business Secretary faces backlash after secret £80m Brexit sweetener he offered to Nissan is leakedHow Nissan\u0026#39s X-Trail U-turn in Sunderland left Clark fighting to save his reputationIndonesian artists protest against plan to ban \u0026#39negative foreign influence\u0026#39 in musicLabour\u0026#39s general secretary claims it is \u0026#39impossible\u0026#39 to completely rid party of anti-Semitism amid fresh stand-off with MPs Children commit half of knife crime, Scotland Yard figures revealWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 4 february 2019","story":"A double Header steam train on the Winter Cumbrian Express travelling over Ribblehead Viaduct, from Carlisle to Settle in the Late afternoon sun.

The size of the market for alternatives is still tiny compared with the global meat market, but there are signs the meat industry is watching closely.\u0026nbspIn the US, the beef industry has filed a petition to exclude non-animal products from the definition of meat, while the French have passed a law banning vegetarian companies from calling their products sausages, mince or bacon.\u0026nbspWhen Sean Monson, the producer of Earthlings, co-produced another film about animal rights abuses in 2018 called Dominion, groups in the meat sector reacted angrily. Patrick Hutchinson, the chief executive of the Australian Meat Industry Council, said the film was an “upsetting” representation of the industry. “What the film shows is not representative of the practices of the wider industry,” Hutchinson says. “The vast majority of their employees are deeply committed to ensuring the most humane experience possible for animals.”Veganuary finishes with record number of participantsBut Kavanagh says that even as a butcher, he was shielded from the worst practices in the industry. He got into the trade at 16 after seeing a job with a family-run shop advertised at the job centre. “When the first meat van came in, it had the first quarter of a pig with the head still on. I remember thinking I was going to throw up, but you just kind of get used to it,” he says. He stayed with the family butcher and moved on to Morrisons when it closed down, clocking 20 years in the trade.\u0026nbspAt Sgaia’s, Kavanagh is in charge of running the kitchen, keeping up with orders and experimenting with new recipes. He has just developed a square sausage recipe using similar spices he used to use in meat sausages, but switching out the animal protein for gluten and soy.\u0026nbspNext, the company is working on vegan black pudding to add to its growing range of vegan burgers, bacon, pepperoni slices and even steak. “It’s been interesting to use my knowledge for something different,” he says. “The meat all gets sliced the same way in a meat slicer, which I have been using for more than a decade, and after all that practise with sausages, I am pretty fast with a knife.”Founders Masin and Casotto, who both have Italian heritage, started making vegan meat from their home kitchen in Wales in 2013. “We’re really into making food,” Masin says. “After we turned vegan we tried to make salamino for our pizza, which is a kind of ham, and then it became more and more like a challenge to research the way these meats are cured and stored.”\u0026nbspThe business partners started to sell their products at festivals and markets, which led to enquiries from shops and cafes. Masin still remembers the panic when they got the first 14 orders through their website, before they knew how to pack the products and ship them out. “I was studying at university at the time and Aberto called me and said, ‘We can’t do this, it’s too much.’”12 best vegan shoes for womenAfter sell-out appearances at vegan festivals, Sgaia’s moved to Glasgow where it has been supported by a small business growth grant from Paisley Council to take on a catering kitchen and office space. In January, the company sold 5,000 units and 500kg of fake meat products through a handful of ethical suppliers, including Suma, Marigold Health Foods and Greencity Wholefoods, and the company website, which reads: “We don’t make fake meats: they are real, just vegan.”Many vegan meat or food technology companies are trying to get their products stocked in the meat aisles at supermarkets, where environmentally-conscious customers will be confronted with the dilemma of which product to buy. In the US, Beyond Meat has created a burger made principally of yellow pea protein that mimics the texture and taste of meat, with the intention that supermarkets sell the product alongside animal protein. In July, Sainsbury’s trialled stocking plant-based products in refrigerators alongside slaughtered meat.\u0026nbspMasin says the barrier for smaller competitors such as\u0026nbspSgaia’s\u0026nbspis not where plant-based products are stocked, but how hard it is to comply with complex safety rules and to produce at scale. “We’ve been contacted by the major retailers, but because we’re so small it’s difficult for them to work with us,” Masin says. “When the quantity is there, we will look at it.”After two decades in the meat industry, Kavanagh is enjoying working with a much smaller company. He mostly keeps his veganism to himself, apart from when he is manning the pop-up kitchen at vegan festivals, where customers are amazed by his butcher past: “If you’re working for a supermarket, it’s all about profits, basically – whereas this is about making a difference.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In the unlikely event of a no-deal Brexit, the sector likely will slide into another recession, amid weaker business confidence and tighter credit conditions. But provided a deal is signed off, the construction sector likely will enjoy strong growth soon.”Construction accounts for around 6 per cent of the UK economy.The first official estimate of growth in the final quarter of 2018 will be released next week with many analysts expecting a sharp slowdown to 0.2-0.3 per cent from 0.6 per cent growth in the third quarter.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Couriers that join the union will benefit from full representation.But David Greenhalgh, head of the employment practice at law firm Joelson, said the\u0026nbspdeal was\u0026nbspnot the landmark precedent claimed by GMB.Hermes’ decision is more reactionary than anything, coming after a tribunal decision which found its drivers to be workers, Mr Greenhalgh said.\u0026nbspFor Hermes drivers, they now at least know where they stand, but the pressure for other gig economy companies to follow suit will be reputational rather than on the back of a new legal precedent having been set.”GMB and Hermes sign deal over gig economy workers Varnish’s treatment should make us reconsider our taste for gloryUber drivers are entitled to workers’ rights, says landmark rulingNational Gallery tribunal sets precedent for public-sector gig workersDrivers for Deliveroo and Uber are among a growing number of gig economy workers fighting to have their employment status recognised so they can secure basic rights such as holiday pay, a guaranteed minimum wage and the right to collectively bargain.Hermes is “showing that the gig economy doesn’t have to be an exploitative economy and we look forward to working with them through this groundbreaking agreement,” said GMB general secretary\u0026nbspTim Roache. “Other employers should take notice, this is how it’s done.”Jason Moyer-Lee, general secretary of the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain, hailed the collective-bargaining agreement as a victory for trade union representation in the so-called gig economy.He added: However, despite having lost an earlier tribunal case establishing that its couriers are entitled to employment rights, Hermes is only offering paid holidays to those who opt in.Because of the inequality of bargaining power and the ability to companies to induce or threaten workers out of rights, employment law cannot be treated as optional.”Close to 3 million people working in the UK’s gig economy, according to a February 2018 report from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS).This means they do not have the security of guaranteed hours, pay as well as employment benefits. Several gig economy firms have said this gives workers\u0026nbspflexibility over when and how much they work.

The budget airline reported an 8 per cent year-on-year increase in passengers, while revenue also rose by 9 per cent to hit €1.5bn.

The group was hit by a series of strikes by pilots and cabin crew which grounded hundreds of flights last summer, and was forced to increase wages.Chief executive Michael O’Leary said that while the loss was disappointing,\u0026nbsp“we take comfort that this was entirely due to weaker than expected air fares so our customers are enjoying record low prices, which is good for current and future traffic growth”.The airline said the risk of a no-deal Brexit “remains worryingly high”, and added: “While we hope that common sense will prevail, and lead to either a delay in Brexit, or agreement on the 21 month transition deal currently on the table, we have taken all necessary steps to protect Ryanair’s business in a no-deal environment.”\u0026nbspGeorge Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “Ryanair is licking its wounds after a difficult 2018 that saw extra competition drive down prices and higher staff and compensation costs push expenses up.Created with Sketch.Ryanair: strikes and cancellations cause travel chaos Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Ryanair airline workers shout slogans during a small protest during the first of two days of a cabin crew strike at Adolfo Suarez-Barajas international airport in Madrid in JulyEmpty Ryanair check-in counter at El Prat airport in BarcelonaRyanair employees hold up signs in English and Spanish on the first day of a cabin crew strike in Palma de MallorcaRyanair airplanes stand idle on the tarmacIrish Ryanair pilots outside the company headquarters at Swords in Dublin, as they stage their fourth one-day strike with their union, ForsaA woman sits at a Ryanair airline check-in desk after her flight to Pisa, Italy, was cancelledRyanair employees protest at the entrance of the airport in MalagaStranded Ryanair passengers line up for information at the airport in ValenciaEmployees of Ryanair\u0027s customer service department wear T-shirts with a slogan \u0027Ryanair Must Change\u0027 during the first day of strike of the company\u0027s cabin crew members at Brussels South airport in Charleroi, Belgium, in 25Cabin crew workers for low-cost airline Ryanair went on strike in four European countries over working conditions in July, forcing thousands of passengers to make last-minute travel adjustments at the peak of the summer holiday seasonRyanair Chief Executive Michael O\u0027Leary addresses a news conference in Schwechat, AustriaRyanair employees hold up signs at the airport in Palma de MallorcaPeople queue at the Ryanair airline customer service desk during the first of two days cabin crew strikeRyanair personnel stand at Brussels Airport in Zaventem, during a strike of cabin personnel Ryanair\u0027s customer service department gather behind a banner reading: \u0027Ryanair On Strike - Respect Us!

In the unlikely event of a no-deal Brexit, the sector likely will slide into another recession, amid weaker business confidence and tighter credit conditions. But provided a deal is signed off, the construction sector likely will enjoy strong growth soon.”Construction accounts for around 6 per cent of the UK economy.The first official estimate of growth in the final quarter of 2018 will be released next week with many analysts expecting a sharp slowdown to 0.2-0.3 per cent from 0.6 per cent growth in the third quarter.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The treatment, that works similarly to a vaccine, is a combination of two existing drugs, of which tiny amounts are injected into the solid bulk of a tumour. 1843 Babies\u0027 health suffers from being born near fracking sites, finds major studyMothers living within a kilometre of a fracking site were 25 per cent more likely to have a child born at low birth weight, which increase their chances of asthma, ADHD and other issues1943 NHS reviewing thousands of cervical cancer smear tests after women wrongly given all-clearThousands of cervical cancer screening results are under review after failings at a laboratory meant some women were incorrectly given the all-clear. A number of women have already been told to contact their doctors following the identification of “procedural issues” in the service provided by Pathology First Laboratory.2043 Potential key to halting breast cancer\u0027s spread discovered by scientistsMost breast cancer patients do not die from their initial tumour, but from secondary malignant growths (metastases), where cancer cells are able to enter the blood and survive to invade new sites. Asparagine, a molecule named after asparagus where it was first identified in high quantities, has now been shown to be an essential ingredient for tumour cells to gain these migratory properties.2143 NHS nursing vacancies at record high with more than 34,000 roles advertisedA record number of nursing and midwifery positions are currently being advertised by the NHS, with more than 34,000 positions currently vacant, according to the latest data. Demand for nurses was 19 per cent higher between July and September 2017 than the same period two years ago.2243 Cannabis extract could provide ‘new class of treatment’ for psychosisCBD has a broadly opposite effect to delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main active component  in cannabis and the substance that causes paranoia and anxiety.2343 Over 75,000 sign petition calling for Richard Branson\u0027s Virgin Care to hand settlement money back to NHSMr Branson’s company sued the NHS last year after it lost out on an £82m contract to provide children’s health services across Surrey, citing concerns over “serious flaws” in the way the contract was awarded2443 More than 700 fewer nurses training in England in first year after NHS bursary scrappedThe numbers of people accepted to study nursing in England fell 3 per cent in 2017, while the numbers accepted in Wales and Scotland, where the bursaries were kept, increased 8.4 per cent and 8 per cent respectively2543 Landmark study links Tory austerity to 120,000 deathsThe paper found that there were 45,000 more deaths in the first four years of Tory-led efficiencies than would have been expected if funding had stayed at pre-election levels.Hours of commuting may be mind-numbingly dull, but new research shows that it might also be having an adverse effect on both your health and performance at work.  Longer commutes also appear to have a significant impact on mental wellbeing, with those commuting longer 33 per cent more likely to suffer from depression2743 You cannot be fit and fatIt is not possible to be overweight and healthy, a major new study has concluded. The study of 3.5 million Britons found that even “metabolically healthy” obese people are still at a higher risk of heart disease or a stroke than those with a normal weight rangeWhen you feel particularly exhausted, it can definitely feel like you are also lacking in brain capacity. Now, a new study has suggested this could be because chronic sleep deprivation can actually cause the brain to eat itselfDavid Lloyd Gyms have launched a new health and fitness class which is essentially a bunch of people taking a nap for 45 minutes. The fitness group was spurred to launch the ‘napercise’ class after research revealed 86 per cent of parents said they were fatigued. The class is therefore predominantly aimed at parents but you actually do not have to have children to take part3043 \u0027Fundamental right to health\u0027 to be axed after Brexit, lawyers warnTobacco and alcohol companies could win more easily in court cases such as the recent battle over plain cigarette packaging if the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights is abandoned, a barrister and public health professor have said.3143 \u0027Thousands dying\u0027 due to fear over non-existent statin side-effectsA major new study into the side effects of the cholesterol-lowering medicine suggests common symptoms such as muscle pain and weakness are not caused by the drugs themselves3243 Babies born to fathers aged under 25 have higher risk of autismNew research has found that babies born to fathers under the age of 25 or over 51 are at higher risk of developing autism and other social disorders. The study, conducted by the Seaver Autism Center for Research and Treatment at Mount Sinai, found that these children are actually more advanced than their peers as infants, but then fall behind by the time they hit their teenage years.3343 Cycling to work ‘could halve risk of cancer and heart disease’Commuters who swap their car or bus pass for a bike could cut their risk of developing heart disease and cancer by almost half, new research suggests – but campaigners have warned there is still an “urgent need” to improve road conditions for cyclists.3443 Playing Tetris in hospital after a traumatic incident could prevent PTSDScientists conducted the research on 71 car crash victims as they were waiting for treatment at one hospital’s accident and emergency department. They asked half of the patients to briefly recall the incident and then play the classic computer game, the others were given a written activity to complete. The researchers, from Karolinska Institute in Sweden and the University of Oxford, found that the patients who had played Tetris reported fewer intrusive memories, commonly known as flashbacks, in the week that followed3543 Vaping backed as healthier nicotine alternative to cigarettes after latest studyVaping has been given an emphatic thumbs up by health experts after the first long-term study of its effects in ex-smokers.3643 Common method of cooking rice can leave traces of arsenic in food, scientists warnMillions of people are putting themselves at risk by cooking their rice incorrectly, scientists have warned.3743 Contraceptive gel that creates ‘reversible vasectomy’ shown to be effective in monkeysAn injectable contraceptive gel that acts as a ‘reversible vasectomy’ is a step closer to being offered to men following successful trials on monkeys.3843 Shift work and heavy lifting may reduce women’s fertility, study findsWomen who work at night or do irregular shifts may experience a decline in fertility, a new study has found.3943 Japanese government tells people to stop overworkingThe Japanese government has announced measures to limit the amount of overtime employees can do – in an attempt to stop people literally working themselves to death.4043 High blood pressure may protect over 80s from dementiaIt is well known that high blood pressure is a risk factor for dementia, so the results of a new study from the University of California, Irvine, are quite surprising. The researchers found that people who developed high blood pressure between the ages of 80-89 are less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease (the most common form of dementia) over the next three years than people of the same age with normal blood pressure.4143 \u0027Universal cancer vaccine’ breakthrough claimed by expertsScientists have taken a “very positive step” towards creating a universal vaccine against cancer that makes the body’s immune system attack tumours as if they were a virus, experts have said. Writing in Nature, an international team of researchers described how they had taken pieces of cancer’s genetic RNA code, put them into tiny nanoparticles of fat and then injected the mixture into the bloodstreams of three patients in the advanced stages of the disease. The patients\u0027 immune systems responded by producing killer T-cells designed to attack cancer. The vaccine was also found to be effective in fighting “aggressively growing” tumours in mice, according to researchers, who were led by Professor Ugur Sahin from Johannes Gutenberg University in Germany4243 Research shows that diabetes drug can be used to stop first signs of Parkinson’sScientists in a new study show that the first signs of Parkinson’s can be stopped. The UCL study is still in its research period but the team are ‘excited’. Today’s Parkinson’s drugs manage the symptoms of the disease but ultimately do not stop its progression in the brain.4343 Drinking alcohol could reduce risk of diabetesA new study shows that drinking alcohol three to four days a week could reduce the risk of diabetes. Wine was found to be most effective in reducing the risk due to the chemical compounds that balance blood sugar levels. 143 Cancer breath test to be trialled in BritainThe breath biopsy device is designed to detect cancer hallmarks in molecules exhaled by patients243 Average 10 year old has consumed the recommended amount of sugar for an adult By their 10th birthdy, children have on average already eaten more sugar than the recommended amount for an 18 year old.

Couriers that join the union will benefit from full representation.But David Greenhalgh, head of the employment practice at law firm Joelson, said the\u0026nbspdeal was\u0026nbspnot the landmark precedent claimed by GMB.Hermes’ decision is more reactionary than anything, coming after a tribunal decision which found its drivers to be workers, Mr Greenhalgh said.\u0026nbspFor Hermes drivers, they now at least know where they stand, but the pressure for other gig economy companies to follow suit will be reputational rather than on the back of a new legal precedent having been set.”GMB and Hermes sign deal over gig economy workers Varnish’s treatment should make us reconsider our taste for gloryUber drivers are entitled to workers’ rights, says landmark rulingNational Gallery tribunal sets precedent for public-sector gig workersDrivers for Deliveroo and Uber are among a growing number of gig economy workers fighting to have their employment status recognised so they can secure basic rights such as holiday pay, a guaranteed minimum wage and the right to collectively bargain.Hermes is “showing that the gig economy doesn’t have to be an exploitative economy and we look forward to working with them through this groundbreaking agreement,” said GMB general secretary\u0026nbspTim Roache. “Other employers should take notice, this is how it’s done.”Jason Moyer-Lee, general secretary of the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain, hailed the collective-bargaining agreement as a victory for trade union representation in the so-called gig economy.He added: However, despite having lost an earlier tribunal case establishing that its couriers are entitled to employment rights, Hermes is only offering paid holidays to those who opt in.Because of the inequality of bargaining power and the ability to companies to induce or threaten workers out of rights, employment law cannot be treated as optional.”Close to 3 million people working in the UK’s gig economy, according to a February 2018 report from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS).This means they do not have the security of guaranteed hours, pay as well as employment benefits. Several gig economy firms have said this gives workers\u0026nbspflexibility over when and how much they work.

Debate in the European parliament is a joke. Neither system is perfect, but they can learn from each other, writes Jon Stone\u0026nbspClick to followThe IndependentFarage and Jean-Claude Juncker: the former Ukip leader is a master of the grandstand-to-viral-video formulaThis is not the House of Commons, this is the European parliament.” These were the words deputy speaker Mairead McGuinness used on Wednesday to tell off former Ukip MEPs shouting down another member during a debate in Brussels.The Brexit crisis has put the House of Commons in the international spotlight more than ever, and the chamber ides opinion. To some like McGuiness, the Commons’ boisterous atmosphere and over-the-top shouting is a sign that MPs do not take things things seriously. It is criticised as being an archaic, hostile environment that disadvantages anyone who doesn’t take a macro approach to politics – often women.Others speak highly of the drama of Britain’s mother of parliaments and sigh wearily at the dour debates in other legislatures like the European parliament. Many foreign observers who watch the Commons for the first time are captivated. An amazed American friend once genuinely asked me whether he was watching footage “from a movie”. Prime minister’s questions features regularly on US political channel C-Span and makes far more appearances there than any other foreign legislature – because it is so watchable.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialI covered Westminster for years and made the jump to Brussels in 2017. I arrived with high expectations of the European parliament, expecting a modern legislature that was rationally designed rather than evolved through the centuries. Not every expectation was met: after a year and a half of working in the EU capital I believe Brussels is better than Westminster in some respects – but worse in others.Let’s start with the bad: what passes for “debate” in Brussels is a joke, and beyond awful. In Westminster the format for asking questions to a minister is designed to put them on the ropes – they get quizzed by their opposition counterpart and have to give an answer immediately after they are asked. Then there are follow-ups. Backbenchers can raise questions afterwards. If the minister doesn’t give good answers, they look stupid or evasive. It is not uncommon for answers to be newsworthy sometimes unintentionally.Drop Brexit red lines to ‘avoid backstop’, EU parliament to urgeNot so in Brussels: first, MEPs ask their questions. Then, after all the questions have been asked, the commissioner does a single summing up speech in response where he picks the questions he likes and pretends uncomfortable ones didn’t exist. There is practically zero scrutiny applied, and the system incentivises MEPs to do a piece of grandstanding to camera, so their clip can be shared on Facebook later and get 17 likes.\u0026nbspSome MEPs are better at exploiting this dynamic than others. Pro-Europeans in the UK would do well to remember that it was the European parliament, not Westminster, that gave Nigel Farage his platform to rail against the EU. The former Ukip leader is a master at the grandstand-to-viral-video formula: one extended clip of him insulting former European Council president Herman Van Rompuy (“You have all the charisma of a damp rag and the appearance of a low-grade bank clerk.”) is perhaps the single most popular clip in the history of the Parliament. It has several million views across dozens of different uploads on YouTube and other streaming sites and made Farage an overnight celebrity across the world – catching the eyes of US news channels where he is now a regular fixture and an ally of Donald Trump.Created with Sketch.The Royal Gallery, Houses of Parliament — in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.India\u0027s Prime Minister Narendra Modi addresses members of parliament and invited guests in the Royal Gallery Queen Elizabeth II  is accompanied by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh as they proceed through the Royal Gallery before the State Opening of Parliament in the House of LordsGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel addresses both Houses of Parliament in the Royal Gallery of the Palace of Westminster in 2014.The Royal Gallery during the State Opening of Parliament in the House of LordsChina\u0027s President, Xi Jinping addresses MPs and peers in Parliament\u0027s Royal Gallery in 2015.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi delivers a speech in the Royal Gallery in the Houses of Parliament as Britain\u0027s Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow listens Yeoman of the Guard, wearing traditional uniform walk through the Royal Gallery during the ceremonial search before the State Opening of Parliament in the House of LordsIndia\u0027s Prime Minister Narendra Modi addresses members of parliament and invited guests in the Royal Gallery at the Houses of Parliamen in 2015.India\u0027s Prime Minister Narendra Modi addresses members of parliament and invited guests in the Royal Gallery Queen Elizabeth II  is accompanied by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh as they proceed through the Royal Gallery before the State Opening of Parliament in the House of LordsGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel addresses both Houses of Parliament in the Royal Gallery of the Palace of Westminster in 2014.The Royal Gallery during the State Opening of Parliament in the House of LordsChina\u0027s President, Xi Jinping addresses MPs and peers in Parliament\u0027s Royal Gallery in 2015.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi delivers a speech in the Royal Gallery in the Houses of Parliament as Britain\u0027s Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow listens Yeoman of the Guard, wearing traditional uniform walk through the Royal Gallery during the ceremonial search before the State Opening of Parliament in the House of LordsIndia\u0027s Prime Minister Narendra Modi addresses members of parliament and invited guests in the Royal Gallery at the Houses of Parliamen in 2015.Furious rhetoric has become a cottage industry: other typical video titles include “‘Who the Hell do you Think You Are?’ Nigel Farage throws egg in Eurocrat faces”, “Nigel Farage: I want you all fired!” and “‘You Are a TERRIBLE Leader’ – Nigel Farage Tells Angela Merkel Everything To Her Face”. In some ways the dynamic of the parliament’s broken debates has undermined the European project itself and allowed shouty populists to differentiate themselves in a field where reasoned debate is always overshadowed by grandstanding.EU rules Gibraltar is ‘colony’ of BritainEU agrees to give UK visa-free travel even after no-deal BrexitJeremy Hardy’s best jokes: From Brexit to right wing hypocrisySenior Conservative latest to admit Brexit could be delayedThe minimal time allocated for debates in Brussels is also a serious problem that prevents serious discussion. Often, only the leaders of the European parliament’s political groups get time to speak – backbenchers are often omitted altogether, even on big issues. When regular MEPs do get a word in, it will only be a handful of them. Even the group leaders are regularly told by the chair to hurry up – we don’t have all day. A massive basketball-style clock with red lettering looms over MEPs telling them how much speaking time they have used.\u0026nbspThis is unforgiveable, and it need not be this\u0026nbspway. The limited speaking time is a function of the fact the parliament barely sits – the main chamber is usually in use for around four days a month, with occasional extra “extraordinary” sessions lasting two days. The Commons, by contrast, sits over twice as many days – even though MPs tend to have more intensive constituency duties than MEPs do. It would be easy to find more time for proper debates if only the parliament actually met more regularly.Westminster has its fair share of ridiculous spectacles: mock hostage-taking during the state opening of parliament, £80,000 animal skin parchments, and the magic mace (don’t pick it up!). But none of these traditions are as bizarre and disruptive as the monthly caravan of MEPs and their staff marching from Brussels to Strasbourg. For the unfamiliar: the European Parliament’s main offices are in Belgium’s capital, but because of a historical quirk and a whole lot of politics, it conducts most of its main sessions in France. To give you an idea of how sensible this is, the transport infrastructure between the cities is so poor that the fastest way is actually to go on the train via Paris (the parliament, in fact charters special TGVs from the French national railway company for some staff). If you’ve ever looked at a map you’ll appreciate that this makes no sense: Paris is 400km from Strasbourg, and not in the right direction.France has an effective veto on ending the practice, and even Emmanuel Macron, for all his alleged reforming zeal, wants to keep it. The situation is so inconvenient that the parliament’s secretariat actually offers to pay expenses for journalists to come to Strasbourg to encourage some to show up. It is, at least, a lovely city – certainly worth a visit or 12.It should be clear that the European parliament is absolutely not the ideal legislature of some British pro-Europeans’ imaginations. And yet, there is a lot that Westminster could learn from itIt should be clear that the European parliament is absolutely not the ideal legislature of some British pro-Europeans’ imaginations. And yet, there is a lot that Westminster could learn from it.\u0026nbspThe overall EU legislative process is notoriously long and convoluted, but the legislative scrutiny the parliament provides is generally very good: independent committees of MEPs and rapporteurs scrutinise laws coming from the commission and council, and all MEPs get a binding vote on their recommended changes, which are often substantial and well thought-out. Elections by proportional representation mean the commission presidency never really has an absolute single-party majority and the law-making process is genuinely consensual – it is harder to railroad through legislation than in the UK.\u0026nbspSome of the nuts and bolts of how the European parliament works are also very impressive to someone used to the 16th century practises still operating in the Commons. MEPs vote electronically, which means it takes about 10 seconds to process a vote. In Westminster a single amendment will take 15 minutes because all 650 MPs have to physically go and stand in a room together to be counted: the present system of having two ision lobbies dates back to 1835 but a similar system, which used only one lobby, dates back to at least 1584.You might think that the fact MEPs speak dozens of different languages from 28 countries would be a problem, but this is actually dealt with very well. The translation set-up is practically one of the wonders of the modern world – everyone can talk and listen to everyone else in their native language. Sometimes MEPs choose to speak in English: some are better than others, and the language barrier makes genuinely inspiring rhetoric sparse, though some does occasionally shine through.What will happen to Britain’s MEPs if Brexit is delayed?What Britain’s last ever MEPs are planning to do after BrexitIn many respects the European parliament is also far more open than Westminster. If you want to report on the House of Commons in person as a journalist, you need to be a member of the press gallery. This requires a parliamentary security pass, of which there are a limited number for journalists, with a set allocation for established publications. It is hard to get one, they are jealously guarded, and the whole system is very much a closed shop.\u0026nbspIn Brussels anyone who can prove they are a bone fide journalist can get a pass that gives them access to the EU institutions: a letter from your editor and samples of work will do. This thankfully made it easy for The Independent to set up shop here, but it also means there are far more freelancers, upstart publications, and smaller specialist outfits catering to interested audiences. Given the technical nature of a lot of legislation the EU deals with, having specialists on hand is crucial: it’s good for scrutiny, and it’s good for democracy. There has been some movement in the UK to allow new publications into the press gallery, but the issue is contentious and the process of who is allowed in is not always transparent.\u0026nbspSpecialist reporters are usually confined to newsrooms for lack of parliamentary passes – while in Brussels agricultural subsidy specialists wander the halls freely with financial services reporters and health policy correspondents.Created with Sketch.

This is not the case in Brussels: because of the way the EU is set up, the parliament plays second – or even third – fiddle to the European Commission and European Council, which are a short walk away and where most journalists congregate. The most important daily press briefing in Brussels happens at the commission, in an auditorium, on camera – while in Westminster it is done in an obscure wood-panelled room, up too many staircases, on semi-anonymous terms.\u0026nbspThe European parliament has gained more powers and importance in recent years, but it cannot yet claim to be a fully-pledged legislature – notably it lacks the ability to actually suggest laws known as legislative initiative. But in practice in Westminster there is little legislative initiative from the backbenches anyway: the UK’s broken private members’ bill system, where practically every law is talked out or “filibustered” even if there is a majority for it, means that the government has a very firm grip on the statute book indeed.Some differences between Westminster and Brussels are a matter of taste: Westminster, notably, sits in a gothic palace, while the parliament buildings in Brussels and Strasbourg are modern glass, steel, and concrete – both styles have their fans and detractors. In one way, though, the two places are more similar than they might like to admit: it notably is very easy to get lost in both, thanks to a shared history of repeated extensions, badly connected annexes, and endless nondescript corridors.There is no really answer to which parliament is better: they can both learn from each other. And really, they both need to.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

For Diane Abbott, a politician with extensive media experience, the show was a “horrible experience”, the worst of her many appearances on the programme. Having appeared on something like 30 episodes, that’s significant. After all, some of her early experiences were almost as eventful. \u0026nbspHer appearance on Question Time in July 1987 was particularly memorable. Abbott shared a panel with Liberal MP Cyril Smith and Conservative minister Michael Heseltine, with Robin Day in the chair. Then, as now, it was the discussion of opinion polls that caused uproar. The polls, Smith commented forcefully, showed that Labour was unelectable, “and one of the reasons for it,”\u0026nbsphe added, “is Diane Abbott and people like her...”\u0026nbspThe largely white audience applauded, and after a moment’s delay chuckled, seeming to get some unspoken joke. Abbott called him out:\u0026nbsp“If Mr Smith believes that having black people in parliament for the first time is in some sense a backward step, thousands of people that voted for me in Hackney North would disagree.”\u0026nbspFor exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThe response was immediate. For Heseltine this was beyond the pale. He appealed to Day to intervene. The audience protested vocally. “I honestly believe,”\u0026nbspsaid one white man, “that the vast majority of the audience here do not see Diane as a black person.”\u0026nbspThis went down well, as did his thought that Abbott was the panellist showing true prejudice for assuming that white people perceived race. Day wrapped up the discussion apologising to the audience for calling Abbott black, his implication being that unless he had said so, none of the white people in the crowd would have been able to tell.The way I was treated on Question Time was a disgraceThe 1987 episode exposes the nature of the assumptions of many white Britons about race in Thatcher’s Britain. Britain was, as Heseltine put it, a harmonious and tolerant country, white people were effectively “colourblind”, and black people who claimed otherwise were either deluded or harbouring their own anti-white prejudice.In the same way, Question Time says something important about the nature of our politics, its entrenched biases, and which political figures are taken seriously.Evidence of bias on the show is best illustrated through comparison. Abbott was interrupted twice as often as prisons minister Rory Stewart, even though Stewart spoke more often, and for more of the show. The introductions at the top of the show were far from even-handed. Stewart’s introduction covered his ministerial career, past and present, as well as his governorships in Iraq.For all her achievements, for all of her experience, Abbott was not treated with the same degree of respect as Stewart or Oakeshott, her voice was not given as much weightBy comparison, Abbott’s introduction was short on detail. What is more, by linking her position as shadow home secretary to her relationship with Jeremy Corbyn, there was an implication that Abbott owed her job to a personal relationship, rather than merit. Indeed, according to several audience members, this was precisely the point made by Fiona Bruce before the show. Equally, in introducing Abbott, Bruce failed to mention her time as shadow minister for public health, her years on the Foreign Affairs Select Committee or the Treasury Select Committee, nor did she mention that Abbott is the first black woman to be elected to the Commons.Then there was Bruce’s decision to side with journalist Isabel Oakeshott’s wholly inaccurate statement that Labour was “way behind... miles behind” in the polls. At the same time, she was quick to assure the audience that Abbott was “definitely” wrong in her contention that the two main parties were essentially “level pegging”. In reality, as the BBC has subsequently acknowledged, Abbott was correct.Although this was never said explicitly, the constant interruptions (21 times compared to nine interruptions of Stewart and eight of the SNP’s Kirsty Blackman), the minimisation of Abbott’s achievements, the willingness to “correct” Abbott when she was in the right, all indicate that in some important sense, Abbott was out of place. For all her achievements, for all of her experience, Abbott was not treated with the same degree of respect as Stewart or Oakeshott, her voice was not given as much weight:\u0026nbspin short, she was not treated as a serious political figure.Why not? Abbott’s treatment is perplexing. In some ways, her biography is similar to many of our political leaders. Educated at an elite university, she went on to have a career in Whitehall, then the media, and then parliament. But the fact that Abbott is a black woman, from a working-class family gives each stage of this story a different significance.She won her place at Cambridge in 1973, at a time when only 10 per cent of the university’s students were women. While the university did not collect data on student ethnicity at the time, recent research shows that she was the second black person to study at Newnham in its century-long history, and only the third black person to study history at Cambridge in the 750 years since the university’s foundation.For politicians such as Jacob Rees-Mogg and Boris Johnson, success in university politics was part of their path to Westminster. Not so for Abbott, who had little time for college debating societies. Her antipathy to university politics is easy to explain. Enoch Powell was honorary president of the university’s Conservative Society when Abbott started at Cambridge, and women were excluded from many of Cambridge’s student societies. But more than that, Abbott found the concerns of student politics essentially elitist.Abbott’s path from university to parliament was anything but straightforward. She entered the Commons in 1987, at a time when there were no black people in the house, at a time when fewer than 5 per cent of MPs were women, and at a time when there was widespread suspicion of black radicalism. Abbott’s historic success was the result of a decade of activism, working with black organisations, and within the Labour Party.Accusing the BBC of bias over Diane Abbott is a step too farDiane Abbott rejects BBC response to Question Time rowLabour demands BBC footage and apology amid Abbott Question Time rowDiane Abbott accuses BBC of anti-Corbyn bias in stinging attackDiane Abbott accuses Question Time of legitimising ‘bias and abuse’In 1978 Abbott became involved with the Organisation of Women of African and Asian Descent (OWAAD), an umbrella organisation for black and Asian women’s groups. Founded by radicals including Stella Dadzie and Olive Morris, Abbott believed that the black womanism she encountered at OWAAD was far more sophisticated and rooted in the concerns of working-class black women\u0026nbspthan the student politics she had experienced at Cambridge. \u0026nbspIn 1983 Labour politics and black radicalism came together. Together with Russell Proffit, Elaine Foster, Marc Wadsworth\u0026nbspand others, Abbott founded the Labour Party Black Sections movement, which fought for black representation at all levels of the party, with a view to gaining black representation at all levels of government. Black Sections was\u0026nbspextraordinarily controversial. The right-wing press dubbed Abbott, Paul Boateng, Linda Bellos, Bernie Grant, Sharon Atkin and other LPBS activists “Black Extremists”, “Black Militants” and “Loony Left”.\u0026nbspIn 1997, Abbott led the first backbench rebellion against Tony Blair’s cuts to lone parent benefits. She was credited at the time for being the first MP to damage the new prime ministerThe movement was\u0026nbspno less controversial inside the Labour Party, and in the run-up to the 1987 election, black candidates were regularly deselected –\u0026nbspthe party leadership seemed to feel that white voters would not turn out for black candidates. In spite of this apparent hostility from the party leadership, in spite of constant attacks in the media, four Black Sections candidates won seats in the 1987 election, Abbott\u0026nbsp(the only woman) among them.Since 1987, Abbott has had a distinguished parliamentary career. Her first major campaign\u0026nbspas an MP\u0026nbspwas against the imprisoning of refugees on Britain’s first private jail, the Earl William, a recently privatised and hastily repurposed car ferry. Abbott visited the Tamil refugees, many of whom had fled torture, highlighting their squalid conditions, and the absence of medical care. The Thatcher government refused to back down, even when the floating prison, nicknamed “the hulk” due to its obvious disrepair, broke its moorings and ran aground in the great storm of October 1987.In 1997, Abbott led the first backbench rebellion against Tony Blair’s cuts to lone parent benefits. She was credited at the time for being the first MP to damage the new prime minister. Abbott also played an important role in exposing evidence of government complicity in the “arms to Africa” scandal. Someone at the top of government was clearly irked by Abbott’s efforts on the Foreign Affair Select Committee, for a government dossier on Abbott was leaked, containing material stolen from her a decade earlier.Abbott’s skill as a parliamentarian was not lost on The Spectator. The venerable right-wing journal awarded her parliamentary speech of the year in 2008, for her forensic critique of Gordon Brown’s proposed anti-terror laws. Abbott stood for the leadership of the Labour Party in 2010, and since joining the shadow cabinet she led Labour’s attack on the government over last year’s Windrush scandal.The first thing my staff have to do in the morning is go online and delete and block all the stuffIn spite of this long, pioneering and successful career, in spite of all of her experience in parliament, and working with grassroots campaigns, Abbott was treated with derision on Question Time.Anti-politics, and a generalised distrust of politicians is part of the current zeitgeist. Yet, even in an age of distrust some politicians are derided more than others. Privilege insulates some iniduals and groups at the expense of others. So, Oakeshott can get polling data wrong and still be taken seriously. Stewart can pull figures out of the air, and still expect to be treated with respect. But as a black woman, Abbott is routinely ridiculed, and her infrequent gaffs are seized upon as “proof”\u0026nbspthat she has no right to be at the centre of British politics.Boris Johnson is, perhaps the best example of a British politician insulated by privilege. As an exceptionally wealthy, white man he can get away with accusing the Turkish president of having sex with a goat he can brush off criticism following his use of the word “piccaninnies” he was even able to accuse Barack Obama of “ancestral dislike” of Britain, and still be given the job of foreign secretary – one of the highest offices of state.None of this is without personal consequences for Abbott, who experiences more racism now than at any time in her 35 years in politics. “Twitter has put racists into overdrive,” Abbott remarked in response to research published by Amnesty International in December 2018. The research showed that black women in journalism and politics were 84 per cent more likely than white women to be mentioned in abusive tweets. “The first thing my staff have to do in the morning is go online and delete and block all the stuff,” she said.\u0026nbspAn earlier study by Amnesty of 900,223 tweets sent in the six months before the 2017 election\u0026nbsprevealed that Abbott received 45 per cent of all abusive tweets sent to women MPs, 10 times more than other women in parliament. According to Abbott: “It’s highly racialised and it’s also gendered because people talk about rape and they talk about my physical appearance in a way they wouldn’t talk about a man. I’m abused as a female politician and I’m abused as a black politician.”During the 2016 US election, Trump claimed infamously\u0026nbspthat he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue without losing any voters. He was so insulated by his status that “his people” would still support him, even if he was guilty of murder. Sadly, as\u0026nbspQuestion Time shows, a similar relationship between privilege and bias is at work in British politics.Robin Bunce is a historian based at Homerton College, University of Cambridge Paul Field is a lawyer, writer and human rights activistOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

According to the latest survey by\u0026nbspWhich?Travel, the Irish budget airline faces an uncertain future. To sustain its flying programme across Europe for 2019, the airline must sell 280 seats per minute. Yet according to the magazine: “Ryanair’s reputation has declined so much that thousands of respondents told the consumer champion that they would never again fly Ryanair, even if it was cheaper than its rivals.”The editor, Rory Boland, said of the airline: “It has spent the past two years cancelling thousands of flights, ruining hundreds of thousands of holidays and flouting the rules on compensation as well. The results of our survey show passengers are fed up. They should switch to one of their rivals, which prove that budget prices don’t have to mean budget service.”Ryanair’s share price has lost one-third in the past year, and is 40 per cent down on where it was in the summer of 2017. That was the summer when Ryanair started to upset passengers who choose not to pay for assigned seating. From May 2017, couples and groups who accepted “random seating” typically found themselves sitting in middle seats at the opposite ends of the aircraft. In September that year, thousands of passengers found their flights abruptly cancelled due to a shortage of pilots – which ultimately led to the grounding of 20,000 flights through the winter.\u0026nbspFor exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThe airline then misrepresented its obligations to travellers whose flights it had cancelled, saying it was not responsible for finding departures on other airlines – even though the European air passengers’ rights rules (known as EC261) state carriers cancelling flights must pay for alternatives. Ryanair had its knuckles rapped by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA).The number of seats per minute Ryanair needs to sellSoon afterwards the airline gave in to demands by crew for union recognition, the first time it had happened in 32 years.The result: a string of strikes by pilots, cabin crew and airport staff. Many of them were coordinated by the International Transport Workers’ Federation, which said: “Demands of Ryanair workers – such as pay for all hours worked and an end to long-term agency employment – continue to go unaddressed.”\u0026nbspDuring 2018 many hundreds of flights were cancelled because of strikes by pilots and cabin crew. Some of the passengers affected sought compensation under EC261 regulations. Payouts are set at €250 (£223) for flights of up to 1,500km, and €400 (£357) for longer flights in Europe and North Africa. Their applications were rejected by Ryanair – which claimed the industrial action was caused by “extraordinary circumstances” and was “totally beyond the airline’s control”.But in another unprecedented intervention, the CAA urged grounded holidaymakers to claim their entitlement. Ryanair still refused, and in December 2018 the authority launched enforcement action, insisting “consumers should be compensated in accordance with Regulation EC261”. For an airline to change its cabin-baggage policy more than once a decade is unusual – but Ryanair passengers had to adhere to three different sets of rules in 2018.Now Martin Lewis, the MoneySavingExpert, has written to the chief executive, Michael O’Leary, about what he claims is a “systemic error” in the Ryanair booking process that changed travellers’ surnames in the same booking to be the same as the lead passenger’s. His organisation has sent a dossier of more than 160 cases to the CAA.Ryanair’s present travails are at odds with its image as the cheeky underdog. In the 1990s, as a tiny Irish airline, it seized on the European Union’s “open skies” policy to create its leading hub at Stansted airport, flying British travellers across Europe and providing Continental travellers with cheap access to London and beyond. But as Brexit approaches, some say the Irish carrier is in disarray, losing passengers in droves and seemingly destined for oblivion.How can a carrier that is apparently widely despised be selling seats at a rate of nearly five per second – and paying prodigious returns to shareholders?\u0026nbspYet Ryanair is set for another year as the most successful airline in Europe, flying close to 150 million people. How can a carrier that is apparently widely despised simultaneously be selling seats at a rate of nearly five per second – and, relative to its rivals, paying prodigious returns to shareholders? The answer lies in Ryanair’s business model, which takes the “keep it simple” principle to extremes.\u0026nbspThe airline has long operated only one type of aircraft, the Boeing 737-800. Pilots, cabin crew and engineers can work on any plane in the fleet. The 189 seats are another constant, avoiding the problems that other airlines – such as easyJet and British Airways – encounter when they “downsize” an aircraft.Ryanair has not always been faithful to Boeing – in the early days it used Romanian-built BAC 1-11 planes, and after it bought the KLM offshoot, Buzz, for a short while it had BAe146 jets in the fleet. But the path to success became apparent as the world assimilated the tragedy of 911. The attack on America changed much in aviation, with airlines cancelling flights and aircraft orders wholesale. And Ryanair was transformed by behaving in the opposite way .In the summer of 2001, Michael O’Leary was known in the airline business as a maverick, who had rescued an ailing regional airline by cutting fares to stimulate business. But by the end of September that year, he had become the fiercely controversial figure he remains – telling Radio 4’s\u0026nbspToday\u0026nbspprogramme that British Airways and other airlines were “screwing” the government for financial support.On 14 September 2001, the day that flights were allowed to resume across the US, with 50 new security directives in place, Boeing announced 25,000 lay-offs. In the next few days, Virgin Atlantic cut 1,200 jobs, together with its routes to Toronto and Chicago, while Aer Lingus shed 1,600 people – more than the total number employed by Ryanair. Two months after the tragedy, Ryanair predicted profits for the full financial year of close to £100m – about £10 for every passenger flown. Other airlines were haemorrhaging cash, or simply going bust (Ansett Australia, Swissair, Sabena of Belgium...).The order books of Airbus and Boeing were full of cancellations. With some almost-new jets being flown to the desert for storage, no one was buying new aircraft. Which, from the point of view of a fast-expanding, opportunistic airline is the ideal time to order some new planes. In bulk. On 24 January 2002, Ryanair ordered 100 Boeing 737s with options on 50 more – the largest ever deal for the world’s most popular plane. The cost per aircraft remains a closely guarded secret but was probably around half the list price.Created with Sketch.Travel Photographer of the Year 2018 Show all 16Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Low-cost aviation relies on keeping costs down. That is obvious to say, but much harder to do. Many elements of flying, such as fuel and air-traffic charges, are priced the same whether you are British Airways or Ryanair. But aircraft ownership costs are negotiable, and at a stroke Ryanair had achieved a deal way better than its rivals.With the fleet set to treble in size, the airline set about expanding its network in a very low-cost way: setting up operations at “secondary” airports. Budget travellers soon became accustomed to finding their way to and from Frankfurt Hahn (closer to Luxembourg than to the German financial hub), Girona (“Barcelona” in Ryanair’s view) and Charleroi (“Brussels south”). Regional authorities poured millions of euros in “marketing support” into Ryanair’s operations, with accusations that the airline was benefitting from state aid.The jury is still out on Ryanair’s play to be an airline for business travellers between Frankfurt and Manchester, for example, the Irish carrier has a single mid-afternoon round tripDuring an expansion that has proved, so far, recession-proof, the airline has long moved into the main airports for those cities, to the dismay of incumbents such as Lufthansa, Iberia and Brussels Airlines.The jury is still out on Ryanair’s play to be an airline for business travellers between Frankfurt and Manchester, for example, the Irish carrier has a single mid-afternoon round trip, while Lufthansa of Germany has five flights each way from dawn to late evening. Passengers on business want frequent flights and a near-certainty that they can get a seat on the next departure – yet Ryanair’s model is to fill its planes as close to capacity as it can.In December, which for the first half is as low-season as the travel year gets, Ryanair flights were 95 per cent full – meaning just nine or 10 seats on the average aircraft remained empty. That achievement is all the more remarkable given the intensifying competition in short-haul aviation.\u0026nbspRyanair and easyJet have a long history of not competing head-to-head. Over the years there have been some spectacular fares wars: easyJet retired hurt after launching flights to Ireland, and for a while it was difficult to pay more than £10 from Luton to Copenhagen. While the two giant carriers have historically competed on only a handful of airport-to-airport routes, expansion makes it increasingly difficult to avoid. And even though Primera Air of Iceland and Cobalt of Cyprus have recently gone bust, other budget carriers are expanding.\u0026nbspWizz Air, the eastern European specialist, is now flying from Luton to a range of western European destinations. Norwegian Air and BA’s sister airline, Vueling, are also chasing the same market. And the “legacy carriers” from Air France to SAS are cutting costs to stay in the game. Ryanair begins 2019 as combative as ever. Cabin crew employed in Spain were planning strikes on 8, 10 and 13 January after failing to reach an agreement over employment conditions, but the airline faced them down.Ahead of Brexit, Ryanair has obtained a UK air operator’s certificate that will allow it to operate British domestic routes and flights to destinations outside the European Union after 29 March. All the available evidence shows that the lowest-cost provider wins in aviation – even with consumer voices raised against it.Ryanair may feel picked on by the authorities. At this time in 2018, Air France workers were gearing up for 15 days of strikes that disrupted many thousands of British travellers. Some BA passengers faced problems during the cabin-crew strikes that dragged on for months during 2017. Yet when the European Court of Justice ruled in April 2018 that wildcat strikes did not consititute “extraordinary circumstances”, the Civil Aviation Authority failed to urge BA and Air France travellers to claim compensation.Created with Sketch.Ryanair: strikes and cancellations cause travel chaos Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Ryanair airline workers shout slogans during a small protest during the first of two days of a cabin crew strike at Adolfo Suarez-Barajas international airport in Madrid in JulyEmpty Ryanair check-in counter at El Prat airport in BarcelonaRyanair employees hold up signs in English and Spanish on the first day of a cabin crew strike in Palma de MallorcaRyanair airplanes stand idle on the tarmacIrish Ryanair pilots outside the company headquarters at Swords in Dublin, as they stage their fourth one-day strike with their union, ForsaA woman sits at a Ryanair airline check-in desk after her flight to Pisa, Italy, was cancelledRyanair employees protest at the entrance of the airport in MalagaStranded Ryanair passengers line up for information at the airport in ValenciaEmployees of Ryanair\u0027s customer service department wear T-shirts with a slogan \u0027Ryanair Must Change\u0027 during the first day of strike of the company\u0027s cabin crew members at Brussels South airport in Charleroi, Belgium, in 25Cabin crew workers for low-cost airline Ryanair went on strike in four European countries over working conditions in July, forcing thousands of passengers to make last-minute travel adjustments at the peak of the summer holiday seasonRyanair Chief Executive Michael O\u0027Leary addresses a news conference in Schwechat, AustriaRyanair employees hold up signs at the airport in Palma de MallorcaPeople queue at the Ryanair airline customer service desk during the first of two days cabin crew strikeRyanair personnel stand at Brussels Airport in Zaventem, during a strike of cabin personnel Ryanair\u0027s customer service department gather behind a banner reading: \u0027Ryanair On Strike - Respect Us!

Travel readers seem to have it in for Ryanair. The Boeing 737s it flies are identical to the bulk of Jet2’s fleet. They hold the same number of people in the same configuration. The only significant difference is that Ryanair’s fleet of 737-800s are younger. Jet2’s score for seating and cabin environment was four stars, while Ryanair received only one star.The most fundamental requirement for any airline is safety, but when an organisation called Airlineratings released its top 10 for “the world’s safest low-cost airlines”, Ryanair was nowhere to be seen.\u0026nbspThe UK’s struggling Flybe and the Anglo-German Thomas Cook Airlines made it, but there was no place for the Irish airline. Which is perplexing, because if you measure safety in terms of flying the highest number of passengers without any of them dying in an accident, Ryanair has the best safety record in the world by a country mile. Since its first flight in 1985, the airline has safely flown 1.25 billion people. Second place goes to easyJet, at 900 million passengers.People\u0026nbsphave flown safely with Ryanair since 1985British travellers have begun another year as the beneficiaries of the best-value air travel in the world, provided by the safest airlines. When easyJet was founded by Stelios Haji-Ioannou in 1995, his main message was that travellers could fly from London to Scotland for £29 – the price of a pair of jeans. Checking flights two days ahead, Ryanair will take you from Stansted to Edinburgh for under £26. And if that’s still too much, the airline will take you from Essex to Italy for under £15.At a time when Europe is fragmenting and slightly more than half the UK apparently wants to be alone, Ryanair is arguably doing more to keep the continent together than a planeload of politicians: connecting families, enabling employment, allowing travellers to discover that Europe is a fascinating mosaic of cultures rather than an amorphous whole.Back to that\u0026nbspWhich? Travel\u0026nbspsurvey: “Of those who said there was one airline with which they’d never travel, 70 per cent named Ryanair – no other airline came close.”Every passenger in Europe benefits from the existence of Ryanair. So while I find it surprising that the airline inflames so much adverse reaction, I believe that even the “bad-boy” image is a consumer benefit. By annoying sufficiently many people who have vowed never to fly on Ryanair, the Irish airline helps its rivals stay in business and keeps competition flourishing.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Tom Petty’s performance is often omitted from rankings of the best Super Bowl halftime shows, but we’re including it here because he absolutely crushed it. Kicking things off with “American Girl”, he followed it up with “Won’t Back Down”, “Full Moon Fever” and the emotional “Free Fallin’”, rounding off with a stirring rendition of “Runnin’ Down a Dream”.U2 had the unenviable task of trying to raise everyone’s spirits just six months after the 911 attacks, but they did an admirable job, with performances of uplifting tracks like “Beautiful Day”.McCartney preceded the pop stars trying to outdo one another with extravagant stage designs and lavish costumes. Instead, he offered four beautifully played songs, of which the final one, “Hey Jude”, prompted an epic singalong with the crowd at Jacksonville’s EverBank Field Stadium.One of the few to outdo Katy Perry’s 2015 entrance was Madonna, three years earlier, who appeared on a giant golden chariot led by about a hundred buff men dressed as Roman soldiers. She brought out Nicki Minaj and MIA for “Give Me All Your Luvin’” and also performed hits “Like a Prayer”, “Music” and “Express Yourself”.There are few entrances as grand as standing on top of a giant golden lion with glowing eyes. Katy Perry went all out for her halftime show in 2015 with performances of “Roar”, “Dark Horse”, “California Gurls”, “Firework” and “Teenage Dream”. And who can forget the notorious Left Shark and his poor coordination?“Put the chicken fingers down and turn your television all the way up,” the Boss ordered. Springsteen’s 12-minute set started out with “Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out” and also included “Born to Run”, “Glory Days” and “Working on a Dream”.710 Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake – 2004Janet Jackson delivered a blistering, brilliantly choreographed show that ended with “Rock Your Body”. But the moment Justin Timberlake ripped away her costume, and exposed her breast for approximately half a second, overshadowed all of that. The incident, dubbed “nipplegate”, even inspired the creation of YouTube. Jackson was turned into a scapegoat for the ensuing controversy, while Timberlake didn’t receive anywhere near as much scrutiny.One of the most outlandish halftime shows in recent memory, Lady Gaga began her performance by hurtling herself from the top of the stadium (attached to a harness, of course) – sparking a thousand memes. Once safely on the ground, she thrilled audiences with her biggest hits: “Poker Face”, “Born This Way”, “Telephone”, “Just Dance”, “Million Reasons” and “Bad Romance”.Beyonce basically ties with Prince for the greatest all-time Super Bowl performance. It was bold, it was fierce, it was virtually flawless. Bursting onto the stage with “Crazy in Love” after an a capella “Love on Top”, she threw down some of her best dance moves, before moving on to other hits including “End of Time” and “Baby Boy”. Lastly, there was a hysteria-inducing Destiny’s Child reunion with Michelle Williams and Kelly Rowland – a performance so powerful, the lights at the stadium cut out when it ended.The greatest. Of course, the Purple One wasn’t responsible for the rain that began to pour during his hair-raising 12-minute performance, which included covers of “We Will Rock You” and “All Along the Watchtower”. But the timing was so perfect, you wanted to believe he was. Following renditions of “1999Baby I’m a Star”, Prince closed on “Purple Rain” in what has to be ranked among one of his greatest live performances of that song.110 Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers  – 2008No frills, just good old-fashioned rock and roll.

It’s female empowerment and mental-health aware. It’s everything I wanted\u0027Click to followThe Independent CultureNetflix’s “mind-blowing” new series Russian Doll has won rave reviews, with Natasha Lyonne’s performance and writing being praised by critics.Russian Doll centres on\u0026nbspNadiya – played by\u0026nbspLyonne – who dies over and over again, only to re-appear every time in the same place: in the bathroom at her birthday party. (Unsurprisingly, the premise has been liked to the film\u0026nbspGroundhog Day.)After reaching the streaming service on Friday (1 February), subscribers took to Twitter to discuss the “trippy” series.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trial“Just binged watched Russian Doll,” wrote one.\u0026nbsp”The whole season. Really worth the effn wild ride. Super Trippy. Major surprises.”Another wrote: “Wow. Russian Doll is the best series I’ve watched in a long time.”“I loved it,” one social media user wrote.\u0026nbsp”I watched it all and I wish there was more. It’s smart. It’s female empowerment and mental-health aware. It’s everything I wanted.”Critics have likewise written highly of the series, with Russian Doll currently holding a 100 per cent fresh rating on the aggregate website\u0026nbspRotten Tomatoes.\u0026nbsp“As the series proceeds, it gets more ambitious and more complicated in a way that’s gratifying to watch,” writes\u0026nbspSophie Gilbert for The Atlantic.\u0026nbsp”It’s still anchored, though, by its sense of place and time, and by the infinite possibilities that a night walking around New York City presents.”Joel Keller for Decider writes: “Lyonne puts on the performance of her career in this funny, emotional series.”\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Hidden gems: The best Netflix originals you might have missed Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.120 American Vandal (TV series, two seasons, 2017–2018)Part satire of true crime documentaries such as Making a Murderer, part carefully observed portrayal of teenage life, American Vandal was criminally underappreciated during its two season run. It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.220 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017–)Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix’s most streamed non-English language show. The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special. The heist here, led by a mysterious man known only as The Professor, involves breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing off €2.4 billion. There are even more twists in the show’s 15 episodes than there are hostages. 320 One Day at a Time (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)In stark contrast to the off-beat, low-key comedy that currently rules TV – the kind that provokes a wry smirk rather than a hearty laugh – One Day at a Time is a big, bright sitcom filmed in front of an interminably enthusiastic studio audience. You wouldn’t have thought that the story of a Cuban-American army veteran  nurse  single mother – who suffers from PTSD and depression – would fit into this format, but it does so beautifully, tackling issues of sexuality, racism and sexism in the process.  Based on writer  director Tamara Jenkins’s own fertility struggles, Private Life stars Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti (both giving brilliant performances) as a spiky, loving middle-aged couple desperate to have a baby. They even rope their enthusiastic but irresponsible niece Sadie (Kayli Carter) into the mix, much to the horror of Sadie’s mother (Molly Shannon, turning a potentially repellent character into one worthy of empathy). It’s subtle, restrained and beautifully realised.520 Big Mouth (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Crude, rude, and rife with surprise emissions and bodily functions, animated sitcom Big Mouth is also a sensitive, nuanced deep e into the various horrors of teenagehood. When 12-year-old Andrew Glouberman (John Mulaney) is visited by the hormone monster (Nick Kroll, who voices many of the show’s best characters), he finds his life irreversibly – and seemingly disastrously – changed. Unlike many other puberty-centred comedies, Big Mouth makes as much time for its confused female protagonists as its male ones Maya Rudolph is a delight as the female hormone monster, and look out for Kristen Wiig’s wonderful turn as a talking vagina.  620 Easy (TV series, two seasons, 2016–)Joe Swanberg’s style of defiantly undramatic mumblecore isn’t for everyone, but if you enjoyed his earlier films, Drinking Buddies and Happy Christmas, you’ll find plenty to admire in this anthology comedy-drama series. Big-name stars such as Orlando Bloom and Aubrey Plaza crop up, but Jane Adams – who you might remember from Todd Solondz’s chronically depressing 1998 film Happiness – is the show’s heart, and Marc Maron is its jaded soul.Community’s Gillian Jacobs is brilliant as the prickly, magnetic recovering addict Mickey, who forms an unlikely – and arguably deeply unwise – relationship with her nerdy neighbour Gus (Paul Rust). Despite Gus’s pathological need to be the nice guy, we’re never quite sure who or what we’re rooting for – which is what makes Love such complex, compelling viewing.  In 2016, comedian Patton Oswalt’s wife, the true crime writer Michelle McNamara, died suddenly in her sleep. That subject matter doesn’t exactly scream “stand-up special”, but out of his devastating loss, Oswalt managed to craft something funny and profound. Over the course of an hour, he processes his grief onstage, managing to find humour in the struggle to raise his grieving six-year-old daughter alone.920 Santa Clarita Diet (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Granted, this horror-comedy – which stars Drew Barrymore as a neurotic real estate agent who suddenly develops a taste for human flesh – is really silly, and really, really disgusting. But it’s also strangely charming, and funny. Timothy Olyphant is excellent as Sheila’s frazzled husband Joel, and the pair’s idiosyncratic but respectful relationship with their smart teenage daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) isn’t quite like anything else on TV right now.1020 Dark Tourist (TV series, one season, 2018–)New Zealand journalist David Farrier is an unlikely TV presenter in the same way that Louis Theroux is – in just about every scenario in which he finds himself, he’s a little bit awkward. But as with Theroux, Farrier’s weakness is actually his strength, allowing him to endear himself to the many unusual people he meets on his journey through the world’s most questionable tourist destinations. Farrier’s stops include the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the road where JFK was assassinated, and the Milwaukee suburbs where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer murdered his victims.1120 Sacred Games (TV series, one season, 2018–)Based on Vikram Chandra’s epic 2006 novel, Netflix’s first Indian original series is a slowly unfolding gem. The first season of Sacred Games – which follows a troubled police officer (Saif Ali Khan) who has 25 days to save his city thanks to a tip-off from a presumed dead gangster – only covered one quarter of Chandra’s 1,000-page novel. As the show itself declared when it announced the forthcoming second season, “the worst is yet to come”.When the trailer for Dumplin’ first landed, it seemed all the ingredients were in place for a film that was at worst tone-deaf, and at best vaguely patronising. Thank heavens, then, that the trailer did Dumplin’ such a disservice. Starring Danielle Macdonald (who broke out in the excellent 2017 film Patti Cake$) as Willowdean, a self-described “fat girl” who enters a local pageant to annoy her former beauty queen mother (Jennifer Aniston), Dumplin’ is as funny, warm and sensitive as its protagonist – and with a killer Dolly Parton-laden soundtrack to boot.1320 Dark (TV series, one season, 2017–)This sci-fi thriller – which features disappearing children, a mysterious local power plant, and scenes set in the Eighties – has, for obvious reasons, drawn comparisons to Stranger Things. But Dark is even more beguiling and (true to its name) less family-friendly than Stranger Things.1420 The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson (Film, 2017)Though it’s been somewhat tarnished by claims that director David France appropriated the work and research of trans film-maker Reina Gossett, this documentary is nonetheless a loving, respectful tribute to gay rights activist Marsha P Johnson. One of the key figures in the Stonewall uprising (though her involvement was almost entirely eradicated in 2015’s critically hated Stonewall), Johnson modelled for Andy Warhol, performed onstage with drag group Hot Peaches, helped found the Gay Liberation Front, and then died under suspicious circumstances in 1992.1520 On My Block (TV series, one season, 2018–)This coming-of-age series might not have found as many eyeballs as it deserved last year, but those it did find were glued to the screen. In fact, it was the most-binged show of 2018 – meaning that it had the highest watch-time-per-viewing session of any Netflix original. Created by Awkward’s Lauren Iungerich, On My Block follows a group of Los Angeles teens as they navigate both the drama of high school and the danger of inner-city life.Two beleaguered assistants (Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell) conspire to get their over-demanding bosses (Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu) together in order to get their lives back in this winning romantic comedy. Set It Up is responsible not only for coining the term “over-dicking” (it’s much more innocent than it sounds), but for rejuvenating a tired genre.Martin Freeman stars as the father struggling to protect his young daughter from a zombie epidemic spreading across Australia. So far, so overdone. But this drama thriller, directed by Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke and based on their 2013 short of the same name, throws a handful of unpredictable ners in the works.    1920 Godless (TV series, one season, 2017–)With shades of John Ford\u0027s The Searchers, this languorous western was critically acclaimed but swiftly forgotten after it landed on Netflix in 2016. Set in 1884, it\u0027s about Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his notoriously ruthless gang of outlaws’ pursuit of their injured former ally Roy Goode (Jack O’Connell), who is hiding out in a small town populated solely by women after a mining accident killed off all its men. A gun-toting Michelle Dockery, clearly relishing the change of scenery after years of Downton Abbey, and a taciturn Jack O’Connell, are on brilliant form.2020 Atypical (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)This coming-of-age series about a teenage boy with autism was sweet and well-intentioned from the start, but its first season was criticised for a handful of inaccuracies, and for its lack of autistic actors. Rather than drowning in a sea of defensiveness – as too many shows tend to do – it listened, and brought in autistic actors and writers for its excellent second season.120 American Vandal (TV series, two seasons, 2017–2018)Part satire of true crime documentaries such as Making a Murderer, part carefully observed portrayal of teenage life, American Vandal was criminally underappreciated during its two season run. It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.220 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017–)Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix’s most streamed non-English language show.

The group was hit by a series of strikes by pilots and cabin crew which grounded hundreds of flights last summer, and was forced to increase wages.Chief executive Michael O’Leary said that while the loss was disappointing,\u0026nbsp“we take comfort that this was entirely due to weaker than expected air fares so our customers are enjoying record low prices, which is good for current and future traffic growth”.The airline said the risk of a no-deal Brexit “remains worryingly high”, and added: “While we hope that common sense will prevail, and lead to either a delay in Brexit, or agreement on the 21 month transition deal currently on the table, we have taken all necessary steps to protect Ryanair’s business in a no-deal environment.”\u0026nbspGeorge Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “Ryanair is licking its wounds after a difficult 2018 that saw extra competition drive down prices and higher staff and compensation costs push expenses up.Created with Sketch.Ryanair: strikes and cancellations cause travel chaos Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Ryanair airline workers shout slogans during a small protest during the first of two days of a cabin crew strike at Adolfo Suarez-Barajas international airport in Madrid in JulyEmpty Ryanair check-in counter at El Prat airport in BarcelonaRyanair employees hold up signs in English and Spanish on the first day of a cabin crew strike in Palma de MallorcaRyanair airplanes stand idle on the tarmacIrish Ryanair pilots outside the company headquarters at Swords in Dublin, as they stage their fourth one-day strike with their union, ForsaA woman sits at a Ryanair airline check-in desk after her flight to Pisa, Italy, was cancelledRyanair employees protest at the entrance of the airport in MalagaStranded Ryanair passengers line up for information at the airport in ValenciaEmployees of Ryanair\u0027s customer service department wear T-shirts with a slogan \u0027Ryanair Must Change\u0027 during the first day of strike of the company\u0027s cabin crew members at Brussels South airport in Charleroi, Belgium, in 25Cabin crew workers for low-cost airline Ryanair went on strike in four European countries over working conditions in July, forcing thousands of passengers to make last-minute travel adjustments at the peak of the summer holiday seasonRyanair Chief Executive Michael O\u0027Leary addresses a news conference in Schwechat, AustriaRyanair employees hold up signs at the airport in Palma de MallorcaPeople queue at the Ryanair airline customer service desk during the first of two days cabin crew strikeRyanair personnel stand at Brussels Airport in Zaventem, during a strike of cabin personnel Ryanair\u0027s customer service department gather behind a banner reading: \u0027Ryanair On Strike - Respect Us!

Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers  – 2008No frills, just good old-fashioned rock and roll. Tom Petty’s performance is often omitted from rankings of the best Super Bowl halftime shows, but we’re including it here because he absolutely crushed it. Kicking things off with “American Girl”, he followed it up with “Won’t Back Down”, “Full Moon Fever” and the emotional “Free Fallin’”, rounding off with a stirring rendition of “Runnin’ Down a Dream”.U2 had the unenviable task of trying to raise everyone’s spirits just six months after the 911 attacks, but they did an admirable job, with performances of uplifting tracks like “Beautiful Day”.McCartney preceded the pop stars trying to outdo one another with extravagant stage designs and lavish costumes. Instead, he offered four beautifully played songs, of which the final one, “Hey Jude”, prompted an epic singalong with the crowd at Jacksonville’s EverBank Field Stadium.One of the few to outdo Katy Perry’s 2015 entrance was Madonna, three years earlier, who appeared on a giant golden chariot led by about a hundred buff men dressed as Roman soldiers. She brought out Nicki Minaj and MIA for “Give Me All Your Luvin’” and also performed hits “Like a Prayer”, “Music” and “Express Yourself”.There are few entrances as grand as standing on top of a giant golden lion with glowing eyes. Katy Perry went all out for her halftime show in 2015 with performances of “Roar”, “Dark Horse”, “California Gurls”, “Firework” and “Teenage Dream”. And who can forget the notorious Left Shark and his poor coordination?“Put the chicken fingers down and turn your television all the way up,” the Boss ordered. Springsteen’s 12-minute set started out with “Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out” and also included “Born to Run”, “Glory Days” and “Working on a Dream”.710 Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake – 2004Janet Jackson delivered a blistering, brilliantly choreographed show that ended with “Rock Your Body”. But the moment Justin Timberlake ripped away her costume, and exposed her breast for approximately half a second, overshadowed all of that. The incident, dubbed “nipplegate”, even inspired the creation of YouTube. Jackson was turned into a scapegoat for the ensuing controversy, while Timberlake didn’t receive anywhere near as much scrutiny.One of the most outlandish halftime shows in recent memory, Lady Gaga began her performance by hurtling herself from the top of the stadium (attached to a harness, of course) – sparking a thousand memes. Once safely on the ground, she thrilled audiences with her biggest hits: “Poker Face”, “Born This Way”, “Telephone”, “Just Dance”, “Million Reasons” and “Bad Romance”.Beyonce basically ties with Prince for the greatest all-time Super Bowl performance. It was bold, it was fierce, it was virtually flawless. Bursting onto the stage with “Crazy in Love” after an a capella “Love on Top”, she threw down some of her best dance moves, before moving on to other hits including “End of Time” and “Baby Boy”. Lastly, there was a hysteria-inducing Destiny’s Child reunion with Michelle Williams and Kelly Rowland – a performance so powerful, the lights at the stadium cut out when it ended.The greatest. Of course, the Purple One wasn’t responsible for the rain that began to pour during his hair-raising 12-minute performance, which included covers of “We Will Rock You” and “All Along the Watchtower”. But the timing was so perfect, you wanted to believe he was. Following renditions of “1999Baby I’m a Star”, Prince closed on “Purple Rain” in what has to be ranked among one of his greatest live performances of that song.110 Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers  – 2008No frills, just good old-fashioned rock and roll.

What happens to UK trade with them after Brexit? Ben Chu looks at the state of playClick to followThe IndependentBrexit? It’ll be the ‘easiest thing in human history’As a full member of the European Union since 1973 the UK has effectively outsourced responsibility for making trade\u0026nbspdeals with other countries to the EU institutions.And those institutions have been busy.The EU now has more than 50 trade deals of various sorts with third countries either in place, partly in place, or pending. A full list can be found on the European Commission’s website here.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThese range from deals with large economies such as Canada and Japan, to middling ones such as Mexico, South Korea and Turkey, to small states such as Moldova and Botswana.The prospect of Brexit – whether a no-deal rupture in March or an orderly departure after several years – raises the question of what happens to the UK vis-à-vis those EU trade deals?How dangerous for the UK economy is the European Union’s latest adviceWill the UK be able to simply roll them over, so the terms of a laboriously negotiated deal that previously only covered, say, the EU and South Africa, now also covers the UK and South Africa too?Or would we need to renegotiate them from scratch?The UK government had hoped to simply\u0026nbsproll them over or “grandfather” them.But the Department of International Trade was forced to admit earlier this month that not a single agreement to do this had so far been signed, with only two months to go when they may be needed.Trade Secretary Liam Fox told the BBC: “I hope they will be but there are not just dependent on the UK. Our side is ready. It’s largely dependent on other whether countries believe that there will be no deal and are willing to put the work in to the preparations.”Created with Sketch.Brexit and travel: all you need to know Show all 14Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.British passports that expire after 29 March 2019 will continue to be valid as UK travel documents, but will lose the power that comes with being a European Union passport – notably the right of free movement within the EU27.You will still be able to travel to the EU with your pet after Brexit, but it could well get more complicated depending on the status that the European Union decide to apply.

The goal is to prevent other countries free-riding on other countries’ deals.According to British official, Korea is asking, in return for a rolling over of its EU trade deal to the UK, for Chinese inputs to its own cars to be treated by the UK as though they were Korean.There’s another complication. Even if third countries did roll over their trade deals,\u0026nbspwhen it comes to solving the rules of origin problem the UK would, for various technical reasons, often require not just the agreement of the third country but also the EU as well (something Peter Holmes and Michael Gasiorek of the UK Trade Policy Observatory have\u0026nbsppointed out).So the message is: when it comes to a no-deal cliff edge, don’t just worry about damage to UK trade with the EU. Worry too about UK trade with all those countries with which the EU has deals.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

The first part would be to extend the post-Brexit transition period by an extra year to December 2021, to give the UK more time to agree a trade deal with the EU.‘Nobody’ in Brussels considering giving May concessions she needsThe second element is much more tricky.

But there is no evidence of any movement so far, and the language in Brussels remains strongly opposed to any changes to the withdrawal agreement.Ms May has promised to come back to parliament next week and set out whether she has made any progress.

Speaking to reporters, he said MPs’ orders to Ms May to replace the backstop were “unreasonable”, suggesting they “take the time to read” the withdrawal agreement.“The Irish protocol in the withdrawal agreement already allows for alternative solutions to replace the backstop, and if they’re there they can replace the backstop – that’s always been the point here,” he said.“The point here is that none of those ideas around alternative arrangements have actually stood up to scrutiny.

Buried in a document called Beyond the Horizon: The Future of UK Aviation, the government says “the UK will not fall below current standards of protection when we leave the EU”814 Entry regulations to the European UnionFrom 11pm GMT on 29 March 2019, UK travellers will become “third-country nationals” when travelling to Schengen countries and subject to the standard rules of admission for citizens of nations such as the US, Japan and Australia.

But if we are able to make progress sooner, then that might not be necessary.“We can’t know at this stage exactly which of those scenarios would happen.”There is\u0026nbspgrowing concern\u0026nbspamong ministers that there is not enough time to pass the necessary legislation before exit day,\u0026nbspamid reports that the February recess could be cancelled to give Ms May more time to win over the EU.Mr Hunt said a solution had “not been properly worked up” to replace the\u0026nbspIrish backstop – which aims to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland.\u0026nbspMPs backed a bid to\u0026nbspreplace it\u0026nbspwith “alternative arrangements” in a series of crunch votes on Tuesday.He said it was “difficult to know” if negotiations would run to the end of March, but added: “Whereas a week ago none of us really knew whether this was going to be possible, we are now in a situation where it clearly is possible.“There are lots and lots of hurdles –\u0026nbspno one is saying this isn’t going to be very challenging –\u0026nbspbut we do now have a consensus in parliament.“Providing we can do that, which I think we can, then I think there is a way through.”However his Austrian counterpart, Karin Kneissl, said it would be “very difficult” for the Brexit timeframe to be extended and warned that Britain could be heading for a no-deal exit.She said: “According to the Article 50 procedures, the deadline is 29 March,\u0026nbspso there is a time pressure because what couldn’t be reached by negotiation over the last years, it’s very difficult to imagine that there can be a tremendous breakthrough – a magic solution – in the next few days in order also to have this ratified in due time for the remaining EU members.”Created with Sketch.

leave the UK port or train station before you’ve told us that the goods have arrived.”Firms will be allowed to defer “paying any duty until the month after import”, by setting up a direct debit

aid package for Nissan to build new cars in the UK after Brexit, after insisting there had been no “special deal”.Greg Clark, the business secretary, came under fire as he announced the Japanese giant would have to reapply for the cash, after its shock decision to abandon production of the X-Trail SUV at its Sunderland plant.A letter revealing the package – originally set to be up to £80m – was

response, Mr Clark revealed that only £2.6m had been paid out so far – “about half for training of the workforce and half for environmental improvements to the plant”.And he told MPs: “Of course, the company will need to resubmit on the grounds of the new information that it has.”That new information, which emerged over the weekend, is that production of the X-Trail will be moved back to Japan, a decision partly caused by the Brexit crisis, the company said.The decision is a further blow to the UK car industry, following recent moves by Ford, Jaguar Land Rover and Honda to reduce their workforces and cut costs.Mr Clark said the decision meant that 741 planned extra jobs would no longer be created at Sunderland – although there were “no implications for existing jobs”.Pro-Brexit Tory MP refuses to back down over false Twitter claimWas Brexit behind Nissan’s decision not to build the X-Trail here?UK ports to wave through EU goods without checks after no-deal BrexitWhat is the Malthouse compromise and will it solve the Brexit puzzle?Mr Clark, who has hinted he will resign if the UK looks like crashing out of the EU without an agreement, added: “No deal is fully acknowledged, certainly by me and the industry, as being ruinous for our prospects.”The controversy blew up on a day when:* It was announced that UK ports will wave through goods from the EU without checks if there is a no-deal Brexit, to avoid huge traffic jams.* It was revealed that the prime minister will hold talks with business leaders in Northern Ireland on Tuesday, and its political leaders the following day.* Lord Trimble, the former Northern Ireland first minister threatened to take the government to court over the Irish backstop, claiming a breach of the Good Friday Agreement.* Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, raised hopes in Downing Street by saying a Brexit deal could be agreed if people were “creative” and if “there’s enough good will”.* A poll found that 45 per cent of voters back delaying Brexit beyond the scheduled date of 29 March to allow time to negotiate a better deal.Mr Clark defended the secrecy on the grounds that Nissan had been promised the aid would only be revealed “when the company said it was no longer commercially sensitive”.It was offered in return for a decision to build the Qashqhai and X-Trail models at the flagship northeast plant. The first car will still be built there.At the time, Mr Clark had said: “There is no question of financial compensation over tariffs because we have said that what is necessary is that we are going to maintain the competitiveness of the sector, and we are going to get the best deal possible.”Rebecca Long-Bailey, Labour’s shadow business secretary, accused the government of planning “managed decline’, saying: “Of course Brexit was not the only reason but it was pretty prominent in Nissan’s decision.”She said Mr Clark’s “quiet opposition to no-deal Brexit is of course well known, but still the juggernaut of government chaos hurtles on.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Instead, women tell themselves they should have been more attentive, or more ­attractive, or better in bed.This week the once queen of the TV jungle, Vicky Pattison, admitted she was wracked with self-doubt after her now former fiancé John Noble “cheated” on her.She even said sadly thatshe was “thinner” he might have remained faithful. This made my blood run cold.It’s typical that poor Vicky chose to shoulder the responsibility for his infidelity by not being “perfect” enough, instead of directing her anger at his betrayal. Noble was spotted with a string of young women on nights out and Vicky felt publicly humiliated and betrayed.One minute she was engaged to be married and planning her wedding. Then it all broke down and she was left in floods of tears. In order to salvage some pride, she decided to break up with Noble.Vicky really thought she had met her soulmate but, instead, it turned out he was just another man she couldn’t trust. She’s utterly devastated, but it’s infuriating her first ­reaction was not to think he’s a swine and cheat but that, somehow, she was the one to blame.Now, Vicky is a smart, feisty young woman and I’m sure she realises she was being very silly to imagine that being a few pounds lighter would have changed anything. But on some level she convinced herself she wasn’t good enough for Noble. Of course,it was the other way around it would be a dferent story.Noble proved he was a man-child, a commitment-phobe and clearly in no way ready to settle down. In these days of social media, he must surely have known thathe was chatting up other girls it would end up all over Twitter and Facebook and Vicky would discover what he was up to.Former Geordie Shore star Vicky says Noble claims he was set up in the photographs taken of him canoodling with a iety of young women, but he has expressed no remorse to her for his behaviour. He hasn’t apologised for breaking Vicky’s heart though he has been back in touch to ask for her engagement ring back.Vicky revealed that he hinted the split was actually her fault and, with her self-esteem and confidence at an all-time low, she actually believed him. His actions in those nightclubs would appear to be those of someone who wants to be found out, or perhaps he is just supremely arrogant.Anyway, I think Vicky has dodged a bullet. It’s painful and raw right now but, one day, she will realise she actually had a lucky escape. Whatthey had gone ahead with the wedding and a few years, and maybe a couple of kids down the line, he turned out to be a serial adulterer Vicky is a strong girl and will bounce back from this devastating experience. I hope her next ­relationship gives her a happy ever after ending. Butit goes awry again, she must not blame herself.And nor should any woman let down by her partner.ALL credit to Peter and Emily Andre, who have provided stability for their own children as well as Peter’s older son and daughter from his marriage to Katie Price.“The Pricey”, as Katie insists in calling herself, has been through tough times dealing with her mum’s terminal illness as well as some truly disastrous relationships.She might appear to be a cartoon character, but she should not be treated as a figure of ridicule. Despite the bold front, I reckon Katie is a mass of anxieties and insecurities and she is very vulnerable right now.I’m sure she is very grateful to her ex and especially to Emily for their support. I hope she takes time out of the public eye and gets her le back on track.I WAS heartened this week by the positive reaction to a married couple who are planning a family together, but whose circumstances mean that their only real option is surrogacy.So many wished trans couple Hannah and Jake Graf well in their quest – some even offered their services as a surrogate. They are a trailblazing man and we and role models who have helped young trans men and women in tough times.Hannah, was the highest ranking transgender soldier in the Army, and was awarded the MBE in the New Years Honours List.While actor and filmmaker Jake stars in Colette with Keira Knightley. Dominic West, who also stars in Colette, recommended that Hannah should take over from Daniel Craig as the first female James Bond.She thought this was flattering and hilarious, but reckons Jake would do a great job in the role. I am so very fond of both of them and in awe of their positivity. Their baby will be lucky to have such kind, loving parents.RIGHT everyone, you know what to do. Vote for Ernest Shackleton as the most influential person of the th century on Tuesday night’s BBC live show of Icons. My all-time hero is up against formidable opposition including Nelson Mandela, Dr Martin Luther King, Alan Turing, Pablo Picasso and David Bowie.Shackleton, the famous polar explorer also known as “The Boss”, was at his best when ­confronted by impossible odds, so I’m hopeful he can pull this off.When his ship, The Endurance, was crushed in the ice , Shackleton somehow ­managed to get all his men to ­Elephant Island in rowing boats.He then made the epic -mile voyage to South Georgia, where he climbed over uncharted mountains, to finally get his crew rescued. I was lucky enough to follow in his footsteps and re-enact that journey, then to pay my respects to The Boss at his graveside in South Georgia, right.If you don’t know his story then check out his book, South, or download the astonishingly good Channel  drama, Shackleton, starring Kenneth Branagh. And don’t forget to vote on Tuesday for this truly iconic ­British hero.BY all accounts, the Michael Jackson documentary Leaving Neverland, ­ which focuses on two men who say they were abused by the star as youngsters, is extremely disturbing and dficult to watch. If the allegations are true, then those who enabled such vile behaviour should be brought to account.Of course, Jackson is not here to defend himself, and he was found innocent of similar charges in a  court case, but the rumours have never gone away.No one wants to believe such actions could have been committed by the pop genius, whose music is still the songbook of many people’s lives. His fans remain loyal and will not entertain the thought that he might have committed any crimes.I feel sorry for his kids, especially daughter Paris, who is rumoured to have entered rehab again due to the stress and upset over the documentary.I can’t imagine how tough this is for a woman who loved her dad, but I suspect we will never really know what went on – and those on either side of the fence will never change their minds.TENNIS ace Andy Murray shared rather more than he meant to when he posted an X-ray of his hip after an operation to relieve the pain of an injury that has all but ended his career.The eagle-eyed ­– and mucky-minded – spotted there was an interestingappendage that drew the eye.Andy, above, might not be able to play tennis at the highest level any more, but he could easily take up snooker with that thing and become a world champion.IT emerged yesterday that all staff at the maternity hospital where Kate had her three babies have been told not to take any leave in April.That would suggest that after talking to her sister in law, Meghan has changed her mind about a home birth.So we will, after all, get that photo on the steps of the Lindo Wing of yet another proud royal mum looking as though she has just stepped off a catwalk.No wonder Meghan is hugging her baby bump so tightly.She knows the little one will be blinded by flashbulbs almost from the moment of emerging from the womb.   Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Tories need to show they’re above that.We don’t agree with much of Nick Boles’s plan for a Brexit so soft as to be barely Brexit at all. This week’s amendment, co-signed by Boles and Yvette Cooper, could have holed the whole operation below the waterline.But that does not mean he should be deselected. The Tory party has always been a broad church and it serves as a better party of government when pragmatism is its guiding force.For the first time in months, the Conservatives have shown the sort of professionalism and unity that the public expects of them.They must keep it together.IT is an outrage that speedboat killer Jack Shepherd continues to claim legal aid despite refusing toto Britain.Justice Secretary David Gauke cannot simply put his hands in the air and claim he’s powerless to do anything.Everybody has a right to a fair trial, and that often means help with legal costs. But how anybody on the run can be entitled to taxpayers’ cash is absolutely beyond us.Gauke has form for dodging tough decisions. His plans to reform Parole Board transparency in the wake of the John Worboys fiasco are still in a holding pattern.He has been renowned as a safe pair of hands for years.That reputation is rapidly disintegrating.A STONED teenager drives his parents’ Audi and kills two people — weeks after being stopped for suspected drug-driving.You’d probably expect the lout to spend some time at Her Maj’s pleasure. You’d at least expect him to be charged with manslaughter, or death by dangerous driving.But no.

So why lie Some people have been asking this weekjail is the best punishment for a speeding fine. But let’s be clear: She is not going to prison for speeding — she is going to prison for perverting the course of justice by lying about who was driving her car.That would be bad enough for an average citizen. But Onasanya is not an average citizen. She is a solicitor — and also an MP.An MP is known by the title ­“Honourable” for a reason: There is a code of conduct outlined for MPs which includes, among other things, integrity and honesty.Any MP has even more obligation than the average person to set a good example and to take responsibility for their actions — both of which she has failed, spectacularly, to do. She has acted asshe is above the law, which is simply not acceptable for someone whose job is to uphold the law.She no longer deserves the privilege of representing anyone in the legal or parliamentary system and it is clear to any right-thinking ­person that she should be struck off as a solicitor — and resign as an MP.It is her refusal to do this immediately which is the most astonishing thing about this story.That, plus Corbyn’s lack of ­leadership in not insisting she resign as soon as she was found guilty.By all accounts, it sounds like she was out of her depth as an MP from the get go. For a start, constituents complained she was uncontactable.She also spent £, of taxpayer’s money in seven months on “expenses” and was caught on video ­pretending to snort “cocaine”, which isn’t exactly a great look for an MP.The trial judge concluded the “truth comes a very distant second to your personal ambition, doesn’t it ”Whether or not that’s true, it is hard not to conclude, in the face of the evidence against her, that her refusal to resign as an MP is rooted in the £, salary it yields.But how is she going to help her constituents from prison One argument being made about her being sent to jail is that she is clearly not a danger to society, which is true. But the problem for the courts is thatyou take an oath to tell the truth, then fail to do so, it has to be considered a serious offence — and punished accordingly.Without a deterrent to stop people lying through their teeth, the justice system would collapse.Let’s face it, there is nothing about this story that makes Onasanya look good.She is going to have an ­electronic tag when she comes out.No doubt she is massively regretting not owning up to speeding in the first place — and taking the consequences.Her le is now in tatters.But resigning as an MP now might help her claw back a tiny bit of respect for finally doing the right thing. As a solicitor and an MP, she needs to take full responsibility for her actions.IT’S shocking that Bonita Baxter, a heavily pregnant woman with a serious heart condition, was forced to sit on an AE floor at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham for five hours after patients and visitors refused to give up their seats.Clearly, manners are no longer important to this nation.But the real issue is that the hospital was so overcrowded that, given the five-hour wait, no one was going to give up their seat.AE departments continue to be overcrowded in part because we continue to abuse the NHS, turning up to AE for anything from drunkenness to a broken fingernail.Anyone who has ever had to pay for their healthcare, as they do in North America, would respect our health service much, much more.In the meantime, we need to put measures in place to make sure that people start valuing what they have.There should be fines for people who don’t attend GP and hospital appointments.And AE should start turning away anything other than genuine emergencies.T’S heart-breaking, isn’t it, ­listening to Vicky Pattison blaming herself for the fact her fiancé, John Noble, had “grown close to” other women during a boys’ trip to Dubai “When something like this happens, you blame yourself and I did question myself. MaybeI was thinner he wouldn’t have done what he did,” she said on TV on Wednesday.Apparently, this charmer actually blamed her – and her size – saying that he was “set up” to cheat because of it. Vicky, darling,you are reading this: It’s not your fault he cheated. And no amount of dieting would have stopped him.A cheater’s always going to cheat.You need to take some time out to focus on yourself and decide not to be around people who make you feel bad about yourself. There is so much pressure on women today.There is so much emphasis on how they look and how other people see them, rather than a focus on real values, like the size of your brain.So I suppose it’s easy to understand how Vicky concluded that her appearance might be the “problem”.When the reality is just that she picked an a***hole to go out with.I ABHOR fat-shaming, and rudeness. And I have zero sympathy for the woman who refused to sit between two overweight passengers on a United Airlines flight from Las Vegas to New York.She caused a horrible scene and loudly called them “big pigs”, which is truly shocking.But luckily the shame was all hers, as her tirade went viral on social media – and she was thrown off the flight.It’s also true thatyou book a flight then you are entitled to the seat you’ve booked, andsomeone is taking up half of yours that’s not fair.But this issue should be dealt with by the airline, not passengers.Many airlines have an “obesity policy”. American Airlines, for example, requires passengers to purchase a second seatthey need a seatbelt extension and their body “extends more than one inch beyond the outermost edge of the arm rest”.I can imagine it’s a dficult and embarrassing rule to enforce – but it’s better than people taking matters into their ownhands.For once, I can say I did not stray, not even so much as once.THE Europeans screaming that the Irish backstop must remain are deluded.No Deal will affect Europe as much as – and in some cases, more than – the UK.And when the French farmers realise they can’t get their cheese across the border before it rots, and the Spanish – who sell more goods and services to the UK than it buys – are stranded with decaying goods, and when German car sales slump because tarfs make them too expensive, I predict riots across Europe.And then Michael Barnier will have a small dose of the pain he has inflicted on our PM.The reality is that citizens of these European countries, whose jobs will be under threat by No Deal, will not give a hootthere is or isn’t a hard border in Ireland.And frankly, all companies collect VAT for the Government and PAYE for them, so why not let them do the same for tarfs and be their own custom offices The Government can audit them once every three months, then the problem is solved.APPARENTLY, dog-walking in Tehran has been outlawed by the Islamic government in a crackdown against pet ownership.Dog owners will even face penaltiesspotted carrying their pets in a car.Tehran’s chief of police, Brigadier-General Hossein Rahimi, said the ban had been introduced because dogs “create fear and anxiety” among members of the public.Ironically, my experience is that dogs create exactly the opposite reaction.But what do you expect from a country that doesn’t allow women to initiate orce, dance or report a rape .Our country might be crazy at the moment, but let’s all breathe a sigh of relief we live here, rather than there.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Here, leading Conservative Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg offers his view:THE EU has taken an almost religious approach to Britain’s latest move towards securing a Brexit deal.The compromise put forward by my fellow MP Kit Malthouse has been immediately dismissed and any prospect of further negotiation turned away. The mighty EU has spoken and will not be gainsaid.In negotiating the compromise, both Leavers and Remainers made concessions. This has led to criticism from their supporters, as I found in my weekly radio show on LBC.Callers felt that I had become a “snowflake” in my willingness to see £billion of taxpayers’ money spent without giving us any advantage in future negotiations.The legal basis for the EU demanding money is weak. A House of Lords report came to the conclusion that while there could be a moral obligation, under UK, EU and international law there was no valid or forceful claim.The only motive for paying is to secure a good future deal, rather than to pay a ransom for our freedom.Yet I have come to the conclusion that leaving on March  is at risk and exiting the EU is a prize worth paying for and on which thewill be great.Unfortunately, in spite of the Referendum result, the majority of MPs are reluctant to see the UK part from the EU and at the least want terms that mirror our membership.This may well not be the view of most voters, who seem to welcome the clean break and are not fearful of the scare stories.It is, therefore, crucial to ensure the fears of those who are far from enthusiastic Brexiteers are assuaged. This is where the Malthouse Compromise comes in.By offering money and making the prospect of a No Deal Brexit unlikely, possible moderate former Remainers are willing to avoid Parliamentary tactics that would frustrate our departure.They can accept the replacement of the backstop, which could keep us tied in to the EU’s rules and courts forever, with a routine trade agreement based on existing processes commonly used around the world.This would not hamper the development of a future relationship which would be discussed once we have left. Although in these discussions we would lose the leverage of cash, we would not be squeezed by the backstop.The second stage of the compromise is that the implementation period could be extended by one year. Currently the withdrawal agreement proposes a maximum of two years.In this time we would remain subject to EU laws and what follows, but it makes the prospect of not finalising a future relationship less likely, which gives comfort to those who are determined to avoid No Deal.In my view, an extra  months of vassalage after  years is an unwelcome but not unaffordable price to pay. Critics may ask why Brexiteers want to lessen the chance of a No Deal departure — and the reason is simple.Regardless of the folly of Project Fear, which becomes more preposterous by the day, the Parliamentary arithmetic means we must either lessen the prospect by compromise or it will be done by sharp practice in the House of Commons.This could lead to delay or even no Brexit at all. This would destroy any remaining trust of politicians in our constitutional settlement, it would show reckless contempt for voters, yet the Brexit-denying amendment put forward by Yvette Cooper last week was only defeated by  votes.As with all compromises, Malthouse is not perfect but is enough for each side of the argument in the UK to accept.The question remains, will the EU response be positive  So far, it has not.This has always been at the heart of the debate, and in a way a compelling reason for going. Is the EU a Mafia-style organisation that has to punish countries that do not subscribe to its religion Their response to the Malthouse Compromise and the PM’s request to re-open the text will answer this question. It must be clear to the EU that the current withdrawal agreement will not do.Defeated in the Commons by the largest margin ever achieved in the lower house on Government business, it is simply too one-sided and allows too great a triumph to the EU.If the EU were to insist on its inalterability requiring the punishment of a recalcitrant, freedom-loving nation then it will reveal its true and barbarous colours. It would be evident on its own that we are right to leave.How much better it would bethis were wrong and that in fact the EU is the civilised organisation it claims to be — respecting democracy, the nation state and constitutional procedures.

Her squabbling party has called a temporary truce. And nobody, including the EU, wants Jeremy Corbyn to take control.Even Labour MPs are rallying behind her — at a price. And working-class voters have given the Tories a healthy seven-point lead. They might even win a snap election.Played skilfully, this could win a deal that satisfies both Remainers and Leavers.Yet there are fears Mrs May will use it to revive her wretched Chequers plan, which sparked the resignations of Boris Johnson and David Davis, or the botched deal thrown out last month by a -vote margin.She has made a worrying start by apparently binning the No Deal card — the only one that truly scares the EU. Mrs May has no intention of playing this ace — and never had.There are other worrying signs.This showdown with EU hardliners requires fresh thinking and shrewd advice from seasoned players. Crawford Falconer, an ex-World Trade Organisation ambassador, was recruited by the Brexit department for precisely these skills.Indeed, he is the ONLY person in the Government machine who has ever negotiated a trade deal.Yet bafflingly, Mrs May is keeping this star player on the sidelines.Instead, she will fly to Brussels with Whitehall mandarin Olly Robbins, the pro-EU fanatic who plunged Britain into the backstop trap she is now under pressure to escape from.Robbins hates Brexit and has privately warned the PM this is Mission Impossible.Mrs May — herself a Remainer who has never grasped the case for Brexit — will be joined by trusted “deputy PM” David Lidington, a dyed-in-the-wool Brussels worshipper.In such company, even the inclusion in her team of a thundering Brexiteer Attorney-General Geoffrey Cox is only mildly reassuring.Mrs May is notoriously stubborn. She can also be devious.After nearly three years, even her closest political colleagues — who can be counted on one hand with a couple of missing digits — have no idea what her Brexit might look like.Voters are increasingly irritated by this foot-dragging.Why should we remain part of an organisation that wants to punish us by stealing Gibraltar, Northern Ireland and our car industry Nobody who watched the brutal humiliation of poor little Greece will be surprised. This tragic and insolvent nation should never have been admitted to the EU, still less the Eurozone.Only with the assistance of US banking giant Goldman Sachs — “The Vampire Squid” — got them in under the wire. Once inside, they launched a borrowing and spending binge which ended in tears in the  crash.Greece might have flourished as a cheap but lovely tourist economy. Instead, it is now being cruelly tormented by Brussels and lumbered with multi-billion euros debts it can never repay.Greece symbolises all that is wrong with arrogant Brussels — the catastrophic Euro, inflexible economic policies and mass unemployment for under-s.Above all, there is the sneering contempt of unsackable Eurocrats for the million people they rule from subsidised ivory towers.Theresa May is a poor negotiator who never truly believed No Deal is better than a bad deal.Without this implicit threat, Brussels will give little and demand much in . It would be a pleasure to eat my words and watch Mrs May play a blinder.She can use her good luck to land a historic victory. Or she can blink and condemn Britain to colony status, paying billions more into EU coffers while being led by the nose on trade deal promises that never materialise.In which case, forget about that snap election fantasy.The Conservative Party would never be forgiven by the .million voters who voted Brexit — or those who wish they had.SECURITY CHIEFS are dusting off Cold War plans anticipating a Soviet nuclear strike to whisk the Queen to safety in the event of . . .  er . . . a No Deal Brexit.Presumably The Mall will be cleared of traffic and used as a landing strip to fly Her Maj out before revolutionary Remainers string her up for supporting Brexit.The only question is whether she will go quietly.The royals refused to leave London even after Buckingham Palace was bombed during the Second World War.This Project Fear nonsense is even more insane than the idea that thousands will die of fruit shortages.To quote Corporal Jones: “Don’t panic!!”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We need a fair Brexit”.The shard of optimism for No came as three days of intense talks began between ministers and leading Remainer and Leaver Tories over the ‘Malthouse Compromise’.The Government showed “genuine engagement” in the plan for an alternative backstop to keep the Irish border open using technology and stand-off declarations instead of having to follow EU rules, its backers said.But a ministerial source close to the talks cautioned on any break through, saying there was “a lot of detail to work through” before the PM decides whether to adopt it.Mrs May hopes to go to Brussels by the end of the week to pitch what changes she wants to the current Irish backstop.Remainer Cabinet ministers also heaped on pressure on her yesterday by warning Brexit will have to be delayed unless MPs vote for her deal “in short order”.Justice Secretary David Gauke challenged the PM’s official line that the UK will leave the EU on March  by insisting Brexit will only happen thenit is “smooth and orderly”.He added: “If we are to leave on March , MPs need to be backing a deal in short order”.The PM was also given multiple warnings from across the EU not to try to rip out the current backstop.Speaking in Tokyo, Mrs Merkel insisted it was “not on the agenda” to reopen the Withdrawal Agreement.But she said the EU and UK should use talks over the future relationship to find a way of ensuring the backstop is never needed.She said: “There are definitely options for preserving the integrity of the single market even when Northern Ireland isn’t part of it, because it is part of Britain, while at the same time meeting the desire to have,possible, no border controls.“To solve this point you have to be creative and listen to each other, and such discussions can and must be conducted.“We can still use the time to perhaps reach an agreementeveryone shows good will.”The remarks came as Mr Selmayr, who is Jean-Claude Juncker’s right-hand man, hinted at new legal assurances being added to the Withdrawal Agreement.Senior MPs said the top eurocrat raised the idea in a behind closed doors meeting with the Exiting the EU Committee.Afterwards Labour MP Hilary Benn said: “I got the impression that they might be prepared to consider some additional statement or legal protocol.“But, the big issue in other minds is will anything get the deal through the House of Commons ”Fellow Labour MP Stephen Kinnock said Brussels appeared open to “unzip the Withdrawal Agreement very quickly and then zip it up again”.He said Mr Selmayr had suggested the content of a letter of assurance penned by Brussels chiefs last month could be “copied and pasted” into the deal.The document, signed by Commission chief Mr Juncker and Council boss Donald Tusk, said the backstop “would only apply temporarily”triggered.Mr Kinnock said: “It would be window dressing, but window dressing as embedded in the Withdrawal Agreement.“It’s an integral part of what would be an international treaty so it would have far more weight than a letter.“But in terms of content of what it would say he was not offering anything dferent.”He added: “They’re ready to offer it but they won’t unless the Government can give a rock solid guarantee that this will get it over the line.”Former Cabinet minister Stephen Crabb said he had also left the meeting with the sense that “legal assurances are a possibility”.But he added: “He’s not convinced solving the backstop issue is the thing that will get a stable majority.”Fellow Tory MP Richard Graham said: “I don’t think it’s impossiblethey turn their letters into a legally binding annex or codicil.”But after the meeting Mr Selmayr insisted MPs had misread his remarks, saying “on the EU side, nobody is considering” reopening the Withdrawal Agreement.He said: “The meeting confirmed the EU did well to start its no deal preparations in December .”The German eurocrat also hit back at critics who say he is taking control of the negotiations, calling the claims “Brexiteer propaganda”.During the meeting Mr Selmayr stressed Brussels is ready to rewrite the political declarationthe UK changes its red lines.But Mr Barnier had much harsher words on a possible compromise after holding talks with Dutch PM Mark Rutte in The Hague yesterday.He said the backstop was the “only operational solution to address Irish border issue today” and the EU will only discuss an alternative to it after the UK has signed up to the deal.Mr Rutte urged Britain to “clary its intentions with respect to its next steps” as soon as possible.Meanwhile during a trip to Brussels Mr Coveney railed against the “wishful thinking” of Brexiteers seeking a technological fix for the border.In a furious attack he said eurosceptic MPs should “take the time to read” the Withdrawal Agreement and accused them of reheating discredited ideas.He fumed: “What Ireland is being asked to do by some in Westminster is to essentially do away with an agreed solution between the UK Government and EU negotiators and to replace it with wishful thinking.“I think that’s a very unreasonable request to ask the Irish Government to be flexible on.”Mr Coveney said the current deal “already allows for alternative solutions to the backstop” so long as it can be proved that they work.He said: “The problem has been that none of those ideas around alternative arrangements have actually stood up to scrutiny.“We certainly haven’t seen any that have. I’ve yet to hear any new thinking that goes beyond what’s already been tested and this is the issue here.”His remarks came after the EU’s deputy chief negotiator, Sabine Weyand, said Max Fac solutions could not be made to work “in the next few years”.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Personally, I didn’t.What I hope we’re all agreed on, though, is the fact that Danny’s too busy playing Danny Dyer, the professional geezer, to be a good listener or natural TV historian.It’s an act that worked, of course, when he was wondering, “Eleanor of Aquitaine, was she a looker ” but didn’t serve him so well when presented with a longbow.“Long, innit ”The Beeb clocked this before production started, obviously, so had paired him up with dozens of head-patting historians and actors who got him to dress up as every kind of medieval t**t you can imagine. Like Mr Benn on crack, it was.Armour, codpieces, nappies, tights, doublet and hose, and a gigantic white smock, bleached with human urine, which had one grovelling “courtier” wondering: “Has all the p*** been washed out, my Lord King ”A good question.We didn’t actually get the answer, though, until part two, on Wednesday, when, after a brief detour round his ancestors, Louis IX of France, William the Conqueror and Henry II, viewers got to the nub of things, with Professor Chris Given-Wilson explaining the agonising death of Edward II: “By thrusting a hollow instrument, like the end of a trumpet, up his fundament.”“’Old on a minute,” said a rattled Danny. “He’s been stabbed  With a trumpet ”“Into his fundament.” Long pause.“Don’t tell me it’s up his a**e ”Right up it, Danny, with a red-hot poker. News which didn’t just do his “nut in”, it seemed to derail the entire documentary.They ran out of direct royal ancestors shortly afterwards as well, and the BBC adopted its stupid default setting in such circumstances. It turned Danny’s Right Royal Family into a dance and cookery show, complete with demonstrations of both, from medieval experts.It was about this time I also sussed out what was going on in the background, with all those winsome historians. An audition.The BBC was using it to find its new face of history, though why any of the blokes turned up is a mystery. Auntie’s already made it clear: “The days of white, middle-aged men explaining stuff are over.”Danny, on the other hand, can be tolerated, because he’s their new performing Cockney. A novelty act who can be dressed up and patronised so much he ended this one doing some weird medieval can-can, with his family, in front of his lost ancestral pile.A trumpet wasn’t quite shoved up his fundament as they danced, but the p*** had very much been washed out of him, my Lord King.GREAT TV lies and delusions of the month. “I think it’s going to be a really great show.” Cheryl Tweedy, The Greatest Dancer.“We do TV shows and we’re national treasures.” Jedward, Celebrity Coach Trip.“People will remember my name and I love that.” Some t**t off Ship- wrecked.IF you’re to take anything from the news experts have claimed Monday, January  was the most depressing day of the year, it’s probably the fact the experts clearly never sat through what happened eight days later, on Tuesday, January .Britain’s Top  Dogs Live: .

Mrs May was expected to say she would do her “utmost” to support peace, prosperity and progress there. She will tell them: “We will find a way to deliver Brexit that honours our commitments to Northern Ireland... that commands broad support across the community.” However, a former Northern Ireland first minister undermined her bid to tackle shyanxieties.  Lord Trimble, an architect of the Good Friday peace deal, is seeking a judicial review of the controversial “backstop” designed to keep the Irish border open. Brexiteers fear it could tie the UK into a permanent customs union. Lord Trimble, says it should be removed from any deal. Mrs May will tomorrow hold talks in Belfast with the Democratic Unionist Party, which props up her minority Tory Government.  DUP leader Arlene Foster has put the PM under pressure over the “toxic” backstop she said “drives a coach and horses” through the Good Friday deal and could potentially “separate” Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK following Brexit. Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald and deputy Michelle O’Neill, who support the backstop, also meet Mrs May. Meanwhile, the PM invited Tory rebels to No to get their support.

Brian Higham felt pressure to persuade people with little cash to take out new loans or to refinance ones they had nearly paid off. As a Provident agent, he says he was told to befriend clients so he could convince them to borrow more. Brian, , left the Bradford-based firm in  after more than two years. In an exclusive interview with the Mirror, he said: “We never wanted the cycle of debt to end. “I felt like I had to entrap people who were already in poverty. “People who are on benefits don’t have much money, so they can always be persuaded. We were giving them the hard sell to get them into more debt. “We would approach around key dates when people need more money, like before Christmas and at the start of the new school year.”   Brian’s allegations come weeks after the Commons’ Business Select Committee demanded that the financial regulator take action against Provident after it “cynically” advertised .% APR loans to families over Christmas. Among the photos on Provident’s festive mailshot was one of a smiling young girl with a caption saying it would not be Christmas without “the look on her face”. Committee chair, Labour MP Rachel Reeves, wrote to the Financial Conduct Authority. She said she thought that “Provident cynically used the intense pressure on household finances over Christmas to target vulnerable customers”. “Provident tried to tug on the people’s heartstrings with [an] emotionally loaded message.” Provident remains the market leader in many parts of the UK because of its face-to-face relationships with customers. But Brian alleges this is used to encourage clients to keep taking out loans. He said: “Customer experience managers befriend these people, so the customer feels they are like part of the family. You get invited to barbecues and weddings. A bond of trust is created, but that is the deception. “There was a sense of a countdown towards a loan being paid off. We didn’t want customers to get to that point. The idea was they would be persuaded to stay in habitual debt. I came across people who had six or more loans. Others had been in debt for  or  years.”   Last week, it emerged that Provident – formed in  – shed a fth of its value on the London Stock Exchange. The lender still expects annual profits for  to be above poundmillion, but warned profits will be down due to an increase in bad debt in its Vanquis credit card ision. Provident’s car loan business, Moneybarn, is under an FCA investigation over affordability assessments and the treatment of clients in financial distress. In , BBC’s Panorama show interviewed relatives of a vulnerable shyschizophrenic woman who they said was given thousands of pounds in Provident loans. MPs have also scrutinised the firm. Last year, it had to give back poundmillion to customers for misselling financial products. Richard Frost, , had several loans with Provident after an agent called to his home in Birmingham two years ago. The father-of-two said: “Whenever I got close to paying it off, they were always around to offer me more money. “I felt like they wanted to extend them out for as long as possible.” Brian approached the Mirror after we launched the Fair Credit For All campaign with actor Michael Sheen last month. Brian says he resigned over practices which “manipulate the most vulnerable in our society”. Provident insists it lends “responsibly”, and said it will fully investigate the Mirror’s findings. Last night, a spokeswoman said agents are recorded when they visit customers to ensure they have been treated fairly. She explained that there is no commission to employees who set up loans or collect payments on those loans. Affordability checks have been tightened following the Financial Conduct Authority’s high-cost credit review published last year, she added. “Our customers need access to credit to live their lives. “We lend responsibly, our customers know what they need to pay back as the amount they repay is fixed at the outset and we work with them should their circumstances change and they find themselves in financial dficulties. “We’re committed to doing the right thing by our customers. Provident does not recognise the behaviours mentioned and will investigate these allegations thoroughly.” "},{"url":null,"title":"gang filmed mowing down defenceless","story":"NewsGang filmed mowing down defenceless teenager before they stabbed him to deathWARNING - DISTRESSING FOOTAGE Lord Promise Nkenda, , was rammed by the BMW before being chased down and brutally stabbed in Newham, east LondonShareByEmily Pennink:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video shocking-cctv-shows-moment-group-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThis is the moment a gang used a stolen car to mow down a defenceless teenager before he was kned to death in a horric Valentines Day attack. Lord Promise Nkenda was walking along the pavement in Newham, east London, when the BMW containing five youths accelerated towards him. He was hit by the car then pursued by four of the boys on foot into an alleyway where he was repeatedly stabbed in the head, back and chest in seconds. Paramedics battled to save his le but Promise was pronounced dead at the scene at about .pm on Wednesday February  last year. Prosecutor Alan Kent QC had said that Promise was deliberately run down by a car containing -year-olds Shemar Dawes, Ephraim Idris, Anton Muir, Ishaq Abdille and a -year-old boy who cannot be named for legal reasons.   The defendants from east London, who were aged  and  at the time of the attack, had denied murder but were found guilty following an Old Bailey trial. Abdille and Dawes were detained for le with a minimum term of  years. Idris, who was cleared of the murder of another -year-old six months before, was handed a minimum term of  years. Muir was sentenced to at least  years and the -year-old was given a minimum of  years.   Detective Chief Inspector Dave Whellams, from Scotland Yard, said: This group acted together from start to finish to execute this murder. They were ruthless in their determination to kill Promise and have refused to co-operate with police from the outset. Promise had his whole le ahead of him and wanted to pursue a career in the music industry. He stood no chance against the onslaught this group inflicted on him. The ages and determination of those involved - a boy who was  at the time of the attack and a group of other teenagers - is chilling.   The victims brother Patrick said: Promise was the youngest of our family and everyone always sought to protect him, however, on the night that he died, we could not be there to protect him. Promise died in a sustained and frenzied kne attack, he died alone and cold in the middle of the street. We never have got to say goodbye to him, we never got to tell him how much we loved and cared for him.   We feel empty and numb, but most of all incredibly sad. A part of us all died with him, alone on that east London street. These boys need to learn that killing one another is not the way, this should not be part of everyday le, seeing a young person stabbed on the news should be the exception, not the norm. An example should be made of anyone that carries a kne and anyone who hangs around with those that do to make it clear this is not the way to live, this is not what being a man is about.

Their son, who quickly became withdrawn, exhausted and depressed, killed himself six months later.Mrs Braithwaite said Jake became so involved with the virtual world it was to the “point of obsession”. She added: “No matter how we tried to restrict the hours of his access to this online social world, he would find a way around it, getting little or no sleep, and becoming emotionally overwhelmed.“He began having constant headaches ... and fits of shaking.  “His rapid decline from an independent, healthy, successful young man to the gaunt, depressed suicidal lad he became we attribute to his engagement with the digital world and social media.” Speaking after an inquest into the welding apprentice’s death, Mrs Braithwaite added that when Jake was younger, she and her husband restricted his access to the internet, digital games and social media. They felt he was too vulnerable for some of the hurtful comments online. She added: “Interpreting what’s real, and not real, is dficult for most people - autistic people see things in black and white,” she said, adding that imposing such restrictions became much more dficult when Jake became an adult. The coroner in Jakes home city of York concluded he had taken his own le.  The couple, who run the Braithwaite Gallery in Low Petergate, York said he became unable to disconnect from the virtual world. Facebook said it cared deeply about the wellbeing of people who used Facebook and its thoughts went out to those who had been affected by these kinds of issues. It added: “We recognise that mental health is a complex and nuanced issue, which is why we work with experts – including The Samaritans – to guide us on our approach. “We’re working with independent companies, policy makers, and experts to get a better understanding of the relationship between technology and well-being, which reinforces the need for more research. “We also devote signicant resources into developing technology which has helped first responders reach around , people globally who have needed help.” Mental health chiefs have taken action to ensure patients with autism receive better care since his death the inquest heard.

Michael Seed, , is accused of being the youngest member the six-strong gang that swiped pound.million of gold, cash and gems in . The swoop during the Easter Bank Holiday weekend hit  boxes at Hatton Garden Safe Deposit in London’s jewellery district. Seed listened intently in the dock as the case against him opened at Woolwich crown court. Prosecutor Philip Evans QC said the suspect known as Basil had remained at large after the rest of the gang were jailed. He said: “The prosecution case is that ‘Basil’ was a nickname and the defendant, Michael Seed, is that man. “The prosecution say Seed was involved in Hatton Garden and the subsequent laundering of the proceeds.”   Five of the gang – Brian Reader, , John Collins, , Daniel Jones, , Carl Wood, , and Terry Perkins, who died last year aged  – have been convicted of conspiring to carry out the burglary. And Mr Evans said the heist probe revealed some members committed a “strikingly similar” poundmillion raid at the Chatila jewellery store in Bond Street in the  August bank holiday weekend. Jones pleaded guilty to the burglary, while Perkins died before he could be tried. Charles Matthews, , was convicted earlier this year of receiving stolen goods from Chatila.   “The prosecution alleges that this defendant, Mr Seed, was also a participant in that earlier  burglary at Chatila” Mr Evans said. He added that the Hatton Garden and Chatila burglaries were “two high-value burglaries” that were “conducted by the same teams”. Seed, of Islington, North London, denies conspiracy to commit burglary and conspiracy to convert or transfer criminal property. The trial is expected to last four to six weeks.

Magazine History Revealed has debunked a top  of fake facts you thought you knew, but it turns out you never did: AMERICA DIDN’T BECOME INDEPENDENT ON JULY  On July , fireworks and festivities across the US celebrate America’s independence from Britain, gained in . What is interesting is that the War of Independence carried on after July ,  and would do so until the Treaty of Paris was signed seven years later. The day was chosen to commemorate when the Declaration of Independence was finalised, rather than the end of the war. The colonies considered themselves independent but it wouldn’t be until September ,  that Britain formally recognised this. John Adams and Thomas Jefferson, the only two people who signed the Declaration of Independence and also became Presidents of the US, both died on July ,  – the th anniversary of the Declaration. NO WITCHES WERE BURNED AT SALEM Witches being burned at the stake is an image that crops up whenever the infamous witch trials of Salem, Massachusetts, are mentioned. In , more than  people were suspected of witchcraft and  were found guilty after rumours filled the local people with fear.   But despite the many paintings and images of witches being burned at the stake, no-one at the Salem trials was executed this way. The guilty were hanged, while one man, farmer Giles Corey, who refused to plead was pressed between stones for two days before he died. Many people think that all the “witches” were women, but a quarter of them were men. AN APPLE DIDN’T FALL ON NEWTON’S HEAD Like Archimedes’ Eureka moment in the bath, Sir Isaac Newton’s altercation with an apple, leading to his theory of gravity is well-known. Newton apparently did witness an apple falling from a tree near his home in  but his theory of gravity was already partly formed in his mind. It’s also unlikely it fell on his head. He seems to have used the tale as an easy way to illustrate his findings. Newton was the second Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge - a position which just over  years later was held by Professor Stephen Hawking. CLEOPATRA WASN’T EGYPTIAN She remains the most famous woman of the Ancient world, yet it might come as a surprise to many that Cleopatra wasn’t Egyptian. The famed lover of both Julius Caesar and Mark Antony was descended from the Macedonian Greek Ptolemaic dynasty, which took over Egypt after the death of Alexander the Great in BC. She was the first in her line to learn Egyptian and embraced many of the country’s traditions. But she was also the last of her line as after her death in BC, her kingdom became part of the Roman Empire. COLUMBUS NEVER SET FOOT IN AMERICA During his  expedition to the Americas, Christopher Columbus never actually set foot on what we now know as North America. Instead it’s believed he set foot on an island in the Bahamas, as well as Cuba and Hispaniola – now the Dominican Republic and Haiti. He also wasn’t the first European to reach the continent, as th-century Icelandic explorer Le Erikson is believed to have made landfall on the Canadian coast in c AD. He named the area Vinland due to the abundance of grapevines. NAPOLEON WASN’T SHORT During the Napoleonic Wars of – between Britain and France, the British media repeatedly ridiculed French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte for being short.   This belief even coined the Napoleon complex – the idea that some people aggressively gain power to make up for short stature. Napoleon was actually believed to be ft in – average height of a man in the early th century. However, due to a confusion about French units of measurement, he was originally said to be ft in. CAESAR WASN’T BORN BY C-SECTION Everyone knows where the word caesarean – the surgical delivery of a baby – comes from, don’t they  It’s a common belief that the name was coined as Julius Caesar was born this way in BC but there are some issues with this. In Ancient Rome, caesareans were carried only outthe mother had died during childbirth but Caesar’s mother, Aurelia Cotta, was known to have survived. The word caesar means to cut so it’s possible that one of his ancestors was born this way, creating the family name. RING O’ ROSES ISN’T ABOUT THE PLAGUE The lyrics of popular nursery rhyme, Ring a Ring o’ Roses, are often said to reference the cheery topic of the Black Death. But folklore experts have dismissed the idea, which only appeared in the th century, as many versions of the rhyme don’t include lyrics that could be about the disease. Some scholars believe it has pagan roots and all falling down is not a reference to dying of plague but an instruction to curtsy. The plague killed more than  million people across Europe during the th century. VIKING HELMETS WEREN’T HORNED A Viking is hard to to imagine without a horned helmet. But there is no evidence to suggest that the fearsome Norse warriors ever wore them. None have even been found. At a performance of Richard Wagner’s Der Ring des Nibelungenin the s, horned helmets were worn by the Viking characters creating the familiar and stereotypical image.These may have been inspired by ceremonial horned attire worn during the Nordic bronze age, which signicantly predatesthe Vikings.NERO NEVER FIDDLED Roman Emperor Nero has been painted as one of history’s villains – however there’s one story that shouldn’t be believed. In AD , a fire swept through Rome. So the tale goes, Nero played the fiddle while the city was razed. He was actually  miles away in Antium, and ordered that his palace be opened up for the homeless. The fiddle wouldn’t be invented for another thousand years. He did however have his mother Agrippina killed, so he wasn’t all good by any means.  For the full feature, see the latest issue of History Revealed magazine, out now"},{"url":null,"title":"libby squire neighbour claims heard","story":"NewsLibby Squire: Neighbour claims to have heard a woman’s \"blood curdling\" screamThe mum-of-two, who lives round the corner, said she heard the scream  minutes after the last confirmed sighting of Libby in HullShareCommentsByLucy ThorntonMark Branagan:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video libby-squire-police-continue-searching-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:,],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA neighbour claims to have heard a woman’s “blood curdling” scream the night Libby Squire vanished. The mum-of-two says she was reading in bed when she heard the panicked cry of a woman in the street outside. The startled woman, who has reported it to police, said it was .am on Friday -  minutes after the last confirmed sighting of Libby. Libby was last seen sitting on a bench in Hull, East Yorkshire on Thursday at .pm, less than  yards away. Today her distraught parents, held hands as they released an emotional video begging her to get in touch. Mum Lisa Squire, from High Wycombe in Buckinghamshire, said: “It is breaking my heart not knowing where you are.”   The video was released as Humberside Police took to rubber dinghies for a painstaking search of nearby Barmston Drain waterway. They used an underwater camera in one of two frozen waterways, both a few minutes walk from Libby’s home. Witnesses have told how Libby was turned away from the Wellly nightclub on Thursday night for being too drunk. A pal put her in a taxi and she was dropped off outside her home a mile away. But her neighbours said she never made it through her front door and went off staggering down the street. She ended up sat on a nearby bench where she was caught on CCTV. The scream was allegedly heard just around the corner from netball player Libby’s terraced shared student house on Wellesley Avenue.   The concerned mum of two, who lives in nearby Heathcote Street near where it joins Wellesley Avenue, said: “We did hear screaming at . on Thursday night. “I was just in bed reading. We do get a lot of students who live in the road that Libby lives in who use this road as a cut through. “They go past screaming, shouting and singing. It’s not unusual. “But this made us sit up. It sounded like someone being attacked. The scream sounded like it was coming from someone who was scared. “It was someone walking quite close past our house. It was just one female scream. “It was really shrill and urgent. It made me sit up and think ‘Oh my God’.  “Then we heard other voices muttering very low, murmuring and then more screams and more male voices. “Then we heard the slamming of a door. It sounded like a wooden door or a garden gate. “It was just very odd,” added the woman, a Hull University graduate whose dad is a retired policeman. “We didn’t think about it again until the police came round knocking on everybody’s doors on Saturday,” she recalled. “We talked about it and remembered the scream and rang .”   Humberside Police have still not come around to take a statement after she reported the incident on Saturday evening. The force has been contacted for comment. Meanwhile, the hunt for the missing girl has been stepped up with officers rummaging through bins and lting drain covers in search of clues. The Hull University philosophy and religious studies student moved into her shared house with two other flat mates four months ago. Her disappearance has stunned and frightened fellow residents and students. Student Tom Wilkinson, , a pal of Libby’s flatmate Chloe Wise, said: “Everyone is scared. Everyone is still worried for her. No one feels safe when they go on a night out. “As students we got out a lot but it’s scary thinking you can’t even get a taxi back and be safe.”  Louisa Amasanti, , said: “It’s scary and surreal. No one is going anywhere alone. “Everyone has all kinds of theories but people seem to think she wandered off somewhere and fell somehow.” Her father Russell, , said in their video appeal: “Libby is our kind, thoughtful, beautul girl who is loved by so many people. As you can appreciate, this is a very dficult time for us both. “We would like to thank everyone for their help and support so far. “Your messages and kind words are a great source of strength for us both. “Please come forward with any information you may have no matter how small or irrelevant it may be, we just want Libby home.” Libby’s mother, Lisa, , added: “Libby, my darling pie. We just want to know that you are safe. “Please get in touch with us any way you can. The whole family is missing you especially me and your dad, sisters and brother. “I miss you so much.

The -year-old monarch stepped out in a peach coat and matching hat on Sunday as she attended a church service in Norfolk, similar to an ensemble worn by the -year-old Duchess of Sussex last week on a visit to the National Theatre. She may have taken inspiration from Meghan just this once, but it’s normally the duchesses who are copying their grandmother-in-law, especially when it comes to eye-popping colours.

Mrs Hobbs, , said: Its hard to imagine what could have happenedI hadnt gone for a facial with Erika but I know I might not be sitting here today. Mrs Hobbs, an accountant from Chislehurst, Kent, admitted she had noticed a mole at the top of her chest was darker than normal while she was on holiday in the south of France in August, but dismissed it, thinking the colour change was caused by tanning. But when she went for a facial with Mrs Hodgkiss in October, the beautician told her she was worried it had changed since their last session and urged her to visit a doctor.  Mrs Hobbs said: Im an optimist so even when the GP referred me to a dermatologist who told me he wanted to take the mole off, I didnt think it would really be cancer. But when I went back to the clinic the consultant asked me to sit down and told me the results had come back saying it was melanoma. I was so shocked. She had to undergo further surgery to remove more skin to ensure the cancer had not spread, leaving an inch-long scar on her chest. Luckily the results came back clear, although she is now keeping a close eye on her other moles. She said: Theres quite a big scar there now - but Im alive so thats all that counts. I cant believe my own naivety that I had noticed the mole but thought it was fine. I think we have a big problem with recognising skin cancer in this country.   Skin cancer is on the rise in Britain, with melanoma rates soaring by  per cent in the past  years, and it is now the fth most-common cancer in the UK. The UK has higher mortality rates from melanoma than the European average, which experts blame on late diagnoses. Mrs Hodgkiss is one of a growing band of beauticians, hairdressers and therapists who have signed up for training to detect skin cancer in a bid to improve Britains survival rates. Cancer charity Skcin has trained nearly , beauty professionals to recognise the disease since it launched the Mascedonline training course last year. The scheme was inspired by the idea that more people have their skin looked at closely on a regular basis by a beautician or hairdresser than by their GP. Within just eight months of completing the training, Mrs Hodgkiss, , has helped saved the le of Mrs Hobbs and two other women, all of whom had surgery to remove melanoma tumours. The beautician, who specialises in facials at her salon in Crockenhill, Kent, took the course because she occasionally had clients ask questions about their skin which she couldnt answer. But she was shocked by the number of suspect skin cancer cases she started noticing. I just cant believe how many people I have seen with something unusual on their skin in just a few months, she said. Sometimes they have no idea because the mark is on their back but most of the time they are aware it is there but they say: Oh thats nothing, its just a mole. I tell them Ive been on the course and encourage them to get anything suspicious checked by a doctor. Luckily the three women who were diagnosed with melanoma have come out the other side but its scary to think it would have spreadI hadnt spotted it. If I hadnt seen them for a facial, they wouldnt have known they had cancer. Mrs Hobbs said: If I hadnt had that facial,Erika hadnt seen the mole,she hadnt been on the course, I dont know what would have happened. Im so lucky all those things came together just in time. Nearly half of people taking the Masced training course were beauticians, hairdressers or barbers, but nail technicians, chiropodists, masseurs, chiropractors and even dentists have also signed up. Claire Dale, campaign manager at Skcin, said: A year on from launching our campaign its amazing to hear about three lives saved by just one of our beauty therapists. With nearly , professionals now trained by Masced, we hope it will save hundreds of lives every year. The Masced training programme relies on donations. To help, go to: www.justgiving skcin donate.

Schoolboy Tommy Howard officially launched shop Dog In A Box on eBay last year - named after his pet pooch Oreo. Stocking , products that he ships all over the world when he gets home from school, he never takes a day off. And the youngster even works over the school holidays to fulfil around  orders a week. He got the idea when his little brother put a pound Nerf gun on his birthday list two years ago, and Tommy realised you could buy a whole bundle second hand for less. The savvy schoolboy sold eggs from the family farm to buy his first batch of toy weapons, then reinvested the money with his pocket money to buy new stock. Are you like Tommy  Do have an inspiring story about how you set up your business  Let us know at webnews@trinitymirror   After selling more than , of the foam guns, he officially launched shop Dog In A Box on eBay last year and branched out to other toys. The pint-sized businessman does all the work himself - phoning manufacturers, liaising with wholesalers, and even cycling on his bike after school every day to meet the postie. Last year he tucked away an impressive pound, profit, helped by a festive surge of his best-selling product Top Trumps and paddling pools he flogged during the heatwave. Tommy, from Hawkchurch, Devon, who dreams of warehouse shops all over the country, said: People may question my age but to that I would say Why not  Im passionate and capable and thats what you need in business. Im probably more capable than some adults. I used to find people didnt take me seriously when I first started out. People shouldnt think because Im young I can be taken advantage of. I know my stuff.   The Year  student first came up with the idea of launching his own business when younger brother Jamie, now , put a pound Nerf Gun on his birthday list two years ago. Noticing how expensive and popular they were, Tommy started researching prices online and found a second-hand bundle on Gumtree for pound. With money earned from selling his chicken eggs across his village, the teen bought them, scrubbed them up, and listed each one inidually on eBay for pound-pound. He sold out within a week and, in true entrepreneurial spirit, Tommy decided to use the pound profit to buy ten more of the toy from Gumtree. He said: I was just watching a normal YouTube video where at the end they showed a tour of their warehouse, where they kept their merchandise and I was just thinking ‘wow imagine owning a company that can warrant a warehouse like that. “I was then on a mission to make my very own business. “When Jamie put it on his birthday list I was shocked at how expensive they were.  “For a -year-old pound is a lot of money. I did a bit of research online and found brand new were so expensive and you could buy big second hand Nerf bundles for the amount you could buy one new gun. “I was buzzing to make my first sale. “They had a couple of scratches on so I gave them a clean up before I took pictures and listed them online. The price was a pound or two cheaper than what they were retailing at all the big stores so I could still have the edge. He added: I bought another bundle with my profit and my pocket money and they sold out within days too. I loved the whole process of deciding which products to go for, seeing how customers react. Demand was growing and I found myself selling quite a few Nerf Guns to Portugal which I had to use a courier for. I foundI started misspelling keywords Id find a tonne of cheap Nerf Guns. I did this until I rinsed Gumtree and eBay of all their cheap guns. The schoolboy sold more than , in a year until he noticed his margins were shrinking - and looked for a solution.  I remember thinking to myselfI don’t expand I’ll never grow at this rate, he said. “The Nerf guns were popular and I would often find myself out of stock. Despite a teacher telling him it wasnt worth the hassle, he phoned Hasbro - who make Nerf guns - and the toy giant provided him with a list of suppliers. He tried to find a wholesaler but was told he needed to be a registered business in order to buy in bulk. Tommy said: “I mentioned it to my business teacher and he said there was no point contacting them as they would only sell to big companies directly. “I said to dad “Let’s just do it, what’s the worst that can happen anyway ” “So that day after school I rang up Hasbro and it had the best possible outcome I imagined. “Of course, they couldn’t supply us directly but they gave us a list of their biggest wholesale distributors who stock their products and with that we got ringing and account making.” He registered as a business on eBay in March  and ordered in  dferent kinds of products from wholesalers. He got his engineer dad Charlie, , to put up shelves in one of their converted milking parlours at their farm to store his products, and toys started flying off the shelves. He now stocks more than , products, selling an average of  a day and shipping to more than  countries. Every day, the savvy teenager gets home from school at pm with only  minutes packaging and labelling time before meeting local postman Leo at the village postbox half a mile away. Best-sellers include Glove-a-Bubbles, Nerf Guns and fun-sand and he has recently added a pound touch screen as his top-ticket item.  Tommy has managed to make thousands of pounds while his peers begin their GCSEs, making his dad and -year-old mum, Claire, a nanny, proud. He has his own sales manager at a suppliers in Cambridgeshire who he said took me under his wing. Tommy said: When we phoned up it really started to feel like I was becoming a proper business. I was helped around by a guy called Jimmy Singh who was the nicest sales manager ever. He took me under his wing and would help me find things that had good margins and were selling. Unfortunately Nerf Guns just didn’t have margins that could make me any money. “So, with that I decided I would sell toys as a whole and my sales manager helped me do just that. “He gave me a heads up on this new product Glove-A-Bubbles. They were just releasing TV campaigns going out with it which was going to boost the sales.” Tommy placed his first wholesale order with  units of Glove-A-Bubbles as well as some other arts and crafts toys. He said: “It was my first taste of what it was like to be a big seller on eBay. I had already bought a pound second-hand industrial label maker which really helped with the growing orders. “I noticed my sales go up almost instantly. In the first couple of weeks I sold eight units of Glove-A-Bubbles. “Then one day I turned my phone after school and I couldn’t believe my eyes.  “It read ‘paid post now  items’. I showed my dad and we thought it was a glitch. “But it wasn’t I had actually sold  items in a day. “I got home and instantly ordered another  units. But after a three-month high as Dog In A Boxs best-selling product, Tommy saw his orders plummet to zero when manufacturer Zing ceased advertising. The youngster, who named the business after his dog Oreo, said: My sales were going up and up and up and then all of a sudden I had nothing. I had no idea what happened. I phoned up Jimmy and he said that the company pulled the TV advertisement. He didnt know why but my sales were flat after that. “I’ve still got  units of them as I’ve only managed to sell  in the past year. “But it taught me a hard lesson about dead stock. Theres no guarantee in business. Keeping an eye on customer trends, Tommy made a splash of money selling paddling pools during last year’s summer heatwave.  He said: I thought there must have been demand for swimming pools and it complimented all my other products. To test the water I bought four, listed them in the morning and by the end of the day they were gone. I was shocked but that confirmed to me they were a winner. Id buy them for as low as pound. and sell them for around pound. I think I sold about  in total. I was really happy with that. He added: “I’ve got the best postman ever who collects from the post-box at the top of our lane and every day at :pm. “I either walk, cycle orthe weather is really nasty or the sacks are too heavy I get my dad to drive me up. With his business growing by the day Tommy is planning a trip to a Birmingham trade show next week. Tommy hopes to roll-out Dog In A Box across the UK, making it the go-to destination for shoppers. Tommy said: I dont want to be held back or restricted to toys. Im always looking to what  I can add. Im looking to get more technology products listed as everyone could be a potential customer. I want to have warehouses across the country similar to Screwfix and Travis Perkins where you have a warehouse in the back and the counter at the front. “I dont think Brexit will affect me doing that as the majority of my sales are from within the UK.

Mr Smith got a pass out from hospital to fight the cruel decision, which had repeatedly denied him Employment Support Allowance , and has finally won his appeal, the Liverpool Echo reports.Now, Stephen will receive back-payments for the money he has wrongly been denied, including all ESA sums. A spokesman for the DWP said: We are sorry for the experience Mr Smith has had and we are committed to ensuring that people with health conditions get the support theyre entitled to.   Following the independent tribunal’s ruling, he is now receiving full ESA support. While Mr Smith continued to receive benefits and support during his appeal, we can confirm he will shortly receive all back-payments for ESA due.”Repeated calls to grant Stephen ESA were denied - despite written evidence from doctors stating that he couldnt walk for  metres without collapsing with pain and exhaustion.Stephen, of Kensington, Liverpool, has suffered with a number of serious conditions for several years. His most debilitating illness is Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, an incurable respiratory problem that causes severe breathing issues and gets worse over time.

Throughout this period, Stephen was living alone and didnt know where to turn as his health deteriorated. He said: I could only make it to the kitchen to make food once a day. I had no muscles in the back of my leg which meant I couldnt stand up at all - and had to lean or sit down all the time - but they were telling me I was fit for work. He believes he could have diedit wasnt for two men, Tony Nelson and Terry Craven. Tony runs the CASA community centre in Hope Street which offers support to people who dont know where to turn.   Tony introduced Mr Smith to Terry, a former city council welfare officer who works at the CASA advising people on benefit claims. After Stephen was kicked off ESA, Terry took up his case and battled with the DWP to get him the benefits he knew he deserved. In response to the DWPs U-turn, Terry said: It is an outrage for a senior citizen of one of the richest countries in the world to have been treated like this by a Government department. Steve should not have been deprived of his just entitlement for a week let alone two years. He has worked all his le and ran several businesses successfully. This Government’s policies and its denial of poverty are challenged by Steve’s circumstances. No justication could possibly exonerate this Govermment’s responsibility for Steve’s plight. I am just glad this is not a death story. Am I owed back payments  Most of those affected are people who moved from incapacity benefit to the contributory version of ESA. The DWP says it will contact those hit. How much am I owed  The average payment so far has been pound,. Early estimates suggested a small number lost poundk. About , entitled to the severe disability premium were estimated to be owed around pound, each. When will I be paid  poundm arrears will be paid to , people whose cases post-date  through to April . Another poundm will then be paid to an estimated , people whose cases pre-date  in the   financial year. How will I be paid  The same way you normally get benefits, usually your bank account, within  weeks of being contacted by the DWP. What about claimants who have died  If your relative died while waiting for payment, you should be entitled to claim their benefits. The DWP claims it is trying to find their families so they can have that money. Will that money be paid back with interest  Its not clear. Ms Newton dodged this question when asked directly in the House of Commons. For more information click here.  This included sending the opinions of two separate doctors who both confirmed the signicant dficulty and pain experienced by Mr Smith when completing simple movements and daily activities. One doctors note stated: It is my opinion that Mr Smith could not walk  metres without pain or exhaustion. But despite this, in January last year, his appeal was rejected by the DWP who told him that he hadnt scored the required number of points to deem him as having limited capability for work. But Stephen and Terry continued to battle over the next year and eventually were granted the chance to fight the decision in a tribunal earlier this month -  months on from that DWP rejection. Speaking today, Terry said: I have got lots of cases like Steves - I have a client at the moment who is actually on dialysis and has been thrown off benefits.

Dominique Montgomery, , survived for years on nothing by greasy fast food - eventually reaching stlb. Despite suffering cruel taunts and bullying - even once having a burrito thrown at her by a total stranger at a football game - Dominique never lost sight of her dream to become a model. Now, following a remarkable transformation whereby she shed  stone, Dominique has strutted her stuff on the runway at the USAs celebrated Los Angeles Fashion Week - and will repeat the experience at the New York shows next month. Reliving the terrying  day which changed her le, after she became trapped by a rapidly rising tide, Dominique, of Los Angeles, Calornia, said: “I always wanted to model, but was so focused on being overweight that I had no idea how it would happen. “But now, my confidence has improved so much and I have learned not to be so hard on myself.   “I can’t explain how exciting it feels to be up on that runway. You can’t even see anything as the lights are so bright – all you can hear are cheers.” Embarking on her first diet aged just five, so big her school unorms had to be specially made, Dominique, who has also started her own personal training business, combining mindfulness with fitness and nutrition, has fought a lelong battle with her weight. After trying and failing on a multitude of diets, eventually resigning herself to a letime of obesity, she admitted: “I struggled with an eating disorder that most people don’t talk about – binge eating. “I couldn’t control how much I ate and, eventually, I stopped caring. As I was already so big, I thought nobody would noticeI ate more.”  Enjoying a staple diet of fast food and takeaways, washed down with fizzy pop, Dominique struggled with portion control and regularly ordered meals like fried chicken with double chips and two biscuits – a scone-like buttermilk bake – or a burrito “as big as her head,” with two large tacos on the side. “I would eat at least , calories a day. Sometimes, I would have large shakes for dessert that were about , calories by themselves,” she said. Her self-esteem shrinking with every pound she gained, Dominique eventually took to eating in her car, away from the prying eyes of judgemental strangers.   She added: “My confidence was low. I felt very hopeless and began to irrationally blame every problem in my le on being big.” But everything changed in July , during a day at the beach with friends. She recalled: “I was swimming around, feeling great, when all of a sudden, the tide got high. “Everyone managed to push themselves out of the water onto some rocks, but I was stuck, because I wasn’t physically able to lt myself out. Everyone tried to help, but I was too heavy. “I thought I was going to die and had no idea what to do. I was terried.” Thankfully, she managed to hold on until the water calmed, but she was left severely shaken. She added: “If I couldn’t even help myself out of the water, then what was I doing with my le ” Since then, Dominique, who now weighs just over st and is a UK size eight, has embarked on a healthy regime, ditching the fast food and heading to the gym. But, having been left with folds of excess skin - particularly around her stomach - by her rapid weight loss, while she has toned up slightly by working out, she is also saving for ,surgery to remove it.   Around four months ago, keen to help to others beginning their own weight loss journeys, she even launched her own personal training company. “Lots of people were asking me how to lose weight, so I wanted to devise something that tackles fitness and nutrition as well as mindset. It’s important to look at why people have gotten to that point, and what is stunting their progress,” she said. “I am hoping to eventually make it an online business, so anyone from anywhere in the world can get involved.” Then, in October , after finding herself an agent and trainer, Dominique fulfilled her lelong ambition - becoming a runway star at Los Angeles Fashion Week, modelling for brands Lorenz Couture and Esti Nay, as well as in showcases for The Model Experience and Model Mafia LA. And, shining in the spotlight, all her insecurities about her remaining apron of skin melted away. She added: “With my first show, it did cause a little problem as I’d applied some  tan, which ended up uneven where my skin folded over – but I changed outfit last minute so you couldn’t see it.   “I prefer walking in couture shows, as you can wear lovely long, flowing gowns but either way, when you’re up there, it’s so exciting that you don’t think about much .” In February, Dominique will also be giving a repeat performance at New York Fashion Week, and hopes it will pave the way to one day realising her ultimate dream of starring in the iconic Victoria’s Secret fashion show. “The designs are impeccable, and it is just such a renowned show,” she sighed. Her le – and body – now unrecognisable, Dominique has even written a book called The Gt, in which she shares everything she has learnt about confidence, self-belief and achieving your goals. “All I want to do now is help and motivate people in any way I can,” she said. “I also want to reassure people that it’s okay to go at their own pace and that every dream, everything that starts with a thought, is absolutely possible.” "},{"url":null,"title":"wayne manor dot cottons house","story":"NewsFrom Wayne Manor to Dot Cottons house - how much it would really cost to live in fictional homes in real leSome of the most well-known fictional homes in film and TV would cost today you a pretty penny in todays worldShareCommentsByHayley Coyle:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB NewsThe fictional castle from Beauty and the Beast \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHave you ever wanted to live in Albert Square so you could visit the laundrette, get a bite to eat in the caff and a pint at the Queen Vic.

Lauren Barrass, , blasted Eastend Diner in Blakelaw, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, in the online review over their allegedly aggressive manner when dealing with her complaint over small portions on Sunday.However she was stunned when Sfu Syed, , who lists himself as the takeaways boss on Facebook , appeared to respond by calling her a f***ing tramp and an ugly b****.After ignoring the abusive post, she says she was contacted directly by his brother Bahar Uddin Syed, , who called her a fat c***t and a Humpty Dumpty lookalike cow. The takeaway claim that Sfu and Bahar are the sons of takeaway co-owner Ashraf Syed and no longer work at the outlet. Co-owner Ashraf apologised for their vile comments over the bad review - however appears to have subsequently removed the apology.   Compliance agent Lauren slammed the half-hearted apology after feeling Sfus messages had been threatening since they goaded her to complain directly to him. Lauren, from Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Tyne and Wear, said: Its so ridiculous. I cant believe how personal and horrible they have been. I felt threatened by the wording and I thought I was more thick-skinned, but with people calling your personal appearance, it does get to you. I left work and I saw the owners son Sfu had written above my review calling me an f***ing tramp and telling me to get in touch. It felt like a threat - I was gobsmacked. I couldnt comprehend it to be honest. Lauren and Jamie ordered a Munchie Box from the takeaway, however when it arrived they claim the portion size was really small.   When they called EastEnd Diner to complain, they were denied a refund and were allegedly spoken to aggressively by a manager. Lauren said: When our order came Jamie took it into the kitchen and I just heard are you joking  The portion sizes were ridiculous so we rang the takeaway to say sorry, this isnt what we were expecting. It is really small - Im wonderingyou could come and pick it back up and give us a refund. The person we initially spoke to said he wasnt going to pay to send a driver to pick it back up because theyd have to pay the driver. The manager came on and reiterated what his colleague had said and started getting quite aggressive on the phone. Jamie, out of sheer disgust, just ended the phone call.  A couple of days later, as Lauren left work she noticed one of the sons, Sfu, had appeared to comment on her post - swearing and mocking her appearance. The post, written publicly on Facebook and later deleted, read: You know what it is [my] dads had his business in Blakelaw for over  years and had never had this problem. All of a sudden some stingy b****h start talking about [my] dads business...Well guess what b***h [my] dads still laughing all the way to the bank every day. He still lives in a million pound house and drives the very best of cars and wears Rolex watches!! Everyone in Blakelaw knows who I am its easy to get my number...you have a f***ing problem ring me U F***ING TRAMPS! He then continued to comment on a photo of the food calling Lauren an ugly b***h and telling her to get a f***in[g] face lt.   Lauren said: I didnt reply to the post because I wasnt going to go to his level. Then I received another message from his brother, Bahar. Me and my partner used to have a business and we couldnt believe it. We wouldnt dream of treating a customer like that. The reason I put the original post up was more about the customer service wed received than it was about the portion size. There were a lot of people saying the way I was treated was a disgrace too. The portion size isnt the point - its past that now. Ive even had people from dferent cities messaging me askingIm okay.  Lauren claims the mens father, Ashraf, had written an apology on the takeaways Facebook page, however this appears to have been deleted. Ashraf appeared to say in the apology: It has been brought to my attention the absolute chaos that has exploded over Facebook and I would like to publicly apologise for the utter disregard and lack of respect my sons have had in dealing with a bad review. I am mortied at the shame they have brought to my business dor and upon my family. Both of them no longer work for the business and I intend to keep it this way! This utter disregard and lack of respect should not be happening in this day and age. Im truly sorry for the hurt, upset and vile comments made by them. Please accept my apology as a means to go on. Lauren said: I did feel for the dad because it was his sons single-handedly ruining his business, but he put an apology up then took it down. The public were saying I hope to god you havent put this half-hearted apology on Facebook without writing to her to apologise directly. Because all the public said message her directly, he took it back down.  Ashraf, the owner of Eastend Diner, said: They havent been working here for six or seven years and they dont live with me either. I wouldnt want anybody to write or say something like that to anybody  - especially something so vile and [in]sensitive. Its just not right. Whatever theyve written or said is out of their own will. I havent spoken to them but they know Im angry about them doing something like that. Ive told their mum to tell them not to come near me. I havent been in contact with them for quite a while. I havent told anybody to write that -you go onto my Facebook I havent written anything. My thinking was the customer has written something, fair enough. Ashrafs sons Sfu and Bahar failed to respond to requests for comment. Eastend Diners manager, Kemran Qureshi, said: They are young lads, they dont know what theyre doing. Why they did it I dont have a clue - its beyond my belief. Im in such a sticky situation. The owner wouldnt accept this behaviour from anybody either - they shouldnt have been writing anything like that. Because its their father that owns the business, they jumped on the bandwagon, I can only assume.

She lives at Kensington Palace and accompanies the family on Royal Tours and holidays - so its fair to assume she knows them all pretty well.But there is one word Maria is banned from saying whenever shes at work, and its all because of her training. Maria was educated at the famous Norland College in Bath, one of the countrys top child care training centres.   Author Louise Heren spent a year at the college researching a documentary, so knows exactly what the students are taught. Speaking to, she revealed theres one word the women are taught never to say - Kids.Instead, the little royals should always be referred to as children or by their names. Louise said: The word kid is banned. Its a mark of respect for the children as iniduals. Its a strict rule at the school, so its unlikely something Maria has carried with her and now follows in her royal role.  Despite being three of the most famous children in the world, Louise believes George, Charlotte and Louis lead normal lives at home. She said: Given what we have seen of Catherine when she is out in public, shes very hands on. I imagine her relationship with Maria is very close and they collaborate greatly on the care of the children.   Ive spoken to nannies who have worked with other royal families and le is pretty normal. You get up, have breakfast, you go to school and you wear your school unorm whether you like it or not.

She was an amazing mum and a fantastic campaigner for autism. She did such good work.

I take each day as it comes and try my best. I work hard and I love my kids with every inch of me. They may have ASD but they are healthy and happy and very much loved.” The devoted mum is also survived by her two other children, Alex, , and -year-old Sara.

Still, personally, I don’t think it was one of my better games by any stretch.“It was my first game at the club, my first playing a dferent style of football and my first playing in dferent weather conditions and stuff like that.“It was all a learning curve, something to take from that game into future games.“I came up Thursday night, so I only had a day here before the game but I have high expectations and I like to set high standards.“When I don’t reach them, I’m disappointed.”The aim now is to show up well as he makes his home debut as Morton visit Tannadice and United try to get back to winning ways to keep in touch with leaders Ross County.And Seaman does admit this week has given him more time to do his homework on the opposition, saying: “Before Ayr the gaffer gave me a lot of clips of Ayr to watch so I had a fair idea of what they were going to do.“I was relatively ready for the game in a tactical aspect but I did only come up on Thursday night.“For this game against Morton we have been getting information throughout the week.

The gaffer will get us ready for it and we need to make sure we go and do the business.”The performance at Somerset Park was a bitter disappointment for the  United fans who made the long trip on a Friday night.And Clark admits it wasn’t good enough from the Tangerines.He added: “We went down to Ayr with full intentions of winning the game.“We gave ourselves a chance a couple of weeks ago against Dunfermline when we won and got ourselves up the league but we let ourselves and the fans down on Friday.“The weather meant it was never going to be a pretty game and they got a chance early on and took it.“I think we only had one real chance with Aidan towards the end where the goalie was out quick and made a good save.“All in all it was a very frustrating night and we were very disappointed.”Strong winds made le dficult for all the players but it was clear Ian McCall’s men coped far better with the conditions than United.The home side dominated the opening period and got their goal through Craig Moore early on but the expected response from the Tangerines with the wind in their favour in the second half never really materialised.Clark added: “It was dficult conditions but we’ve all played in wind like that before, we all know what it’s like.“We had a game plan – I don’t knowwe didn’t stick to it but it never happened for us.“We’re disappointed because that’s nine points we’ve given Ayr this season and we’re making it very hard for ourselves.”It’s been a stop-start first season at the club for Clark with a series of injuries curtailing his first-team opportunities.Now, though, he says he’s back to % and ready to help United get back on track.“It’s been very frustrating for me, I’ve missed a lot of games with daft wee injuries here and there where you can’t actually treat them, you just have to leave them until they get better.“It’s been frustrating but I’m back and feeling good now so, hopefully, I can kick on now and help the team get where

And today the Tories ripped apart the Good Friday agreement, an international treaty the UK had signed up to.\"His SNP colleague Drew Hendry, who represents Inverness,Nairn,Badenoch and Strathspey, added: ldquoWith her Brexit deal in tatters after its record-breaking defeat in the House of Commons, Theresa Mays focus remains on appeasing her Tory colleagues, rather than on delivering a plan to protect jobs and the economy.ldquoShe knows this fudge on the Irish backstop cannot be delivered in any meaningful way, yet she continues to waste what valuable time is left. It is little wonder the EU  are so bemused by her behaviour.ldquoAs ever, it is the public who will pay the price for this shambles. The Prime Minister has made no attempt to recognise the views of the Scottish electorate, and the damage Brexit will cause to the Scottish economy.ldquoLabour has shown they are also not to be trusted, leaving us facing the prospect of being hauled out of the EU and made to endure all the damage that brings.

It sought more to allow parliament more time to figure out how to break the deadlock.When this failed Liberal Democrat MP Jamie Stone, who represents Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross,argued for a Peoplersquos Vote because crashing out with no-deal would, he said, be a disaster for those in the far north.ldquoJobs, infrastructure, health care in my constituency all rely on EU citizens to fill vital roles and on EU funding,\" he explained.ldquoMPs who voted in favour of Bradyrsquos amendment were knowingly voting for a no deal Brexit. The EU had made it very clear to all involved that they would not reopen negotiations. These MPs are running after a fantasy and itrsquos British people who will pay the price.ldquoAll Theresa May has done is kick the can down the road and run the clock down even further. She is gambling with time we just donrsquot have.Mr Stone also sought to underline the importance of the non-binding Spelman amendment which stated the UK will not leave the EU without a deal.ldquoLabour MPs who sat on their hands have once again facilitated Theresa May and the European Research Groupin their pursuit of a no deal Brexit.ldquoA win for amendment ldquoI means the government has once again been told that there is no majority in the house for a no deal Brexit. The PM needs to take no deal off the table - as she should have done months ago - and recognise that people are not in favour of a hard Brexit which will damage our country.Tuesday  Feb  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/03293000/03293093.jpg","title":"Intake cap at seven Inverness schools","story":"SEVEN Inverness schools will have their rolls capped in - academic session.The move was triggered by high demand for places at each school.The primary schools affected by the cap are Holm, Lochardil, Kinmylies and Milton of Leys while three secondary schools ndash Charleston, Culloden and Millburn Academies ndash will also have the first year intake limited.The local authority said it will do its best to accommodate all pupils in their preferred choice of school but warned that they would be subject to criteria.Pupils must be within the Highland area and within the geographical catchment of the school concerned or  certied medical reasons or additional support needs best be served by a specic school are needed.If pupils had siblings at a particular school that would also help their case while religious belief for denominational schools would also be a factor.Educational courses unavailable at one school or pupils living within the catchment area of a secondary school that is not subject to capping might impact where a child can go as would proximity to home to school and road safety or ease of travel.Tuesday  Feb  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/ResizeCache/00125000/00125302-124x067.jpg","title":"Site for Inverness homes not acceptable","story":"Councillor Ken Gowans hit out at the application by agent Bracewell-Stirling for DMPM Services.He said the site was not zoned for housing and would pile pressure on local school rolls which are already well over  per cent capacity.ldquoWhile we need more affordable houses, any development must be part of the local plan, and this development is not.ldquoThis is likely to generate more unacceptable pressures on infrastructure which is already struggling to cope at the moment.ldquoWhile developers pay contributions towards education, it doesnrsquot change the fact that local schools are beyond full, and the councilrsquos school roll projections indicate these will worsen in the short to medium term, he said.Highlands MSP and road safety campaigner David Stewart also expressed some concern: ldquoI am mindful that the dual A will be at one side of this site and the rural B road will extend along another side of the site.ldquoAs it stands, this particular road has no pavement for pedestrians and this would be an issue that would cause me concern.Tuesday  Feb  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/02/IMG_2486-752x564.jpg ","title":"aberdeen drivers facing major delays in aberdeen city centre","story":"Drivers in Aberdeen have been urged to avoid a busy area of the city centre due to ongoing works.Market Street, Virginia Street and Guild Street are facing major delays this afternoon.Works to fix a cable fault are being repaired by BT and Scottish Water. vw, px\"  It#s understood a BT cable was damaged and is affecting city centre properties.The fault was expected to be repaired today, but the city council said the damage is worse than expected.An Aberdeen City Council tweet said: #The damage to the BT cable is worse than expected and as of .am tomorrow, restrictions will be extended with no right turns from Guild Street on to Market Street and no south bound onto Guild Street from Union Street.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13926204.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_18355078.jpg","title":"ayr united 2 inverness 3","story":"NewsAyr United  Inverness : John Roberston hails Somerset Park among best grounds in worldThe Inverness gaffer was full of praise for the old fashioned surroundings as his side clung on in the face of a stirring fightback.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsNathan Austin puts Caley - up \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailJohn Robertson hailed Somerset Park as one of the best grounds in the WORLD after Caley held off a storming Ayr fightback. Inverness were three up and on easy street after a crazy opening  minutes which saw United gt-wrap the game. But a Lawrence Shankland inspired comeback almost grabbed a share of the spoils for Ian McCalls title contenders. A relieved Robertson said: Had it finished - you wouldnt have been surprised. Somerset Park is one of these grounds that sucks you inyou give them a snf. Its a good throwback and their fans make it intimidating and a good atmosphere for teams when you lose a goal. Its brilliant...one of the best grounds in the world to come and play your football. In the past we might have lost a game like this so Im delighted.  Ayr knew a win here would take them top of the Championship and started well with Robbie Crawford missing a good chance in the first minute. But they soon hit the self destruct button as their defence went AWOL to allow Nathan Austin in for a double before Liam Polworth rammed home a third. The game looked over with barely  minutes on the clock and shellshocked Ayr took time to regroup. Coventry-bound Michael Rose rocked the post with a header before Michael Moffat drew a fingertip save from Cammy Mackay. McCall turned to the bench at half time and introduced top gun Shankland who immediately turned the tide. He set up Declan McDaid to haul Ayr back into the contest with a close range finish eight minutes after the restart. And a resurgent Ayr thought they had a penalty when Carl Tremarco appeared to handle in the box but ref Nick Walsh waved away loud protests. United continued to pour forward as the clock ticked down and Shankland set up a grandstand finish when slamming home a  yard free kick with five minutes left.  But their comeback proved too little too late as Inverness clung on. Ayr boss McCall said: Im just gutted. Weve conceded three goals and at least two of them were gted with just crazy defending. And were the team with the best defensive record in the league. I think a draw would’ve been fair but it’s just one of those nights. It’s a dficult one to take to get beat.They’re a big strong team and at times we didn’t cope with that.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsAyr United FC"},{"url":null,"title":"bob shields national trust who","story":"NewsBob Shields: National Trust owe an apology over asking people for donations to restore Burns CottageShareByGary Fanning:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB NewsBurns Cottage needs restoration\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailI’m trying to imagine the back-slapping and glad-handing at the National Trust For Scotland’s Hermiston Quay headquarters when someone came up with a spfing ‘Save Burns Cottage’ wheeze. “Let’s send out a begging letter to all those with Burns Cottage closest to their hearts – the people of Ayr . . .” “Wonderful idea!” “We could arrange for it to land on their doorsteps on Burns birthday – January  . . .” “That’s genius!” “Throw in some pictures of cracked walls and the dodgy thatched roof . . . “ “Fantastic!” “Use phrases like “before it’s too late” – or “damaged beyond repair” . . . “It’s heartbreaking!” “That’s Burns Cottage sorted then! Gin and tonic anyone ” “Large ones all round!” To be serious though – I still can’t decide what made me angrier. The crass begging bowl letter – hoping to cash in on the biggest Burns day of the year  Or the fact that Burns Cottage has been allowed to fall into such a state that phrases like “damaged beyond repair” are even necessary  If we’re talking man’s insensitivity to man here – then last Friday’s NTS letter takes the bannock! Its contents have upset dozens of people I know – and judging by the reaction on social media, hundreds more that I don’t know. Nicky Cotter wrote: “NTS . . . put your hands in your pockets and get it fixed. If you can spend pound, on a wooden tree house at Culzean Castle – you can stump up pound, to fix one of the most historically and culturally signicant buildings in Scotland”. Spot on, sir. The NTS letter tells us that “time and Scotland’s wet winters have taken their toll”. Yes – that’ll be the  winters since Burns father William Burness built the cottage on . And during that period, it’s been thatched more times than Wayne Rooney’s balding napper. If the current thatch “has signicant tears and has worn away”, you have to askthe last thatching work was in some way inferior - orthe cottage needed re-thatched several years ago and the work was never undertaken  You then start wondering how the auld clay biggin’ managed to survive the  wet Scottish winters between the cottage being built and the National Trust for Scotland’s formation back in   The answer is fairly obvious. Back then – people looked after it! And you only have to look at the recent row over the deteriorating Burns Monument to start wonderingthe NTS is the right custodian of our Burns heritage  Burns Cottage is everything Mr Cotter said earlier . .. and more. It’s the most important building in Ayrshire – by a lang Scots mile. Every nook, cranny - and twig of its roof - should be the subject of a fingertip, annual inspection. And whatever work is required – at whatever cost – should be sanctioned immediately. In fact, I imagine that’s what ‘most people’ thought was already happening. But then we had last Friday’s mail . . . when ‘most people’ discovered to their horror that the north-west gable is starting to pull away from the rest of the cottage! If admission fees don’t cover the cost of Burns Cottage – then put them up! The last figures I have show , visitors in . Charging them an extra p would have reached the pound, required – with enough left over to putty the windows as well. So, I’m sorry, NTS.

The sht manager was driving past -year-old Nan’s home on Castlehill Road in the early hours of New Year’s Eve when he saw flames flickering in the window. A Las Vegas neon sign – which Nan popped on for the festivities – had caught alight. Quick-thinking Lewis, along with pal Lauren Kennedy, sounded the alarm, got Nan to safety and dampened the fire with towels before the fire brigade arrived at the scene.Lewis told the Ayrshire Post : “The whole night was a blur.“We were driving back from work and I saw a fire in the window. “I was chapping on the door and ringing the doorbell. “The full house was covered in black smoke. “I couldn’t see anything. “I didn’t know how long the firemen were going to take and the house was still on fire so I thought I needed to do something. “Nan was shook up about it. “I was trying to get into the kitchen because Nan said there were towels at the washing machine. “They were pretty damp so I just threw them over it. “After we put the fire out, we sat on the wall and waited for thefiremen.

Mark Kirkby, , almost killed passenger Kerrie Anne Monaghan when he finally crashed into a wall. Miss Monaghan was in Ayr Sherf Court on crutches to hear the sentence on her partner, who she is standing by. The court heard Kirkby did not even have a driving licence and Sherf John Montgomery banned him from holding one for four years. Depute fiscal Lindsay Bain told the court police spotted a silver Volvo being driven erratically from Barassie Street into Portland Street. The police car’s blue lights went on and Kirkby initially slowed down before increasing speed. He was hitting mph in Templehill before heading into Harbour Road. And Kirkby’s car was said to have taken off as he drove across a mini roundabout into Port Ranald Drive. He hit mph in North Shore Road, eventually crashing into a wall at the Beach Road Kilmarnock Road junction in Barassie. During the whole episode, which began around .am on October  last year, Kirkby drove dangerously through junctions and swerved round corners.  When the crash occurred the car’s airbags were deployed but this did not prevent Ms Monaghan’s horric injuries. She had to be cut out of the car by firefighters and suffered numerous fractures to her face, head, body and limbs. “Kerrie Anne Monaghan is very lucky to be alive,” said fiscal Ms Bain. The court also heard of offences committed by Kirkbywhose address was given as Barlinnie Prison, on June . This time he was in a grey Ford Mondeo around .am when police spotted the car stationary on the A near the Pennyburn Roundabout. Kirkby was unsteady on his feet and slurring his speech, although a breath test proved negative. A a blood test found substances identied as cocaine and benzocaine. Defence lawyer Hugh Duncan said Kirkby’s relationship with Ms Monaghan was still ongoing. “He accepts full responsibility,” said the lawyer. “He comes across as remorseful to the injuries his partner suffered and to potential harm he could have done to others.” Mr Duncan said Kirkby had been remanded in custody since October , had undergone a detox programme, and had come to a realisation of his mental health issues. Sherf John Montgomery told Kirkby: “You drove dangerously at high speed for an extended period. I see no option but a custodial sentence.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnHMP BarlinnieVolvoAyrCourtsJusticeTroon"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article11461688.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/ymr_ayp_141112Elliots_02.jpg","title":"elliots prestwick evolve rebrand vics","story":"NewsElliots in Prestwick to \"evolve\" with rebrand as Vics  The VineBosses at Buzzworks say the bar and restaurant must \"evolve\" as part of its transformation.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  FEB NewsBuzzworks managing director, Kenny Blair, is promising bold changes at Elliots \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailOne of Ayrshire’s biggest hospitality venues has closed for a “complete transformation”.

Kenny added: “We’ve seen an appetite in the industry for more cool and modern pubs and, similarly to our T-Bar in Ayr, Vic’s will be a traditional bar with a twist. “This will both suit the local market and sit alongside our excellent new restaurant offering in Prestwick. “Our vision is to create the best day-to-night venue in Scotland and we are confident Vic’s  The Vine will match those expectations.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrPrestwickAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"former royal hotel ayr sold","story":"NewsFormer Royal Hotel in Ayr is sold at auctionBuilding is branded the most dangerous in the townShareByGary Fanning:,  FEB NewsRoyal Hotel Ayr\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe former Royal Hotel, which has been described as the most dangerous building in Ayr, has been sold at auction. The iconic property, near Ayr Central, went under the hammer last Thursday. Wilsons Auctions Land and property sales executive, Lorren Mullen were managing the auction of the ex hotel. The three and a half storey building, which has lain empty for more than  years, consists of two commercial shop units on the ground floor and sandstone units above is located on Kyle Street. It had a guide price of pound,. A spokesman for Wilsons Auctions Land  Property Sales, said: “Unfortunately we cannot disclose any further detail on this property in terms of the identity of the purchaser or the sale price . “However this figure will be disclosed by the Registers of Scotland and the Ei Group in the coming months.” In May, the Post reported how plans to knock it down and turn it into a gym were rejected by councillors. Builders Dawn Developments wanted to build a new block in its place to home a gym and shops. But the plan was cut short as council planners want the hotel preserved or refurbished instead. And the sale happened after concerns about the safety of the former hotel were discussed at this month’s Fort, Seafield, and Wallacetown Community Council held at Ayr Town Hall.

Now the proposition has got a whole lot dferent. Pet Heaven, a crematorium for family animals, has just opened in Ayr. And businessman Forbes Robertson believes it is the answer for many families who want to give their four legged - or two-legged in the case of birds - friends a splendid send-off. No expense has been spared in an -month project at the former commercial garage site in West Sanquhar Road. Area MP Bill Grant performed the official opening ceremony last week. The lavishly decorated gilded interior includes a parlour where families can pay their last respects. Entrepreneur Forbes, who has business interests throughout the area, revealed up to  people can attend the pet funeral services . Mourners can watch as their pet recedes behind the final curtain at the close of the service, similar to what would happen in a human ceremony at Masonhill. As yet Pet Heaven cannot handle horses, but the biggest of dogs to cats, hamsters and birds. There is a tea and coffee service as well as any choice of music desired and a book of remembrance in the reception area.  Much of the interior decoration has been gathered by Forbes, a keen antique hunter and auction room collector. The company will offer a collection service as well as provide a selection of remembrance urns for ashes. It seems no expense is spared by some dog lovers in the UK and recently a couple spent pound on a full funeral including a horse drawn glass hearse. Forbes said: “People sometimes care more about their animals than humans. “A farmer who contacted me askedhis dog goes before him, the animal would be cremated here and I will store the ashes. “He told me his lawyer would be in touch as he wanted buried with his dog. “Pets are loyal, they don’t steal from you and are there first thing in the morning and last thing at night.” MP Bill Grant said Pet Heaven was a signicant investment for the area. He said: “I am sure this will be welcomed by pet owners from all over the southwest, pet owners who have lost their best friend. “To have a dignied departure for that pet who has been their friend - in some cases for  years - is a great service. “The set-up Mr Robertson has here is wonderful and I think he can be proud of it. “That last journey for pets will be full of dignity and respect from Pet Heaven and its staff. “Indeed my family had a wee dog Blackie for  years and I don’t mind admitting, then a senior fire officer, that I cried unashamedly for an hour at the loss of our companion”.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrPetsSanquharAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"weather knocks out weekend shutdown","story":"NewsWeather knocks out weekend shutdown of the main ASub zero temperatures have played havoc with road teamsShareByStephen Houston:,  FEB News\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailRoad chiefs have axed major roadworks which would have seen the main A completely closed from pm tonight.

The council needs to take a lead and speak up.ldquoIt is now clear, and indeed it is alarming, that the UK Parliament is blocked and has been unable to make a clear decision on which route to take and on how Brexit should be brought to pass.ldquoThe clock is ticking down to a departure from Europe and just last week the confederation of British industry stated that under some scenarios there could be lsquodisastrousrsquo implications for Scottish productivity and economic prospects. ldquoWhilst that is only some scenarios, it is unacceptable to me that the UK Parliament cannot decide what to do. ldquoThe decision should be put back to the people, precisely because Parliament is now blocked. That could be through a general election or it could be through another EU referendum.ldquoI maintain that to now have a referendum, based on definite proposals and on an honest statement of the facts about leaving Europe would not betray the decision taken in . ldquoThe real options were not clear two years ago, but now we have some facts. Anyway, people who are confident of their arguments donrsquot run away from a referendum.ldquoBut maybe the people should decide through a general election. Either way the UK Parliament is failing on this and now the people, themselves, must decide.The council meets on Thursday, January , where elected members will be asked to vote on councillor Bellrsquos motion."},{"url":null,"title":"council-could-help-with-food-crackdown","story":"SCOTTISH Borders Council officers could take on a larger role policing the selling and marketing of high fat, high sugar and high salt foods.In a paper which is set to go before councillors on Thursday, council officers have outlined a draft response to a Scottish Government consultation on reducing health problems associated with calorie intake.In the paper, council officers suggest that as the councilrsquos trading standards team already has experience around alcohol and tobacco restrictions, then it would lsquomake sense to utilise that expertisersquo.The draft response on enforcement, whichapproved will be sent to the Scottish Government, reads: ldquoLocal authorities have experience of similar enforcement regimes in relation to tobacco and nicotine vapour products and have had a role in the online pricing of alcohol following the implementation of the minimum pricing legislation.ldquoWhilst it would be for the local authority to determine which service is best placed to enforce the proposals, trading standards already have a role in policing pricing and it would make sense to utilise the expertise that already exists in the local authority.ldquoHowever, it should be recognised that there will be a need for Scottish Government to work with local authorities to quanty current and future resources required to police pricing promotions and to provide these to local authorities to reduce the inevitable additional burden that the proposed restrictions will create.In July  the Scottish Government produced a paper which set out the foods it felt needed to be targeted in order to reduce the caloric intake and weight of Scottish people.These include: confectionery sweet biscuits crisps savoury snacks cakes pastries puddings and soft drinks with added sugar.The consultation askslocal authorities agree with this list, and whether more items should be added.In their draft consultation response, Scottish Borders Council officers believe that ice-cream, ready meals and dairy desserts should also be included in the crackdown: ldquoWhile it will certainly be useful to target the discretionary foods listed above there is also a need to include drinks high in sugar, salt, fat or calories irrespective of whether or not this is lsquoaddedrsquo.ldquoSimilarly ice-cream and dairy desserts should also come under the scope of the new policy as they are often high in fat and high in sugar and do not form an essential dietary component.ldquoWhile diary-based desserts could offer some benefits in terms of calcium and other nutrients, these would be available from other sources in a healthy diet.ldquoTheir benefit in a dairy-based dessert would be offset by the high energy density and presence of salts, sugars and fats.According to the NHS Health Scotland, in ,  per cent of Scotlandrsquos children were at risk of becoming overweight, and  per cent were at risk of becoming obese.

However, it has a narrow focus in terms of local taxation.ldquoGiven the consultation only concluded last Friday, it is surprising that the Scottish Government were able to announce the tourist tax today.The new deal with the Scottish Greens includes an extra poundm for the core local government settlement, a move to three-year local authority budgets and legislation that will give councils control over tourism taxes.The deal also includes raising the council tax cap, meaning local authorities will now be able to increase council tax by .%, up from %.Fellow Tweeddale East councillor Stuart Bell, also leader of the councilrsquos Scottish national party opposition group , said: ldquoSignicant announcements have been made on a phased development of alternatives to the council tax. ldquoAlthough I donrsquot advocate that locally we should immediately take advantage of the proposal to give local authorities power to introduce a tourist tax, or the suggested workplace parking levy, these are adjustments that some Scottish city authorities will want to take up after the necessary legislation is approved.ldquoI am also pleased that talks on meaningful alternatives to council tax will restart and that with a three-year funding settlement, as opposed to the current one-year deals, there will be more clarity for local authorities on future funding.ldquoThere are also small changes in the - revenue grants for local authorities. Despite the constant chant of despair from the Bordersrsquo Tories, I said all along that the December announcements of funding for the council were only provisional. ldquoThe Conservatives who lead the council like to highlight that we were told we might see pound.m less for core revenue funding next year, conveniently forgetting to talk about promised money for new services such as the massive expansion in early learning and childcare.ldquoThey also omit to tell Borderers that we are getting poundm more next year as capital funding, almost exactly offsetting the change in revenue funding.ldquoWe must wait until the detail of the poundm package from the Scottish Government is analysed by officers, but my provisional calculation is that the new funding announcements could give the council more than pound.m, meaning that we will see a clear cash increase in next yearrsquos funding for core revenue and capital.ldquoSadly, we are being told that the Conservatives in Holyrood may vote against these welcome changes.Rachael Hamilton, Conservative MSP for Ettrick, Roxburgh and Berwickshire, said: ldquoThanks to the SNP, Scots across the country are about to be hit by a triple tax bombshell.ldquoThis budget not only taxes aspiration but taxes people for driving to work, which is quite frankly ridiculous in a constituency like mine, where travelling by car is essential.ldquoWe will pay the highest income taxes in the UK, council tax could go up and now you might even be taxed hundreds of pounds a year for taking your car to work.ldquoThe SNP have run out of ideas on how to grow and expand the economy.

In my current role, there is barely a day that goes by without discussing with a parent or carer the impact of sugar in their childrenrsquos food, but, letrsquos face it, fat, salt and sugar make things taste nice, and itrsquos easy to fall into the trap of overindulgence.ldquoThatrsquos okay every now and again, but regular overindulgence of fat, sugar and salt leads to grave consequences, such as tooth decay, heart disease, diabetes and cancer.ldquoObesity, including childhood obesity, is fast becoming the epidemic of our age.ldquoMany of us are blissfully unaware just how much salt, sugar and fat is in the foods we buy.ldquoBig companies which produce, promote and retail these products are in it to maximise profits.ldquoThey have at their disposal expensive advertising and marketing which hugely influence our choices and purchasing habits.However, Galashiels councillor Harry Scottfelt the proposals amounted to unwelcome government meddling with personal choice, saying: ldquoIrsquom not in agreement with any of the proposals in this paper.,params: .pushldquoI appreciate the problem, but this is typical nanny state, dictating to us how we should live our lives.ldquoIt will cause unnecessary restrictions on business, specialist retailers will find it hard to market themselves, and I doubt very much whether it will have any impact on the groups it is

their own lives and lestyle choices, and as long as you keep within the law, the state should have no place in telling you what you can eat or drink.A motion put forward by Councillor Scott called for the response to be completely rejected, but it was not supported by his fellow councillors.Instead, they opted to vote to submit the consultation response in full, albeit as a council officer response not as a political response.According to NHS Health Scotland, in ,  per cent of Scotlandrsquos children were at risk of becoming overweight and  per cent were at risk of becoming obese.That same year,

around Candlemas and one of the most interesting came from Scotland.In the olden days, Candlemas was the day when children brought candles to school so that the classrooms would have light on dull

most money was declared Candlemas King or Queen and they ruled for six weeks.They had the power to make one whole afternoon a week a playtime and to excuse anyone they wished from any form of

This includes working from home and flexible working practices to ensure that nobody should lose pay or holidays.ldquoThe move by East Lothian appears to be nothing other than an exercise in saving money and will not go unchallenged.At Tuesdayrsquos meeting in Haddington, the councilrsquos chief executive Angela Leitch told councillors thatstaff could not fulfil their contract, the council ldquocould not pay them.Anger over the way the council handled last yearrsquos severe snow storms led councillors to overturn a long-standing policy on absences and agree to pay workers who had been unable to get into work.Many workers were stunned to be told that, while police were warning people to stay at home, the council was continuing with its established policy advising them they would have to take time in lieu or unpaid leave to cover the time they were unable to work.While other local authorities, including City of Edinburgh Council, took to social media to assure staff they would be paidthey were unable to work during the Wednesday and Thursday of the red weather warnings last March, East Lothian Council repeated its advice that workers should report to workit was ldquosafe to do so, or attend the nearest council office or suitable premises, or work from home or other suitable locations.Following a review, wages were reinstated for those who missed work during red weather warnings and the policy was reviewed.Councillor Willie Innes , council leader, said he expected that, should another Beast from the East hit the county, councillors would once again step in to ensure wages were not docked.He said: ldquoIt is impossible to have a policy that pleases everyone. Last year, members took the decision to pay staff ndash I would hopeit happened again we would consider making similar commitments.South of Scotland list MSP Michelle Ballantynecondemned the policy, saying: ldquoIt is completely unacceptable for East Lothian Council to tell their employees to save their holiday time in case of bad weather. It beggars belief that any employer would be this unreasonable. I will be writing to Willie Innes about how deeply unfair his cabinet have been to hardworking council staff.A statement issued on Wednesday by Ms Leitch, the councilrsquos chief executive, said: ldquoThe policy has been refreshed following last yearrsquos severe wintry weather.ldquoThe updated policy reflects feedback following staff consultation, and is consistent with the approach taken by many other public sector organisations.ldquoIt reflects the councilrsquos commitment to protecting the health and safety of all employees, while minimising disruption and maintaining key public services where possible.ldquoIt recognises that employees may periodically face dficulties in attending work during periods of severe weather, or some other adverse event.

It was a cold day but my friend, who is skilled in bushcraft, had brought his portable fire pit with him.We searched for drtwood and sat by the fire, roasting marshmallows and warming our hands. It was a short walk but dramatic rock formations loomed above us, making it feel like a real adventure. The kids climbed them and explored the rocky beach, where once there had been an open-air bathing pool.On our , we went through a small tunnel-like arch. I stopped for a moment, suddenly taken by the view. The ruins of Dunbar Castle were beautully framed by the archway. Locals call this archway the keyhole and I reflected that the term is a perfect name.When we look through a keyhole, our vision is narrowly focussed. Such was the effect here. It cast a visual spotlight on what is left of what was once a mighty fortress.The kids trundled on before me, noticing smaller wonders: a frozen worm on the path, a sea shell and interesting-looking stones. But I stood for some moments, taking in the view beyond and thinking of what stories those old stones of the castle could tell.Many people pass this way every day, both locals and visitors. Itrsquos a section of the John Muir Way. I have often been with my family to Dunbar Leisure Pool and the harbour and town. But somehow I had missed this short but spectacular nearby walk until this day.Dunbar Castle is now but a fallen-down ruin. Indeed, itrsquos dficult to imagine what it once was. But the weathered sandstone castles on the shoreline built by nature still stand defiant, somehow reminding us of their greater permanence in the face of human transience. But as I stood looking at the ruins, the keyhole focussed my thoughts as well as my vision.History is also viewed through a keyhole, a very narrow one. The lives and events of the castle were lived in most part unrecorded by it. The spotlight of history has illuminated only brief moments, and even then the characters have been only those deemed lsquoimportantrsquo.There are moments where the view through the narrow keyhole of history has included insights to untold stories. The bravery of Black Agnes, as she defied the siege in , is one of those. With her husband away, she was in charge of this important fortress during war with England. She refused to give up the castle, even in the face of bombardment and attempts to starve her small garrison into submission. Her mocking of her besiegers by dusting down the battlements with her maids after a bombardment is an image seared in legend.But itrsquos a chink of light on a huge untold story we are led to believe by historyrsquos silence that women were insignicant players in events. For sure they were oppressed and put down by a system that centred on male power, but they are half of humanity and at least half the story.As the actions of Black Agnes reveal, even with such constraints put on them, women were there, part of events and often refusing to accept their assigned role.The le of Mary Queen of Scots has always been for me an example of this. Yes, she was privileged and powerful by birth, but because of this history took notice of her.Despite all the political and religious challenges she faced, it was her womanhood which men deemed her main failing. And so she was judged by dferent standards. Had she behaved with the morals of her father she would not have lasted five minutes in power. But no one raised an eyebrow because he was a man.But more than this, even though Mary was the monarch, her royal authority was deemed diluted and even less legitimate merely because she was a woman.So she understood she needed to find a husband to bring her royal authority to full strength in a country full of powerful and bullying misogynist men.She chose the dashing young Darnley, and the fact that he turned out to be dross was not, in my opinion, Maryrsquos fault. How easy it is to blame a woman for a manrsquos failings. She was taken in by him it was he who was the failure, not her.Thatrsquos what Irsquove always maintained, despite the protestations of my tutors at university. And her third husband Bothwell, well he was a disappointment as well.It is the stones of Dunbar,they could speak, who could tell us of the truth of his forced union with Mary. She had been taken there by him in April . The circumstances of this still remain debated. Was she abducted by him as later claimed, or did she go willingly It was also claimed she was raped and forced to marry Bothwell soon afterwards to save her honour . This idea has been disputed by some because Mary is said to have miscarried with twins while imprisoned at Lochleven Castle some months after, suggesting a relationship with Bothwell even before Darnleyrsquos murder. So a woman cannot be abused by a man she has had a relationship with  Really If they could talk, the stones of Dunbar would whisper the truths of those events in , and the despair and desperation of a strong and clever woman whose destiny was stolen mainly because of her sex.These were my thoughts as I stood looking through the keyhole towards Dunbar Castle. Suddenly, my daughter Manja broke my trance by wiggling the frozen worm in front of me. I smiled and thought to myself that thankfully times have changed since the days when the castle was a fortress.But sometimes, I fear, not as much as we think they have."},{"url":null,"title":"new-fidra-gin-hoping-for-east-lothian-base","story":"Fidra Gin is the brainchild of Emma Bouglet and Jo Brydie and is currently based at Ballencrieff and Aviemore.The duo came together to create the juniper berry-based drink and have already enjoyed immediate success, with the product already available in a number of Edinburgh restaurants.Now they are hoping to make it  per cent based in the county, with plans under way to find suitable premises.Emma said: ldquoWe pick all the botanicals in East Lothian and, at the moment, we use a still in Aviemore.ldquoA friend has lent us his still for the time being so we can get enough momentum behind us and bring the whole operation to East Lothian.ldquoWe have potentially secured a premise in East Lothian.

It will also advise on any further, long-term solution to the issues at the beach.The groyne at the northern end of the beach will provide protection over part of the northern section of the seawall, with the potential to develop a higher beach in front of the wall.Finally, armour stones will be put in place along Lamer Street to protect the seawall.Discussions on how to revitalise the East Beach, which was once a popular tourist attraction, have been ongoing for more than five years.Pippa Swan, chairwoman of the townrsquos community council, has been heavily involved in the talks to find a solution.She was hopeful the latest measure would help and told community councillors: ldquoThe rock breakwater, the design has been worked on for more than two years.ldquoIt is now the preferred design solution and is the subject of a planning application.ldquoThere has been a lot of chatter about the East Beach and I wanted you all to be aware of what is going on and to be able to speak with some authority.Stones weighing anywhere between three and six tonnes will be used as part of the project, with work expected to take place throughout the summer and into the autumn.Mrs Swan was expecting heavy machinery to be on the site and said: ldquoIt will require big machines, at least -tonne trucks, moving these rocks around.ldquoThe East Beach will be the site of quite a lot of activity over the summer and we are bound to get some negative comments.

The doorsquocot is a clue that once a residence of some signicance stood here. It was called Dolphingstone Castle. Nothing now visibly remains of the castle, but around  years ago ruins were still to be seen.It was at one time an elegant mansion, but before that, on the same site, an older castle once stood ndash now all gone, and the structures of modernity are hemming in what is left of this ancient site. A wave of new housing laps at its walls to the west, the A traffic roars past on its south, and roads surround it on other quarters.One wondersthis small slice of East Lothian history will survive the developers. I hope it does. It is a small, historic fingerprint and gives a mysterious glimpse into our countyrsquos past, in an area now being carpeted with thousands of new houses.Earlier maps suggest that Dolphingstone Castle was surrounded by woodland. So perhaps the planting of a small wood or orchard within the old walls could create an island of both nature and history amidst the tide of urbanising development in this area.Up above on the ridge of Falside Hill to the south, the restored Farsquoside Castle looks down on the developments below . It sits like an eagle perched on a high ridge, observing the land below.How dferent the landscape it surveys would have been in  when, according to an old story, a small force of hand-picked warriors descended from the castle under the cover of darkness.It was just past midnight when they left, guided by a slither of moon. It was a raiding party, bent on revenge and heading for Preston Tower in what is now Prestonpans.Tradition tells us a feud had existed between the houses of Farsquoside and Preston for some years. The cause of the feud was the breaking down of walls between the two estates and the animals of each side grazing on the land of the other. Regular, and sometimes violent, clashes had taken place.But then Hamilton of Prestonrsquos livestock had been poisoned, or so it seemed. They had drunk from a burn which flowed from Farsquoside and it was assumed the water had been deliberately poisoned. Hamilton of Preston Tower, making no investigation, sent his men on a raid of violent retribution.Farsquoside Castle was attacked and blood was shed. This was the act which the select band of warriors who had set forth from Farsquoside were to avenge.In darkness, they filed down from the ridge on a path now known as Whinney Loan. This took them down to where the new houses are now being built on the southern edge of Wallyford.From here, great care was needed lest they be seen or heard. Dolphingstone Castle lay ahead and although their grievance was not with the occupants of Dolphingstone, early discovery could ruin the element of surprise.So the raiders veered north of Dolphingstone, by way of Prestoungrange, and at dawn, with the smell of the salt pans in their noses, they set about their vengeful work.Screams and running bairns alerted the occupants of Preston Tower. Armed men were ready, for this raid was expected, although not from this direction.The walls of Preston Tower held the attackers at bay but the people of the village suffered the worst of the slaughter. What senseless violence: neighbours separated only by the brae of a hill had been whipped up into a hateful frenzy against each other. Gradually the raiders melted away, back up the hill, with blooded swords.But hate builds on hate and the reckoning was not slow in coming. The very next day, Hamilton of Preston led a force westwards. It arrived by the walls of Dolphingstone Castle and then rounded past them to head up the hill towards Farsquoside, crossing where now the A speeds by.No attempt at surprise was required, this was to be an open fight. The Lord of Farsquoside had arranged his men along the top of the ridge, looking down on the approaching force of Hamiltonrsquos men. The order to charge was given and the men of Farsquoside poured down the slope.The leaders of both sides were in the thick of the fighting. It was the Lord of Farsquoside who fell, pulled from his horse and hacked to death by Hamiltonrsquos men.Seeing the death of their leader, the men of Farsquoside fled back to the castle. But the Lady of Farsquoside, in shock and rage at the death of her husband, rallied the men. She led them out of the castle in a furious charge as the sun began to set, forcing Hamiltonrsquos men to flee back to Preston.The battle, or skirmish as some would call it, was over, and the feud had reached its bloody climax. Soon after it was discovered an infectious disease had stricken the cattle, not poisoned water. Cattle on both sides had been equally affected. No one was to blame.How easy it had been to make enemies out of neighbours based on  assumptions. We are told Hamilton attempted to make amends. But the dead could not rise and the Lady of Farsquoside was said to be devastated at the loss of her husband. We can be sure others of lesser status suffered no less.This feud was over little remains to record it except tradition passed down, captured and retold by th-century writers such as P MrsquoNeill and Robert Seton, from whose works this account is garnished.Preston Tower still stands in Prestonpans, in a ruined but still defiant state. Farsquoside, much restored, is a visual delight still keeping watch atop the ridge. But only those feint hinds of Dolphingstone Castle remain, most of it lost to time and mystery just like the details of this story.But all the more reason to preserve and value them, I think."},{"url":null,"title":"betting-businesses-told-to-monitor-gambling-habits-of-people-on-benefits","story":"East Lothian Councilrsquos licensing board has approved a new gambling policy which

told board members: ldquoWhen I first joined the council, gambling was a backstreet activity with premises down back alleys and it took us a long time to persuade the industry to come onto the high street.Mr Innes said that the new policy, which set out additional risk assessment requirements for applicants, sent ldquoa clear message to both the industry and those concerned about

As such, we believe it makes sense to meet as much of this need as possible from domestic sources.\"But the report acknowledges that this will come at a cost.According to a  study in the scientic journal Nature, an estimated third of oil reserves, half of gas reserves and more than % of known coal reserves should remain unused in order to meet global temperature targets under the Paris Agreement.And Friends of the Earth has recommended they should reassess the MER policy against its legal commitments under the Paris Agreement and the Climate Change Act , and propose an alternative strategy for the UK Continental Shelf which would be in line with it.:Edinburgh oil firm highlights profitability ofNorth SeaproductionThe Governmentrsquos figures for CO emissions by fuel type show total emissions from oil and gas in  were . metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent, accounting for more than % of the UKrsquos total.Oil and Gas UK has argued that ldquoin the foreseeable future, oil and gas is going to play a key part in the energy mix, representing two thirds of primary energy in the UK in  and so \"maximising domestic production was important\" because it would reduce reliance on fuel imports which can be more carbon intensive.Oil and Gas which is jointly heading the strategy which aims to ldquodouble the productive le of the basin through maximising economic recovery and doubling the UKrsquos share of the global goods and services market says the billions in revenue will benefit companies and the workforce in Scotland.One of the three centres of excellence proposed focuses on developing technology to support an energy transition to a lower carbon economy and would involve the industry and government investing poundm each.An poundm underwater innovation hub would lead on research and development.A third centre in Newburgh, which opened earlier this month, will prioritise cost-effective decommissioning of over  s forecast for removal over the next decade.Scottish affairs committee chairman Pete Wishart said: ldquoScotland should be enormously proud of its globally recognised oil and gas industry.

But the work they do in rigorously researching and testing not only how the electorate thinks but, crucially, why it thinks that way, is crucial. Such organisations bring proper depth and understanding to political thinking, paving the way for better policies.Marianne Taylor: Brexit reveals Germanys unrequited love for UKAnd never has Scotland been more in need of rigorous thinking than now. The terrible situation we find ourself in, about to be ripped from the European Union against our will and plunged off the no-deal clf, wilfully ignored by a robotic Prime Minister most focused on keeping her partyrsquos fringe extremists happy, demands action. Or at least options, and independence remains the most obvious.The moral and democratic case for independence gets stronger and clearer by the day as the grim inability of Westminster to deal with the gravity of the situation plays out. On one side of the house you have a Tory party gone rogue, prepared to abandon its own fundamental principles and trash the country economically, socially and culturally in the name of a glorious English past that never was.On the opposition benches, meanwhile, you have a bafflingly ideological and ineffectual Labour party willing to harm the very people it claims to represent by allowing this madness to go unchecked. No wonder the partyrsquos membership in Scotland has noseed by  per cent in the last year.The perfect storm indeed. Some in Scotland - certainly those who shout the loudest on social media - would have you believe it is also the perfect time for another independence referendum. But as the democratic case for Scotland leaving the UK strengthens, the economic arguments are harder than ever to make.If an independent Scotland was a hard sell in  with both sides of the border inside the EU, the possible and probable consequences of the current stalemate are mindboggling. Imagine the economic ramications for an independent Scotland inside the EU, while its next door neighbour and biggest trading partner is outside the customs union, making tarfs necessary on every product or service that crosses what would quite possibly have to be a hard border. Then throw into the mix that they donrsquot use the same currency. All this may be happening to a Scotland and England already economically traumatised by the aftermath of a hard Brexit. Could Scots be persuaded to vote to potentially make themselves poorer in the short-term to achieve longer term prosperity  The Leave campaign persuaded a majority in England and Wales to largely ignore economics in , of course.Marianne Taylor: Brexit reveals Germanys unrequited love for UKThen therersquos the fact that referendums themselves have become the stuff of nightmares for many of us. The last two years of chaos and ision have shown that a close result on independence ndash say - in favour ndash could potentially be just as disastrous. The anger and disgust felt by many, meanwhile, at the Westminster class only highlights the distrust most of us feel towards all politicians. They have betrayed us.One can only imagine, of course, how the newly souped-up, Brexit-ed UK would look to thwart Scotlandrsquos independent ambitions. The arrogance and disrespect with which the UK Government has already dealt with the EU and Holyrood tells you much. And look at what is happening to Northern Ireland ultimately the Tory party has shown itself willing to sacrice peace,thatrsquos what it takes to achieve Brexit. Imagine how it would seek to punish Scotlandit tried to leave the union.When will Scots be ready to even contemplate another political upheaval  It wonrsquot be any time soon,you ask me, and certainly not until we believe there are sensible alternatives on the ballot paper.Marianne Taylor: Brexit reveals Germanys unrequited love for UKIrsquom not saying Scotland shouldnrsquot or wonrsquot be able to choose a dferent future for itself.

Going the straight dramatic route, sans songs, was a risk, but it has paid off handsomely in an adaptation that has had both sweep and depth, with great characters allowed room to breathe. If you really missed the songs, there was a burst or two of La Marseillaise.Be it the book, the stage musical, the film, or the television adaptation, the closing of Hugorsquos tale is a packed affair, offering spectacle aplenty. The scenes that worked best here were not the vast panoramas showing thousands of troops preparing an assault on the barricades they had more than a whf of computer generated imagery about them.

Cities ndash thanks to parks and gardens, public and private ndash can be more wooded than the national average. Tree cover was measured at % or above in Perth, Inverness and Stirling.But it falls to just under % in Dundee, % in Edinburgh, % in Glasgow and just % in the city of Aberdeen.A spokesman for Glasgow City Council: ldquoThere are multiple benefits that can potentially be drawn from planting new woodland on vacant or derelict land.ldquoUrban woodland assists with carbon reduction, enhances bioersity in places which maybe otherwise deficient, helps to manage flood risk and acts as a barrier to city noise among many other positive environmental impacts.ldquoBut planting on derelict land also leads to aesthetic improvements for communities, while encouraging increased physical activity as people make greater use of previously unattractive spaces.The Glasgow spokesman said: ldquoThere are derelict sites that naturally regenerate into woodland with tree species such as birch, willow and alder commonly taking hold along with ground flora and urban wildle.ldquoWhether to pursue planting or allow natural growth would require assessment on a site-by-site basis.ldquoAn appropriate balance would also have to be struck between fostering urban woodland and ensuring development of sites could continue, particularly for housing.Experts stress the healing powers of trees - both for people and for land and air.

Successive Scottish and UK governments have pursued rural reforestation, often despite opposition from those who want to keep Scotlandrsquos hill as they are, gamekeepers and mountaineers.Tree cover across the country has gone from around % at beginning of the th century to % at its end, largely thanks to commercial timber plantations and the state-owned Forestry Commission.There is currently a target to raise that area to % by .

From a legal perspective, my best advice to anyone thinking of going on holiday next summer, is to take out a travel insurance policy as soon as possible. Your insurance policy might cover you all year round until the time of your holiday, which means you could be covered for a number of dferent situations ndash for exampleyoursquore ill before your holiday and have to cancel it.Make sure the travel insurance is bespoke to you and your needsldquoItrsquos definitely worth taking out a cheaper policy than none at all, however, we do advise that you go a step further and opt for a bespoke policyyou can afford to. As this will ensure your policy is bespoke to you and your needs as an inidual. Many people tend to get reeled in by the cheap travel insurance deals ndash but think to yourself, what do I need cover for  Is this policy going to be suitable for me and my family Book a package holidayldquoOver the last decade or so, wersquove seen a signicant rise in people booking holidays that arenrsquot package holidays ndash people tend to be shopping around more booking flights  hotels  transfers separately, in order to cut down cost. However, we are advising consumers to rethink this strategy, and consider booking holidays as a package deal. Itrsquos important to understand the dficulty you may run intosomething were to go wrong, and yoursquove booked each component separately. For example,yoursquove paid £ for your flights with a particular airline, and paid £ with a separate hotel provider ndashyour flight was cancelled, you may or may not get your £ back from that airline . However, there is no guarantee that yoursquoll get your refund on the hotel too, as this is a separate and standalone contract. Again, this may or may not be covered on your insurance policy, but yoursquore not going to get it back from the hotel provider regardless.ldquoIf you choose to book a package holiday, with a reputable tour operator,one part goes wrong, all components are likely to be covered. The law in this area changed only recently and the new Package Travel Directive is an even more powerful piece of pro-consumer legislation. The importance of booking a genuine package holiday cannot be underestimated, and again this is even more relevant in light of Brexit and its uncertainties.Make sure there is ATOL Protection on your holidayldquoATOL protection is extremely important, and goes hand-in-hand with booking a package holiday.

We have two major long-term concerns to focus on here ndash the gradient of the brae and the fact that we are still witnessing serious accidents on the bottom hairpin bend even where there is an escape bed.\"These accidents are a risk to le, causing road closures and impacting in all sorts of ways on our local community and economy. Improvements to the north brae are very welcome and I hope that it is the start of a bigger vision to improve the entire Berriedale Braes.\"We can expect the standard lead-in period of about three months and for discussions to be held with the contractor on how they propose to physically approach the works and discussions with statutory bodies like the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds among others.\"He said that archaeological investigatory works have been completed.The award of the contract was also welcomed by Trudy Morris, chief executive of Caithness Chamber of Commerce.She said: \"We are delighted to see that after many years of dedicated campaigning by the chamber, Caithness Transport Forum and other local organisations, this project is finally moving ahead. For too long, the Berriedale Braes has acted as a pinch point for travellers on the A north of Inverness, disrupting business and jeopardising investment in the region.\"It has been good to see other work on A improvements and repairs going to local companies in recent years, and we hope the principal contractor will engage closely with our highly skilled local supply chain as these works progress.\"Ms Morris added: \"Now that the contract has been formally awarded, we hope to see clarication on exact start dates and expectedof works very soon. We would urge the Scottish Government to uphold its previous promise to start works within this financial year so that the north Highlands can start to see the benefit of this upgrade as soon as possible.\"A Transport Scotland spokesman said: \"R J McLeod Ltd has been awarded the construction contract as part of the pound. million project to deliver improvements to the road alignment and the existing tight hairpin bend on the A.\"Michael Matheson, cabinet secretary for transport, hailed it as a positive development for the area. \"It will enhance the skills development of the Scottish construction industry, with approximately  jobs expected to be supported in the region during construction.\"Related articles:Four in running for Berriedale Braes contractSilence on A schemeTuesday  Feb  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04119000/04119387.jpg","title":"We have saved part of our identity","story":"THE Dunnet and Canisbay area would have lost part of its identityits community council had been scrapped due to boundary changes, vice-chairman Bill Mowat has said.He welcomed last weeks change of heart by Highland Council and said he was very pleased the body had been saved.Under the proposals, Dunnet and Canisbay would have been linked with Castletown and Bower community councils.Mr Mowat said the area would have lost part of its identitythe plan, which would also have seen the demise of Sinclairs Bay Community Council, went ahead.Details were reported in the John OGroat Journal last Friday.\"Community councils are of real value when you have got a single-tier council and you dont have a councillor representing the area,\" Mr Mowat said. \"We are very pleased with the outcome which is a small victory for localism.\"We are relieved we are to continue.

In addition, vehicles cannot turn into Castle Street from Albert Street – but can drive on into Broad Street.The works are part of the Kirkwall Townscape Heritage Initiative’sPlaces and Spaces project, which will see improvements to the area at the bottom of the Strynd, the creation of a new path to the War Memorial at St Magnus and improvements at the head of Victoria Street.The council has said the works at the top of Castle Street will see new paving and road surfacing laid, and the road surface raised to pavement level. This initial phase of the project is due for completion early May after which works will be suspended for the main summer season.Work at the entrance to Victoria Street is set to begin in the autumn, with a suspension planned, in December for Christmas shopping season.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The planning application also covers landscaping and future restoration of the site.The application process is being handled by consultants AECOM.The council-owned quarry currently supplies stone and aggregate materials for Council roads and building projects as well as the local construction industry.  It extracts Devonian Flagstone which is highly suited to a range of crushed aggregate products, in particular as roadstone and aggregates, used for producing asphalt for road construction and maintenance, with the quarry being the only active producer of asphalt in Orkney.The activity at the quarry generates an income for the Council which is reinvested to provide and protect some of the vital services we provide in Orkney.The current quarry area is heading towards the end of its use and an expansion would safeguard supply of materials. Current output ranges between , and , tonnes of rock per year andapproved, the ha expansion will release approximately  million tonnes of additional resources, sufficient for another  years of production.Full details are available on the Council website at http:www.orkney.gov.uk Council C long-term-development-of-cursiter-quarry-in-firth.htmPersons wishing to provide comments on the proposed development can do so by writing to AECOM at fraser.blackwood@aecom or by post to Fraser Blackwood, APEX ,  Haymarket Terrace, Edinburgh, EH HD by  February .OIC says that, at this stage, comments made to Aecom are for the purposes of assisting with the scheme design and EIA process and as such are not representations to the Planning Authority. When the planning application is submitted, an opportunity will be given for representations to be made to the Planning Authority.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We are also very aware there needs to be some internal structural alterations.Given the urgency, the board is using its capital reserves to order the new air handling unit which is should be installed in March.ldquoIf the equipment breaks down between now and then, the pool will have to close, Mrs Manson said. ldquoSome people attend the pool on a weekly basis and that is what keeps them going. If it has to close for a number of weeks, it can make a real dference to their mobility and pain control.Retired GP Helen Charley, board chairman, said:ldquoHaving been a GP in Cromarty for  years, and having needed both hips and knees replaced, I am all too aware of how vital the Puffin Pool is to the good health and wellbeing of so many patients like me, she said.Established in  by Dr Malcolm Stevens, the pool has provided an average , sessions each year over the past four years.

It can really make a dference to a vulnerable person or family who is experiencing high heating costs.ldquoThese payments should be made to eligible iniduals automatically, however, in my experience that is not always the case.

But all are nasty, evil and damaging to those on the receiving end.At its worst, abuse can undermine the human rights of the people – usually, but not exclusively, women – who are subjected to it.One of the worst forms of domestic violence is sexual.Here in the UK we tend to think that we are alert to the dangers.As a society we believe that we abhor, and fight at every opportunity, to expose and excise abuse, of every iation.But just recently we were given a stark rebuke. Two in fact.Both the UK Supreme Court and the United Nations warned that the current domestic abuse laws in Northern Ireland are undermining the human rights of its women. That women in this part of our country do not have the benefit of the same rights and protection of the law as the rest of us.If that was not bad enough,any of us, or our daughters, should move to that other part of the UK we would lose the rights we were born with. You maybe wonder how, or even doubt, this is possible. But it is.The UK Supreme Court concluded that Northern Ireland’s abortion law is incompatible with human rights.: Nicola Sturgeon urged to back efforts to legalise abortion in Northern IrelandThe United Nations stated that the UK is violating the rights of women in Northern Ireland by restricting their access to abortion.To be clear, this is not an argument about the rights and wrongs of abortion, but of human rights. It is about whether people in every part of the UK enjoy the same basic rights.Before Parliament at the moment is an opportunity to address that inequality. But so far it remains untaken.And more often than not the excuse given is one that I find particularly hard to swallow: devolution.In each of the debates that I have been part of on this issue, the fact of the legislative existence of Stormont has been used as an excuse.The argument regularly made – and one I would normally agree with – is that devolved areas should not be interfered with.In this case, however, I am often left incredulous by those who say that while they recognise the situation is unacceptable and the law is in need of reform we shouldn’t interfere, even though Northern Ireland does not, at the moment have a working devolved legislature.That offends my sense of justice.When they have been asked, the majority of people in Northern Ireland have agreed that Westminster should step in.: Jacob Rees-Mogg: Easing NI abortion law would ‘damage the Union’Surely the people of Northern Ireland have a right to expect the same human rights as their fellow citizens in every other part of the UK I would expect no less for any of us in Scotland, although I am sure that we would never need that redress and certainly in this area the law in Scotland is already enacted.To be clear this is not, for me, simply about this Domestic Abuse Bill.Yes, Northern Ireland has the most restrictive abortion law in Europe with a near blanket ban, even for cases where there is a medical reason. And that is certainly central to the argument.This week Belfast high Court began hearing the case of a woman, Sarah Ewart, who was denied an abortion even though she was told her unborn baby had a fatal condition. She was forced to borrow money to make the journey to the UK for an abortion.Since , more than , women and girls have travelled to another country for an abortion. In , , made that traumatic journey.Sarah Ewart has the support of Northern Ireland’s human rights commission and of MPs like myself who last year voted to force Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley to explain how officials can continue to enforce the ban.However, in Parliament, this has become about which should be more important: a constitutional argument or the human rights of the population.For me the people, not the constitution or national identity, should come first.Devolution, as I argued in the Commons, means that areas of legislation are delegated, or transferred to another authority.It should not mean that the UK Government abrogates all responsibility for the welfare of UK citizens or that it should not step up to resolve an injustice that is being done to some or any of our people, when there is no other body to fight their corner.And neither should those of us in areas with devolved authorities use it as a defence against helping others. Indeed, not only has the UN argued that is the case, two-thirds of adults in Northern Ireland have agreed that, without their own devolved government, Westminster should act to change the law.In parliament this week I felt for Conservative minister Victoria Atkins MP, a barrister in her former career, who had to make the Government’s argument that women in Northern Ireland could not have the protection of the Domestic Abuse Bill currently going through parliament because it is a devolved area.Ms Atkins obviously feels as passionately as any of us that domestic abuse must be tackled but could not accept the case that it should be extended to Northern Ireland in the absence of a working executive there. There is currently a private members’ bill going through parliament, which I have backed, aimed at tackling the same issue.And there have been several recent attempts to change the law over what should and, in a better world, would be the private healthcare concern of the inidual women concerned.For the moment at least, it seems that those who fail to overcome the roadblocks to re-establishing devolution in Northern Ireland also fail to protect the rights of its women.Surely it’s time the rest of us took responsibility.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4867778.1549314140!/image/image.jpg","title":"brexit theresa may moves to reassure northern ireland over peace promises","story":"The UK government #will find a way to deliver Brexit that honours our commitments# to the peace process, Theresa May will say in a speech in Northern Ireland.The Prime Minister will meet political leaders and businesses today to seek consensus and in a bid to reassure the people of Northern Ireland that Brexit will not see theof a hard border.Mrs May has staked her Brexit deal on convincing the EU to reopen the agreement between London and Brussels to replace the insurance policy to prevent a hard border, known as the backstop.However, her appeals have so far been rejected despite the Prime Minister setting a deadline of Valentine’s Day to present the Commons with a renegotiated deal.“I know this is a concerning time for many people here in Northern Ireland,” the Prime Minister is expected to say.“But we will find a way to deliver Brexit that honours our commitments to Northern Ireland, that commands broad support across the community in Northern Ireland and that secures a majority in the Westminster parliament, which is the best way to deliver for the people of Northern Ireland.“As we do so, I hope we can also take steps to move towards the restoration of devolution – so that politicians in Northern Ireland can get back to work on the issues that matter to the people they represent.”The Democratic Unionist Party confirmed it would hold Brexit talks with Mrs May in Belfast.Party leader Arlene Foster said she would tell the Prime Minister the proposed border backstop “drives a coach and horses through the Belfast Agreement’s principle of consent” and would effectively create a new border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Mrs Foster said: “Parliament has spoken. A majority has rejected the current backstop.“The European Union must now accept the need for the withdrawal agreement to be reopened. The toxic backstop must be dealt with.”She added: “It is important that the scaremongering about barbed wire and checkpoints is exposed as nonsense. Border communities should not have genuine fears exploited with such tall tales.”Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald and deputy leader Michelle O’Neill will also meet Mrs May in Belfast.“The majority of political parties in the north continue to oppose Brexit and want to protect the Good Friday Agreement and prevent theof a hard border,” Ms O’Neill said following a meeting with Labour’s shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer. “It is on that basis that the majority of political parties support the backstop.”Sir Keir said Labour accepted it was “impossible to see a way forward without a backstop”.Meanwhile, former Northern Ireland first minister Lord Trimble has threatened to take the government to court over the backstop.Lord Trimble said he and others were planning to initiate judicial review proceedings over an alleged breach of the Good Friday Agreement.The former leader of the Ulster Unionist Party – currently sitting in the House of Lords as a Conservative peer – said the proceedings would demand the removal of the protocol on Northern Ireland from Mrs May’s withdrawal agreement.He said the backstop should be replaced by alternative arrangements set out in a report entitled A Better Deal and A Better Future authored by Eurosceptic Conservative MP Steve Baker.A spokesman for Lord Trimble was unable to provide an explanation for the claim that the protocol breaches the Good Friday Agreement.

Publicly, the government has stated that it is focused on getting its spending plans passed and is confident of reaching a compromise.In , when an SNP minority government had its budget defeated by the Scottish Parliament, then-First Minister Alex Salmond threatened a snap election before the deadlock was broken.The current SNP minority has struck a more conciliatory tone and sought to calm speculation about an election, with Finance Secretary Derek Mackay last night appealing for MSPs to “act responsibly”.Last ditch talks are set to continue today in the final hours before a vote, with the Green Party holding out for concessions on local government spending and council tax reform.Mr Mackay must secure the support of the six Green MSPs to pass his budget, with all other opposition parties committed to voting against it.Green Party co-convener Patrick Harvie has dismissed suggestions his party could bring down the government by rejecting the SNP’s budget as a “myth”.But senior Nationalist figures were openly speculating about the possibility of an election earlier in the week, with SNP committee convener Gillian Martin warning Green MSP Andy Wightman on social media that voting down the budget could force an election and put a second Scottish independence referendum at risk.“You’ve seen the way the other parties coalesce against us to try and bring down the government,” Ms Martin posted on Twitter. “Since  everything for them is about defeating the pro-Indy Parliament.”She added: “We are at risk of an election that might see pro Indy parties lose seats and put us in a weaker position.”Polls show the SNP remains in the lead in Scottish Parliament voting intention, but that the nationalists have lost ground compared with their performance in the  Holyrood election where they narrowly lost their majority.Scottish Conservative shadow finance secretary Murdo Fraser claimed uncertainty around the budget showed the SNP were “unfit” for government.“The SNP has neglected the day job so badly that it’s now struggling to get the single-biggest responsibility taken care of. Nicola Sturgeon is so resigned to the weakness of her own administration, she’s been forced to rally the troops for another election.“Hers would be the first government in the history of the Scottish Parliament to call an election because it couldn’t pass a budget.“That would be a shameful legacy, and shows just how unfit the Nationalists are for government of any kind.”Scottish Liberal Democrat campaign chair Alex Cole-Hamilton MSP said: “We’ve made clear to the SNP that we want a budget that focuses on education, mental health and local government funding.“If their inability to get a budget through necessitates a new Scottish Parliament election then I have every hope that people in Scotland will want to use that to eject the Nationalists.”A Labour spokesman said “no credible anti-austerity party would propose” the draft budget put forward by the SNP.With no deal last night, Mr Mackay said: “Our spending plans for the coming year contain additional money for schools and hospitals, protecting vital public services and investing in our economy, while also providing stability amid the ongoing uncertainty caused by Brexit. “With that backdrop in mind, there has never been more need for MSPs, of all parties, to act responsibly and not add to that uncertainty.”Mr Mackay added: “We are open to compromise in order to ensure we deliver the Budget that the country expects.” ©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4867666.1549302276!/image/image.jpg","title":"shipments would be waved through channel ports after no deal brexit","story":"For at least a year after a no-deal Brexit, most shipments of goods would be allowed to pass through UK ports and the Channel Tunnel before customs officials had been informed of their arrival and before any duty was paid.Importers would have to tell HM Revenue and Customs “as soon as possible” after the goods’ arrival in the UK and no later than the end of the next working day.Campaigners for a second Brexit referendum claimed the plan amounted to “waving things through irrespective of our safety”.: Poll: Half of voters back delaying Brexit to negotiate new dealBut HMRC sources insisted security checks on controlled goods would continue unchanged and officers would continue to target suspect cargo on the basis of intelligence and risk assessments.Under the Transitional Simplied Procedures, registered businesses would be able to transport goods from the EU into the UK without making a full customs declaration at the border and would be able to postpone paying import duties until the month after import.: Brexit: Queen to be evacuated in event of no-deal, reports claimHMRC has written to , businesses that trade with the EU to inform them of action they need to take to operate under the arrangements.Financial Secretary to the Treasury Mel Stride said: “Leaving the EU with a deal remains the Government’s top priority.

If anything, it should be amplied.It turned into a trilogy. There was a Great Book of Skye Two in , and now we have the #Great Book of Skye Three#.That was perhaps predictable. In the first volume, Cailean Maclean commented that he had two problems in persuading Norman Macdonald to prepare the book. The first problem was to get him to start the second was to get him to stop.Three books and , pages later, the prof has stopped — or so he says.The three volumes comprise a Dictionary of Skye Biography. The lives of almost , people are profiled and illustrated inside their pages. They have all #been Skye born or bred or are people who have had an intimate connection with the island. They have all been noteworthy in one way or another… #There has never been more than , people living in Skye at any one time, and for much of history — particularly recent, recorded history — its population has been much smaller than that.Nobody, however, will be too surprised that Norman and Cailean uncovered and portrayed over a thousand eminent Sgiathanaich. Without wishing to kickstart Norman once again, the miracle is that they enumerated so few. The island, like almost all Hebridean islands, has been a breeding ground of talent and character.The only other qualication for entry in the Great Books of Skye is that you must be dead. You, dear reader, however, accomplished you might be, will not be able to read your entry unless metaphysics permits you access from your celestial cloud. These are obituaries, not panegyrics.That lends a sombre tone to certain pages of the Great Book of Skye Three. There are people featured here who, we are sharply reminded, were alive when volume one was in preparation.Here, for instance, is the smiling face of Dr Vicky Ann Galbraith, who was born in Portree in  and who died at home in Aird Bernisdale of brain cancer in .Vicky Ann was achievement personied. A leading scientist for Roche Pharmaceuticals, she also played for Scotland#s national women#s rugby union team on  occasions. Following her fatal diagnosis, she raised thousands of pounds for cancer research by leading sponsored walks from Portree to Glasgow, up the West Highland Way and where.Here is Thomas William Mackenzie. You may have known him as Tommy. He was born in  and he died last March. He was, in the GBS abbreviated subheading, a #printmaker, etcher and gallery owner, Chieftain of Skye Highland Games, boat race devotee, tug-of-war revivalist, shinty enthusiast, and half-marathon runner.#That just about covers it, as a dictionary of biography is forbidden to indulge itself and cannot add that for very many people, Tommy Mackenzie was the face and personality of modern Portree.These volumes, these hefty Great Books of Skye, are a leisurely parade along Wentworth Street and then out to the peninsulas, pausing to wave at or pass the time of day with Victorian land reformers, clan chiefs, bards, teachers, surgeons, fishermen, and climbers. It#s a verbal Skye equivalent of the cover of #Sergeant Pepper#s Lonely Hearts Club Band#.Sir Harold Boulton was not a Sgiathanach. He came from Hertfordshire and was educated at Harrow and Oxford.In  he married into the Highland quality via a Dingwall military family. Boulton already had an interest in Gaelic song and music.He enters the Great Book of Skye because, in the late th century, Boulton seems to have heard a Gaelic rowing song and put his own, English, words to the tune.Those lyrics and that tune have become internationally known as #The Skye Boat Song#. Norman Macdonald digresses wonderfully on Boulton#s creation of a supposed Jacobite anthem.We are still left with the dilemma of the bonnie boat#s journey. The original Gaelic version may have celebrated a voyage from Torrin to Loch Coruisk. For most of the th century, it was assumed to refer to Charles Edward Stuart#s post-Culloden flight by sea from the mainland to Skye.As Charles never made such a journey directly by sea, pedants have more recently suggested that Boulton must have been referring to the Pretender#s actual sea voyage It really, really, does not matter. We are in the realms of mythology. Charles may as well have been sailing from Papua New Guinea. Harold Boulton invented the whole damn thing — the misty isle#s most famous song is a Victorian concoction — and in recognition of that, he deserves his entry in the Great Book of Skye Three.And finally, here we are back in Portree. William Cowie was born in Kiltarlity in  and became an agricultural advisor in Skye in the s. The brother of a professional footballer, Cowie devoted himself to shinty and became one of the greatest players of his era.Fittingly, he married in  a grand-daughter of the captain of the Skye shinty team which had won the inaugural MacTavish Cup in .William and Margaret Cowie had two sons, Ross and William. He died too young, at the age of  years, while playing badminton in Portree Drill Hall.William Cowie would, therefore, have been shy of his th birthday had he led his natural course to June  and a day in Fort William which would have caused him, more even than the rest of Skye, unimaginable pride.It is tempting to say of all three Great Books of Skye that they are for dipping in and out rather than reading as a single narrative. The trouble with that suggestion is that once you#ve dipped in, it is very hard to dip out again.As a trilogy, they are a phenomenal publishing achievement. They should take their place, alongside the inevitable Tommy Mackenzie print, in every home in Skye."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/INDOOR-SHINTY-19-P4-7-FINAL-2.jpg","title":"skye schools indoor shinty competition all the action in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineYoung shinty players fromthroughout Skye gathered to take part in two indoor tournaments for primary school teams last weekend.Portree High’s Fingal Centre hosted competitions for P-P and for P-and-under teams.On a fast and furious day of excellent shinty action teams fromBun-sgoil Ghàidhlig Phort Rìgh won both competitions.Broadford were runners up in the P- competition, with North West taking second spot in the P-under tournament following an epic final."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/visitor-web.jpg","title":"skye charities work to be showcased at skeabost","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA multi-charity event will be held in Skeabost on Saturdayto highlight the work of several good causes across Skye.The event will be held at Skeabost Memorial Hall from  am until  pm and will provide information on the work carried out by a iety of charities in the area, as well as insight into the costs and challenges they face.to raise awareness of the event, which will support Skye and Lochalsh Young Carers the Skye and Lochalsh Foodbank Crossroads Care # Skye and Lochalsh Macmillan Cancer Support Skye Dance Bloodwise, and Rotjanas Hands, which Mr Williams set up with his we nearly  years ago.He said: “I have been an independent fundraiser for many years – I am a trustee of Rotjanas Hands – formally known as Hands Across the Water – which I set up alongside my we following the Indonesian Tsunami .”He added: “For me, it has always been important to share particularly when we are so fortunate and others not so.

From a legal perspective, my best advice to anyone thinking of going on holiday next summer, is to take out a travel insurance policy as soon as possible. Your insurance policy might cover you all year round until the time of your holiday, which means you could be covered for a number of dferent situations ndash for exampleyoursquore ill before your holiday and have to cancel it.Make sure the travel insurance is bespoke to you and your needsldquoItrsquos definitely worth taking out a cheaper policy than none at all, however, we do advise that you go a step further and opt for a bespoke policyyou can afford to. As this will ensure your policy is bespoke to you and your needs as an inidual. Many people tend to get reeled in by the cheap travel insurance deals ndash but think to yourself, what do I need cover for  Is this policy going to be suitable for me and my family Book a package holidayldquoOver the last decade or so, wersquove seen a signicant rise in people booking holidays that arenrsquot package holidays ndash people tend to be shopping around more booking flights  hotels  transfers separately, in order to cut down cost.

However, there is no guarantee that yoursquoll get your refund on the hotel too, as this is a separate and standalone contract. Again, this may or may not be covered on your insurance policy, but yoursquore not going to get it back from the hotel provider regardless.ldquoIf you choose to book a package holiday, with a reputable tour operator,one part goes wrong, all components are likely to be covered. The law in this area changed only recently and the new Package Travel Directive is an even more powerful piece of pro-consumer legislation. The importance of booking a genuine package holiday cannot be underestimated, and again this is even more relevant in light of Brexit and its uncertainties.Make sure there is ATOL Protection on your holidayldquoATOL protection is extremely important, and goes hand-in-hand with booking a package holiday.

An entrepreneur and pioneer in his field, Sir William, despite his worldwide success, has never forgotten his strong ties to Ballymena.“His vision and dedication has put our borough firmly on the map as an area of manufacturing excellence and innovation.”Mid and East Antrim Borough Council agreed to bestow the Honorary Freedom of the Borough of Mid and East Antrim on the Wrightbus founder in February . It followed a motion proposed by the previous Mayor, Councillor Paul Reid, and seconded by Councillor Audrey Wales MBE.Among those who paid special tributes to Sir William was former Mayor of Ballymena, P.J. McAvoy, who, as a long standing SDLP representative was poles apart on constitutional issues from the ardent unionist. On Friday, however, he told the audience of the personal bond that had grown between the pair during their service on Council.“I well remember Sir William giving me a lt in that great big car of his many times when going or coming from council meetings! “I’m happy to be here today to pay tribute to the man I call my friend,” he said. Further tributes came from North Antrim MP, Ian Paisley who remarked on Sir William’s political activism at a time when many in the business community ‘kept their heads below the parapet’. And he recalled nights in the harsh days of the troubles when his late father would receive ‘phone calls from the man he codenamed ‘Ahoghill’. Mr. Paisley said Sir William was a rare breed in today’s society: “He is a character. If anyone wants to see what makes a real Ballymena man they need only look at Sir William Wright.” Lauren Christie, speaking on behalf of the extended Wright family, thanked all who attended for the honour conferred on her grandfather and paid special tribute to Mrs. Ruby Wright, who, she described as ‘the great woman behind the great man’.

From a legal perspective, my best advice to anyone thinking of going on holiday next summer, is to take out a travel insurance policy as soon as possible. Your insurance policy might cover you all year round until the time of your holiday, which means you could be covered for a number of dferent situations ndash for exampleyoursquore ill before your holiday and have to cancel it.Make sure the travel insurance is bespoke to you and your needsldquoItrsquos definitely worth taking out a cheaper policy than none at all, however, we do advise that you go a step further and opt for a bespoke policyyou can afford to. As this will ensure your policy is bespoke to you and your needs as an inidual. Many people tend to get reeled in by the cheap travel insurance deals ndash but think to yourself, what do I need cover for  Is this policy going to be suitable for me and my family Book a package holidayldquoOver the last decade or so, wersquove seen a signicant rise in people booking holidays that arenrsquot package holidays ndash people tend to be shopping around more booking flights  hotels  transfers separately, in order to cut down cost. However, we are advising consumers to rethink this strategy, and consider booking holidays as a package deal. Itrsquos important to understand the dficulty you may run intosomething were to go wrong, and yoursquove booked each component separately. For example,yoursquove paid £ for your flights with a particular airline, and paid £ with a separate hotel provider ndashyour flight was cancelled, you may or may not get your £ back from that airline . However, there is no guarantee that yoursquoll get your refund on the hotel too, as this is a separate and standalone contract. Again, this may or may not be covered on your insurance policy, but yoursquore not going to get it back from the hotel provider regardless.ldquoIf you choose to book a package holiday, with a reputable tour operator,one part goes wrong, all components are likely to be covered. The law in this area changed only recently and the new Package Travel Directive is an even more powerful piece of pro-consumer legislation. The importance of booking a genuine package holiday cannot be underestimated, and again this is even more relevant in light of Brexit and its uncertainties.Make sure there is ATOL Protection on your holidayldquoATOL protection is extremely important, and goes hand-in-hand with booking a package holiday. For example,an airline stops trading, there is a back up fund which acts as a lsquosafety netrsquo it ensures that you canhomeyoursquore stranded abroad and that your money is safe.Pay for your holiday by credit cardPorsche vandalised in KenilworthTravelling after Brexit - how it impacts data roaming and driving abroad Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"KEN | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"KEN | Article Teaser\"ldquoDonrsquot lose sight of booking your package, ATOL protected holiday, by credit card.

An SDLP conference is scheduled to take place on February  in Newry where the party membership is set to vote on the plans.Speaking exclusively to the Andersonstown News. West Belfast Councillor Tim Attwood said he was “not an advocate of the SDLP and Fianna Fáil partnership”. It’s known that South Belfast MLA Claire Hanna is also at odds with the party leadership over its move to link up with Fianna Fáil.“I recognise that the political landscape of this island has been changed utterly given the failure of the DUP and Sinn Féin to bring back the power-sharing Executive, the catastrophic consequences of Brexit and the emerging debate about Irish unity,” said Cllr Attwood.Cllr Attwood continued: “I have the greatest respect for the leadership of the SDLP and recognise that in a post-conflict situation there is a natural and wider debate about political realignment on this island,” he said. “The reality is my politics is steadfastly rooted in the social democratic and labour traditions embodied by the SDLP and parties of the Party of European Socialists.”Mr Attwood, who has served as a West Belfast councillor these past  years, said that over the coming days he would be speaking to his family and SDLP members in his constituency area about the proposal for a new partnership between the SDLP and Fianna Fáil. “I will make a further statement after these discussions,” he added.Meanwhile, SDLP Lagan Valley MLA Pat Catney is supporting the party leadership in entering into a partnership with Fianna Fáil.Mr Catney said: “Northern Ireland is crying out for a response to the fast changing and signicant challenges across these islands as a result of Brexit. “Twenty years after the Good Friday Agreement, people here must be offered something new, credible and forward-looking in its approach.”The Lagan Valley MLA added: “Brexit has shted the political sands dramatically. It poses many challenges that sit outside the boundaries of local devolution. Our politics in the past two years, a politics of ision, of deadlock and of repetition is frighteningly at odds with the vast challenges that now face us. Old solutions to new challenges can no longer cut it.“It has always been the SDLP’s vision to unite our people. To seek an Ireland, befitting of the st century, where opportunity and prosperity are more than slogans on a placard but a way of le whether you are Catholic, Protestant or Dissenter. That will never change.“I am all too aware of the uneasiness some of my unionist neighbours may feel about this new partnership. Neighbours who have put their trust in me in countless elections. But let me be crystal clear a new Ireland, one without the full inclusivity of unionism is not one I want to be part of let alone build. You are part of the fabric of this island, woven into history every bit as much as any nationalist and you are a critical part of its future.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"fundraiser in memory of limestone mother","story":"A FUNDRAISING night will be held this Saturdayin memory of a North Belfast woman who died suddenly just two weeks after she became a grandmother for the first time.Marie Branfdied suddenly at her Limestone Road home on St Patrick’s Day  after suffering a heart attack and going into cardiac arrest. Despite efforts by her family to perform CPR, they were unable to resuscitate her.This Saturday, the mother of four’s family are holding a charity night in St Malachy’s Old Boys’ Club to raise money for British Heart Foundation Northern Ireland in her memory. The charity funds research into heart and circulatory diseases including the prevention and treatment of heart attacks.Marie’s daughter Zara said her mum had been delighted to have become a granny for the first time just two weeks before she died.“Mummy’s death came as such a shock to us all. We knew that heart disease ran in our family and my grandparents had had heart attacks at a young age but we didn’t expect this to happen,” she said. “Just two weeks before she died my wee nephew was born and she became a granny for the first time. She couldn’t wait for the baby to be born and had everything all in for him coming. She just doted on him but she only got two weeks with him before she died.”The charity night in St Malachy’s Old Boy’s Club will raise funds to power research into heart and circulatory diseases.“We don’t want another family to suffer like we have,” added Zara.“My wee brother found mummy in the house and between us we tried to resuscitate her but it was too late. We want to raise money to help fund research and stop this happening to other people. So many people loved and miss her. Her husband David, her children and her four brothers and all her friends. The night will be a lovely tribute to her.“Saturday will be a really good night and so many businesses and local people have been really generous with ballot prizes. It would be greatpeople could come along and enjoy a great night.”Órla Clarke, fundraising manager for BHF NI said: “Thanks to Zara and the Branf family for organising the charity night which will raise much needed funds for research. Our research has saved thousands of lives. Before the mid-s, nobody fully understood the cause of heart attacks and  per cent of people here who suffered a heart attack didn’t survive.“Our research has meant that today  per cent of people do survive a heart attack. But stories like Marie’s story show there is still so much to do.“ No family should lose their mummy at just . We need to keep funding research so that more lives can be saved.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"mates pull pensioner from blaze","story":"A RIVERDALE man has recounted the dramatic moments when he and a friend saved two of his neighbours from a blaze that gutted their home.Antoin Carlisle and Terence Young saved an elderly woman in her s and a man in his s from the house fire in Riverdale Park South around .am on Saturday morning. After noticing smoke billowing from the property, the brave pair sprang into action, racing towards the fire to bring the people inside to safety.Recounting the dramatic ordeal, Antoin told us: “I couldn’t see the fire, so I thought it was the end house on my street. As soon as we got to the end of the street we could see the flames through the back windows – the whole lot was on fire.“Nobody lives in the house next door so I kicked in that door thinking somebody had broken in and set it on fire. Then I came round and hit the other door a boot and the fire nearly blew me off my feet.“I started smashing windows to let the smoke out. I smashed the front window and then climbed up and smashed one of the top windows and shouted at the top of my lungs, ‘Is anybody there ’“We found out there were people at the back of the house. We couldn’t get in the front because the flames were too big, so we went to the old couple next door, got them settled, and then my mate Terence started breaking down the fence with his shovel to get into the house. He got in the back way and lted the two people out of the house and out through the broken fence.“The smoke was all over the place so I thought all the houses were going to go up. I went to the houses on the other side and got them up. My neighbour had one of the kids and I had to bring the other one up the street to get them away from the smoke – I was trying to keep my hand over the child’s face to stop them breathing in the smoke. The black smoke was following us the whole way up.”Antoin added: “I think most people would have done it. I just did it because it was my own neighbours. I knew there were old people in those houses so I had to do something. When it’s your own street you can’t just walk past it. I have to thank my friend Terence too becausehe wasn’t here then God knows what would have happened.”A spokesperson for the Fire Servicesaid: “Firefighters were called to a house fire on the ground floor of a two storey, mid-terraced property. A man in his s and a woman in her s were out of the property before the arrival of fire crews. Firefighters wearing breathing apparatus extinguished the fire.“Both casualties were treated at the scene for smoke inhalation and shock and taken to hospital. An elderly neighbour was also treated at the scene and taken to hospital.

I believe that the work that I set out to do is completed and that RRCANI now has a good foundation which they can continue to build on.”She added: “It is amazing what we all achieved in a relatively short period of time, most times relying just on friendships and a lot of good will. A heartfelt thank you and very well done to you all. I hope you will continue the good work with the Roma communities.”Remarkably, recipients of the email include her line manager at LORAG and the community group’s CEO Gerard Rice – both of whom Ms Long now claims were aware of her concerns. Both say they were not alerted to any concerns with the project until issues were raised by the Belfast Trust in late May .Another recipient of the email is her then fellow LORAG worker in the RRCANI project, spokesman for the Roma community of Belfast, Nicolae Nicola. Ms Long now says that he was the person charging vulnerable Roma for services, a claim which remains unproven and which Mr Nicola vehemently denies. Also copied into the email is Ms Long’s husband, Stephen Long.LORAG Chairperson John Gormley said: “We reject the claim that was broadcast on the Nolan show. LORAG had previously told the BBC Nolan Show that the first we became aware of an allegation of charging by RRCANI was through a conversation on or about  May  with Belfast Health and Social Care Trust officials. We were funded from June  to March  to provide mentoring and capacity-building support to RRCANI, in partnership with other agencies. At no time during the funding period was any allegation of charging by RRCANI made to LORAG by any of the other partners or by any LORAG staff member.”We contacted Ms Long via email but no response had been received as we went to press."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37779561.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/3301984-_Read-Only_.jpg","title":"dups foster calls for brussels to talk about brexit backstop alternatives","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He will be closely engaged throughout the process.\" Meanwhile, Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald yesterday repeated her partys stance that the backstop is the \"absolute bare minimum... the bottom line\" required.Speaking on the BBCs Andrew Marr show, Mrs McDonald said the backstop is essential to the protection of the Good Friday Agreement in \"all of its parts\".\"That is why a backstop, or a set of very specic protections were landed on,\" she said. \"They are minimal, but they are the absolute bare necessities to ensure that our economy, that our society and crucially our peace agreement isnt disrupted.\"Addressing the prospect of a border poll, she said Sinn Fein would \"prepare for the worst scenario and protect our national interest\".Her comments yesterday were made less than  hours after she told a gathering of party activists in Dublin that the unionist community needs to start \"preparing for Irish unity\".Meanwhile, Tanaiste Simon Coveney has again stated the EUs position that the withdrawal agreement will not be renegotiated. Writing in the Sunday Times, he said the decision by MPs last Tuesday to agree to seek alternative backstop arrangements had caused \"disappointment and dismay\" in the Republic and Europe.Mr Coveney added that no \"credible\" options have been put forward as yet, but stressed the EU is \"committed to trying to agree alternative arrangements to replace the backstop\" once the withdrawal agreement is ratied.He warned that dispensing with the withdrawal agreement would have serious consequences for Northern Ireland.\"It is now time for the UK to keep its word, to deliver on these commitments and on its responsibilities,\" he said.The hardening of the EU position comes as the Prime Minister - who pledged yesterday that she is determined to agree a \"pragmatic solution\" that delivers Brexit - prepares to s to Brussels for further negotiations next Wednesday."},{"url":null,"title":"coveney alternatives to border backstop represent wishful thinking","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But we recognise there is a need for a backstop at this stage of the exercise.”His comments come as Labour has faced calls to clary its position on the contentious issue.Whilst we have got concerns that we have set out about the backstop, we do accept the principle that there has got to be a backstopSir Keir StarmerFacebookTwitterLast week, Labour MPs were whipped to vote against a Westminster amendment calling for “alternative arrangements” to replace the backstop.However, last week party leader Jeremy Corbyn also said he had a “problem” with the backstop proposal, insisting it was unacceptable that the UK could not unilaterally decide to withdraw from it.The purpose of the backstop arrangement is to ensure the Irish border remains open, evena wider trade deal between the UK and EU fails to materialise at the end of the Brexit transition period.It would effectively see the whole UK continue to adhere to the customs union, while Northern Ireland would also align with EU single market regulations on goods, meaning it would operate under a dfering legal framework to Great Britain.On Monday, Sir Keir met business and trade union leaders in Belfast, as well as leadership figures from Sinn Fein and the SDLP.He told the Press Association: “The Prime Minister has effectively run down the clock and therefore it is impossible to see a way forward without a backstop.“So, whilst we have got concerns that we have set out about the backstop, we do accept the principle that there has got to be a backstop.”Sir Keir said he did not believe Theresa May would succeed in agreeing an alternative to the backstop with the EU, stating: “The Prime Minister and her team have spent over  months trying to find an alternative to the backstop.“We have only got the backstop because they couldn’t find an alternative.“So for her to go back now saying, ‘I don’t want the backstop, I want an alternative’ is to stand the last  months on its head.“And I think that’s what is causing the anxiety because nobody realistically thinks she’s going to succeed in that objective.”After the meeting with the shadow Brexit secretary at the Europa Hotel, Sinn Fein vice president Michelle O’Neill said he had brought “clarity” to Labour’s position.It was important today to put to Keir Starmer that we need to see clarity from the Labour Party on the backstop. He did say in the meeting that the backstop is inevitable and that is the Labour positionMichelle ONeill, Sinn FeinFacebookTwitterShe suggested that during their meeting Sir Keir acknowledged that Labour had previously not been clear and consistent on the need for a backstop.“It was important today to put to Keir Starmer that we need to see clarity from the Labour Party on the backstop,” she said.“He did say in the meeting that the backstop is inevitable and that is the Labour position.“It’s their position because they understand the need to ensure there’s no hard border on this island.”She added: “The words he used to ourselves in the meeting today were clearly that a backstop is inevitable – that is the Labour position in order to protect or guard against a hard border and I can only say that that’s what he’s relayed to us.”Ms O’Neill said it was important that Sir Keir heard first hand “very clearly and directly” the need to protect the backstop.She described the backstop as the “least worst option” but nevertheless she said the Irish government and the EU needed to stand firm against the UK Government’s attempts to alter the Withdrawal Agreement.“The backstop is a legal guarantee,” she said.“There’s no-one here who trusts the word of the British Government at this moment in time.”She added: “It has to be legal guarantees. The backstop is the bottom line.”The DUP claimed Sir Keir’s comments on the backstop were evidence of an “internal struggle” on the issue within the Labour Party.DUP MP Gavin Robinson said: “When he talks about a backstop being inevitable, it is code for keeping the UK fully inside the single market and customs union.For all Labour’s criticisms of the Government’s negotiations, it seems Keir Starmer is prepared to accept defeat without even entering any negotiationGavin Robinson, DUPFacebookTwitter“Others in the Labour Party, including Jeremy Corbyn, seem to recognise that such an outcome would not reflect the referendum result.“When he talks about Parliament asserting itself, he conveniently ignores last week’s vote where Parliament has set a course for what it wants to see from the Government in negotiations with the EU.“Most concerning is that he has effectively said the only alternative to the current backstop is remaining inside the customs union and single market because the European Union haven’t offered anything  forward.“For all Labour’s criticisms of the Government’s negotiations, it seems Keir Starmer is prepared to accept defeat without even entering any negotiation.“Whilst Keir Starmer’s attention seems to be fixed on the leadership of the Labour Party, the real focus should be on the European Union.“They have already acknowledged that alternatives to the backstop will have to be found, but at the moment they refuse to negotiate until after th March.“The focus should be on Brussels and starting meaningful negotiation immediately.”"},{"url":null,"title":"what is the malthouse compromise","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Plan A is similar to the current Withdrawal Agreement, but with changes to the Irish backstop and the implementation period. Plan B assumes that agreement on the Withdrawal Agreement is not possible and creates a “transitional standstill period”.– How is plan A dferent to the current deal on offer The bare bones of the Withdrawal Agreement remain the same, but the implementation period would be extended until no later than December . The aim of this is to provide a longer period to agree the future relationship, but it could also involve paying more money to the EU. The second major dference is to the controversial backstop, which would be changed to become a “basic free trade agreement”. It would not require new technology and relies on existing administrative processes.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Jacob Rees-Mogg – Is plan B dferent to a no-deal Brexit  Yes – as Britain would remain in a transition period evena Withdrawal Agreement had not been signed. The UK would become a third country, in practice, but would offer to pay the EU in exchange for retaining the implementation period until no later than December . Plan A would remain on offer as long as the EU was willing to consider it. – How much would the UK have to pay Under plan B, Britain would offer around £ billion per year in exchange for the implementation period to continue. – When would Britain leave the EU under the plan Brexit would still occur on March  under both plans, but the major dference is that the UK could stay in a transition period until December  under both. – Does Number  support it Theresa May offered an olive branch to the rebel Tories by inviting MPs including Steve Baker, Marcus Fysh, Owen Paterson, Damian Green and Nicky Morgan into the Cabinet Office on Monday afternoon.

However, councillors subsequently switched attention to the former St. Maryrsquos Girlsrsquo Primary School campus at Shanslieve Drive.Despite a number of protracted attempts to secure the site and hopes that a deal could be agreed, it was bought by supermarket giant Lidl.While widely regarded as one of Northern Irelandrsquos premier tourist resorts, Newcastle does not have a modern indoor leisure facility and while there are some politicians who would like a swimming pool as part of any new development in the resort, this seems unlikely given there are local authority pools in Downpatrick, Kilkeel and Newry.It was previously suggested that the sale of the Annesley Buildings would free up the site for a new hotel and, signicantly, generate funds to help provide new leisure provision in the resort. But that now looks unlikely.As part of the drive to signicantly enhance leisure provision in the resort, council officials are continuing to work alongside education officials to develop a major new sports hub.Shimna Integrated College is planning to redevelop its King Street site which would include the creation of additional sports facilities at nearby Donard Park.It has been suggested that the proposed sports facilities could potentially be developed by the Department of Education in partnership with Newry, Mourne and Down Council with pitches and a sports pavilion forming the new sports hub which could also used by the community.While discussions are ongoing, the local authority still has to address the issue of no meaningful indoor sports facility in the resort to cater for both residents and visitors and is turning its attention to the Annesley Buildings site.Senior council officials have admitted that their initial thoughts about using the location for a town centre hotel have changed, confirming they are working to make a final decision on the way forward. It is also being suggested that the most likely outcome is developing a new leisure-cum-community facility at the Central Promenade site.A feasibility study on the redevelopment of the town centre site for a new hotel was completed several years ago which suggested a two or three-storey extension extension would be acceptable.The new hotel was viewed as a key ingredient in the plan to deliver highly ambitious proposals outlined in the Mournes Gateway proposals aimed at shaping future tourist provision in Newcastle.Other proposals include a gondola ride into the heart of the Mournes and a visitor centre at the site of the old quarry at Thomasrsquo Mountain.It has emerged that work on the high profile tourism project is progressing with moves to establish a board to deliver its ious elements, with membership including representatives from the local council, Tourism NI, Forest Service, Mourne Heritage Trust and National Trust.Over the next month, work is scheduled to start on tendering for consultancy and architectural services, alongside the recruitment of environmental and traffic management services.

Scrum half Conor Gibson was on hand to move the ball quickly to Hutley, who put Luka Walsh in space for the first score of the game.Omagh bounced back well, again using the wind effectively, and their pressure gave way to a penalty which they successfully struck to close the gap.As they continued to apply pressure, the home side had a chance to take the lead on the  minute mark, but their kick drted to the right hand side of the posts.With  minutes left in the half, Down High extended their lead. Having forced Omagh deep into their own half, Luka Walsh capitalised on Omaghrsquos decision to play out from their own quarters when he intercepted the ball to score his second of the day. Hutley slotted over the conversion. Down carried a - lead into half-time.With the strong wind now on their tails and a reasonable points buffer, Down High controlled the game well. Omagh continued to apply plenty of pressure, but the Down defence was hungry and with the exception of a few indiscretions they soaked up the Omagh onslaughts.With  minutes left the game took a critical turn when Hutley slotted agoal to take the Down lead to -.As would be expected from the men from the west, they didnrsquot lie down, but they were forced to chase the game.

However, the book kept me from thinking dark thoughts. Soon, all I wanted was to hold a copy of the book in my hand.Maureenrsquos dream came true in the autumn of  when her haunting story was finally published.Maureen, who is the mother of five grown-up children, explained some of the background as to why she put pen to paper.She added: ldquoI was initially setting out to piece together my family tree and the computer screen flashed up information on my great aunt Brigid. I was so fascinated with what I read that I could see the story unfold in a book and in turn I felt the plot would work well on screen too.Research took Maureen to the Presentation Convent in Co Kildare, which Brigid entered at the age of .Maureen said: ldquoI met with such a warm and friendly welcome from the community of sisters, that it gave me the desire to pursue Brigidrsquos story further. I travelled to Australia shortly after and I received the same, warm and friendly welcome from the sisters of the Presentation of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Wagga Wagga.On herMaureen set about sting through a mountain of information and carefully crafted the remarkable story of her great aunt. The book was published in July  and was officially launched a few months later to a rapturous reception in Murphyrsquos Bar in Downpatrick.A chance meeting which her web designer, Michael McLaughlin, had had a year later led to a further development.She said: ldquoMichael was working on a display in Eclipse Cinema in Downpatrick for another movie when he struck up a random conversation with Colin McIvor.ldquoAs they chatted Michael mentioned that he had recently read a book written by a Downpatrick woman which he thought might make a great movie.ldquoWithin days Colin, with the backing of Northern Ireland Screen, was in my house and we were signing contracts on a movie deal. That was in July last year and since then the whole thing has snowballed.ldquoIt has been a pleasure putting the whole thing together. I wrote it like a novel which makes it easy for the reader to follow the story. My story is entirely based on fact.As Maureen describes the plot her face lights up. She believes her great aunt would be delighted at her revealing the long-lost tale to a new generation.ldquoBrigid had trained as a teacher and in  there was a great demand for priests and nuns with skilled trades in Australia and so she was shipped off to the mother house in Wagga Wagga.ldquoBrigid proved herself capable and popular with the children she taught for six years. But a bad day in front of a teaching inspector led the convent demoting her to refectory duties.ldquoTwo weeks turned into two years of hard labour that took their toll physically and mentally on poor Brigid. Requests toto her former duties were denied and feeling she had no real means of complaint, it left Brigid desperate.ldquoOne day she wandered outside the convent walls. Tears welled up in her eyes as she called at a strangerrsquos home. Her afternoon of tea and warm company by the fire ended all too soon and Brigid was sent back to the convent, seen by a doctor and put to bed, Maureen added.The story really begins in earnest at this crossroads in Brigidrsquos le. Drawing on every ounce of courage she had, Brigid leapt from her bed that night and made a hasty escape barefoot in her nightgown on a foggy winterrsquos night in .This night set the scene for a religious storm unprecedented in Australiarsquos history. Brigid found refuge in the home of Protestants who refuse to disclose her whereabouts to the Catholic authorities.A bishop swore before a magistrate that Brigid was insane and a warrant was issued for her arrest. She was hunted down like an outlaw and the local media attention created a level of sectarian tension rarely unseen in that part of the world.Later, when there was no apology from the bishop for the arrest and slur on her character, Brigid turned to the courts for redress. But taking on the bishop meant taking on the Catholic Church.Maureen had a challenging time presenting Brigidrsquos story.She said: ldquoIt was a scandal at the time but I had to be careful to write it from both sides and let people judge for themselves. Itrsquos all I can do.Maureen says she is looking forward to the filmrsquos premiere.She added: ldquoIt will be the culmination of not just my five years of writing and telling the story, but all the hard work and effort that my family have put into supporting and helping me and, of course, the efforts of the film company, the director and the actors.Colin spoke of his enthusiasm over Maureenrsquos forthcoming film.ldquoI am thoroughly delighted to have optioned such an amazingly powerful book and to have met the inspirational Maureen and her family through the process, he said.He is currently adapting the book into a screenplay. ldquoI believe the film will offer a fantastic role for a strong female lead and supporting cast, he said. ldquoTo be able to bring this beautully written, dramatic and deserved piece to the silver screen some day would be just fantastic.Log on to Maureenrsquos website toon the forthcoming movie premiere at www.theextraordinarycaseofsisterliguori..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C January 30%2C 1979  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK mdash A Strangford man had a narrow escape from death when he turned up for work on Monday morning at the new Abbey Lodge Hotel, outside Downpatrick.A muffled explosion during the night had ripped apart a section of the hotel mdash which was due to open in three weeksrsquo time mdash but no alarm was raised and workmen were unaware of the danger when they reported for work.One of the men, Mr Francis Black, from Strangford, passed through the lounge and noticed a black bag and two yellow tins. He thought it was some material left for him to carry on with a job and picked it up.Mr Black failed to notice several wires leading from the bag, but an examination of the contents told him something was wrong. He put it down and it was discovered later that the contents were competence for a lethal fire-type bomb.By then Mr Blackrsquos colleagues had discovered the damage caused by another bomb and a warning was raised. Police and firemen rushed to the scene and the main Downpatrick-Crossgar Road, beside the hotel, was sealed off as army bomb disposal experts raced from Lisburn.An army officer successfully defused the second bomb and workmen moved in to assess the damage, which was confined that bedroom section of the hotel.The hotel owner, Mr William Polly, said: ldquoDoors, windows, the gable and the roof have all been damaged and this includes a total of eight bedrooms. It will mean that an entire section of the building containing the bedrooms will have to come out.

Statues of trade unionist Inez McCormack and SDLP co-founder Paddy Devlin are among the proposals for honouring prominent Belfast citizens. The plan was due for approval at tonight’s meeting of Belfast City Council.But Sinn Fein group leader on the council, Ciaran Beattie, submitted a motion for discussion to address what he called “the imbalance of statues” in the grounds of City Hall.The ‘call-in’ procedure can be requested% of councillors believe it was not properly reached or would adversely affect a section of the community. An independent lawyer is then asked to examine the motion and determine whether it should be reconsidered.Carney was a suffragette and trade unionist who acted as secretary to James Connolly in the  Easter Rising.The motion stated: “The current statues largely represent the unionist British tradition, with no reflection afforded to the republican tradition.“The Irish Congress of Trade Unions proposed in writing to the chief executive on March ,  that a statue of Winred Carney be installed, due to her history and success in Belfast.“Accordingly, the council agrees that a permanent statue of Winred Carney be installed to address that imbalance.”DUP councillor Lee Reynolds accused the Sinn Fein of “throwing the dummy out of the pram”.He told the News Letter: “For a number of years on this council the progressive coalition voted together, which assisted Sinn Fein in getting its own way a highly disproportionate amount of the time.“On this occasion five parties have come together to make an agreement and the response of SF has been to try and bully people by threatening all sorts of legal action.”Although the plan does not include a permanent tribute to Carney, it is proposed that she be recognised in a time-limited installation at city hall.Trimble threatens legal action over Brexit backstop Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingIN PICTURES:  things you should never EVER say or do to someone from Northern IrelandHas PSNI officer Bobby Singleton become an unwitting sex symbol Ian Ogle daughter: UVF gang that murdered Dad are still planning to kill my brotherVIDEO: Police investigation into fight at Belfast International Airport, AldergroveLamp stolen from popular N.I. bar - P.S.N.I. threaten to share C.C.T.V. footage on social mediaitem not ed immediately          ..

The site will potentially generate up to  new work positions across management, supervisory, warehousing staff and apprenticeship roles.Speaking of the new facility and what it will bring, Mr Rattenbury said: ldquoWe are delighted that our vision of a lsquoone stop shoprsquo for our customers is being realised and having a  hour, seven day a week co-packing facility in the heart of Wales, is a game changer for our industry. We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I now intend to present an amended report to cabinet on February .ldquoThe report will propose that option one in the previous report now be taken forward, which retains the current roundabout though enhances the gateway route into Penarth whilst providing much safer crossing opportunities for cyclists and pedestrians. There is no requirement to complete any spending on this project by the end of this financial year.ldquoIt is very dficult to please everyone with highway improvement schemes but I very much hope that this option provides the active travel benefits we are seeking and is viewed by residents and visitors to Penarth as being the most appropriate. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created. They helped us roll it down the hill from the clf tops.\"Richard Parry, who helped to organise the event and led the Mari Lwyd, said: \"It was great to see so many people come together to celebrate Hen Galan in Penarth. The giant Bendegeidfran got his name because he was the Blessed Bran - the best friend anyone could ever want - and in the stories of the Mabinogion he was loved by those who knew him. He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

From a legal perspective, my best advice to anyone thinking of going on holiday next summer, is to take out a travel insurance policy as soon as possible. Your insurance policy might cover you all year round until the time of your holiday, which means you could be covered for a number of dferent situations ndash for exampleyoursquore ill before your holiday and have to cancel it.Make sure the travel insurance is bespoke to you and your needsldquoItrsquos definitely worth taking out a cheaper policy than none at all, however, we do advise that you go a step further and opt for a bespoke policyyou can afford to. As this will ensure your policy is bespoke to you and your needs as an inidual. Many people tend to get reeled in by the cheap travel insurance deals ndash but think to yourself, what do I need cover for  Is this policy going to be suitable for me and my family Book a package holidayldquoOver the last decade or so, wersquove seen a signicant rise in people booking holidays that arenrsquot package holidays ndash people tend to be shopping around more booking flights  hotels  transfers separately, in order to cut down cost. However, we are advising consumers to rethink this strategy, and consider booking holidays as a package deal. Itrsquos important to understand the dficulty you may run intosomething were to go wrong, and yoursquove booked each component separately. For example,yoursquove paid £ for your flights with a particular airline, and paid £ with a separate hotel provider ndashyour flight was cancelled, you may or may not get your £ back from that airline . However, there is no guarantee that yoursquoll get your refund on the hotel too, as this is a separate and standalone contract. Again, this may or may not be covered on your insurance policy, but yoursquore not going to get it back from the hotel provider regardless.ldquoIf you choose to book a package holiday, with a reputable tour operator,one part goes wrong, all components are likely to be covered. The law in this area changed only recently and the new Package Travel Directive is an even more powerful piece of pro-consumer legislation. The importance of booking a genuine package holiday cannot be underestimated, and again this is even more relevant in light of Brexit and its uncertainties.Make sure there is ATOL Protection on your holidayldquoATOL protection is extremely important, and goes hand-in-hand with booking a package holiday. For example,an airline stops trading, there is a back up fund which acts as a lsquosafety netrsquo it ensures that you canhomeyoursquore stranded abroad and that your money is safe.Pay for your holiday by credit cardldquoDonrsquot lose sight of booking your package, ATOL protected holiday, by credit card. If your holiday is over the value of £, and something were to go wrong ndash under the Consumer Credit Act, the credit card company provides another avenue for financial redress, providing even more financial protectionthings go wrong.\"Email your Brexit-related questions to gemma.jimmison@jpimedia.try catch  TrendingPolice concerned for safety of missing N.I. manPSNI officer put himself at lsquosubstantial riskrsquo during incident at Craigavon HospitalToy Reece Milner bought for his young son arrived this morning before his funeralHas PSNI officer Bobby Singleton become an unwitting sex symbol Arrest after attack on ambulance, PSNI and hospital staff          ..

He’s just taken over at the helm of the internationally renowned next generation science park which is home to  innovative knowledge based companies, who are employing more than , engineers, researchers, entrepreneurs and executives, across four locations – and has his sights firmly set on making Northern Ireland a leader in two key innovative areas of tech business.Taking on the role as chief executive of Catalyst from stalwart Professor Norman Apsley OBE, just two months ago, plans are under way to build on the foundations of an organisation which has an estate of , sq ft of agile workspace filled with innovative companies. Catalyst leads the way in innovation and entrepreneurship by supporting the creation and growth of innovation companies in Northern Ireland.“We have a rightful place in leading the world. We aren’t going to follow anybody. Let’s get back to leading the world,” Steve tells Ulster Business.“I am going to take the foundation that Norman left and look at how we leverage that by a signicant factor – in terms of economic activity and dynamism for Northern Ireland.“We need deeper, more strategic partnerships with key institutions. It is through collaboration we can do something to scale and put Northern Ireland on a world map.”Catalyst is the thriving, beating heart of Northern Ireland’s booming technology sector and leading the way in educating and preparing companies and young people for the changing world of work through the impact of the ‘Fourth Industrial Revolution, which is seeing the impact of new technologies impacting on le, work and society.Formerly known as the Northern Ireland Science Park, Catalyst is an independent not-for-profit organisation operating across the region. It provides agile workspace across four locations – the main site in Belfast’s Titanic Quarter, the Innovation centres in Londonderry, and Ballymena and most recently opened Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub, a co-working space dedicated to the fintech sector in Belfast city centre, which is a partnership with Danske Bank.“The business model we have had for the first  years was the perfect model for that period. We need a new model for the next. We are identying a simple, but ambitious strategy – building on the existing foundation.”Part of the strength of Catalyst is in attracting big international firms, such as Citi, in close proximity to businesses at the very birth of existence. Steve says as a result, “accidental encounters” lead to relationships and outcomes which otherwise, would not have happened.It also plays host to Queen’s University’s leading research body, ECITwhich itself is home to CSIT .Some of the leading thinkers based at the site include ECIT’s Professor Maire O’Neill – one of the youngest ever engineering professors at Queen’s, one-time UK Female Inventor of the Year and a leading researcher. “You have US companies looking at why would they want to move to Northern Ireland – they want to meet Professor O’Neill. She’s amazing,” Steve says.“Then there are cyber companies, like B-Secur. The firm specialises in technology which can read your ECG heartbeat as a unique biometric identy verication.“There are other indigenous companies, like Titan IC in cyber-security, Displaynote and ProAxsis. We have great companies that are now making a dent in the world.”And pushing forward with what his predecessor Norman Apsley built, plans are under way to expand and redevelop Catalyst further still.That includes another new building, Pierpont  – which will provide another , sq ft of space – and a revamp and refurbishment of Catalyst’s Innovation Centre, as part of an addition £m investment.“We want to make this the best place to work – improving the environment, the flow around the campus, the accessibility, and the experience, so that you love being here.“We want to refresh some of the buildings on the site. The Innovation Centre will be modernised by March and we will freshen-up our identity.”His big goal is to lead the way in two areas of technology and business at Catalyst – putting Northern Ireland front and centre.“We want to help to incubate two clusters where Northern Ireland leads the world.“How do we build on what ECIT is doing  We take the start-up capability, and ecosystem we have in Northern Ireland and leverage that further.“We want to make it easier for corporations to set up in Belfast and Northern Ireland in order to access amazing research talent. They want to define what the next big breakthrough is.“We can develop something for global companies that they can’t find where in the world. We want to create clusters, that will act as a magnet to attract hundreds of companies.”One of the unique elements of Catalyst is Connect – a network of experienced entrepreneurs, business professionals, top research talent and potential investors who provide their time and experience pro bono to help foster and develop the next generation of entrepreneurs.“It’s helping entrepreneurs to figure out how to build a company around their product idea and providing the support to validate and access the marketplace, capital, investment and or talent,” Steve says.“With the Connect network, we had  early stage companies or entrepreneurs engaged in our programmes last year. There is a lot of exciting and vibrant activity going on at the moment.”And it was Connect, which Steve founded and developed at Catalyst, which first drew him back home to his native Northern Ireland, following years of running and founding tech firms in the West Coast of the US.“I was an entrepreneur in Calornia for a number of years, in San Francisco and San Diego. I was there for the peak of the dot coms,” he said.That included his own start-up business, Kineticom, as well as other tech companies. It was his time in San Diego which resonated strongly with Steve.“Personally, I became obsessed with the San Diego story and the parallels to Northern Ireland. When they started on their journey in , San Diego had a population of . million people, % of their economy was dependent on the public sector. They have an ocean to one side, a mountain range around them and another country to the bottom of them.”San Diego went from the bottom of every league table to the top – with the collaboration of top universities, research and development and entrepreneurship, building the city into the tech stalwart it is now.The Connect  emanated from San Diego – a concept which help shaped the programme in Northern Ireland.“Meeting Norman Apsley at the Science Park was just the most beautul thing ever,” Steve says.The financial and economic impact and contribution that Catalyst has is hard to ignore. It’s estimated the businesses which operate there contribute around £m in GVA each year.“Everything we do is based on the simple belief that innovation has the power to transform our economy. People around the world are all innovating quickly, adapting new technologies, articial intelligence, for example. In Northern Ireland,people are producing goods and services, but are behind in adopting those new technologies, our economy is going to be in trouble as we will not be competitive.“The question is, how does innovation become the foundation on which everything is based ”And as a result of Catalyst’s research into the NI Knowledge Economy, an annual report published later this month, which acknowledges the huge changes to the workplace in the coming year, Catalyst is hosting their second Future of Work summit in May  – aimed at demystying how roles and traditional jobs are changing, right across the Knowledge Economy sectors.Of course, Brexit is still on the horizon. For Steve, the main concern is around the availability of talent. “The tech sector is hungry for talent, but with the uncertainty in the last couple of years, fewer people have been willing to consider moving to Northern Ireland. That places a lot of pressure on the existing employees in the sector.”“Long-term, we have to be optimistic and look at the opportunities which can come out of Brexit. The businesses within the Knowledge Economy are export driven, representing over % of all NI exports. With % of these exports outside the EU, the Knowledge Economy is the sector least dependent on Europe and should be the key for driving growth at this time of uncertainty.”So, for Steve, his level of optimism and dynamism is clear in his new role, one which he says he is “very fortunate” to have.“It’s a position which comes around so rarely, and whoever gets the opportunity is so blessed and fortunate to have the opportunity to lead. We have a talented team of people who are all passionate about what is possible. It’s so exciting. The opportunities and possibilities are endless.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"no deal brexit could cost ni economy bn by ","story":"Posted on Monday  January  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s economy could suffer a £bn drop in output by  in the event of a ‘no deal’ Brexit, it’s been claimed. According to the CBI, its analysis of government figures published at the end of last year showsthe UK fails to secure a deal with the EU, by , GVA could be “.% lower than under the UK’s current arrangements with the EU according to government analysis”. The CBI calculates this could amount to an annual loss of output worth almost £bn by , based on today’s prices. It says “manufacturing activity is particularly important in Northern Ireland, and the agri-food sector, which employs thousands, is likely to be severely impacted as it is particularly exposed to the risk of higher tarfs and trade costs”. Angela McGowan, Northern Ireland director of the CBI, said: “CBI members across Northern Ireland are clear:the new approach to finding a Brexit deal continues to be a game of who blinks first, the Northern Irish economy will pay the price. “The deadlock will only be broken by a genuine attempt by all MPs to find consensus and compromise, not stick to rusting red lines and political conditions. Like the rest of the UK, Northern Ireland is not – and cannot be – ready for no deal. “The projected impact on our economy would be devastating and while business will do all it can to reduce some of the worst aspects, a no deal scenario is unmanageable. “The message from the CBI to our politicians is clear – we must see compromise or the whole country faces the unforgivable prospect of a disorderly Brexit which will affect jobs and livelihoods in Northern Ireland for decades to come. It’s time to put prosperity before party politics and dogma.”  View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Air-1.jpg","title":"eight part belfast made airbus passenger jets delivered","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by John Mulgrew Eight part-Belfast made Bombardier Airbus passenger jets were delivered at the end of last year – bringing the total number to  during .

We tell client’s stories through engaging content written by former journalists – grab their customers’ attention with stunning design, maximise conversions by using the latest digital marketing expertise, and develop websites which are living, breathing, online stores or shop windows. As content director, my role is to bring almost  years’ experience in journalism, political communications, corporate PR, crisis management and digital content crafting to Grofuse. How did the business start and how has it grown The business was created by a fusion of expertise to achieve sales growth, including experienced digital marketers, PR consultants, web developers, software developers, graphic designers, illustrators and motion designers. I co-founded the company with expert digital marketer Denis Finnegan who has spent  years fuelling online lead generation for businesses. Growth has been swt over the last  months. We’ve employed an effective combination of marketing efforts and created fans of our existing clients.What is your background I’m a seasoned hack, having worked in print journalism for almost  years followed by a few years as a political communications adviser. I spent a brief period teaching English and history at secondary level before entering a newsroom. The working environments were poles apart in terms pace, excitement and... language choices. As a school pupil and university student, I worked on building sites, supermarkets, farms, bars, bread delivery vans, a bakery and even a bacon factory kill-line. However, I had never encountered such flurries of expletives as I did in newsrooms. Great places to work. High pressure, tight deadlines and great target-setting – a superb way to fuel productivity in any work environment.What do you do dferently from your competition and what are your strengths Clear communication with our clients is our greatest strength. We listen intently to what our clients’ goals are, take time to learn about their products and gain full understanding of their ideal customers. We start with a blank canvass and devise bespoke digital strategies to fuel each client’s business growth by engaging their target market effectively and delivering genuine sales leads that are easily quantiable.Who are your main customers Our customers operate across a wide range of sectors. We are currently working with clients across the UK and Ireland, US, France and Spain. Do you have a target in mind in terms of where you want the business to grow We are currently focusing the bulk of our efforts on the island of Ireland with a particular focus on Dublin and Belfast. What challenges have you faced The somewhat ‘snake-oil industry’ reputation of digital marketing sometimes poses a barrier to speaking with decision makers who in the past have invested with little . However, once we’re given an opportunity, we like to let the results do the talking. Who most inspires you Those who thrive in the face of adversity and have strong growth mind-sets. The type of person with the right measure of accountability, skill and relentlessness to inspire their teams to achieve targets. It’s a mind-set akin to that of a top athlete whose body is screaming ‘slow down’ in the business end of a race but whose mind interprets that as a cue to go faster. My we Martina – a former operations manager with Lidl Ireland who co-founded and runs leading human resources consultancy, HR Team – has these qualities in abundance. She inspires me in everything I do.Where do you see yourself in the next few years I love living and working in the North West. Whatever people like to call Derry or Londonderry, it’s a very special place with a lot of talent and a big future in driving the cross-border regional economy. With our headquarters at Catalyst Inc and plans underway for satellite offices in Dublin and the UK, we want to ensure our agency plays a part in shaping that economic prosperity with the provision of more high-quality jobs for the area.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
