Over the next four months, letters poured in from all over the world, bearing loving messages and words of comfort to the man who’d given them so much pleasure through his music and humour.Some — like those from Emma Thompson, Billy Joel and Phil Collins (who wrote a three-page fan letter) — were from people who didn’t know him personally but wanted to be part of a massive outpouring of affection for him.Among them was a parody, by Paul McCartney, of The Beatles hit When I’m Sixty-Four a caricature of Dudley with ribald comments from the Rolling Stones scribbled around his face and loving notes from Elton John, Bette Midler, Whoopi Goldberg, Jack Lemmon, Mel Brooks, Michael Caine, Neil Simon and hundreds more.Some tried to make him smile. ‘Many happy returns from someone who is just over a year older (and still slightly taller),’ wrote Alan Bennett, while Billy Joel confided: ‘I’m not much taller than you and I think I understand how uncomfortable it can be carrying an oversized set of b***s on such short legs.’          Having appeared in the film Ten in 1978, above, he’d been surprised to be offered a cameo role in Barbra Streisand’s romantic comedy, The Mirror Has Two Faces. This would be Dudley’s chance to remind people of the talents that once made him the toast of HollywoodDuring all this time, I was bombarded by calls from concerned friends. ‘I didn’t know he was ill,’ Kelsey Grammer fretted. ‘What’s wrong with him?’ It was a question that nobody could answer.American musician-producer Quincy Jones rang me one night after I’d started to run a bath. For 15 minutes he talked about the magic of Dudley, his wonderful spirit and how much he loved him. I spent the next half-hour mopping the flood in my bathroom.By the time I’d assembled all the letters, they filled two massive albums, which I packaged and sent to Dudley. He was overwhelmed. ‘I found it enormously touching,’ he told me. ‘I thought it was extraordinary that they would write me letters that expressed their feelings about me. Such a surprise. It was amazing.‘It gave me some encouragement to think a bit more pleasantly about myself, and to think more positively about myself.’The first sign of a problem had come on the first day of shooting of Dudley’s final film. It was the mid-Nineties, and his triumphs in Arthur and 10 were far behind him. So he’d been surprised to be offered a cameo role in Barbra Streisand’s romantic comedy, The Mirror Has Two Faces. This would be Dudley’s chance to remind people of the talents that once made him the toast of Hollywood. Except it didn’t turn out that way.As the cameras rolled, he found he simply couldn’t remember his lines. Even writing them on giant cue cards wasn’t helping, because he was finding it hard to focus. Afterwards, Dudley retreated to his trailer, so upset that he refused to have any lunch. ‘Something is happening to me and I don’t know what,’ he told journalist and friend Rena Fruchter and me.          Dudley Moore, centre, in Blame in on the Bellboy in 1992. By the time I’d assembled all the letters for his birthday just a few years later, they filled two massive albums, which I packaged and sent to Dudley. He was overwhelmedRena and I thought we knew the answer. Nicole Rothschild had happened to him, and the once irrepressible Dudley, who lit up rooms with his warmth and raucous laughter, was increasingly sinking into depression.As it turned out, we were only partially right. Half his age, Nicole had met him a few years earlier through the simple stratagem of stopping him in the street and begging for his autograph. Never able to resist an attractive woman, Dudley plunged into an affair.His latest leggy girlfriend was eight inches taller than him and came loaded with problems. While still married to her first husband, she’d gone through a bigamous marriage with Charles Cleveland, a self-confessed drug addict, and had two children with him.          Dudley Moore with his wife, Nicole Rothschild, and their baby, born in 1995. Buckling down for the first time to do up to six hours of practice a day, he’d blossomed into a critically acclaimed concert pianist —admired by, among others, the great conductor Sir Georg Solti and the violinist Itzhak PerlmanSo obsessed was Dudley with his new lover that he helped the couple financially throughout their ‘marriage’. Then, when Nicole decided to leave Cleveland, he bought her a house around the corner from his home in California, and gave her a 20,000-dollar sports car and a monthly allowance.That wasn’t all: he continued supporting her ex-husband, who was now HIV positive, and their two children. Plus he bought cars for both Cleveland and Nicole’s sister, and a flat in Las Vegas for Cleveland’s mother.If that seemed outrageously philanthropic, Dudley’s friends knew it was typical behaviour. He’d always taken on responsibility for the families of long-term girlfriends or wives, just as he’d always insisted on having the freedom to sleep around.          Classical musician Rena Fruchter with Moore in Washington. In his final years, he lived with her along with her partner Brian DallowSo despite his infatuation with Nicole, he was still enjoying the company of other women, among them Quincy Jones’s daughter Jolie. Why did he stay with Nicole?Their relationship became ‘a union created in hell’, as one of his friends described it.No one could understand the dynamics that kept them together, because they were such opposites. While Dudley was meticulous and rational, Nicole was volatile, often irrational and as changeable as the English weather.These differences triggered endless fights, often resulting in Dudley — all 5ft 2½in of him — emerging scratched and bruised. Somehow they always kissed and made up.Eventually Nicole persuaded him to marry her. First he had to get his lawyers to track down her first husband and get that marriage annulled, as Nicole had married Cleveland without an annulment.Soon she was pregnant with their son, Nicholas. Dudley, however, felt trapped in a cycle of abuse, remorse and apology — yet strangely helpless to do anything about it.The night before he forgot his lines on Streisand’s new movie, Nicole had rung him several times in the early hours. She announced that she was moving the household to Telluride, a small mountain town in Colorado, where Dudley had already given in to her latest whim and put down a deposit on another home.Little wonder that he was distracted. He’d already arranged to move there with Nicole her phone calls were because she didn’t want to wait until he returned to LA a week later — she wanted to move immediately. She was a very impulsive woman.‘I just want to play the piano and have everyone leave me alone,’ he said despairingly to Rena, herself a renowned pianist.          Dudley Moore and Peter Cook in 1993. ‘I don’t visualise myself at concerts, and I’m not obsessed by images of myself at the piano,’ he said. ‘You get used to the idea of saying: “Goodbye, goodbye, practical world…”In a break from filming, Dudley flew back to California, determined to commit all his lines to memory. But he wasn’t surprised when his agent rang a few days later to report that Streisand was cutting him loose from the film.Still puzzled by his sudden memory problems, Dudley decided to have some medical tests. Having ruled out every common brain disorder, however, his doctors pronounced themselves mystified.Dudley’s only obvious problem seemed to be the continuing turmoil in his personal life. It would be another two years before doctors were finally able to diagnose what was really wrong with him.Instrument of war: Violin built by hero soldier, who was...Share this articleDudley’s amazing facility to switch between acting, comedy, writing film scores and playing jazz had already made him one of the most versatile and multi-faceted performers of our time.In mid-life, he’d also developed another major talent. Buckling down for the first time to do up to six hours of practice a day, he’d blossomed into a critically acclaimed concert pianist —admired by, among others, the great conductor Sir Georg Solti and the violinist Itzhak Perlman.          Cook and Moore in Goodbye Again. For too long, Dudley realised, he’d been too wrapped up in his personal life. Now it was time to take care of himself and focus on his workMore recently, spurred on and tutored by Rena, he’d mastered Grieg’s Piano Concerto, which was released as a CD. Despite Dudley’s love of acting and comedy, it was music that gave him the most fulfilment. For him, it was the more visceral art, the one through which he became emotionally recharged.As his old music tutor, Peter Cork, observed: ‘What is incredible is how he does brilliantly with one career then opens up in another. But in the end it comes back to the one thing that was always the most overwhelming — his music.’After the Streisand debacle, however, Dudley seemed almost to have given up. Now living in Telluride, surrounded by the chaos of Nicole’s family, he abandoned his daily piano practice.He’d lost confidence, believing he no longer had a place in the world of entertainment. ‘I know it’s sad because I have so much to give,’ he told me, ‘but I’ve tried to come back and people don’t like what I do. I’m resigned to that.’Rena was alarmed. They’d been booked to perform some concerts together, so she flew out from New York several times to see him.Gently, she encouraged him back to the keyboard and managed to rekindle his passion. Over time, it became clear Dudley depended on her for the security that was otherwise lacking in his life.Nicole had been up to her usual antics. On one of her whims, she decided to open a shop selling children’s clothes and furniture, and Dudley had paid 60,000 dollars for the merchandise.Then, two months after he moved to Colorado, she decided they should go back to California. The shop never opened.After settling back into the two homes in LA’s Marina del Rey — his and hers — they resumed their pattern of blistering rows and abuse. There was yet more turmoil when Dudley discovered that his business manager had misappropriated several million dollars of his savings.In an effort to raise money, Dudley tried to sell the flat he’d bought for Nicole’s ex-husband’s mother. The woman promptly sued him.Eventually, he paid her $25,000 to leave, even though — thanks to his kindness — she’d lived for several years at the flat for free.          Dudley Moore pictured with Peter Cook in Sherlock Holmes: The Hound of the Baskervilles in 1978. Though he had feared a diagnosis of a degenerative brain disease, known as PSP, for Dudley it was almost a reliefWith hindsight it was obvious that some of the early signs had been his trouble with remembering lines on Streisand’s film set.In October 1999, I visited Dudley in New Jersey, where he’d been living with Rena’s family — who helped care for him — for two years. The house next door had come up for sale and he’d immediately snapped it up. Rena’s daughter had just moved in to help him and he’d also hired a cookhousekeeper.The next few days were heart-wrenching as I saw the full devastation of Dudley’s illness. His speech had become slurred and his balance unsteady he would often stumble while walking or climbing stairs, and had a tendency to fall backwards.On top of that, his eyesight had become impaired. He was having trouble focusing and was suffering from double vision. Taking part in conversation had become difficult. Sometimes he’d begin expressing a thought but would lose the thread before he could get it all out.It was frustrating and enervating, and he found it easier to listen than to participate. ‘I’m trapped inside this body,’ he’d tell me. ‘It feels as if I have something on the tip of my tongue but I can’t quite get at it. I start to say something, but by the time I’ve said it, the rest of the thought has disappeared.’I noticed he had three grand pianos in the house as well as the upright he’d learned on as a child — but he played only when no one was around.He felt tremendous gratitude towards Rena and her husband Brian. ‘They are remarkable,’ he told me. ‘They’re like the family I’ve never had. I feel very comfortable here. Life is very quiet, nice and extremely supportive.’Later, as Rena drove us home from lunch at a restaurant — a daily ritual — Dudley played his Songs Without Words CD. His eyes filled with tears as we listened to his evocative score from the film Six Weeks, arguably his most outstanding composition.These days, he spent a great deal of time playing his own music, he said. Now that he could no longer play properly, listening had become his substitute.He even watched his own movies, laughing at himself. It was the first time in his life that he’d felt able to sit back and genuinely appreciate his work.‘I don’t visualise myself at concerts, and I’m not obsessed by images of myself at the piano,’ he said. ‘You get used to the idea of saying: “Goodbye, goodbye, practical world…”‘But there are regrets. It’s very hurtful to realise that one can’t function in the same way ever again. So I just listen to my old records and feel it’s something unachievable by today’s standards, but it was achievable in the past.’ Before leaving, I asked if he’d play for me one last time. To my delight, he launched into his exquisite Six Weeks score. No, it didn’t sound the same. But when he couldn’t sustain the classical sound, he suddenly transformed it into a moment of glorious improvised jazz.          Moore, right, with Peter Cook, left. Moore spent a great deal of time playing his own music, he said. Now that he could no longer play properly, listening had become his substituteKnowing that Bach and Ravel had written music specifically for the left hand, I asked him if he’d consider playing in public again.He shook his head. ‘It’s not my bag. It’s maddening as it’s the one thing that I really regret saying goodbye to — the ability to play with two hands — but it’s impossible to get the hands together to play the right speed.’At the end of my three-day stay, Dudley gave me a long, tight hug, his face puckered into that familiar boyish, pixie smile.In his own way, he continued to fight back against his illness. He compiled a CD with Rena of a legendary concert he’d performed in 1992 at the Royal Albert Hall.And with great courage, he agreed to give a charity performance in Philadelphia that November, in which he and Julie Andrews narrated American poet Ogden Nash’s Carnival Of The Animals.With the help of his speech therapist, Dudley worked assiduously on the narration for several weeks. He was ecstatic to be facing an audience again — and they responded on the night with a standing ovation.During his final few years, he was wrapped in the loving, protective cocoon provided by Rena’s family.Life settled into a routine filled with speech and physical therapy, daily excursions to local restaurants, rented movies every evening, holidays at the family’s Nova Scotia hideaway and even a week’s cruise to Bermuda.With them, Dudley was at last able to find the peace and contentment that had eluded him for so much of his life.In the autumn of 2001, despite his increasingly frail condition, he came to Britain to receive a CBE from Prince Charles, who spent several minutes speaking with him. Afterwards, he caught up with old friends, including his first wife Suzy Kendall.When he said goodbye to them all, he knew it was for the last time. At the end of March 2002, just a few weeks before his 67th birthday, Dudley lost the battle he’d so bravely fought for the past five years.Adapted from Dear Dudley: A Celebration Of The Much-loved Comedy Legend by Barbra Paskin, published by John Blake on November 15 at £18.99. © Barbra Paskin 2018. To order a copy for £15.19 (offer valid to 241118 p\u0026ampp free), visit www.mailshop.co.ukbooks or call 0844 571 0640."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/30/05/51C9E77100000578-0-image-a-45_1540878286105.jpg","title":"Mobile phone vacuum cleaner coffee maker rated gadgets avoid Black Friday","story":"    Which? reviewed products from Amazon, Argos , AO.com and Currys PC World which had glowing five star reviews, despite shoddy design          Billions of pounds will be spent on gadgets on Black Friday – November 23 – with shoppers heavily reliant on customer ratings - these headphones were given a 40 per cent (poor) verdict on Which?\u0027Fit for a Queen\u0027: RAY MASSEY test drives new £250,000...Share this article    This vacuum cleaner costs £98 but was given a rating of 33 per cent by Which?Which? tests hundreds of products every year and warns people against buying those that fail to work effectively.Six products, including a vacuum cleaner, mobile phone and coffee maker, which are listed as ‘Don’t Buys’ by Which? after getting scores of 32-43 per cent, are given impressive customer ratings on retailer websites.They include a cordless vacuum that scored just one star for carpet and floorboard cleaning, a coffee machine that was ‘poor in most respects’ and a mobile phone Which? experts said was ‘rubbish at just about everything’.The revelations will raise new questions about whether online reviews are useful or even genuine.Concerns about the reliability of such reviews are particularly significant ahead of next weekend.It is estimated that Britons will splurge £8.29billion from Black Friday through to Cyber Monday – November 26. Retailers, including Amazon, Argos and Currys PC World, are already running deals linked to Black Friday in a bid to capture a share of the nation’s festive spending on gifts and products.Which? cannot say the customer reviews are fake, but, it warns they are not as useful as independent, long term, comparative tests.Alex Neill, of Which?, said: ‘Customer reviews are often based on very first impressions and won’t necessarily offer a comparison with other products or how the product performs over time.‘While online customer reviews can be useful for narrowing down a large selection of products, they may not give you all the information you need to make an informed decision before making a purchase.’The Beko Bean to Cup CEG7425 coffee machine, costing from £220, scored 32 per cent in Which? tests.

Lidl then tweeted a tongue-in-cheek advert for an £89 Yamaha keyboardThe German supermarket tweeted: \u0027Just because you don\u0027t have £872 to spend on a piano, doesn\u0027t mean you can\u0027t be the next Elton\u0027, alongside a picture of an £89.99 Yamaha keyboard.The picture is also captioned \u0027It\u0027s a Lidl bit funny...\u0027 Twitter users were quick to praise the witty response, calling it a \u0027masterstroke\u0027 while one user said \u0027give your marketing manager a rise\u0027.The official John Lewis account then tweeted Lidl a link to its £15 children\u0027s piano with the message: \u0027It\u0027s a Lidl bit cheaper\u0027.One wag replied to both saying: \u0027Do you pair want to leave this argument till the weekend. I’ve heard Saturday nights all right for fighting\u0027 - a joke linked to another of Sir Elton\u0027s big hits.                        Five actors aged between four and 50 were used to play Sir Elton, using prosthetics, CGI and help from the star and his husband David Furnish to ensure they had the same mannerisms and piano playing style.Viewers are taken back through key moments in his life with scenes of the star on stadium tours, travelling on a private jet, recording Your Song, playing the piano in a local pub and performing in a school recital. It ends with Sir Elton - then little Reg Dwight - running down the stairs on Christmas morning to see his grandmother Ivy and his mother, who brought him up together because his father, Stanley, was largely absent.John Lewis has said the advert is \u0027inspired by real events\u0027 but admits the finale involves \u0027some creativity\u0027 because the singer was never gifted a piano at Christmas, but he had learned to play at his grandmother\u0027s house - and denied claims they paid him £5million to take part. It is also the second of the retailer\u0027s Christmas ads to feature Your Song after singer Ellie Goulding recorded a cover for the 2010 campaign. The  nod to Elton\u0027s mother and the influence on his career comes almost a year after her death last December.Two years before she passed away the star found the courage to apologise to her after a nearly nine-year feud that culminated in her inviting an Elton John impersonator to perform at her 90th birthday party because she missed him so much.Elton severed all contact with her after a catastrophic argument where she blamed Elton\u0027s husband, David Furnish, for turning him against her.She was also upset the Candle In The Wind singer demanded she cut all ties with her longtime friends Bob Halley and John Reid, who  worked for him for decades.But he later sent Sheila a large bouquet of white orchids for her milestone birthday and also shelled out £30,000 for Sheila to undergo a double hip replacement.When she died last year Elton spoke of his grief - but happiness that they had become close again.In September this year rumours emerged that Sir Elton had agreed to take part - but John Lewis has denied he was paid the £5million fee being mooted. They also said some of his fee was donated to charity.The musician said today: \u0027The John Lewis Christmas campaign has so many warm memories for me and my family.\u0027It\u0027s been a lovely opportunity for me to reflect on my life in music and the incredible journey I have been on, and how first playing my grandmother\u0027s piano marks the moment when music came into my life.\u0027The ad is absolutely fantastic and I\u0027ve truly loved every minute of being a part of it.\u0027His husband David Furnish, who was involved in producing the advert, said:  \u0027I think Elton has enjoyed the process of making this tremendously. \u0027I think, you know, emotionally he is thinking about the journey he’s been on as an artist, and that moment, you know, when music came into his life at a very young age when he was encouraged by his mother and his grandmother with his piano\u0027. The Boy \u0026amp The Piano was released online at 8am this morning before being shown on ITV at 9.15pm tonight.Actor Simon Burbage plays Elton in the 1980s and 1990, while the lookalike used to recreate the scenes from the 1970s is Oliver Marshall. The singer as a teenager is played by Brandon Stein, while Hudson Trindall is performing at a piano recital and the young boy on Christmas morning is Freddie Henderson.           Sir Elton sings his first big hit Your Song in a present day gig but the advert goes all the way back to his 1950s childhood          Actor Oliver Marshall wearing prosthetics and original clothes is shown performing on his stadium tour on the West Coast with the crowds recreated using CGI          Viewers are also transported into his tour plane in the 1970s when he became a global superstar and multi-millionaire      Sir Elton, again using an actor, is shown performing Your Song on TV and then recording it for an album in 1970  In the 1960s the star first started performing in the Northwood Hills pub in Pinner, around the corner from where he grew up  Elton, played by Hudson Trindall, is shown performing in a school recital watched by his family in an advert inspired by events in his life (pictured, right, Elton as a child)           The heart of the advert is revealed at the end as Elton as a young boy tears the paper from the piano in front of his grandmother and mother, played by Deborah Baxter and Katie Bonna (left to right)          The child actor looks in wonder at the musical instrument with the message that gifts can inspire and change lives          The final scene shows Elton playing the same piano himself, although John Lewis admit while he learned to play with his grandmother he never received one as a Christmas giftJohn Lewis addressed speculation about the cost of this year\u0027s ad, describing reports that it had paid Sir Elton £5million as \u0027wildly inaccurate\u0027 and said the ad cost £7million with most of the money going on advertising spending.          Sir Elton said his mother Sheila (pictured together at his 50th birthday party in 1997) was an inspiration to him - but they had an eight-year feud before having a reconciliation two years before she died last DecemberIt added that Sir Elton had requested that a portion of his fee be donated to the Elton John Charitable Trust when he was first approached to be involved.  John Lewis customer director Craig Inglis said: \u0027The ad tells the story of why Elton\u0027s piano was more than just a gift and we hope to remind customers of that special moment when they\u0027ve given a gift at Christmas time that they know will be treasured forever.\u0027The retailer, which reported a 98.8 per cent profits crash for the first half of the year in September, said the ad was a \u0027crucial part\u0027 of its overall marketing campaign and \u0027one of the most effective marketing campaigns in the industry, delivering an excellent return on investment\u0027.John Lewis and Waitrose employees have been given the first opportunity to share the two minute and 20 second ad at 6am on Thursday before its launch on the store\u0027s social media channels, its website and in shops at 8am.The ad first airs on television on Thursday at 9.15pm during ITV\u0027s Dark Heart, although ITV viewers may have noticed that the theme tunes to some of the channel\u0027s shows including Coronation Street and This Morning were played solely in piano notes on Wednesday to tease the advert\u0027s premiere.Customers at the retailer\u0027s flagship Oxford Street branch can also step into a 2,000 square foot recreation of the ad production set to try on some of the costumes, listen to recordings from Elton John\u0027s 17-11-70 album and have photos taken at the piano.          The advert has been met with mixed reviews on social media with some viewers labelling it \u0027beautiful and powerful\u0027 and others asking if it is merely a promotional ad for the singer\u0027s upcoming tour John Lewis has moved away from cuddly toys this year and fans of the advert can enter a reproduction of Sir Elton\u0027s lounge now built in its Oxford Street store          The music studio where Your Song was recorded has also been lovingly rebuilt in the Oxford Street where shoppers can touch the mixing desk and play the grand piano          As part of the experience Elton\u0027s 1970s dressing room is open to the public where they can try wigs, glasses and his clothes  Classic tour T-shirts will be sold in John Lewis store but there will be no cuddly toys or other similar gifts for the 2018 advert  \u0027#fabulousfreddie!\u0027 Boy, 4, from Corrie actress Tina O\u0027Brien\u0027s drama school is revealed as child star of John Lewis advert as his proud mother shares Elton John\u0027s Instagram post about her sonThe mother of the child star of this year\u0027s John Lewis advert has spoken of her pride today after the long-awaited commercial was finally unveiled, calling her son #fabulousfreddie!Emma Henderson shared a picture of son Freddie, four, from the advert on Facebook, originally posted by Sir Elton John, with the department store\u0027s 2018 festive campaign based on his life.The mini-biopic, which cost £7million and is set to his 1970 hit Your Song, shows the Rocketman singer\u0027s career in reverse, featuring several actors in make-up and prosthetic playing him through the ages.Posting a picture of the youngster on Instagram, Sir Elton wrote: \u0027What a pleasure it was to be part of the wonderful @johnlewisandpartnersChristmas advert.\u0027Ms Henderson then shared it with the caption: \u0027When @eltonjohn posts a pic of your child\u0027s face! #fabulousfreddie @freddiesteddiego.\u0027          Freddie Henderson, four, has won rave reviews for his performance as young Elton John in the John Lewis Christmas advert and the musician posted a picture of the youngster on social media this morning which proud mother Emma Henderson shared on Facebook today, pictured          Ms Henderson, pictured with Freddie, captioned Sir Elton\u0027s post with #fabulousfreddie and said: \u0027When @eltonjohn posts a pic of your child\u0027s face!\u0027Drama school pupil Freddie was picked out from more than 1,000 hopefuls after auditioning for the advert, called The Boy and The Piano, earlier this year.

We are very, very proud. He beat more than 1,000 other boys and it is great for our small school because a lot of the big London agencies often get these roles.\u0027You don\u0027t get a bigger advert than the John Lewis Christmas ad so this could be a stepping stone to big things for Freddie\u0027.Ms Morgan added she expected the other pupils to be very excited about the advert but said Freddie had not been affected much by the exposure.She added: \u0027At his age, we try to teach them some improvisation, script work and try to get their imaginations going.\u0027We have a lot of talented children but since Freddie arrived we all said how confident, bubbly he was and how much of a spark he had.\u0027The school also confirmed Freddie would be watching tonight\u0027s first airing of the advert on ITV1 at 9.15pm with his family and it would be filming the moment to share with the public.Meanwhile O\u0027Brien, who plays Sarah in Coronation Street, added: \u0027I\u0027m so proud I could pop.\u0027   \u0027It\u0027s just one big plug for Elton!\u0027 John Lewis ides fans with \u0027not very Christmassy\u0027 festive advert as retailer is accused of \u0027selling out\u0027 by promoting singer\u0027s farewell tour and Rocketman film biopic Fans of the John Lewis Christmas advert are split today over the decision to have millionaire Sir Elton John at its heart.Critics have called the retailer\u0027s 2018 campaign a \u0027sell out\u0027 and a \u0027plug\u0027 for the star\u0027s farewell tour and his Rocketman biopic starring Taron Egerton, which is due for release next year.But others including stars James Corden and Susanna Reid have praised it with some fans claiming it is the retailer\u0027s \u0027best ever\u0027 Christmas commercial.Many said its message that one present can change a life reduced them to tears.   Some fans loved it - and saw it as a happy distraction from the Brexit chaos consuming the UK - with many crying through itThe £7million advert tells the tear-jerking story of his rise to fame and fortune from humble beginnings in Pinner, north London, where he was brought up by his mother Sheila and grandmother Rita.It ends with a four-year-old Elton - then Reg Dwight - unwrapping his first piano on Christmas Day in 1951 then cuts back to the present say showing the emotional 71-year-old playing the same instrument in front of the tree.It is followed by the slogan: \u0027Some gifts are more than just a gift\u0027 and the retailer has today started marketing pianos for £800 - the first time it has sold them for decades.Twitter went wild when it was released this morning - but it has split opinion.@mollytomkinss said: \u0027I feel truly sorry for anyone who can\u0027t understand the deeper meaning of the #JohnLewisChristmasAd this year.

Best ad since the penguins\u0027.   Elton John faces backlash for featuring his mother in John Lewis Christmas ad despite arguing with her for years           Sir Elton, pictured with his mother Sheila  after being knighted in 1998, had a series of damaging rows with her but they reconciled just before she diedSir Elton John healed the long and painful rift with his mother Sheila five months before her death last December  - but he has faced a backlash for featuring their relationship in the John Lewis Christmas advert released today.The star, 71, had been estranged from Mrs Farebrother for around nine years until May 2017 following rows over mutual friends and his husband David Furnish.Mrs Farebrother had encouraged her son to play piano from the age of three and was a constant throughout the majority of his extraordinary career.But their relationship faltered when she was in her 80s and she said two years ago her son \u0027hated\u0027 her after a series of bitter public rows.When she turned ninety she even invited an Elton John lookalike to perform because she missed him so much Despite their reconciliation last year some viewers of the John Lewis ad said it was wrong to put their sometimes rocky relationship at its heart.One fan said while watching today\u0027s advert: \u0027All I could think was: didn\u0027t Elton John famously cut his mum out of his life for years?\u0027 Another said: \u0027Nice ad for, erm... Elton John. Didn’t he refuse to speak to his mother for years? Nice that he appreciated her eventually\u0027, while one critic tweeted: \u0027Remember the time that Elton John’s mum hired an Elton John lookalike to play at her party? That didn’t make the cut into that ad\u0027.But others saw the other side and said: \u0027Such an emotional journey, so gripping, so true to life for so many people and heartfelt especially after @eltonofficial losing his Mother. Well done John Lewis this year!\u0027.Another added: \u0027I was quite moved by #JohnLewisChristmasAd. The power of music and a mother\u0027s love combined. Lovely\u0027.Mother and son\u0027s relationship appeared hit rock bottom in 2016, two years after he married Mr Furnish. Sheila had been a witness at their civil partnership in 2005.Sir Elton said: \u0027I don’t miss her. When she says things in the press, like, “I haven’t spoken to Elton since he married that f****** a****** David Furnish”. That was pretty hard to take\u0027.He added: \u0027I don’t hate my mother. I look after her but I don’t want her in my life.’But they made up fully around six months before she died last year, shortly after he was hospitalised for 12 days, including two nights in intensive care, after picking up a serious infection while touring South America.In May 2017 he confirmed they were close again after he shared a throwback picture on Twitter to celebrate reconnecting with Mrs Farebrother on America\u0027s Mother\u0027s Day with the message: \u0027So happy we are back in touch. Love, Elton.\u0027Mother and son fell out in 2008 after she allegedly refused his request not to talk to two of their oldest friends.          Sheila and Elton at the height of his fame in 1976 - she has been credited for being a driving force behind his career          1947: Elton John is born Reginald Dwight on March 25 to father Stanley and mother Sheila. As he grew up his father was largely absent and his mum encouraged him to play the piano from the age of three.His parents orce and Sheila remarries his stepfather John, and the couple encourage him to write songs and get him a job as a pub pianist age 15. She remained a strong and constant support during his long career. 2008: Mother and son fall out after a row over mutual friends and his husband David Furnish\u0027s influence on his career2015: Mrs Farebrother said that her son \u0027hated\u0027 her and gets an an Elton John impersonator at her 90th birthday party. He then sends a bunch of white orchids - his first contact for seven years. May 2017: He posts a US mother\u0027s day message saying he is \u0027happy they\u0027re in touch\u0027 - confirming they had reconciled their differences.December 4, 2017: Sheila Farebrother dies aged 92.                                                    This was further inflamed when she claimed that Elton never told her she had become a grandmother when boys Elijah and Zachary were born.In 2015 she told the Daily Mail that her son had called out of the blue and ordered her to cut off all contact with Bob Halley - Sir Elton\u0027s driver turned personal assistant - and John Reid, with whom he had fallen out.Mrs Farebrother, who lived in a bungalow on the South Coast, said: \u0027I told him: \u0027I\u0027m not about to do that and drop them. Bob is like a son to me. He has always been marvellous to me and he lives nearby and keeps an eye on me\u0027.\u0027She said Sir Elton flew into an expletive-filled rage, adding: \u0027To my utter amazement, he told me he hated me.\u0027And he banged the phone down. Imagine! To me, his mother!\u0027She is said to have told him during the row: \u0027I said to him, And you think more of that f***ing thing you married than your own mother.\u0027During that period, however, it is understood Sir Elton continued to support Sheila financially and to provide a roof over her head, despite all that has passed between them.He is also said to have paid £30,00 for her double hip replacement.At one point she filled the void left by her son with a tribute act to the pop star.Sheila Farebrother hired him to provide the entertainment at her 90th birthday in March 2015 and would send emails to Mr Bacon, who himself described their link as \u0027quite surreal\u0027.Prompted by the milestone birthday, Sir Elton got in touch with his mother for the first time in seven years, sending her white orchids.They then continued to work on their relationship until their reconciliation was properly confirmed by Sir Elton in May 2017.The star last saw her a week before she died.When it was announced on December 4 last year he said he was in \u0027complete shock\u0027.He also posted a photograph of them together in happier times and wrote on Instagram: \u0027So sad to say that my mother passed away this morning. I only saw her last Monday and I am in shock. Travel safe Mum. Thank-you for everything. I will miss you so much. Love, Elton\u0027.The singer says he has been spurred on to shower his sons with affection because he received none from his own father.Elton took a swipe at his late father Stanley Dwight while giving a speech in which he said a lack of love had led him to drink and drugs.He said recently: \u0027I never stop telling them I love them, and they never stop telling me they love me\u0027.          Elton John, then 24, at home with his mother Theresa and stepfather Fred in 1971, and the couple were his rock for many years but his own father Stanley was largely absent      John Lewis\u0027 2017 Christmas advert has left viewers in tears over a mischievous and flatulent monster called Moz and  his relationship with a seven-year-old soulmate - with fans comparing it to Disney\u0027s much-loved Monsters Inc.The giant furry monster with a bulbous nose, wonky teeth and a love of snoring, jumps out from under the bed every night to play with companion Joe in a festive tale making many  laugh and cry.The little boy, aged 7, who is played by young twin brothers from London named Ethan and Tobias, is initially frightened after seeing a pair of enormous eyes peering from the dark under his bed.But the two unlikely friends are shown sharing games, playing piggyback and Scalextric in his bedroom – all without mum, dad, or older sister finding out.Moz then leaves his friend as he realises the little boy needs to grow up without him and wraps a farewell gift for him under the Christmas tree - a nightlight to help him sleep.Elbow performed The Beatles\u0027 Abbey Road masterpiece Golden Slumbers as the soundtrack.2016 Last year\u0027s star was Buster the Boxer and his trampoline antics.John Lewis said the advert where the dog, played by five-year-old Biff, beats a young girl to her new toy is their attempt to cheer up Britain after a \u0027tough year\u0027.The advert told the story of a little girl called Bridget who loves to jump.Set to a cover version of \u0027One Day I\u0027ll Fly Away\u0027, her mother and father buy her a trampoline, toiling while she sleeps to build it before hiding it in the garden to surprise her with on Christmas Day. As the snow falls an array of animals start using it as the Boxer watches forlornly through the window.The next morning Bridget sprints out to use it for the first time but her joy turns to shock as cheeky Buster has the last laugh and uses her new toy  before her.2015A lonely Man on the Moon is shown to viewers sitting by himself on a bench, completely unaware that he is being observed by the youngster back down on EarthThe elderly man, played by a 77-year-old French actor called Jean, gazes up wistfully towards the Earth, as the Oasis song Half The World Away, performed by 19-year-old Norwegian singer Aurora plays mournfully in the background.She tries desperately to send him a message but all her efforts fail, while he remains unaware that anyone cares about him and sits alone on a bench, wistfully staring up at the Earth.Eventually, on Christmas morning, a present arrives from the sky, carried by party balloons, and the old man unwraps it to reveal a vintage telescope.He uses it to spot Lily and, realising that someone cares about him, his eyes fill with tears.2014John Lewis hoped the bond between a boy and a penguin would capture the public\u0027s imagination.The two-minute festive commercial told the story of seven-year-old Sam, played by actor Rhys Edwards from Hertfordshire, and his friend Monty.The boy gradually realises Monty is longing for a penguin companion. And so on Christmas morning Sam surprises Monty with the gift of a new penguin friend named Mabel.The soundtrack was John Lennon\u0027s song Real Love, performed by Tom Odell.2013The £7million Disney-inspired advert told the story of a selfless hare who is determined to make sure his best friend, a bear, doesn\u0027t miss Christmas for once.The commercial features the tale of two good friends, a bear and a hare, who are sad at the thought of being separated for Christmas.The tale opens as winter is starting to draw in and the fun and excitement of preparing for Christmas begins.As the first snowflake falls and lands on the bear\u0027s nose, the hare starts to feel sad because he realises his friend will soon go off to hibernate, so – as usual - missing Christmas.While the bear is keen to join in, eventually he finds he cannot hold off his winter sleep any longer and disappears into his cave.Viewers see the bear fast asleep while all the other woodland creatures become excited about the big day to come.However, the hare is missing his friend and finds it increasingly difficult to join in the preparations until the moment he has a great idea for a very special present.He disappears off in to the wilderness to return with the gift – an alarm clock – which wakes the bear just in time to gather around a beautifully decorated tree to celebrate with all his friends.2012The Christmas ad, called The Journey, shows the extraordinary lengths to which some will go in their search for a gift for someone they love.The 90-second commercial opens in a family\u0027s snow-covered garden, with children happily making a snowman and snowwoman.When the snowman mysteriously disappears the next morning, the viewer is transported to a magical world, following him on an epic journey across river, mountain, road and city.The motive for the snowman\u0027s secret journey isn\u0027t revealed until the last scene, when he returns on Christmas morning with gifts for his wife.Newcomer Gabrielle Aplin sings The Power Of Love, the 1984 hit from Frankie Goes To Hollywood, as the soundtrack. 2011In 2011, the John Lewis advert showed a young boy so desperately excited about Christmas that he couldn\u0027t wait to give presents to his parents.It was accompanied by a cover of The Smiths\u0027 Please Please Let Me Get What I Want\u0027.2010And the 2010 offering saw iniduals choosing and wrapping their presents in the lead up to the big day, as Ellie Goulding sings a cover of Elton John\u0027s Your Song.Various people furtively hide the presents they\u0027ve carefully chosen: parents sneak a rocking horse upstairs while their children\u0027s backs are turned a mechanic struggles to wrap a spotted teapot and a small boy braves the snow in his dressing gown to hang a stocking outside his dog\u0027s kennel.2009This was the first of the store\u0027s Christmas campaigns created by advertising agency Adam \u0026amp Eve, now adam\u0026ampeveDDB, and the first to feature a musical cover by a current artist, on this occasion a Taken By Trees version of Sweet Child O\u0027 Mine by Guns N\u0027 Roses.The ad shows children opening gifts for adults including a laptop, coffee machine and handbag, followed by the tagline: \u0027Remember how Christmas used to feel? Give someone that feeling.\u00272008Culminating in the tagline: \u0027If you know the person, you\u0027ll find the present,\u0027 it shows a succession of characters followed by a matching gift.The soundtrack is a cover of The Beatles\u0027 From Me To You recorded for the campaign, with vocals by Matt Spinner, a member of the John Lewis IT department and its music society.2007The ad shows a group of people stacking a pile of potential gifts including a desktop lamp, a computer and a leather satchel in an empty room. The finished product ends up creating a shadow that looks like a woman walking her dog through the snow, accompanied by the tagline: \u0027Whoever you\u0027re looking for this Christmas.\u0027  "},{"url":null,"title":"Canadian man discovers lost interview Kurt Cobain 27 years later","story":"    Lost and found: A nearly never-been-heard 1991 interview with Nirvana legend Kurt Cobain has been uncovered after the cassette tape was boxed up for 27 years          Canadian physics teacher Roberto LoRusso (pictured left as a college student) was only 21 years old when he landed an interview with the then-hardly known Nirvana frontman before their concert in Toronto in 1991 \u0027It was before Nevermind was released, so they were a big deal to us in our little niche music scene, but in the greater market nobody knew much of them at that point,\u0027 said the Canadian physics teacher. \u0027My intention at the time was to simply get a phone interview.\u0027I harassed the record label reps on a weekly basis.

I was like, Sweet!\u0027          LoRusso, pictured far right in 1992, dabbled as a DJ on his university\u0027s student radio in the small town of London, Ontario          After playing a few snippets of the interview on his student station - to an audience of around 15 people - LoRusso (pictured in white) boxed up the cassette tape and left it gathering dust for the next 27 yearsWhen LoRusso asked him about his previous comments disparaging white rap artists, Cobain shot back: \u0027Oh, I don\u0027t know. Hmm, was I drunk at that time?\u0027I\u0027m a fan of rap music but most of it\u0027s so misogynist that I can\u0027t even deal with it. I\u0027m really not that much of a fan. I totally respect and love it because it\u0027s one of the only original forms of music that\u0027s been introduced. The white man doing rap is like watching a white man dance. We can\u0027t dance, we can\u0027t rap.\u0027When asked what the future held for him, the grunge icon gave a characteristically nihilistic response.\u0027Whatever, I don\u0027t know. Televisions out the window. Red snapper. Fire extinguishers. Sparklers, fireworks.\u0027LoRusso said this attitude was evident, despite the band being on the cusp of stardom.\u0027As I was talking with him, there was a little bit of laissez-faire, almost indifference to what was going on around him. I didn\u0027t quite understand it, I didn\u0027t get it,\u0027 said the teacher. \u0027Because you\u0027re signed to Geffen, you\u0027re on top of the indie world, you\u0027re creating the most relevant stuff to date. And he almost couldn\u0027t care less, or was so distracted by something else that he didn\u0027t really seem to be enjoying himself.\u0027At the time I dismissed that thought. I\u0027d just met the guy. But it was something that stuck with me. When he took his own life, it really made sense.\u0027It made me realize success doesn\u0027t mean anything if your world is chaos in your own mind. It\u0027s heartbreaking, he was a fantastic artist.\u0027Three years after the interview, on April 8, 1994, LoRusso was taking a seven-hour drive home from teachers college in Montreal when he heard on the radio that Cobain had been found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. He spent the rest of the drive listening to the world come to terms with the news.          He met Cobain before Nirvana\u0027s show in Toronto and explains he was \u0027woefully ill-prepared\u0027 but said the rock star was \u0027remarkably gracious and patient\u0027          Three years after the interview, on April 8, 1994, Cobain would take his own life, leaving behind wife Courtney Love and daughter Frances Bean Cobain (pictured left) \u0027I just remember the highway, and the Buick Regal that I was driving, and hearing the radio memorials on the scratchy indie radio station. I knew it was one of those moments I\u0027m going to remember forever.\u0027LoRusso says his encounter with Cobain put him on a trajectory towards his own love of music.He had a band in the 90s called Sanseiru and these days he plays drums for a band called Red Arms.Joe Perry, 68, of Aerosmith is released from the hospital...Rihanna, 50 Cent, Missy Elliot, and more pay tribute to...Share this articleHe also has his own solo dubnoisepunk project called Dead City Beat.LoRusso said he too has suffered from depression like Cobain, but the sense of purpose that teaching gives him has helped him maintain his mental health.\u0027The most important thing that someone can have is a sense of purpose. Without it, life becomes very difficult to live,\u0027 he said.\u0027It doesn\u0027t matter what resources you have, how popular you are or how great a musician you are, if you feel your life is meaningless it\u0027s a pretty dark place to be.

One of the first rooms of the exhibition pays homage to that film, which also featured Mickey’s sweetheart Minnie Mouse. A big steamboat takes center stage and comes equipped with a functioning ship’s wheel that can be whirled. Nearby is Steamboat Redux, which has two screens. One, on the left shows the original film, and, the other, on the right, shows artists reimagining its scenes.‘Took the original Steamboat Willie short, we chopped it up in about 35 scenes and we asked each animator or artist to be as graphically interpretative as they could,’ explained John T. Quinn, who produced and directed the Redux. ‘We used the original soundtrack, the original layout so that the film continuity holds together.’Quinn told DailyMail.com that it took about two and a half years to do the film, and many animators wanted the famous scene where Mickey is whistling. Included in the Redux film, he said, are many different types of animation: stop motion, hand-drawn on paper and computer, and CG or computer-generated.Ever since he was a kid, Quinn said he wanted to work for Disney as an artist, and now that he does, ‘it’s really a dream come true.

I use it a reference a lot in my work because it kind of embodies LA in many ways,’ she said, who lives in Los Angeles, and adding that she was so obsessed with Disney she considered working there as a princess - Snow White - for one of her first jobs.Superimposed on the bedroom scene is a shadow of the forest, she said, which adds a ‘little bit of darkness and mystery, which is a lot of what Disney is to me – it’s the light and dark and mystery.’ Near Papademetropoulous’ piece is Katherine Bernhardt’s mural called ‘99Cent Hot Dog.’‘It features Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse and hot dogs with mustard,’ Bernhardt said. ‘I did that because I like humor in art and I think hot dogs are funny.’Bernhardt usually does paintings but was excited to do a mural, which was painted directly on the wall using house paint.

The sketches are out of the archives for the first time and were animated. A giant replica of the sorcerer hat that Mickey puts on during the film and where people can stand under is one of the many photo opportunities throughout the exhibition.After indulging in brooms and wizard’s caps, the next room has a different type of nostalgia to luxuriate in: the Mickey Mouse Club. The show has gone through many iterations, and, depending on your age, a visitor may yearn for Annette Funicello, part of the original show from the 1950s, or the many stars - Britney Spears, Justin Timberlake, Keri Russell and Ryan Gosling – from the All-New Mickey Mouse Club that started airing in 1989 until 1994.Romanelli, the curator, said: ‘Those were such important years, you know, being a teenager and not wanting to grow out of being a kid but also wanting to.’He laughed and added: ‘It was definitely an important chapter for me. We have a Mickey Mouse Club room where we recreated the 90s set to a tee so for anybody in my age demo that walks in that room, it should resonate.’Monitors placed around the set show a young Spears and Timberlake singing and dancing their out heart.Also in that room is an intriguing artwork by Brian Bress. Romanelli explained that Bress drew Mickey Mouse 2,000 times, then built a suit for himself covered in those drawings. The video, titled ‘Exactly (Mickey Mouse),’ shows a white piece of paper drawn with black and white Mickey figures. Bress, who is dressed in a suit that matches that foreground, cuts pieces out of it, revealing him in the background. It is artwork that is ever shifting and constantly changing.           Pictured above is Keith Haring\u0027s 1981 \u0027Untitled (Mickey Mouse).\u0027 Haring, who died in 1990, is known for his pop art that included chalk outlines drawn on New York City subways.

The torch and the face will be highlights of the new $100 million museum, which is scheduled to open in May 2019."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/11/16/15/4786552600000578-0-image-m-10_1542380481074.jpg","title":"Former aide says Labour MPs drove house claims Russian speeding car","story":"    Dr Christian DeFeo, pictured with his wife, told the Old Bailey that the MP had driven to his house alone when she claims a Russian man was behind the wheel, the court heardOnasanya is accused of plotting with her brother Festus Onasanya to claim that a Russian man was behind the wheel of her Nissan Micra when it was clocked doing 41mph in a 30mph zone on The Causeway near Thornley in Cambridgeshire at around 10pm on July 24 last year.Engineer, 57, is CLEARED of assaulting \u0027drunk\u0027 lawyer who...Brexit deal battle comes between married Tory MPs as Jack...Former aide says Labour MP drove to his house alone on night...DUP \u0027could pull the plug\u0027 on deal to prop the Tories up in...Share this articleThe court was told about an email exchange between Onasanya and Dr DeFeo, arranging to meet on the same day.Asked what time she was there, the witness said: \u0027I cannot say a specific time, however she arrived late and was there quite late because we offered her a bed to stay the night.\u0027She arrived in her car. She arrived alone. She pulled up her car in front of our house. I greeted her at the door.\u0027           Festus Onasanya also used a similar ‘method’ involving fake driver details, when he was caught speeding on June 17 and August 23 last yearDr DeFeo said Onasanya, his wife and himself spent no less than two hours discussing the \u0027nitty gritty\u0027 of a charity lease in his living room.They were there together throughout apart from the occasional \u0027loo breaks\u0027 and his wife going into the kitchen to prepare a \u0027hot lemon squash\u0027. The Peterborough MP allegedly conspired with her brother Festus to offload the blame when her Nissan Micra was caught speeding in July last year.Jurors were told that Mr Onasanya, 33, a singer from Chesterton, Cambridge, used a similar \u0027method\u0027 involving fake driver details, when he was caught speeding on June 17 and August 23 last year.He has already pleaded guilty at the Old Bailey  to perverting the course of justice in relation to the incidents, as well as to the charge incident involving his sister.Miss Onasanya, a former solicitor who is now a Labour whip responsible for party discipline, deliberately gave police false details so they could not trace the real driver, jurors at the Old Bailey were told.The investigation was triggered when the MP\u0027s Nissan Micra was detected driving at 41mph in a 30mph zone at 10.03pm on July 24 last year in Thorney, Cambridgeshire.The MP, who had risen for Parliament\u0027s summer recess several days earlier, replied to a notice of intended prosecution (NIP) naming Mr Antipow as the driver.Officers became suspicious when they unsuccessfully tried to contact Mr Antipow, and found that the address and phone number on the document were false.The court heard how analysis of records for Miss Onasanya\u0027s two mobile phones placed her in the area where the speeding offence took place.Prosecutor David Jeremy said: \u0027Mr Antipow does exist, but he was not driving Ms Onasanya\u0027s car.\u0027 Miss Onasanya became \u0027trapped in a number of lies\u0027 when she decided to \u0027adopt her brother\u0027s method of evading prosecution\u0027, jurors were told.Mr Jeremy said: \u0027This case did start as an offence of speeding. It has become, as a result of the choices made by Miss Onasanya, a case about lying.\u0027Lying persistently and deliberately, lying all the way to this court and, it may be, even lying in this court. Lying in a way that has had to be coordinated with lies told by her brother.\u0027Mr Antipow was connected to the siblings due to living in a property that they rented in Chesterton for several months in 2016.Investigators found that Mr Onasanya had previously lived at the false address for Mr Antipow that was provided on the prosecution notice, while its occupants are said to be linked to him.A phone number supposedly belonging to the Russian was traced back to a company called IT Fleet Automotive, where Mr Onasanya worked as a self-employed delivery driver, it was claimed.When the original prosecution letter to Mr Antipow was returned to police due to the incorrect address, officers wrote to the MP in September asking her to clarify the details.When another NIP letter was sent to Mr Antipow and again received no response, investigators repeatedly failed in their attempts to get hold of Miss Onasanya.She told investigators in November that Mr Antipow had filled in his own details on the returned speeding form.When the MP eventually agreed to attend a voluntary interview at Bedford police headquarters on January 2 this year, she refused to answer questions.Mr Jeremy said: \u0027What a shame she did not tell the truth from the beginning\u0027.\u0027By this time Miss Onasanya would have known that she and her brother had a problem - that the speeding allegations had not gone away and been fobbed off using Festus\u0027s method.\u0027Miss Onasanya denies one count of perverting the course of justice. The trial continues.  "},{"url":null,"title":"Vegetarians mad Costas new Christmas Toastie doesnt clearly mention contains meat","story":"    The \u0027Ultimate Christmas Toastie with sweet cranberry sauce on cheese topped bread\u0027\u0027Calm\u0027 Costa knifeman is pictured being arrested by police...Share this articleThe two meats are disclosed is in the ingredients list on the back of the packaging - which is removed and thrown out by staff to heat up the toastie.But Costa say that in addition, the toastie sits in the fridge aligned with its product label which clearly indicates it contains pork and turkey.But some vegatarians are furious and complain that they have been physically sick after being lulled by the labelling and tucked into the toastie because all of the fillings aren\u0027t made clear on the front label. On November 11, Nazya Fiaz Tweeted a photo of the toastie from the front, after purchasing it in a Costa branch in Shipley, West Yorks.Nazya wrote: \u0027Major labelling issues.

The cheese and cranberry one looked good and I had it heated up.\u0027It tasted a little odd, but I assumed there was a sauce or chutney included which was not disclosed.\u0027I have been a vegetarian for over 11 years and didn\u0027t even think it could be meat. I have little memory of what it tastes like.\u0027Eventually it dawned on me that something was wrong and I went back to the fridge to check.\u0027She added: \u0027The fridge label had no mention of meat but when I picked up one of the toasties and decided to check the ingredients, I felt sick.\u0027There is a reason I stopped eating meat and knowing that I ate even just a bit of it made me feel uncomfortable.\u0027I couldn\u0027t get my head around it. All I could taste and smell was the toastie, which I now knew was meat.\u0027When I told the barista who served me, he said it wasn\u0027t the first time and that he had raised it with the manager.\u0027He said he often even points it out to customers because he agreed it was misleading.\u0027Later that night I was sick for about four hours. After so many years, my stomach obviously did not agree with it and I felt awful all night.\u0027A spokesman for Costa said: \u0027This product is clearly labelled and states on the back of the pack and on the fridge display that the toastie contains turkey and pork.\u0027All our pre-packaged food contains nutritional information, including allergens, and our fridge labels reference products that are suitable for vegetarians.\u0027All product information is available online and in store.\u0027We would always encourage customers that are unsure to have a discussion with a member of the store team, who will have been advised on how to help customers make informed choices.\u0027Costa later added: \u0027We’d like to apologise to customers for any confusion caused.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Vigilante mob overnight ARMY 1 000 new recruits join ranks","story":"    Two of the organisers of the We Stand Together group in Birmingham.

Otherwise they are sued,’ Block continues. ‘There are private security firms that pressure workers not to talk to strangers. They control their social media accounts and there are all kinds of reprisals. It took us quite a while to get in touch with the workers. We collected all the information to get a bigger picture about what is going on there.‘But when we eventually did it (in collaboration with local students) we were surprised how proud many of them were to do this job. They told us: Without us social media would be a complete mess. On the other hand many of them silently suffer from the impact the work has on their mental health. After a very long period of research, in which we built up a relationship of trust with the workers, we worked together with our protagonists of the film to find out how to make a film about this work.’The process of securing the participation of such workers – men and women with firsthand knowledge of how the system works – was one that had to be carefully orchestrated. Riesewieck tells DailyMail.com how colleagues were secretly ‘photographed while talking to possible subjects and then the photo was sent to all the employees in order to threaten them in case they were willing to talk to us.‘The offices are protected by airport scanners at the doors and surveilled by private security firms who sometimes even control the private social media behavior of the workers - just to make sure they are not in touch with journalists. So we really needed to find creative ways how to make a film about this completely hidden work.‘We eventually did by finding an abandoned office of this very type of work in a business district of Manila with all the typical work stations still inside where we could invite our subjects in order to learn more about their work. This protected space made it possible for them to share experiences about their traumatizing work and their feelings, in which way they are affected and so on.’          \u0027Cleaners\u0027 are not employed directly by tech giants such as Facebook or Twitter - which have been the subject of congressional hearings in the US exploring their practices - but rather by other companies - and the well-known social media platforms are often given code namesThe content moderators are affected in vastly different ways some are proud and see their role as guardians, while others are deeply affected, such as the formerly innocent devout Catholic who finds it hard to get images of male genitalia out of her head. The film also includes the story of one moderator specializing in images of self-harm he repeatedly asked to be transferred but was denied, and he ended up taking his own life.The pitfalls of the job are, clearly, manifold.But The Cleaners also explores the wider societal implications of their work. Sanitizing content means that images of war and violence – such as bombings in Syria – are often designated as terrorist-related, deleted and kept from online audiences, preventing them from being fully informed.Abdulwahab Tahhan, who works with the NGO Airwars, laments in the film how summarily deleting such content hinders the efforts of his organization – and prevents global citizens from receiving vital information.‘Without our work, the armies or the governments would have a straight pass without anybody challenging them,’ he says in The Cleaners. ‘There would be, I think, more civilians getting killed there would be less closure we would not be able to know what’s going on. These videos are needed. These videos are part of the war. They provide information they provide evidence for the future.‘But the problem is, these videos are quite often classified as ISIS videos. It’s been seen that this is very graphic, so they get deleted. Now the censorship that’s taking place on YouTube, it’s affecting a lot of organizations.’The cultural, educational and political backgrounds of the content moderators inherently affects what’s deleted and what’s allowed to remain without context, it’s wildly difficult for such workers to make informed decisions about images and footage.    Some content moderators are proud and believe their work helps keep the Internet from being a \u0027complete mess\u0027 others have suffered mentally and emotionally from being forced to view images that include beheadings, assaults and other atrocities - with the film even telling the story of one moderator who took his own life          Filmmaker Block tells DailyMail.com: ‘Most of the billions of people in the world who use social media don’t have any clue who does the clean-up-work for them. Most of us take it for granted we don’t have to see videos of beheadings, rape or torture in our newsfeeds. We don’t know there are thousands of young workers in the developing world who sacrifice themselves in order to keep us “safe” and provide us with a “healthy environment” when we go online\u0027          Directors Moritz Riesewieck, left, and Hans Block went to great lengths not only to obtain interviews but also to protect \u0027cleaners\u0027 - even offering them access to a psychologistWithout comment or judgement, a few examples are woven into the film. The devout Catholic content moderator deletes any images of nudity, period. A moderator deleted the award-winning Vietnam War photo depicting a naked young girl running from a napalm attack – because it showed an unclothed minor. Another moderator deleted an image he believed to be a young child killed in a flood accident – when, in reality, it was an image of a toddler victim of the Syrian conflict, likely a drowned refugee.Artist Kahled Barakeh had posted that photo and others on facebook to highlight the atrocities in his native country – only for the post to be deleted after three days.‘There was no explanation,’ he says in the film. ‘I tried to, in every possible way, to be in touch, but it was impossible … Sometimes I try to think about it: Who decides what is the policy of Facebook? I would love to meet these people, know who they are – because by logic, their background, who they are, it affects how they think. That child didn’t die out of a normal situation.’Such harsh realities should be shared on social media, he says, because ‘we should keep disturbing the world’.The documentary hammers home the point that major companies, and not just the content moderators, should be facing major ethical and procedural questions.‘A decision about what constitutes terror content is a really context-based decision,’ says Nicole Wong, a former policy maker at Google and Twitter – and former deputy US chief technology officer under President Obama – who was interviewed by the filmmakers.‘It may show up on one platform as a true threat, and it may show up on another platform as news or as satire or criticism commenting on a piece of content … it’s hard to know whether something should be removed or not.’Rhymes with \u0027Zuck\u0027: Jim Carrey slams Mark Zuckerberg after...Mother whose \u0027beautiful and smiley\u0027 teenage son was driven...Google wants to put a virtual assistant in every room of the...Share this articleThe Cleaners interviews former executives from major companies such as Facebook and Google – but it proved veritably impossible to get current employees to talk, the filmmakers tell DailyMail.com.‘From the beginning, we wanted to involve Silicon Valley executives in our film to discuss the issue of global networks and how to handle the moderation process of the platforms,’ Block tells DailyMail.com. ‘It would be so easy to blame or insult the social media for all their mistakes. But we never did. Much more, we wanted to encourage an open dialogue to think about the problem of the global network.‘But getting in contact with the executives of the big social media companies wasn\u0027t any easier as there is this code of silence in Silicon Valley. None of the employees of Facebook or Google talks about what\u0027s happening inside. We contacted several dozens of people and never got an answer. We\u0027ve even sent the final cut of our film to all the major companies and asked for a public statement. There was no response either.‘When we tried to promote the film in Germany and France via social media, we got the message after a short time that the trailer violated the community guidelines and was deleted. Sad but true! Intransparency is one of the main characteristics of the companies. That was very annoying and upsetting.‘Eventually we got in touch with some of the former representatives of Facebook and Google YouTubeTwitter. Many of the former representatives regret that they helped to build technology with so many terrible effects.’The power struggle with inidual governments, as well, is investigated by the film, which touches upon censorship in countries such as Turkey and issues with information spread in places like Myanmar – where most people get all of their news from platforms such as Facebook and are arguably less able to distinguish between fact and fiction. That reality contributes to major problems such as genocide and marginalization, with The Cleaners pointing out that Facebook has been used to promote hatred of the ethnic minority Rohingya people in Myanmar.  The film interviews former Google and Twitter executive Nicole Wong, left, who went on to be US  deputy chief technology officer under President Barack Obama - as well as activist Abdulwahab Tahhan, with NGO Airwars, who believes blocked content of bombings and other violence in Syria is hampering efforts by organizations such as his that are trying to show the world what is really going on. Tahhan says: \u0027We should keep disturbing the world\u0027          Artist Khaled Bakareh is also interviewed in the film he posted photos on Facebook of children killed during the Syria conflict, only to see them removed days later. He says: \u0027Sometimes I try to think about it: Who decides what is the policy of Facebook? I would love to meet these people, know who they are – because by logic, their background, who they are, it affects how they think\u0027But the documentary makers themselves also had to struggle with what they should and shouldn’t show in the film.Riesewieck explains how they ‘decided only to show a tiny part of the disturbing content itself and whenever possible rather to show the reactions of the content moderators on the content. It is clearly not our aim to shock the audience.‘But in cases like with the war in Syria we still need to ask ourselves what gives us the right not to be disturbed by the human victims of this terrible war which so many countries worldwide are included in. We want to make awareness that the so called “healthy environment” on social media comes at a huge price: A very perfidious mental abuse of young low wage workers in the developing world and the loss of a lot of ambivalent, challenging, eye-opening material.’The filmmakers made a psychologist available to the content moderators they interviewed, and they hope that their final product prompts thought and discussion among social media users, platforms and governments alike. Their film focuses on an aspect of the Internet that is rarely discussed or investigated – or thought about by the billions using social media every day for information and communication.‘What was really surprising was, how many grey areas remain despite the guidelines the content moderators have to follow,’ Riesewieck tells DailyMail.com. ‘Content moderators told us they don\u0027t dare to forward every second case in which they feel unsure about which guideline to apply or how to recognize the context of a picture or video and therefore just use their gut feelings.‘According to several different content moderators in Manila there is a golden rule everybody has to learn in their three to five-day-training for the job: “Don\u0027t overthink!” Just think about the consequences for activists, civil rights organizations, minorities and others if their content is deleted from Facebook, Youtube, Twitter just because a young low wage worker didn\u0027t know about the context and purpose of the post and intuitively got it wrong.’His co-director says: ‘Most of the billions of people in the world who use social media don’t have any clue who does the clean-up-work for them. Most of us take it for granted we don’t have to see videos of beheadings, rape or torture in our newsfeeds. We don’t know there are thousands of young workers in the developing world who sacrifice themselves in order to keep us safe and provide us with a healthy environment when we go online. \u0027At the same time, hundreds of thousands of newsworthy pictures and videos disappear every single day without our notice. A lot of iniduals as well as whole groups of our societies are secretly silenced with huge effects on our democracy.‘We all should question the power social media has on all of us and become much more aware of the impact it has on today\u0027s societies and all our minds. Instead of just passively consuming the net and allowing a few companies to dictate the rules for our digital public we should claim a much more participative, erse net - in the hands of the public.’‘We should become aware about how social media has hacked our desire to be loved by making us seek likes with every post we make. And by constantly asking us what we think about this and that people have familiarized with the idea of constantly having opinions. All these triggers and nudges make us produce more and more content in order to keep the level of positive feedback. The first step to limit the addiction to these technologies and dealing with them in a more mindful and meaningful way is becoming aware about those effects on our minds and on behavior.’"},{"url":null,"title":"How stars rallied round comedian Dudley Moore outpouring love","story":"Dudley Moore at the Mayfair Hotel with eleven beautiful, bikini-clad young women, coming from Denmark, Germany, Austria and England, in 1966, before the International Beauty ContestI was blown away by the response. Over the next four months, letters poured in from all over the world, bearing loving messages and words of comfort to the man who’d given them so much pleasure through his music and humour.Some — like those from Emma Thompson, Billy Joel and Phil Collins (who wrote a three-page fan letter) — were from people who didn’t know him personally but wanted to be part of a massive outpouring of affection for him.Among them was a parody, by Paul McCartney, of The Beatles hit When I’m Sixty-Four a caricature of Dudley with ribald comments from the Rolling Stones scribbled around his face and loving notes from Elton John, Bette Midler, Whoopi Goldberg, Jack Lemmon, Mel Brooks, Michael Caine, Neil Simon and hundreds more.Some tried to make him smile. ‘Many happy returns from someone who is just over a year older (and still slightly taller),’ wrote Alan Bennett, while Billy Joel confided: ‘I’m not much taller than you and I think I understand how uncomfortable it can be carrying an oversized set of b***s on such short legs.’          Having appeared in the film Ten in 1978, above, he’d been surprised to be offered a cameo role in Barbra Streisand’s romantic comedy, The Mirror Has Two Faces. This would be Dudley’s chance to remind people of the talents that once made him the toast of HollywoodDuring all this time, I was bombarded by calls from concerned friends. ‘I didn’t know he was ill,’ Kelsey Grammer fretted. ‘What’s wrong with him?’ It was a question that nobody could answer.American musician-producer Quincy Jones rang me one night after I’d started to run a bath. For 15 minutes he talked about the magic of Dudley, his wonderful spirit and how much he loved him. I spent the next half-hour mopping the flood in my bathroom.By the time I’d assembled all the letters, they filled two massive albums, which I packaged and sent to Dudley. He was overwhelmed. ‘I found it enormously touching,’ he told me. ‘I thought it was extraordinary that they would write me letters that expressed their feelings about me. Such a surprise. It was amazing.‘It gave me some encouragement to think a bit more pleasantly about myself, and to think more positively about myself.’The first sign of a problem had come on the first day of shooting of Dudley’s final film. It was the mid-Nineties, and his triumphs in Arthur and 10 were far behind him. So he’d been surprised to be offered a cameo role in Barbra Streisand’s romantic comedy, The Mirror Has Two Faces. This would be Dudley’s chance to remind people of the talents that once made him the toast of Hollywood. Except it didn’t turn out that way.As the cameras rolled, he found he simply couldn’t remember his lines. Even writing them on giant cue cards wasn’t helping, because he was finding it hard to focus. Afterwards, Dudley retreated to his trailer, so upset that he refused to have any lunch. ‘Something is happening to me and I don’t know what,’ he told journalist and friend Rena Fruchter and me.          Dudley Moore, centre, in Blame in on the Bellboy in 1992. By the time I’d assembled all the letters for his birthday just a few years later, they filled two massive albums, which I packaged and sent to Dudley. He was overwhelmedRena and I thought we knew the answer. Nicole Rothschild had happened to him, and the once irrepressible Dudley, who lit up rooms with his warmth and raucous laughter, was increasingly sinking into depression.As it turned out, we were only partially right. Half his age, Nicole had met him a few years earlier through the simple stratagem of stopping him in the street and begging for his autograph. Never able to resist an attractive woman, Dudley plunged into an affair.His latest leggy girlfriend was eight inches taller than him and came loaded with problems. While still married to her first husband, she’d gone through a bigamous marriage with Charles Cleveland, a self-confessed drug addict, and had two children with him.          Dudley Moore with his wife, Nicole Rothschild, and their baby, born in 1995. Buckling down for the first time to do up to six hours of practice a day, he’d blossomed into a critically acclaimed concert pianist —admired by, among others, the great conductor Sir Georg Solti and the violinist Itzhak PerlmanSo obsessed was Dudley with his new lover that he helped the couple financially throughout their ‘marriage’. Then, when Nicole decided to leave Cleveland, he bought her a house around the corner from his home in California, and gave her a 20,000-dollar sports car and a monthly allowance.That wasn’t all: he continued supporting her ex-husband, who was now HIV positive, and their two children. Plus he bought cars for both Cleveland and Nicole’s sister, and a flat in Las Vegas for Cleveland’s mother.If that seemed outrageously philanthropic, Dudley’s friends knew it was typical behaviour. He’d always taken on responsibility for the families of long-term girlfriends or wives, just as he’d always insisted on having the freedom to sleep around.          Classical musician Rena Fruchter with Moore in Washington. In his final years, he lived with her along with her partner Brian DallowSo despite his infatuation with Nicole, he was still enjoying the company of other women, among them Quincy Jones’s daughter Jolie. Why did he stay with Nicole?Their relationship became ‘a union created in hell’, as one of his friends described it.No one could understand the dynamics that kept them together, because they were such opposites. While Dudley was meticulous and rational, Nicole was volatile, often irrational and as changeable as the English weather.These differences triggered endless fights, often resulting in Dudley — all 5ft 2½in of him — emerging scratched and bruised. Somehow they always kissed and made up.Eventually Nicole persuaded him to marry her. First he had to get his lawyers to track down her first husband and get that marriage annulled, as Nicole had married Cleveland without an annulment.Soon she was pregnant with their son, Nicholas. Dudley, however, felt trapped in a cycle of abuse, remorse and apology — yet strangely helpless to do anything about it.The night before he forgot his lines on Streisand’s new movie, Nicole had rung him several times in the early hours. She announced that she was moving the household to Telluride, a small mountain town in Colorado, where Dudley had already given in to her latest whim and put down a deposit on another home.Little wonder that he was distracted. He’d already arranged to move there with Nicole her phone calls were because she didn’t want to wait until he returned to LA a week later — she wanted to move immediately. She was a very impulsive woman.‘I just want to play the piano and have everyone leave me alone,’ he said despairingly to Rena, herself a renowned pianist.          Dudley Moore and Peter Cook in 1993. ‘I don’t visualise myself at concerts, and I’m not obsessed by images of myself at the piano,’ he said. ‘You get used to the idea of saying: “Goodbye, goodbye, practical world…”In a break from filming, Dudley flew back to California, determined to commit all his lines to memory. But he wasn’t surprised when his agent rang a few days later to report that Streisand was cutting him loose from the film.Still puzzled by his sudden memory problems, Dudley decided to have some medical tests. Having ruled out every common brain disorder, however, his doctors pronounced themselves mystified.Dudley’s only obvious problem seemed to be the continuing turmoil in his personal life. It would be another two years before doctors were finally able to diagnose what was really wrong with him.Instrument of war: Violin built by hero soldier, who was...Share this articleDudley’s amazing facility to switch between acting, comedy, writing film scores and playing jazz had already made him one of the most versatile and multi-faceted performers of our time.In mid-life, he’d also developed another major talent. Buckling down for the first time to do up to six hours of practice a day, he’d blossomed into a critically acclaimed concert pianist —admired by, among others, the great conductor Sir Georg Solti and the violinist Itzhak Perlman.          Cook and Moore in Goodbye Again. For too long, Dudley realised, he’d been too wrapped up in his personal life. Now it was time to take care of himself and focus on his workMore recently, spurred on and tutored by Rena, he’d mastered Grieg’s Piano Concerto, which was released as a CD. Despite Dudley’s love of acting and comedy, it was music that gave him the most fulfilment. For him, it was the more visceral art, the one through which he became emotionally recharged.As his old music tutor, Peter Cork, observed: ‘What is incredible is how he does brilliantly with one career then opens up in another. But in the end it comes back to the one thing that was always the most overwhelming — his music.’After the Streisand debacle, however, Dudley seemed almost to have given up. Now living in Telluride, surrounded by the chaos of Nicole’s family, he abandoned his daily piano practice.He’d lost confidence, believing he no longer had a place in the world of entertainment. ‘I know it’s sad because I have so much to give,’ he told me, ‘but I’ve tried to come back and people don’t like what I do. I’m resigned to that.’Rena was alarmed. They’d been booked to perform some concerts together, so she flew out from New York several times to see him.Gently, she encouraged him back to the keyboard and managed to rekindle his passion. Over time, it became clear Dudley depended on her for the security that was otherwise lacking in his life.Nicole had been up to her usual antics. On one of her whims, she decided to open a shop selling children’s clothes and furniture, and Dudley had paid 60,000 dollars for the merchandise.Then, two months after he moved to Colorado, she decided they should go back to California. The shop never opened.After settling back into the two homes in LA’s Marina del Rey — his and hers — they resumed their pattern of blistering rows and abuse. There was yet more turmoil when Dudley discovered that his business manager had misappropriated several million dollars of his savings.In an effort to raise money, Dudley tried to sell the flat he’d bought for Nicole’s ex-husband’s mother. The woman promptly sued him.Eventually, he paid her $25,000 to leave, even though — thanks to his kindness — she’d lived for several years at the flat for free.          Dudley Moore pictured with Peter Cook in Sherlock Holmes: The Hound of the Baskervilles in 1978. Though he had feared a diagnosis of a degenerative brain disease, known as PSP, for Dudley it was almost a reliefWith hindsight it was obvious that some of the early signs had been his trouble with remembering lines on Streisand’s film set.In October 1999, I visited Dudley in New Jersey, where he’d been living with Rena’s family — who helped care for him — for two years. The house next door had come up for sale and he’d immediately snapped it up. Rena’s daughter had just moved in to help him and he’d also hired a cookhousekeeper.The next few days were heart-wrenching as I saw the full devastation of Dudley’s illness. His speech had become slurred and his balance unsteady he would often stumble while walking or climbing stairs, and had a tendency to fall backwards.On top of that, his eyesight had become impaired. He was having trouble focusing and was suffering from double vision. Taking part in conversation had become difficult. Sometimes he’d begin expressing a thought but would lose the thread before he could get it all out.It was frustrating and enervating, and he found it easier to listen than to participate. ‘I’m trapped inside this body,’ he’d tell me. ‘It feels as if I have something on the tip of my tongue but I can’t quite get at it. I start to say something, but by the time I’ve said it, the rest of the thought has disappeared.’I noticed he had three grand pianos in the house as well as the upright he’d learned on as a child — but he played only when no one was around.He felt tremendous gratitude towards Rena and her husband Brian. ‘They are remarkable,’ he told me. ‘They’re like the family I’ve never had. I feel very comfortable here. Life is very quiet, nice and extremely supportive.’Later, as Rena drove us home from lunch at a restaurant — a daily ritual — Dudley played his Songs Without Words CD. His eyes filled with tears as we listened to his evocative score from the film Six Weeks, arguably his most outstanding composition.These days, he spent a great deal of time playing his own music, he said. Now that he could no longer play properly, listening had become his substitute.He even watched his own movies, laughing at himself. It was the first time in his life that he’d felt able to sit back and genuinely appreciate his work.‘I don’t visualise myself at concerts, and I’m not obsessed by images of myself at the piano,’ he said. ‘You get used to the idea of saying: “Goodbye, goodbye, practical world…”‘But there are regrets. It’s very hurtful to realise that one can’t function in the same way ever again. So I just listen to my old records and feel it’s something unachievable by today’s standards, but it was achievable in the past.’ Before leaving, I asked if he’d play for me one last time. To my delight, he launched into his exquisite Six Weeks score. No, it didn’t sound the same. But when he couldn’t sustain the classical sound, he suddenly transformed it into a moment of glorious improvised jazz.          Moore, right, with Peter Cook, left. Moore spent a great deal of time playing his own music, he said. Now that he could no longer play properly, listening had become his substituteKnowing that Bach and Ravel had written music specifically for the left hand, I asked him if he’d consider playing in public again.He shook his head. ‘It’s not my bag. It’s maddening as it’s the one thing that I really regret saying goodbye to — the ability to play with two hands — but it’s impossible to get the hands together to play the right speed.’At the end of my three-day stay, Dudley gave me a long, tight hug, his face puckered into that familiar boyish, pixie smile.In his own way, he continued to fight back against his illness. He compiled a CD with Rena of a legendary concert he’d performed in 1992 at the Royal Albert Hall.And with great courage, he agreed to give a charity performance in Philadelphia that November, in which he and Julie Andrews narrated American poet Ogden Nash’s Carnival Of The Animals.With the help of his speech therapist, Dudley worked assiduously on the narration for several weeks. He was ecstatic to be facing an audience again — and they responded on the night with a standing ovation.During his final few years, he was wrapped in the loving, protective cocoon provided by Rena’s family.Life settled into a routine filled with speech and physical therapy, daily excursions to local restaurants, rented movies every evening, holidays at the family’s Nova Scotia hideaway and even a week’s cruise to Bermuda.With them, Dudley was at last able to find the peace and contentment that had eluded him for so much of his life.In the autumn of 2001, despite his increasingly frail condition, he came to Britain to receive a CBE from Prince Charles, who spent several minutes speaking with him. Afterwards, he caught up with old friends, including his first wife Suzy Kendall.When he said goodbye to them all, he knew it was for the last time.

Their home was always filled with music and laughter. Tessa would be devastated to know that it had caused such heartache.’When Tessa died in a nursing home in January 2011, the 98-year-old widow was childless and left her bungalow, filled with jazz records, film posters and celebrity photographs, to the nephew she regarded as the closest thing she had to a son.But this act of love, set out in a will the socialite made a couple of years before her death, marked the beginning of a legal nightmare which, until a judge stepped in this week, almost saw mild-mannered Martin deprived of his inheritance.          Martin remembers being so beguiled by Tessa\u0027s (pictured) beauty that ‘if she smiled at me, I was so overawed that I’d hide behind the sofa’After Tessa’s death, the home-made will was mislaid and so her estate was not formally admitted to probate, the legal process by which a person’s estate is dealt with after their death. Martin had no idea that this legal state of limbo placed him in a precarious position.Unfortunately, her empty £500,000 home caught the attention of heir hunter Andrew Fraser, who has appeared on the BBC series Heir Hunters, a programme documenting the work of those who devote their lives to tracing beneficiaries.In a move that will strike fear into the hearts of families across Britain, Fraser obtained legal control of Mrs Amstell’s estate after being employed by a local authority to track down beneficiaries, changed the locks at her house and, despite being told of the existence of a will, was just days from selling it at auction when he was stopped by an 11th-hour injunction.It was only this week, after a protracted legal battle, that a judge ordered Fraser to hand the keys to Mrs Amstell’s beloved home to her nephew and to foot a legal bill said to amount to around £130,000.‘For the past two years, it’s been like having a sewer rat sinking its teeth into my neck and not letting go,’ says Martin when we meet in a local hotel. ‘It’s been terribly stressful, but I knew I was in the right and I was determined not to give in.’In a tweed jacket, smart shirt and tie, Martin is charming and solicitous. But his passion is evident when he dwells on the consequences of the heir-hunting industry. ‘I felt so strongly about fighting this. If I hadn’t had the money to fight it, I would almost certainly have caved in.Murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi WAS ordered by Saudi...\u0027He\u0027s a Duchy Original!\u0027: Queen pays warm tribute to Charles...Share this article‘What really preys on my mind is that people like this get away with it most of the time.‘If this is what happens when you tell someone there is a will, and they choose not to mention it to the court, then it’s likely this is being done by other firms. Something needs to be done.’So how on earth did such a horrendous situation arise — especially given that Mrs Amstell not only signed a will, but had it witnessed by two people?Aside from the upset this case has caused, it shines a spotlight on concerns about how local authorities use heir-hunting firms to deal with empty properties and those who die without a will. Such arrangements offer huge profits to the heir hunters, who track down potential beneficiaries in return for a slice of the inheritance.          Heir hunter Andrew Fraser outside Central London County Court during hearing in dispute with Martin AmstellBut legal experts warn that the involvement of the unregulated probate research industry is leading to massive overcharging and estates being awarded to the wrong relatives.Mrs Amstell, however, not only made a will in February 2009, but when she put her signature to the two-sided single page she did so with such vigour that the ink from her fountain pen bled through the paper. The document, which was drawn up by another family member using a will-writing guide, was commended in court this week for being ‘a model of simplicity and clarity rarely seen these days’.Having moved into a nursing home several years earlier, she left the house, which she hoped would remain in the family, to Martin and the remainder of her estate — £130,000 in cash and assets — to 22 different animal charities.‘The first she mentioned leaving her home to me was two or three years before she died,’ Martin recalls. ‘She said, “I want you to have the bungalow.” The next time I saw her she said she was sorry for being a “soppy old sausage” but some time after that she spoke about drawing up the will.’          After Tessa’s death, Martin and his sister might have been expected to apply for probate so Tessa’s wishes could be carried out. But, he explains, with homes of their own, they were in no rush to actAlthough Martin wasn’t present when the will was signed, it was witnessed by his older sister Marion, who was named executor, and by one of Mrs Amstell’s oldest family friends. Photocopies were made and, along with the original, stored at Marion’s home.When Tessa died peacefully in January 2011, Martin, who is unmarried, his sister and her children were the only mourners at Bushey Jewish Cemetery, Hertfordshire, where she was laid to rest alongside her husband, who had died in December 2005.After Tessa’s death, he and his sister might have been expected to apply for probate so Tessa’s wishes could be carried out. But, he explains, with homes of their own, they were in no rush to act.The bungalow had already been empty for years because Tessa (born Toba Gembitsky in 1912) and Billy had moved into a nursing home together in the late Nineties, when they were both in their 80s.          Mrs Amstell\u0027s husband, jazz musician Barnet \u0027Billy\u0027 Amstell (pictured)The couple, who met at Pinewood Studios while working on the film Kicking The Moon Around and married in 1938, refused to sell the two-bedroom property and left it in the care of Martin’s sister.‘It was like a ghost house,’ says Martin. ‘It was exactly as they had left it with all their belongings.’As Tessa’s attorney, Marion had handled her aunt’s financial affairs for several years, arranging for money to be paid from Tessa’s bank account to cover nursing fees and paying gas and electricity bills. She made regular visits to the bungalow to sort the post.‘I wasn’t thinking about selling the bungalow even though I wasn’t going to live in it’, says Martin. ‘I didn’t know what I was going to do with it, but it never occurred to me that someone would try to take it from me.’ With the benefit of hindsight, he wishes they had acted sooner.There was an added complication because Marion, who is now 85, could not immediately lay her hands on the will. She had moved house between the drawing-up of the document and Tessa’s death, and couldn’t recall where she had placed it among the mountains of paperwork and boxes of books she and her family had accumulated. Not long after Tessa’s death, her own health deteriorated when she suffered a stroke.‘I didn’t want to put pressure on her,’ says Martin. ‘I didn’t see it as an urgent problem. Of course I regret it now. What has happened is a lesson in how not to do these things. I was incredibly naive.’Problems began when Tessa’s empty bungalow came to the attention of Brent Council, though it’s not known how. They contacted Andrew Fraser, of Fraser and Fraser, a London-based family firm of international probate researchers, in a bid to locate the property’s owner.          Fraser changed the locks on the north London home and stopped Mrs Amstell\u0027s nephew from claiming his aunt\u0027s houseThe company specialises ‘in tracing owners or their next-of-kin to properties that are vacant, occupied illegally or falling into disrepair’.Such services are usually provided free of charge to local authorities because the ‘leads’ can be highly lucrative.If it transpires that the owner is dead, and if a blood relative can be located, heir-hunting firms will offer to secure an unexpected inheritance for an inidual in return for a hefty percentage of it. The first the Amstells knew of Fraser and Fraser’s involvement was when Marion received a phone call from one of the company’s case workers in July 2016, asking if she knew of a will.‘She had no idea who was calling her,’ says Martin. ‘She was very suspicious. She told them that there was a valid will and that she was the executor, but that the will could not be immediately located.’A letter from the company followed saying that if no will was produced, there was a risk that Tessa’s estate would be regarded as ‘intestate’, or without a will.          Mr Amstell was forced to take his fight to the Royal Courts of Justice, where Fraser was ordered to pay back the costs By then Andrew Fraser had already tracked down one of Tessa’s distant relatives — an American-born man named in court as Keith Simpson — and agreed with him that Fraser and Fraser would receive a proportion of any amount of Tessa’s estate that they recovered for him.He went on to apply to the Winchester probate registry for a grant of letters of administration over Tessa’s estate on the basis of intestacy, swearing an affidavit without mentioning the will Marion had told him about. This gave him control of the house on behalf of the beneficiary.Judge Nigel Gerald said in court this week that Fraser was ‘materially misleading’. Taking control of Tessa’s property ‘with gusto’, he changed the locks and cleared the house of a lifetime of Tessa and Billy’s cherished possessions. Among them was the only known photograph of Martin’s Jewish grandparents, who fled persecution in Warsaw in 1898 and arrived in London unable to read or write, and speaking only Yiddish.          Martin Amstell pictured outside the Royal Courts of Justice in LondonFraser went so far as to put the bungalow up for sale at auction in February 2017 and, even when Martin and his sister had tracked down the will (tucked inside a cardboard box filled with other files), did not withdraw it from sale until threatened with an injunction.Fraser then embarked on a hugely expensive 12-month trawl through Tessa’s medical records in what was described in court as a ‘pointless’ attempt to prove she had not been of sound mind.‘In effect he cherry-picked her medical records, ignoring the parts that made it clear how sharp-minded she was,’ says Martin.Even when he dropped the challenge to the inheritance in 2017, and Martin was handed the grant of letters of administration, Fraser went to court in a bid to get him and the animal charities named in the will to pay the £134,000 costs he ran up while supposedly hunting for heirs.For this, Fraser came under especially heavy fire from the judge: ‘Mr Fraser treated this as a commercial venture,’ he said, adding that Fraser had ‘acted in a belligerent and provocative manner which appears to be intended to run up costs and bring pressure to bear on Mr Amstell to withdraw or settle the claim.‘There was a specific and deliberate intention to run this litigation as disproportionately, obstructively and expensively as possible.’Andrew Fraser told the Mail that he was ‘disappointed by the result’ of this week’s costs hearing and that Fraser and Fraser had not yet decided if they would appeal.A statement released by the company said: ‘The existence of a possible will, its content and the location of the will were fully disclosed and information was drip-fed to the blood family whom Fraser and Fraser had located.’It added: ‘In the six years between Mrs Amstell passing away and Mr Fraser obtaining a grant, nothing had happened apart from the will being lost. Indeed, none of the charities had received any money and bills for utilities and council tax concerning the property had not been paid.’Martin Amstell’s main concern is that the heir-hunting industry isn’t regulated.‘I’m not sure that the average person would be able to stand up to them,’ he says. ‘My sister is in a state of complete exhaustion and I am still reeling.’Now he has the keys to Tessa’s bungalow, Martin must decide what to do with it. He entered the property for the first time on Thursday and was devastated to find it stripped bare. After so much distress, he says he will now probably sell it.‘Tessa loved the bungalow,’ he says quietly, ‘but I think she’d understand that it’s time to let it go. My sister and I have been through enough.’"},{"url":null,"title":"RICHARD KAY reveals Prince Charless extraordinary 70th birthday","story":"    I came, I sawed, I conquered: How Edward and \u0027victim\u0027 Peter Phillips might have lookedHis partner who clambered willingly, if a little nervously, into a wooden box was Princess Anne’s son and Charles’s nephew Peter Phillips, whose 41st birthday was the following day.Many a royal heart was in mouth as the pair, with Edward brandishing a hand saw, stepped on to the stage for the highlight of a riotous and joyful celebration at Buckingham Palace.All the elements of the Prince of Wales’s life were there. His love of music, comedy, fine food and gentle lampooning, together with 300 family and close friends carousing into the early hours.No one took to the Palace ballroom floor with more enthusiasm than the birthday boy, dancing with Camilla and a string of royal cousins.          Not since the Queen held her ‘Dance of the Decades’ party at Windsor Castle at the turn of the century to mark a host of family birthdays have so many royals crammed into the PalaceEven Prince Philip, who makes only rare appearances at family events these days, was on hand to join the toasts led by the Queen for their eldest son. If hers was the warmest and wittiest of tributes – in which she labelled her son ‘a duchy original’ in reference to his organic food brand – it was Prince William who brought the house down with a tongue in cheek, if heavy-handed joke at his father’s expense.Father and son have not always enjoyed the easiest of relationships, but William showed he was a chip off the royal block with remarks that remained, just, inside the boundaries of propriety.His speech, complete with theatrical pauses, began with him saying: ‘Let me tell you all the things my father hates... red squirrels, the environment, traditional architecture.’ Warming to his theme, he listed the Prince of Wales’ subsidiary titles – titles he will one day inherit.

Guests from the younger generation included members of William and Harry’s circle, such as Charlie and Daisy van Straubenzee, and Hugh and Rose van Cutsem. The party was overseen with absolute precision by the Duchess of Cornwall, whose ex-husband Brigadier Andrew Parker Bowles, was also invitedThe evening had begun with drinks in the Picture Gallery followed by dinner of salmon tartlet, poussin with autumn vegetables and ice cream bombe, served in the ballroom, where the Queen usually holds investitures.

There were no Cabinet ministers, as there were at his 50th when Peter Mandelson was on the guest list, and fewer ‘luvvies’.While 97-year old Prince Philip made an early departure – before the dancing – he was not the first. Prince Harry and the pregnant Duchess of Sussex made their excuses and left.The Queen left soon after, but others remained until after midnight.

The Prime Minister (pictured in her Downing Street office) is determined to see her plan for Britain throughOnly after returning to the No 10 flat was she finally able to discuss her woes with her husband.Philip May, a banker, was so irked by the wall-to-wall reporting of his wife\u0027s imminent political demise, he has taken to switching off all TV news bulletins at work. When she returned from Clarence House, he was waiting in their Downing St kitchen with more modest fare than the champagne and fine canapes at the royal birthday party.\u0027We went up to the flat for a quick bite – Philip cooked beans on toast – I think I opened the tin! He made the toast – and did the washing up! Then it was downstairs for a quick meeting and home (their property in Sonning, Berkshire) by 9.30pm so I could get the washing on and leave it to dry overnight.\u0027          Theresa May (pictured during the exclusive Daily Mail interview) has told how her husband was her rock this week As ever, the middle-class vicar\u0027s daughter was putting day-to-day practicality first.She skipped her usual Friday morning gym session to be back at Downing St for our interview but says she could not survive the pressure cooker of politics without Philip. \u0027I always say he is my rock. It\u0027s hugely important to have somebody there who is supportive of you, not involved in the intricacies of politics, but there to provide human support.\u0027 When they met at Oxford, Philip was as politically ambitious as she was. \u0027He thinks what I am doing is important for the British people, though he doesn\u0027t put it like that. He says \u0027Keep going, this matters, keep doing the right thing\u0027.\u0027Mrs May says Philip feels the pain of the vicious personal attacks on her by Tory Party critics even more than she does. \u0027It\u0027s often harder for the other half because they are watching it and feel protective and think \u0027Why are they saying that to my wife?\u0027 He does feel some of it (the hurt) himself – he\u0027s bound to. We\u0027ve been married for 38 years, that\u0027s a long time.\u0027  Some Whitehall veterans have compared the air of impending doom now enveloping Mrs May\u0027s No 10 to the last days of Margaret Thatcher in 1990, when, just as with Mrs May, her Tory ministers were deserting her.Maggie\u0027s husband Denis has often been likened to Philip: discreet and monosyllabic in public similar in appearance – tall, slim, formal and above all loving and fiercely loyal.When the Tory sharks circled around Lady Thatcher, it was Denis who stepped in and said it was time to go, telling her: \u0027You\u0027ve done enough, old girl. You\u0027ve done your share. For God\u0027s sake, don\u0027t go on any longer.\u0027 Has Philip reached that point? \u0027No, he supports what I\u0027m doing.\u0027He must feel like punching her Tory assailants on the nose?\u0027You\u0027ll have to ask him – he\u0027s as protective as any other half.\u0027Mrs May says her Christian faith has also helped. \u0027I am a practising member of the faith and go to church regularly. It is an important part of my life – part of who I am and how I do my job.\u0027She is careful not to attack Mr Johnson, Mr Rees-Mogg and others directly, perhaps because she is fearful of prodding the hornet\u0027s nest. But she leaves little doubt that she regards some hard Brexiteers as vainglorious, fanatical ideologues with no regard or knowledge of ordinary people or real life.\u0027Some politicians get so embroiled in the intricacies of their argument they forget it is not about this theory or that theory, or does it make me look good? It is what is best for people going about their lives day in and day out. They think too much about their privileged position and too little about their responsibility. The job of a prime minister is to make tough decisions which are not always black or white. I have to find a way through, what best suits everybody\u0027s needs.\u0027 Mrs May does not pretend her Brexit plan is perfect.\u0027It\u0027s not everybody\u0027s ideal deal. You were never going to get that.\u0027She is hardly extolling it to the skies – however hard she tries to get people enthused about it, there\u0027s a feeling she must know the truth: that it is the least worst option.But she is intensely frustrated that so few have given her credit for addressing the main reason millions voted to cut ties with Brussels: controlling immigration by ending freedom of movement.\u0027As Home Secretary for six years I did my best to reduce immigration with one hand tied behind my back because you couldn\u0027t do anything about people coming in from the EU,\u0027 she said. \u0027Now we can. Freedom of movement ends.\u0027She trotted out her other Brexit achievements: \u0027no more sending vast sums to the EU an end to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice out of the Common Agricultural Policy out of the Common Fisheries Policy out of the customs union out of the single market independent trade and an independent coastal state. That is delivered in the future.\u0027It sounds impressive. But she is back on the defensive when challenged over claims that the EU can now veto us leaving the customs union: \u0027No, no, no, no. In the future we WILL leave customs union.\u0027But we are trapped in it?\u0027No, no, no, no, no.\u0027 She\u0027s very much in Maggie mode here.Could Mrs May categorically say the EU would not have a veto?She pauses, \u0027You are talking about it, you see …\u0027Have they or haven\u0027t they?\u0027No, but…\u0027Won\u0027t they just trap us in it?\u0027No. The EU does not have a veto on us leaving the customs union – we have a future relationship where we are not in it.\u0027It sounds categorical.But then she adds the so-called \u0027backstop mechanism\u0027, involving \u0027UK-wide customs territory arrangements to ensure the Ireland and Northern Ireland border remains free\u0027, can only be ended by \u0027mutual consent – we don\u0027t have unilateral withdrawal from that.\u0027 No wonder people are confused.She also struggles to answer Esther McVey\u0027s withering comment to her after quitting the Cabinet: \u0027You have gone from saying no deal is better than a bad deal to any deal is better than no deal.\u0027\u0027No, I haven\u0027t gone to that position,\u0027 she says tersely.But what if her deal is voted down by MPs? She will have nowhere to go. It will be the end game. She refuses to contemplate it: \u0027I am focusing on making sure I persuade people this is a good deal.\u0027 Admirers will praise her resolve: cynics will say she is in denial. But in a message aimed at her Tory assassins she says replacing her as prime minister would not lead to a better Brexit offer. \u0027People say \u0027if you could only just do something slightly different, have a Norway model or a Canada model, this backstop issue would go away.\u0027 She turns up the volume: \u0027IT. WOULD. NOT. THAT ISSUE IS STILL GOING TO BE THERE.\u0027Whatever your view of her as a prime minister, there can surely be no doubting her fortitude on a human level. She makes light of the regular injections of insulin she requires ever since she was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes.She jokes that during last week\u0027s five-hour Cabinet Brexit summit \u0027I was the only one who didn\u0027t take a break! You get used to managing it. It becomes part of your way of life. I inject when I eat,\u0027 she said matter-of-factly.As for the idea that she is about to suffer the same fate as Lady Thatcher, who wept as she was driven out of Downing St, it simply isn\u0027t on her mind.\u0027I don\u0027t go \u0027Oh gosh, it must have been like this x years ago\u0027. I wake up each morning and say \u0027What have I got to do today to get where we need to be?\u0027.\u0027Being prime minister is about fighting the good fight for the country,\u0027 she insists with that air of defiance and resolution. And that is what I am determined to do.\u0027   How beans on toast, a glass of Welsh whisky and Philip\u0027s rock-like support helped Theresa May survive a week of treachery... but the PM has STILL had to do the washing as she vows to keep \u0027fighting the good fight\u0027 on BrexitSitting in her Downing Street study yesterday morning, Theresa May hardly had the manner or appearance of someone on the verge of being ejected from No 10.Perhaps the Prime Minister was taking inspiration from the portrait of an impassive Winston Churchill glowering down on us, for her demeanour was one of determination and resolve.In her elegant tweed jacket and white top with a discreet string of pearls, Mrs May was a picture of calm under the circumstances – although the pointed steel toecaps of her flat shoes may have reflected what she really thought of her political enemies.          Mrs May wore an elegant tweed jacket (pictured above) for the exclusive interview Mrs May\u0027s exclusive interview with the Mail behind the heavy blue doors of her Downing Street redoubt took place at the height of this week\u0027s political turmoil.Just 48 hours earlier, Jacob Rees-Mogg had launched a campaign to depose her over her proposed Brexit deal seven ministers and senior Tories had resigned and she was struggling to find someone ready to accept the Cabinet\u0027s poison chalice, the job of Brexit Secretary.When you are in the bunker with heavy shelling all around, any hint that another major casualty has been avoided is cause for fresh hope.Which is why embattled Mrs May and her No 10 team were so thrilled by the news just before our meeting that Michael Gove was not going to resign from the Cabinet despite rejecting her plea to replace Dominic Raab as Brexit Secretary.In normal circumstances, a Cabinet minister who publicly spurned a prime minister in their hour of need would be sacked. These are not normal times.Mrs May has been hit by so many resignations she is in danger of running out of Conservatives willing or able to fill the gaps round her Cabinet table.But while her boasts that she and her Government are \u0027strong and stable\u0027 are long gone, she has an air of steely composure as she talks candidly about her marriage, her faith, how she copes with Tory plotters ... and why Boris Johnson – and anyone else who might replace her as prime minister – would be deluding themselves if they think they can wring any more concessions from Brussels than she has.\u0027It\u0027s been a pretty heavy couple of days,\u0027 she says with understatement and her familiar awkward smile. \u0027When I went up to the flat late on Wednesday, around 11pm, the first thing Philip did was to pour me a whisky, Penderyn Welsh whisky – though I do drink Scotch as well!,\u0027 she adds diplomatically.She needed a large one, surely? \u0027I couldn\u0027t possibly comment!\u0027 she jokes.Her husband\u0027s whisky serves more than one purpose. Asked if she has lost sleep, she laughs: \u0027It depends how strong the whisky is, or how much Philip has poured for me!\u0027 The next morning, before she had even walked downstairs from the Downing Street flat to her study, she could have done with another glass of Penderyn because she was told that Mr Raab\u0027s resignation had been confirmed.\u0027I wasn\u0027t leaden footed, but sad,\u0027 she says with a sigh. \u0027When you are PM you wake up each morning and never quite know how the day is going to pan out.\u0027She discovered this afresh when, within hours, Mr Rees-Mogg called on her to resign.          Mrs May has stayed away from attacking cabinet members such as Jacobs Rees-Mogg (pictured above)For many it would have been a body blow, but not for this prime minister. That evening, she was back on duty chatting to Prince Charles at his 70th birthday party at Clarence House.Only after returning to the No 10 flat was she finally able to discuss her woes with her husband.Philip May, a banker, was so irked by the wall-to-wall reporting of his wife\u0027s imminent political demise, he has taken to switching off all TV news bulletins at work. When she returned from Clarence House, he was waiting in their Downing St kitchen with more modest fare than the champagne and fine canapes at the royal birthday party.\u0027We went up to the flat for a quick bite – Philip cooked beans on toast – I think I opened the tin! He made the toast – and did the washing up! Then it was downstairs for a quick meeting and home (their property in Sonning, Berkshire) by 9.30pm so I could get the washing on and leave it to dry overnight.\u0027As ever, the middle-class vicar\u0027s daughter was putting day-to-day practicality first.She skipped her usual Friday morning gym session to be back at Downing St for our interview but says she could not survive the pressure cooker of politics without Philip. \u0027I always say he is my rock. It\u0027s hugely important to have somebody there who is supportive of you, not involved in the intricacies of politics, but there to provide human support.\u0027 When they met at Oxford, Philip was as politically ambitious as she was. \u0027He thinks what I am doing is important for the British people, though he doesn\u0027t put it like that. He says \u0027Keep going, this matters, keep doing the right thing\u0027.\u0027          Whitehall veterans have compared the air of impending doom now enveloping Mrs May\u0027s No 10 to the last days of Margaret Thatcher (pictured above) in 1990Mrs May says Philip feels the pain of the vicious personal attacks on her by Tory Party critics even more than she does. \u0027It\u0027s often harder for the other half because they are watching it and feel protective and think \u0027Why are they saying that to my wife?\u0027 He does feel some of it (the hurt) himself – he\u0027s bound to. We\u0027ve been married for 38 years, that\u0027s a long time.\u0027 Some Whitehall veterans have compared the air of impending doom now enveloping Mrs May\u0027s No 10 to the last days of Margaret Thatcher in 1990, when, just as with Mrs May, her Tory ministers were deserting her.Maggie\u0027s husband Denis has often been likened to Philip: discreet and monosyllabic in public similar in appearance – tall, slim, formal and above all loving and fiercely loyal.When the Tory sharks circled around Lady Thatcher, it was Denis who stepped in and said it was time to go, telling her: \u0027You\u0027ve done enough, old girl. You\u0027ve done your share. For God\u0027s sake, don\u0027t go on any longer.\u0027 Has Philip reached that point? \u0027No, he supports what I\u0027m doing.\u0027He must feel like punching her Tory assailants on the nose?\u0027You\u0027ll have to ask him – he\u0027s as protective as any other half.\u0027Mrs May says her Christian faith has also helped. \u0027I am a practising member of the faith and go to church regularly. It is an important part of my life – part of who I am and how I do my job.\u0027She is careful not to attack Mr Johnson, Mr Rees-Mogg and others directly, perhaps because she is fearful of prodding the hornet\u0027s nest.

Amber Augusta Rudd was born in August 1963, the youngest of four children, and enjoyed a privileged upbringing in a large family home in Kensington, West London, and a country house in Wiltshire.Her father Tony was a successful self-made Labour-supporting stockbroker while her mother Ethne was a Tory-leaning magistrate. After Cheltenham Ladies’ College and Edinburgh University, she worked in recruitment and dabbled in the film industry, serving as the ‘aristocracy co-ordinator’ on Richard Curtis’s hit Four Weddings and a Funeral.In 1990 she married AA Gill, the writer and restaurant reviewer, and they had two children together. In an interview with the Mail recently, she described how she realised the marriage was over when she arrived to collect Gill from the airport and found him with his mistress Nicola Formby, a South African model. She orced him in 1995.  In 1990 she married AA Gill, the writer and restaurant reviewer, pictured together campaigning in the 2005 general election, and they had two children togetherRudd turned to politics in her forties, winning the marginal seat of Hastings and Rye at the 2010 general election. She backed Remain in the referendum. Her multi- millionaire younger brother Roland is one of the most influential PR men in the country and one of the key figures in the campaign for a People’s Vote.Despite Rudd’s rapid march up the ranks, her Commons seat remains on a knife edge. Her majority stands at just 346 and she is seeking advice from election guru Sir Lynton Crosby.In 2013 Rudd upset some poverty campaigners when she said: ‘You get people who are on benefits who prefer to be on benefits by the seaside. They’re not moving down here to get a job, they’re moving down here to have easier access to friends and drugs and drink.’ Many of her constituents welcomed her remarks but they may come back to haunt her.In her new position at the Department for Work and Pensions she faces the tricky task of pushing through the Government’s Universal Credit benefits reform in the face of fierce opposition from a Labour Party happy to leap on such remarks.If anybody can handle the pressure, though, it’s Rudd – a woman who can show even her boss a thing or two about resilience. "},{"url":null,"title":"Lady Kitty Spencers wealthy Italian ex woos Elizabeth Hurley date Mayfair","story":"    Niccolo Barattieri di San Pietro was spotted on a date with the Elizabeth Hurley, 53, in London’s Mayfair          Ex-lovers: Lady Kitty Spencer and Niccolo Barattieri di San Pietro in July 2016EDEN CONFIDENTIAL: Harry and Meghan \u0027may leave their...Decimated: New drone images show how fire utterly wrecked...Share this article  Daughter of Charles\u0027 ski tragedy pal to tie the knot Prince Charles, who gallantly agreed to walk Meghan Markle down the aisle at her wedding, can look forward to another poignant occasion.His goddaughter Alice Lindsay, whose father was killed on a skiing holiday in the Alps with the Prince, has become engaged.Art history teacher Alice, 30, is to wed lawyer James Poyner, 33, next summer.‘We plan to light a candle for my father in the church, and the band will be playing some of his favourite songs,’ she tells me.Charles desperately tried to rescue Major Hugh Lindsay, a former equerry to the Queen, when he was buried by an avalanche at Klosters in 1988.

The trees are native to West Africa, where it has long been an agricultural crop, but it ended up in Southeast Asia more than 100 years ago as an ornamental crop.It’s the world’s most widely used vegetable oil — 66 million tons is produced every year — and consumption is on the rise, with the oil appearing in all manner of products.It was first planted commercially in Malaysia in 1917, and Indonesia and Malaysia now account for 85 per cent of the global supply. According to the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), 42 other countries also produce it.          The advert follows the story of Rang-tan, the baby orang-utan who has taken up residence in a girl’s bedroom after losing his homeIncredibly efficient, the plant produces more oil per land area than any equivalent vegetable oil crop, hence its rapid rise. Palm oil supplies 35 per cent of the world’s vegetable oil demands on just under ten per cent of the land allocated to oil crops.It’s versatile, odourless and colourless, and has a high melting point so it is semi-solid at room temperature, keeping spreads spreadable. The WWF says it’s also resistant to oxidation (giving products a longer shelf-life) and stable at high temperatures (giving fried products a crispy texture).This explains why it is estimated to feature in about half of all supermarket products.SO WHAT IS THE PROBLEM?PRODUCTION has expanded at a frightening rate. Oil palm plantations are already said to cover more than 27 million hectares of the Earth’s surface — an area the size of New Zealand — and production is expected to triple by 2050.The spread of palm oil has been blamed for major deforestation in some of the most erse habitats. Given that this is largely unfolding in Indonesia and Malaysia, that’s where Rang-tan comes in.Iceland ad: Why is Palm Oil so bad for the environment?The one Christmas TV advert everyone ought to watch: SIMON...Share this articleVast areas of rainforest — once home not just to orang-utans, but also to tigers, elephants and rhinos — have been cleared to make way for oil palms. Already endangered animals such as the Borneo pygmy elephant, Sumatran rhino and orang-utans have been put at risk. An estimated 25 orang-utans are killed every day, and Iceland’s advert is dedicated to them.People are losing their homes, too. And that’s not to mention the question marks surrounding working conditions, and any impact of forest loss on climate change.HOW ABOUT SUSTAINABLE OIL?In recent years there has been a drive towards more sustainable sourcing and production of palm oil. But campaign groups’ views on how realistic this is differ.The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil was formed in 2004 due to concerns about the impact of mass production. It is intended to set a global standard for palm oil production, with ‘stringent’ criteria for producers, and a certification process to signal to buyers that the products they buy contain palm oil from a sustainable source.In 2010, many of Britain’s most popular brands pledged that by 2020 they would no longer buy palm oil from any supplier involved in the destruction of forests.But Greenpeace says that while responsible production is possible and does happen, questions remain over how reliable the system is.

Belafonte gets the 2015 Cadillac Escalade Brown gets the two 2017 Subaru Outbacks and the two Range Rovers.

Andrea Leadsom (pictured) had hosted the \u0027pizza club\u0027 at her homeIn order to relax tensions, Ms Rudd was deployed within moments of her appointment to appeal for calm in the party.In an interview with the BBC she said that MPs contemplating submitting letters to Sir Graham should \u0027think again\u0027, adding: \u0027This is not a time for changing our leader.\u0027This is a time for pulling together, for making sure we remember who we are here to serve, who we are here to help: that\u0027s the whole of the country.    Theresa May (pictured on LBC this morning) is in the political battle of her life today as she desperately tries to rally support for her Brexit plan as Tory MP mobilise to try to oust her form the leadershipTheresa May laid down the gauntlet to Tory Eurosceptics over her Brexit deal today - warning that she is a \u0027bloody difficult woman\u0027.The Prime Minister took a defiant stance despite fears that Michael Gove could become the latest minister to quit and join a massive revolt by Brexiteer MPs. Mrs May is in the political battle o her life as her Brexit deal is hammers by all sides and Tory MPs are mobilising to try to oust her.But launching a PR blitz to drum up support for her beleaguered deal, the PM today made a rare appearance on live radio to take questions from the public for half an hour.She admitted to LBC that she had \u0027concerns\u0027 about the Irish border \u0027backstop\u0027 - but insisted the overall package was the best thing for the UK.But she insisted that her agreement is the best on the table.She told listeners: \u0027I truly believe this is the best deal,\u0027 she added. Asked whether she regarded herself as \u0027bloody-minded\u0027 like her cricketing her Geoffrey Boycott, the premier said: \u0027Well, Ken Clarke once described me as a bloody difficult woman.\u0027                         However the mini reshuffle was far from straightforward as it later emerged that Mr Barclay was her third choice for the job of Brexit Secretary, after it was turned down by Mr Gove and Geoffrey Cox, the Attorney General.Despite the promotion Mr Barclay has been told he is only in charge of \u0027domestic planning\u0027 for Brexit and will play no part in the negotiations with Brussels, which are led by the Prime Minister. Downing Street has insisted that the draft EU Withdrawal Agreement cannot now be changed.However, Mr Gove and his cohorts were given some pointers yesterday ahead of the November 25 meeting.Leo Varadkar, the Irish premier, said he did not see much room for negotiation, while the Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said only that the EU would not make \u0027massive changes\u0027 to the deal.The \u0027takeaway club\u0027 are set to tell Mrs May it is imperative that Britain has a way of quitting the \u0027backstop\u0027 arrangement which is designed to avoid a hard border in Ireland.They  also want provision for a \u0027technical solution\u0027 to the Irish border issue to be included into the deal at a later date.Other demands will be for further clarification of the EU\u0027s demand for a \u0027level playing field\u0027 customs arrangement in the backstop, which they believe to be too vague at present.Former president of the European Free Trade Association Court, Carl Baudenbacher highlighted that Britain would still be subject to European Court of Justice rulings and it was \u0027absolutely unbelievable\u0027 that the UK would allow it.Explaining Mr Gove\u0027s decision to stay in the Cabinet, a friend told The Telegraph: \u0027Michael thought about his position in Cabinet overnight and concluded that he wants to find a way through for the Government and the country. What good would leaving now actually achieve?\u0027He has concerns about the deal but he also has concerns about no deal. Ultimately he decided it would be wrong to walk away. It was a tough call to make but he hopes the deal can be changed to make it more sellable.\u0027It is said that Ms Leadsom was \u0027having a lot of phone conversations\u0027 with the other four ministers.

It has always mattered, and always been controversial, never satisfying everybody, sometimes satisfying almost no one. But there it is, a (literally) concrete and monumental acknowledgement of an activity at which, at least since Elizabethan times, we have excelled, and for which we have always had an appetite. Each of its five artistic directors has modified the vision informing its work, amending it as times have changed, but it has never ceased to be inspired by an ideal of public service no one who has worked there has been in it for the money.The oddly stirring history of how this remarkable institution came to be has been recounted at thrilling length by Daniel Rosenthal in The National Theatre Story. Here, he tells a different tale, brilliantly evoking the day-to-day life of a great theatre, its constant negotiation with the shifting imponderables out of which productions are brought, often kicking and screaming, to the stage. Nothing in the theatre can be relied on. Superb directors occasionally deliver naff shows, wonderful actors turn down parts they were born to play, writers of impeccable track records cannot finish or occasionally even begin their plays, designs that look adorable in the model box prove hideous and impractical, and machinery installed at staggering cost judders to a halt the moment the public arrives. All this is conducted in a maelstrom of emotion and much of it in public. Denunciations fly, old friends fall out, enduring hurt is inflicted, fine plays are badly served, budgets burst at the seams. And every night upwards of 2,000 people descend on Denys Lasdun’s great bunker on the South Bank in London, expecting to see a show that will stimulate, ert, transport, challenge or inform them.The letter written to Michael Redgrave by the secretary to the board Kenneth Rae is terribly touching: “I have now seen your performance of Uncle Vanya four times and can truthfully say that nothing in the theatre has moved me more. Were I to attempt to tell you in person all I felt, I should merely stammer and blub.” The emotional element is part of why the book is so compelling. Here is Maggie Smith to Olivier, after he has told her that he is giving the part of Millamant in The Way of the World to another actor: “Dear Larry, What on earth do you expect me to say? I am absolutely heartbroken by your decision, but what can I do? … it was nice of you to say that you would devote your energies to my return but really I do not think it would be wise of me to believe that either.” The letter is signed, baldly, Margaret.Olivier served a nervous Ronald Pickup rather better, wiring him just before he opened as Rosalind in an all-male As You Like It: “IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU SET YOURSELF ONLY TO ENJOY IT JUST TAKE OFF NOW ON A LOVELY LYRIC FLIGHT.” The waggish agent Al Parker, hearing of the production, wired the casting department to suggest his client Danny La Rue. La Rue saw the joke, too, wiring the company on their first night, “COME ON IN THE WATER IS FINE BEST WISHES FOR A GREAT SUCCESS.”One letter is absent from the book: the one over three foolscap pages I wrote to Olivier in 1967, carefully explaining to him what a wonderful theatre he was running. I was 18, and had no idea what to do with my life. By return of post came a letter from him saying: “If you like it so much, why don’t you come and work here? There’s a job in the box office.” The life-changing power of letters.• To buy Dramatic Exchanges for £22 go to bookshop or call 0330 333 6846. Free UK p\u0026ampp over £15, online orders only.

Why can people born in Britain be forced to leave? Kamila Shamsie explores how citizenship became a privilege, not a rightA couple of years ago, while working on my novel Home Fire, which required me to look into certain aspects of the UK’s citizenship laws, I had a slightly painful conversation with one of my oldest friends. Like me, she had grown up in Karachi. But while I didn’t move to the UK until the age of 34, she came here at 18 to go to university, and has never left. She became a British citizen soon after graduating (her grandmother was British) later, she married an Englishman, and they had a son. Her son was born in London, has never lived anywhere but here. But the painful thing I had to tell her was this: unlike many children who are born and live in the UK, her son’s claim on UK citizenship was contingent rather than assured. He was a British citizen, yes, but he could be made unBritish.The reason for this stemmed from her decision, made soon after her son was born, to get him a POC – a Pakistan Origin Card. This bit of paperwork, issued by the Pakistan High Commission, meant that her son wouldn’t need to go through the expense and hassle of applying for a visa every time she wanted to travel with him to Pakistan where his grandmother and aunt and cousins lived. At the time my friend made this decision she was unaware of a change in the immigration laws that had come into force a few years earlier, in 2003, allowing for people who had acquired British citizenship through birth to be legally deprived of citizenship – provided they were dual nationals who weren’t going to be made stateless.This wasn’t the first time that those who were British by birth could be made unBritish. Prior to 1948 if you chose to become a naturalised citizen of some other country then you lost your British citizenship. Also, until 1948 any British woman who married a foreign national lost her citizenship – the undoing of this misogynist law was the result of years of campaigning by feminists and their allies in the House of Commons. It only seems right to acknowledge this, because there’s no point discussing discriminatory laws if we don’t remember that such laws can be and have been successfully challenged in the past.It is also worth remembering right from the start how fluid citizenship laws are, and how dramatically they can change from one regime to the next. Donald Trump’s recent declaration that he will seek to outlaw birthright citizenship in America has been a well-publicised example of a prospective change – most changes, certainly in the UK in the last 15 years, have attracted far less attention.When I broke the news to my friend about the 2003 law she said it didn’t apply to her son. While his POC entitled him to many of the same rights as a Pakistani citizen, it didn’t make him a Pakistani citizen. But writing novels can turn people into mini-experts on particular subjects for about five minutes, and so I had to break the news to her that the official wording on Pakistan government websites, which I had looked up just that week, said that POC holders could acquire Pakistani passports that would make him a dual national, and therefore in a position to be deprived of his British citizenship. He was 10 years old, but that didn’t change the facts of the case.In the years between that conversation and now, the particular wording around acquiring passports has disappeared from Pakistan government websites, so today my friend’s son appears to be irrevocably British. But if the Pakistan government re-instates the old wording, it all changes again. Which is to say, whether he’s irrevocably British or not depends on some other country’s laws.This is both Kafkaesque and Orwellian. There’s a story ahead – a gripping story, the elements of which include a promising young footballer, murky government practices, a right-on human rights lawyer, parents duped into betraying a son, a terrorist organisation, a central character of unknown loyalties, ugly Americans, foreign locations and a granny.But in order to get there, we first need to grasp that at no point in the process of becoming a British citizen does any piece of documentation signal to you that your citizenship is contingent, that the equality of all citizens is a myth. That sigh of relief that new citizens breathe out, the belief that the certificate of citizenship means “now they can’t throw me out no matter how hostile the environment gets” – that, it turns out, is a myth.A great many people in Britain were shocked by the Windrush scandal. I wasn’t. The stories of people from the Windrush generation being deported from the UK on the flimsiest technicality were certainly distressing, but not in the least bit surprising. For those who haven’t caught up with the latest Windrush news, Sajid Javid this week told the home affairs select committee that there were 83 confirmed cases of people who were wrongfully deported, at least 11 of whom have since died. Prior to the story breaking, those of us who were personally invested in the rhetoric around citizenship and migration knew that we had, for several years, been living in a country obsessed with cutting its migrant numbers and prepared to be entirely heartless in the way it went about achieving that. But I don’t claim an all-knowing position. Yes, I knew that anyone whose citizenship status couldn’t be unequivocally proved was in trouble I didn’t know how many of those who were indisputably British citizens were also at risk.In 1981, an additional clause was added to the 1948 citizenship laws. “The secretary of state shall not deprive a person of British citizenship if it appears to him that the person would thereupon become stateless.” In the years after the second world war, it was recognised that making citizens stateless was the kind of behaviour associated with fascist governments, and that no liberal democracy should have any truck with it. In any case, the UK’s legislation on depriving people of citizenship was little more than moot in the final decades of the 20th century. The deprivation powers were not used in a single case from 1973 to February 2002.But then came the “war on terror”, and with it the collapse of all kinds of civil liberties. The chilling new legislation that was introduced included the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act of 2002, which came into effect the following year. For the first time since 1948, it became possible to deprive any Briton of their citizenship status “if the secretary of state is satisfied that the person has done anything seriously prejudicial to the vital interests of the United Kingdom or a British overseas territory”. In other words, it was no longer only naturalised citizens who could be stripped of citizenship – now even the British-born fell under the deprivation powers provided they had a second nationality. And this is why I had to have the conversation with my friend about her son.It doesn’t end there. There was a further change in 2014. But first, the story I promised.Some of you may remember it. Mahdi Hashi came to the UK at the age of five with his parents from Somalia. They were granted asylum and a few years later became British citizens. He lived here from the age of five, grew up in Camden, went to Haverstock school, enjoyed rowing on Regent’s Park canal, was a promising young footballer who trained at Arsenal, and after school became a care worker. He was also Somali born and a practising Muslim.In 2009, he was one of five Muslim men who went public with claims that MI5 was trying to blackmail them into becoming informers. He was 19 at the time. He had recently travelled to Egypt and on his return to the UK was informed by MI5 that he would be considered a terrorist suspect if he didn’t agree to work for the security services. He said they told him to inform on his friends by encouraging them to talk about jihad and reporting back on what they’d said.It’s true that we only have his word for all this. We don’t know why MI5 approached him in the first place, if that is what really happened. What we do know is that in 2009 he made public these claims against MI5 we also know that in 2009 his family told their local MP Frank Dobson and the investigatory powers tribunal, the body that oversees MI5, that Hashi was being harassed by security officers. In addition, we know that he was never charged with any crime in the UK, though by 2009 there was no shortage of anti-terror legislation. Later in 2009, Hashi moved to Somalia. He said he went to look after his sick grandmother, with whom he lived when he arrived there, though his family also claims that the harassment he was facing in the UK made him want to leave.In 2012, a letter addressed to Hashi arrived at his parents’ home in the UK, containing a deprivation order from the then home secretary, Theresa May. He was to be stripped of his citizenship on the grounds that he was involved in Islamic extremism. His parents didn’t immediately know how to respond to this, and did nothing. It isn’t hard to imagine their state of paralysis, as former asylum seekers. And then things took a particularly bizarre turn. The parents received a call from someone in the world of officialdom – probably MI5 – asking if Hashi had received the letter. They replied that Hashi wasn’t in the UK. The official said he had 28 days to appeal the decision, so they should call him immediately to let him know what was happening and give him time to appeal at the nearest British consulate. If this were a TV drama, we’d all start yelling at the screen: “Don’t call him!”They called him. If anyone was listening in who didn’t already know his phone number and where he was, they did now. His father told him to go to the British consulate. How could he, he said, when Britain didn’t have a consulate in Somalia. The parents didn’t know what to do but a few days later the unusually diligent official called back. He said Hashi must get to the nearest consulate. So, in an attempt to do just that, he crossed into Djibouti, where he was promptly arrested by local security services. “I’m British,” he said. “No you’re not,” they said. But he wasn’t Somali either – Somalia didn’t allow dual citizenship, so he’d ceased to be Somali when he became British.Now he was stateless, with no access to consular services. How many of those here with British passports have ever really stopped to consider the weight of the words printed on the inside of the front cover: “Her Britanic Majesty’s Secretary of State Requests and requires in the Name of Her Majesty all those whom it may concern to allow the bearer to pass freely without let or hindrance, and to afford the bearer such assistance and protection as may be necessary.” No one from any government was requesting or requiring that Mahdi Hashi be afforded assistance or protection. He was put in a cell, without court process or access to advice. Here he was treated badly, held in incommunicado detention for three months, during which time he was interrogated at length by CIA officials. Finally he was hooded, taken to a plane, and flown to New York – which is to say, rendered without due legal process. In New York, he was charged with conspiring to commit acts of terrorism – including being part of an elite suicide squad for al-Shabaab and of planning chemical attacks in the US. He was placed in pre-trial solitary confinement where he remained for three years.Helena Kennedy took up his citizenship deprivation case in the UK in 2013 but it wasn’t until two years later that the judicial process ended with Hashi losing the appeal. In that time, the government made one further change to the laws around citizenship. The new law said that in the case of naturalised citizens without another nationality, citizenship deprivation was possible “if the secretary of state has reasonable grounds for believing that the person is able, under the law of a country or territory outside the United Kingdom, to become a national of such a country or territory.” This wording neatly sidesteps the issue of whether that other country is willing to accept the person’s citizenship application once they’ve been stripped of British nationality.In the case of Hashi we will never know the truth of his guilt or innocence. He was tried in America in one of those particularly Orwellian situations where he was appointed a lawyer who could not disclose to anyone, including Hashi, what evidence there was against him. Though he was originally charged with crimes that carried a mandatory minimum sentence of 30 years he finally entered a guilty plea on the lesser charge of providing material support to terrorism – a post 911 offence which many rights groups have criticised for imposing guilt by association. Hashi was sentenced to nine years in prison – in the context of US anti-terror sentencing, this counts as getting off very lightly. Did he make some kind of deal or did the case against him simply fall apart once some kind, any kind, of legal process was underway? All we do know is that the British government will never ask the Americans these questions because they washed their hands of him, and then passed a law that made it legal to do what they had already done.This change was accompanied by considerable disquiet within both houses of parliament – and not only about the fact of statelessness. It was also about the wording of one of the clauses. Only naturalised British citizens could be made stateless, but a wider category of people – including those British-born with dual nationality – could be deprived of their citizenship if the home secretary was satisfied that deprivation was “conducive to the public good because the person … has conducted him or herself in a manner which is seriously prejudicial to the vital interests of the United Kingdom”. What exactly does “seriously prejudicial” and “vital interests” mean? It doesn’t exactly mean anything. You can make it mean whatever you want it to mean. But getting some kind of clarity, some framework around the deprivation powers, was more necessary now than ever before because for the first time those powers were being put to use. This started with May’s stint as home secretary, and the practices she embraced were continued by Amber Rudd and show every sign of continuing under Sajid Javid.Although the powers to strip citizenship were increased in 2003, they were still very rarely used. But in 2013, 18 people were deprived of citizenship, a huge increase from the six of the previous two years. In 2014, the number was 23. In July 2017 the Times reported that the number of those who had their citizenship revoked so far that year was already over 40. And yes, the rise in numbers occurred at the same time that increased numbers of British citizens first went to join Islamic State, and then tried to return after the collapse of Isis’s so-called caliphate. And yes, that makes it a little difficult to sympathise. Wasn’t it, after all, as the government insisted, a matter of national security? It was impossible to gather sufficient evidence for prosecution against people who had committed their crimes in Syria, but that didn’t mean they wouldn’t be a threat to the UK if allowed to return.Let us look at it from another angle: the government has said, we don’t have the evidence to prosecute these people. We don’t really know what some of them did beyond the fact that they went to a country that we don’t want people to go to. So the only thing to do is to strip them of their citizenship – unless they’re British born and without dual nationality in which case we’ll have to find a way to deal with them when they come back. This two-tiered system of justice should not be consoling to anyone. Consider, though, the case of a man whose son went to join Isis the father, desperate, went to Syria to try to find a way to bring his son back. He failed, he returned alone and was arrested for joining Isis. He’s lucky, I suppose, that he didn’t have his nationality revoked – but the case does highlight what is so problematic in the “we don’t have the evidence to prosecute them so we’ll just send them into exile” approach. Exile. It’s an oddly medieval word, isn’t it? Exile at the discretion of a single person (the home secretary), entirely bypassing the court system or the need for evidence. What are we doing, in Britain, making greater and greater use of this medieval system of justice?Let’s turn to a group of men who, in August this year, had their attempts to contest deprivation orders  rejected by a court of appeal: three of the members of the Rochdale grooming gang. A fourth, the ringleader who is still in prison, is awaiting the outcome of his appeal. All four were naturalised Brits, who also had Pakistani citizenship. When they were convicted in 2015, May said that they would be stripped of citizenship and deported back to Pakistan after they had served their sentences. I have as little sympathy for rapists and paedophiles as anyone, and I understand the gut reaction of “good riddance”. But as a citizen of both Britain and of Pakistan, I find these deprivation orders profoundly disturbing.I will look at this first as a citizen of Pakistan. These men are being sent to a country that, unlike Britain, has no sex offender register and where, unlike Britain, the men have no criminal records. There is nothing to stop them walking into a school in search of employment, and opportunity. If they are being made unBritish because they still pose a threat to young girls, then why is that threat being exported to Pakistan? We might pause here to think about President Macron’s words at last Sunday’s armistice commemoration: “By saying ‘our interests first, who cares about the others?’ we erase what a nation holds dearest, what gives it life, what makes it great, and what is essential: its moral values.”What are the moral values of a country that decides to send its sex offenders to a country where it will be easier for them to rape vulnerable girls? Can anyone really find it in them to say, “Well, as long as it isn’t British girls …”Now let me look at this as a citizen of Britain. I’m a dual citizen, a naturalised citizen, and yes, that makes me the most vulnerable to deprivation orders, but I want to consider the underlying question in all of this: what is the relationship between principles and the law? When the choice comes between giving up your principles or giving up on a proposed new law, the answer should always be that if the law undermines the values by which a nation wants to be known, then the law is unfit for purpose. One of the great sleight of hand manoeuvres by many democratic governments since the start of the “war on terror” has been to convince its citizens that we need to set aside our principles in the name of security. I can tell you from lived experience that this is the argument of dictatorships.The line May used time and again to justify the increased use and scope of deprivation powers was: “citizenship is a privilege, not a right”. It’s true that acquiring citizenship is, for naturalised citizens, a privilege insofar as there is an element of discretion involved. But once you become a citizen then, as Helena Kennedy has written, “citizenship is not a privilege it is a protected legal status”. What is so dishonest about citizenship deprivation, Kennedy said, is “that it’s using ‘go back where you came from’”.I haven’t mentioned the issue of race so far but it’s the elephant in the room, shifting from foot to foot. In many countries, citizenship laws have often been used as racial exclusion laws. It came as some surprise to me that until 1952 the American citizenship laws had racial restrictions and until 1965 they had national origin restrictions – all in an attempt to keep the US as Protestant and white as possible. In contrast, the 1948 British Nationality Act is a remarkably progressive, inclusive piece of immigration legislation. I’m not one to speak well of empire, or the processes of ending it, but this first piece of post-empire immigration legislation does make me a little teary-eyed. Overnight those who had been subjects of the empire now found themselves with the right to be citizens of Britain – with no restrictions or quotas around race or national origins.But there was a gap between what the law allowed, and what was culturally accepted. My mother grew up in England in the 1950s and early 60s and has described how when she was looking for somewhere to board in London she would dial a number, speak in her plummy accent, and be told that yes, there was a room. And then she’d arrive at the front door and the landlady would say: “No rooms.” Recounting this, my mother once said, “I realised I might think of myself as English, but the English never would.” In many ways things felt different by the time I moved to the UK several decades later, in my 30s, but at a certain point I started noticing that if I were with a British Asian friend who had lived here all her life we would often be addressed by white Brits as though we had the same relationship with Pakistan – both of us being asked: “How often do you go back home?”I would have thought all this relatively benign if I hadn’t been in London just after the 77 bombings, and noticed something about the way the bombers were spoken and written about. I placed those observations in Home Fire. This is in a classroom at a British university:It overturned 790 years of precedent in British law the Kashmiri lecturer had been saying during an impassioned presentation on Control Orders and their impact on civil liberties when she saw the quiet girl in the third row roll her eyes. Would you like to say something, Ms Pasha? Yes, Dr Shah, if you look at colonial laws you’ll see plenty of precedent for depriving people of their rights the only difference is this time it’s applied to British citizens, and even that’s not as much of a change as you might think because they’re rhetorically being made unBritish. Say more. The 77 terrorists were never described by the media as ‘British terrorists’ even when the word ‘British’ was used it was always ‘British of Pakistani descent’ or ‘British Muslim’ or, my favourite, ‘British passport-holders’, always something interposed between their Britishness and terrorism.Why has it been possible for the British government to start exiling its citizens, without a criminal trial, without the right to defence, without open examination of the evidence? Why has it been so possible to create a two or three tier system of citizenship? It is possible, I would argue, because culturally there are too many people who think that if you aren’t white and of Christian stock then you really aren’t “one of us”. The question that sums it up is: but where are you really from? Historically, the law has been ahead of people’s prejudices. The law said the former subjects of the empire now had the right to be full and equal citizens, even if culturally a great many people still thought and think of the formerly colonised as inferior, and as outsider. The law said that discrimination on religious or racial grounds was not permitted, even if culturally bigotry was and is still prevalent. But the expanding scope of deprivation powers has moved in the opposite direction – it has taken on discriminatory attitudes that exist in the culture and enshrined them in law, distinguishing between those who are “British British” and those who are British until the home secretary decides otherwise.“What should I do?” my friend asked me, when I told her that her son might possibly be a dual national, and subject to deprivation orders. “Tell him not to break any laws,” I said, trying to make a joke of it. “Yeah,” she said. “But how do I have a conversation with my son where I tell him that because he’s Muslim and his mother’s from Pakistan he has to be careful in ways that his friends don’t have to?” I had no answer to that.• Kamila Shamsie’s Home Fire won the 2018 women’s prize for fiction.

The company was due to pay the bondholders about £220m in June next year.The company said that it had received offers for parts of its business – the owner of the Daily Mail had considered a bid for its crown jewel asset, the i – but “none of the offers received delivered sufficient value” to save the company.“There were offers for the whole group, as well as for some inidual titles,” said David King, Johnston’s chief executive. “Each approach was examined carefully. Yet none of these offers, or combinations of offers, would have raised enough money to repay the £220m debt that we are obliged to settle in June 2019, nor did they allow the defined benefit pension scheme to remain attached to the company.”King, who took over as chief executive after the surprise departure of Ashley Highfield after seven years in May, sent an email to the company’s 2,000-plus staff saying their jobs are safe – for now.“Our operations will continue uninterrupted and so it is important that you turn up for work as normal – your employment contract will be transferring to the new company and you will continue to be paid as normal,” said King, in an email to staff seen by the . “The newspapers and websites will continue to be published as usual.

Under the terms of the deal to shift the assets to a new company, Johnston Press’s defined benefit schemes will not transfer and will shift to the government’s Pension Protection Fund, resulting in lower payments.

The damaging environmental impact of global meat production has spurred interest in bugs – which can be bred in significant numbers without taking up large amounts of land, water or feed – as an alternative, sustainable food source.The packaging for the crunchy crickets, made by London-based Eat Grub, deploys the environmental argument in a bid to win over shoppers who might balk at bugs for lunch. The new product is trumpeted by its manufacturer as “more sustainable than pork scratchings … and more exciting than a crisp”.The Eat Grub bugs – acheta domesticus, or house crickets – are farmed in Europe and come in packets of about 50, at £1.50 per bag. If shoppers can get over the ick factor, they can consume the crickets as a snack or as a garnish for noodles, soups and salads.The global edible insect market is set to exceed $520m (£406m) by 2023, according to recent research. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization says at least 2 billion people regularly consume insects, and the tiny creatures could also help meet the food needs of the world’s growing population.More than 1,000 insect species are eaten around the world but hardly feature in the diets of many rich nations. In the UK, crickets and other insects have so far been predominantly limited to quirky pop-ups or sales through online outlets, while they also feature on a few restaurant menus. The move by Sainsbury’s means this is the first time consumers will be able to buy insects from a supermarket.“Insect snacks should no longer be seen as a gimmick or something for a dare,” said Rachel Eyre, head of future brands at Sainsbury’s. “It’s clear that consumers are increasingly keen to explore this new sustainable protein source.”Insects are naturally very low in calories and suitable for gluten- and dairy-free diets, as well as being exceptionally high in protein. Gram for gram, dried crickets contain more protein than beef, chicken and pork – with 100g containing 68g of protein, compared with only 31g of protein in beef.The food group also tops the list when it comes to sustainability. Bugs emit considerably lower levels of greenhouse gases than most livestock and are more efficient in terms of the resources needed to farm them – crickets, for example, need 12 times less feed than cattle.“As the population increases, we urgently need to look at alternative protein sources to make the most of land available for food production,” the food policy manager at WWF UK, Duncan Williamson, said. “Insects are incredibly sustainable and can help to reduce our carbon footprint.”Other retailers are capitalising on the rise of insect food. The online grocer Ocado sells Eat Grub’s protein bars made of cricket powder, while the French supermarket group Carrefour has started selling bug-based products from the Jimini’s range in more than 300 of its branches in Spain. The products include spicy chilli buffalo worms and insect-based energy bars, pasta and granola.The UK department store Selfridges, which also sells some of Jimini’s products, will next February launch a pop-up “Bug Bar” selling a range of products including cricket flour while introducing shoppers to new recipes. The specialist food shops Fortnum \u0026amp Mason and Planet Organic also stock the Jimini’s range.Chefs report some success in encouraging their diners to tuck into creepy-crawlies. Archipelago restaurant in central London has cricket and locusts on its menu, bought in bulk frozen from a supplier on the Isle of Wight.Diners at Heston Blumenthal’s Michelin-starred Fat Duck restaurant can savour mealworms from the Netherlands in edible soil in a savoury “woodlands-themed” dish – part of its £325 tasting menu. “I’m fully behind the idea of eating insects, but this one still feels like a work in progress. For one, the cricket looks too much like a cricket – I can make out its thorax and abdomen and I’d rather I couldn’t. They taste of whatever they are flavoured with – bitter with a little spicy kick at the end – rather than the cricket itself, which is perhaps a mixed blessing. But\u0026nbspfor me the sticking point is the texture. Crisp on the outside, it quickly yields before popping in your mouth. All that aside, if I\u0026nbspdidn’t know this was a cricket I could well imagine taking a handful out of a bowl at a party without thinking twice. But since I do, I can’t really get\u0026nbsppast it.” Morwenna Ferrier“I often have a little protein snack to keep me going in the afternoon – nuts or seeds or something boring like that – and crickets felt like they could definitely liven up that arena. They were satisfyingly crispy with an overall nutty flavour. There was also some sweetness and a hefty hit of coriander seed, although I suspect they were flavourings that had been added rather than the cricket itself. Despite the horrified looks of my colleagues, I’d recommend them – they tasted different without being off-puttingly weird. They did look like animal droppings, however, which is even worse than looking like crickets.” Tim Jonze"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3aa827c56c5833c5f9cf644e7186feceb6d00d0c/75_0_4303_2581/master/4303.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e302b6d31d2bf7594c139e9e97780687","title":"europe britain brexit article 50 second referendum","story":"The EU is fed up with the UK’s Brexit drama, but would extend article 50 to allow for a second referendumAs Britain agonises over its destiny, I’ve been in Brussels discovering what other Europeans think about Brexit – and therefore what real options Britain still has. Essentially, there are just two. Europe’s door is still open for Britain to stay, if we vote to do so in a second referendum, preferably before the European elections in late May. Otherwise, most of our fellow Europeans would rather we left on 29 March, leaving everything else to be sorted out later and allowing them to get on with confronting their own big challenges.Of course, it’s impossible to generalise about the views of some 450 million Europeans, but among the leaders and official representatives of the 27 other member states, and the European institutions, there is a remarkable degree of consensus. They are fed up to the back teeth with how long the Brexit drama has taken and how unrealistic the British side has been.If you sit with Germans talking to the French, or Poles talking to Italians, it’s as if Brexit has already happened. Their mental time is spent on the eurozone and Italy, Donald Trump and trade, post-Merkel Germany, their own populists and the upcoming European elections. “In Berlin, Brexit is about issue number 10,” one diplomat says. Even in areas where Britain used to be strong, such as foreign and security policy, the country has already experienced a catastrophic loss of influence, like a helicopter falling out of the sky.One other thing on which they all agree is that they all agree. Despite British diplomatic attempts to ide and rule, the unity of the 27 has held and is constantly stressed. As a result, Ireland has effectively had a veto over the negotiation result – probably the first time in a long bilateral history that it has been more powerful than Britain. This unity results from an unusual combination of strength and weakness. The EU’s bargaining position is exceptionally strong because Britannia has put a pistol to her own head and said, “Give us a good deal or I will shoot myself.” Yet, because of all those other crises, there is also a pervasive sense of weakness. This translates into a conviction, repeatedly made explicit by Angela Merkel, that Britain’s position outside the EU must be seen to be worse than that of anyone inside.Behind this united front, there are different tendencies. A small minority positively wants Britain to leave the EU so that France, Germany and other core states can push ahead with making a federal union. Martin Selmayr, the secretary general of the European commission, is widely identified with this view.Others say the English – and they know Britain well enough to mean specifically the English, rather than the Scots, Irish or Welsh – need to be taught a lesson. “You English must have your noses rubbed in it,” one former EU foreign minister told me, “and discover how cold it is outside. Then, in 10 years’ time, you will come back with your tails between your legs.” A Dutch friend working for a European institution says the English must go through “a vale of tears”. Well, thanks a lot, my friends.Most of our fellow Europeans express various degrees of regret, but also want Britain to get on with it. This is Merkel’s position, reinforced by a certain sororal solidarity with her fellow female leader and vicar’s daughter, as Theresa May struggles to reach a compromise while angry men bray all around her.At the other end of the spectrum is a significant minority, especially of north Europeans and people with close British connections, who are deeply distressed at the prospect of Britain’s departure. In terms of actual policy, however, these tendencies converge in a common position. Even if there is, strictly speaking, no such thing as no deal, the EU badly wants to avert an improvised, chaotic Brexit. Merkel has led a chorus saying that the withdrawal agreement is not up for renegotiation. This is also intended to help May get it through parliament. In practice, insiders acknowledge that there could probably be a few tweaks, but nothing significant.Gobsmackingly, the wording of the declaration on the future relationship has yet to be agreed. All we have at the moment is seven pages of draft bullet points, full of waffle, but crucially envisaging “ambitious customs arrangements that build on the single customs territory provided for in the withdrawal agreement”. The current timetable foresees this declaration being agreed by Tuesday, with member states having 48 hours to evaluate it. It beggars belief that the outline of the UK-EU relationship for decades to come is being handled like a last-minute student essay crisis.While many in Westminster still blithely talk of renegotiation, people in Brussels are generally adamant that the EU would not extend article 50 just for more jaw-jaw. So the negotiation of a different future relationship would have to happen after Britain had left and would therefore be in an even weaker negotiating position. Moreover, if Britain were to move much further in the direction of Norway – not “for now”, which is a non-starter, but for good – that would require accepting freedom of movement.For the growing army of Britons, in all parties and from all walks of life, who are now persuaded that the only good way forward is a second referendum, the crucial question is how the EU would react to a parliamentary vote to make that happen – once May’s deal had been rejected, in the “meaningful vote”, as it now seems almost certain to be.On this variant, and only on this variant, the answers I have heard from the highest levels in the EU are entirely reassuring. Although one cannot guarantee in advance the attitude of every member state, the overwhelming consensus is that the EU would extend article 50 to allow time for any referendum in which one of the options would be to stay in the EU on the current terms. There’s a legal and political difficulty around the European elections, for which a redistribution of the British MEPs’ seats to other member states has already been decided on the assumption that Britain will leave on 29 March 2019. But that, my interlocutors agree, must not stand in the way of a much larger, historic prize. Many express a concern that if Britain voted to stay in by a narrow majority – say, 52-48 the other way – the UK would be an even more difficult, truculent partner, getting in the way of things that the rest of Europe needs to get on with. But that’s a risk they will take, albeit often reluctantly.So here’s the good news: Europe’s door is still open, if we decide in a people’s vote to turn around and stay in. Otherwise, we can swallow the deal May has negotiated and live unhappily ever after."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcb2e2b632b6c6de8d2ee23d7ea7ba31dab4a730/0_107_3203_1921/master/3203.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a7becb6181f7dc59c6b439e3ada1ff78","title":"facebook sheryl sandberg feminism","story":"Those feminists who were quick to embrace Sandberg should now publicly condemn her. Otherwise, they risk proving their critics rightThe latest New York Times investigation into the goings-on at Facebook is less of a revelation and more of a reiteration of what was already on the record about the powerful platform: not only does Facebook have a problem with the dissemination of propaganda by the alt-right, white nationalists, and international genocide purveyors, those who own and operate the site have known about this and have repeatedly chosen not to address it.Whether those problems are caused by Russians who sought to sway the 2016 election in favor of Donald Trump or the Myanmar military seeking to cleanse its state of the Rohingya people, Facebook has stubbornly delayed examining its role in geopolitical shifts all over the world. But people have been writing articles about the misdeeds of social media platforms for years, and little oversight, internal reform, or mass exodus of users ever follows.The newest piece did reveal one thing, however: the vital role COO Sheryl Sandberg played in all of this. This is not the story, however, of the one woman bravely speaking truth to power. Nor is it the ethical influence a celebrated feminist leader had on a company concerned primarily with protecting its economic well being and that of its shareholders. Rather, Sandberg yelled at her employee, Facebook’s security chief, for daring to investigate these issues, and then tried to cover up all he had found. Sandberg also played a pivotal role in lobbying top lawmakers in Washington DC to limit unwanted regulation and scrutiny.Sandberg, of course, became an aspirational heroine among mainstream, self-empowerment feminists with her 2013 book Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead. There, she urged women to join corporate culture, to reform workplaces from the inside, by striving to reach high levels of power and influence. While many feminists, mostly those originating from activist and not merely commentary classes, attacked Sandberg’s project of ambition and wealth from the beginning, she was defended by some of the most prominent names in feminism.Supporters such as Gloria Steinem, former Jezebel editor Anna Holmes, Naomi Wolf, and New York Times columnist Michelle Goldberg lent a feminist legitimacy to Sandberg’s work, and helped deflect legitimate criticism about her blindness to class, race, or the lived experience of the majority of workers in an age of wild income inequality and financial precarity.This New York Times investigation is the logical endpoint of corporate feminism. Sandberg and her Lean In Foundation urged women to buy into the values of the contemporary workplace and then use their new positions of power to create a better, fairer workplace. Granted, Sandberg was writing about things like maternity leave and flexible work hours, not about what to do when your office becomes a shill for supporters of ethnic cleansing or a pure ethnostate.One, then, should look to Sandberg’s example and see what she actually used her influence for. From her position of power, Sandberg intimidated her employees into silence and wasn’t transparent with users about Russia’s part in the election of Trump, used her influence with politicians on both side of the aisle to avoid any much needed regulation and oversight by the government, and slandered her critics as anti-Semites.Why, then, when Facebook is rightly criticized for its machinations and manipulations is it always Mark Zuckerberg’s name being tossed around? Even now, with all of the revelations about Sandberg in the Times piece, the bulk of the public shaming is falling on his shoulders. He is the founder and CEO, yes, but it’s not a leap to guess that it is Sandberg’s feminist friends and affiliations that protects her from criticism.She must be the one reforming corporate boy’s club culture from the inside she must be the civilizing force barely keeping the organization from tipping into the abyss of greed and toxic masculinity. It seems clear what Sandberg truly is instead: a team player. And her team is not the working women of the world. It is the corporate culture that has groomed, rewarded, and protected her throughout her career.Which is why those feminists who were so quick to embrace Sandberg should now publicly condemn her. If feminism wants to claim any interest in the safety and quality of life of women – a demographic that includes those who have become victims in the rise of rightwing terrorists, many of whom organized and were radicalized online – the most visible spokespeople for the movement must distance themselves from a woman who prioritized profits over ethics and her job over countless lives.Because otherwise they will prove their critics right – critics who have argued that feminism has become more centered on the inidual than the structural become less interested in upending power imbalances than gaining the position of power and then using the imbalance to create profit and failed to reckon with and overcome its racist, classist, and heteronormative past.Sandberg offered herself up as a role model for working women, but now she’s looking more like a cautionary tale. She was right about one thing in Lean In: more women than ever before are entering the worlds of work and politics, and they have the power to create meaningful reforms. What has yet to be seen, however, is whether those reformers will bring truly feminist values to the world, or whether they will spread misery and pain."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a450f081a1caa5bd105bce570d2ca3937968b5d/0_0_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a0fca2e7383b2d8e5cd6efb2eab7a1e","title":"i couldnt go to the jobcentre i didnt have a cv building my business as a refugee","story":"When Moh Agha fled the war in Syria and arrived in the UK, he started selling books on ebay to support his family. Now he stocks more than 3,500 items and runs training courses for other refugees. This is how he got back in businessMoh Agha had a lot to take in when he first arrived in the UK with his young family in November 2013. “It’s not easy moving to a new country with a wife and two small children,” he says. “Everything was unfamiliar. We had no friends or family, it was very cold and people spoke very fast and with a strong accent.”After fleeing Syria for Saudi Arabia, the family arrived in the UK. “We moved from London to Bristol, then settled in Wolverhampton,” he says. “It wasn’t easy for me to go to the jobcentre, because I didn’t have a CV I’d always owned my own business. I wanted to open a shop, but it was very expensive because of council tax and business rates. I also found it hard to leave my wife Ranim and my daughters Yara and Amal (now 11 and six) at home alone, because they didn’t speak English. So when I discovered ebay and selling things from home, I realised it could be the solution.”Around this time, by chance, Agha attended a very British institution: the car boot sale. “I met a lady who was trying to sell old books – she had maybe 700 or 800 of them,” he recalls. “She didn’t want to take them home at the end of the day so she was giving them away for free. I took them back to my garage, sorted them out and listed 20 for sale on ebay. The next day all of the books were sold. I then listed the rest and spent the next six months looking around for more. The profit was small, but I was happy to be building a store and getting good feedback.”As Agha and his family began to build up a network of fellow Syrians between Manchester, London and Bristol, he realised that many in his community were struggling to find traditional items they missed from home. “I went to a big wholesaler in London and bought some Syrian kitchenware and house decorations and listed them,” he says. “I made a profit straight away and I realised that there was a real demand there, so I started to import more items from Egypt and Lebanon.”But building up an online store from scratch wasn’t without its challenges. “I’d watch videos explaining how to sell on ebay, but I couldn’t always understand them because they were in English or out of date,” he says. “I realised many people in my community needed these items, but didn’t know about ebay or were not sure how to use it. So I started making videos in Arabic, advertising my items and explaining how to make an ebay account and use PayPal.”Agha’s store, Almaskiya, now stocks 3,500 different items – from prayer mats to copper falafel makers – and he’s not just selling to the Syrian community anymore. “There’s a mould to make sweets that we use every Eid,” he says. “I made a 20-second video explaining how to use it, and now people from Europe are buying it at Christmas and Easter. We have orders for it every day now, actually. And there’s a metal straw that we use to drink tea in the Middle East. The idea came to me that people who drink coffee might want to use it to keep their teeth white. That’s become one of our bestsellers.”The business is growing – “we make a good profit in high season and we cover our costs the rest of the time” – but Agha hasn’t stopped there. “After I made the videos explaining ebay, a lot of people asked me how they could start selling too,” he says. Agha now runs free workshops around the UK for people interested in becoming ebay sellers. “Even though I know these people could become my competitors, I believe that everyone has their own strategy and their own way of doing things – and there’s room for millions of sellers. When I hear people thank me or say: ‘I’m going to pray for you’, or I see them start businesses with a good turnover, I feel proud,” he says. “It’s the best part of my day.” Millions of people are using ebay to start a side hustle, make more of a hobby or carve out a career.

Not only is it easier to take that first step, but it’s reassuringly non-scary. After all, there’s no risking it all to follow your dreams it is, by definition, a bit on the side. Unsurprisingly, the rise of the multitasking worker comes hand-in-hand with fewer people working in a traditional “job-for-life” role. According to HR organisation the CIPD, around a quarter of workers have been in a job for less than two years, as working on a project-by-project basis lessens the stigma around job-hopping (and creates more impressive-looking CVs).Simultaneously, advances in technology have led to general job security being called into question. I started my side hustle in 2010, when I began to suspect that my magazine job wasn’t going to be around in five years’ time, and have been earning money with a blog and consultancy business ever since. This means we’re quicker to move on and less likely to look back. “I resent the job-for-life notion,” says journalist and volunteer Georgie Bradley. “The idea of clocking in, chaining myself to the desk, then clocking out nine hours later seems soul-destroying.”Researching my book on multi-faceted careers, The Multi-Hyphen Method, I met many more people making side hustling an art. Janet Oganah is a prime example: a former family law barrister, she is now a civil servant and podcaster. “Choosing a multi-hyphenate lifestyle was not an easy decision,” she says. “But it was one of the best ones I have made. I was invested in my legal career I did important work that changed lives. But I was uneasy about relying on one income stream, particularly with the cuts to publicly funded work.” Oganah turned to podcasting as a lucrative, creative way of ersifying her career. For Sally Steel, a teacher who launched a crochet business on ebay, the flexibility was vital for family life: “I wanted to work more creatively and be able to do the school run. I started teaching part-time, building my business while my twins were asleep or at nursery,” she says. “It meant I could spend more time with my children while earning a living. And the happiness I feel at being my own creative boss is worth all the hard work.” This fulfilment is a key factor. For Emma Glass, a paediatric clinical research nurse and author, it’s achieved through the variety of her days. “I feel lucky to have opportunities in both nursing and writing,” she says. “I like working in a clinical environment and with patients, and then spending the evening with publishers and writers and having entirely different experiences within a single day.” Of course, nobody wants to have 17 jobs to make ends meet, and it would be irresponsible to glorify that, but embracing multiple skills to create a modern portfolio career is exciting. We’re told to pick one thing to be good at from our school days, but we all have so many skills and interests. Being a multi-hyphenate answers this, expanding our earning potential and giving us the flexibility to choose how and when we work. After all, says Sarah Kingston, writer, consultant and owner of a marketing agency: “I get to be creative, challenged and excited about what I do. Why have one job title when I can have three?”Millions of people are using ebay to start a side hustle, make more of a hobby or carve out a career.

Entrepreneurial experts share their hard-learned lessons, from the genuinely useful to what to avoidDon’t get lost in the crowdYou may think your product is better than everything else, but without something distinctive about it, it’s not going to stand out. “When I do consultancy work occasionally and, say, someone’s made a new T-shirt, I’ll say: ‘What’s so good about it?’” says Kuldip Singh Sahota, founder and chief executive of Mr Singh’s chilli sauces and crisps. “They’ll say, the fabric or design, but that’s what everyone says. What’s going to make you stand out? That’s where your brand and authenticity comes in, especially in such a crowded market.”Dave Bailey, a business coach and entrepreneur, agrees: “When you’re starting a new business, you have to get people to believe what you believe. And they’re never going to believe someone they think is fake or doing it for the wrong reasons.”Do have a good storyIt’s the entrepreneur who can spin a good yarn who gains a head start. For Sahota, that was the chilli sauce recipe his father Hardev “Pops” Singh Sahota had perfected over decades in the family’s shed in east London. They now sell sauces globally.“Everyone loves a good story, don’t they,” says Sahota. “It’s something customers can relate to but also, in our case, it helped us stand out with retailers who we wanted to stock our products.” To highlight the backstory, Sahota cast his father in a series of online comedy music videos to promote the brand.Don’t think all advice is good adviceIf launching a business or a product is like having a baby, entrepreneurs face a similar barrage of well-meaning, often contradictory advice from family, friends and a million business books. “Sarah Wood, the co-founder of the video ad tech company Unruly, once said the best piece of advice she ever got was that advice itself was overrated,” says startups’s Shane Donnelly.Sahota hates the kind of motivational self-help quotes that flood Instagram – “An investment in yourself pays the best interest” and all that sort of thing. “It starts off really well intentioned but it can really get on top of you after a while, so I ignore it all now,” he says.Do ask for experience not advice“A lot of advice is regret in disguise,” Bailey says. “Everyone’s got an experience, but rather than ask for advice, I often recommend asking for that experience.” In other words, not so much “what would you do?” but “what did you do?” – then make your own decision.“The worst advice I got was when I called this big wholesaler in east London and he said: ‘My biggest piece of advice for you is just quit, this is really hard’”, Sahota recalls. “And then he goes: ‘I’ll take a pallet off you if you want.’ And I remember thinking: ‘You told me to quit but you also want a pallet of my sauces? I’ll show you.’”Don’t stick with a product beyond its sell by dateBuilding a product around yourself only enhances your emotional attachment to your baby, but attachment parenting can be bad when things get tricky. “Where people come unstuck is they fall in love with their first creation and stay with it even when the evidence is against it,” says Bailey.“Holding a sentimental attachment to elements that just aren’t working will do your startup no long-term favours,” Donnelly adds.Do go back to the beginningIf sales or interest in your product aren’t what you had hoped, Bailey suggests going back to page one of your story. “Remember what it was that first motivated you,” he says. “What problem were you trying to solve? You have to be open to trying 10 or 20 different solutions and seeing what works.”For Sahota, the first element was working – his sauces were popular and central to his story – but to satisfy investors and progress as a business, he knew the answer was to make his crisps work. “And we should have made that move a lot sooner,” he says. “But I felt like I couldn’t look beyond the sauces unless I was dead.”Don’t look like an amateurIt doesn’t matter how good your story is if you come up short when talk turns serious. “You’ve got to have that nice soft exterior to connect but when you sit down with the supermarket or an investor, they have to know you mean business,” says Sahota. “You need to be able to say: ‘When you put my product on your shelves, I’ll drive customers in to your store because I’ve got followers who want it and I will add value to the category.’ That is hugely important for retailers.”Do ask the right questionsCustomer research is vital for any new business. “But people always ask their customers: ‘Would you use this product that does this cool thing,’” says Bailey. “But that’s a leading question. They’ll say: ‘Yes’ – and that looks like validation. But you should be asking about experience and behaviour.”Knowing how someone lives will help you to see how your product fits into people’s lives.To do this, Bailey suggests directing people to a landing page on your website and setting up a waiting list long before you launch anything, and then having a conversation with those people on the waiting list. “Even if you just get 10 people, that also means they feel the problem you’re trying to solve. And if nobody signs up, that tells you something, too.”Don’t fall into bad habitsKnowing how to structure each day – and what to do – can be tough for a solo starter, particularly one who has come out of an office environment. “You need to create really good habits straight away,” Sahota says. “There’ll be days when it’s really hard and those habits will get you through even if you’ve run out of willpower or motivation.” The sauce entrepreneur sets himself daily goals. “It could be something really simple like sending one really good email to a potential lead and following it with a phone call. On some days it’s good to set your goals low so you feel like you’ve achieved something.”Do take care of number one“Basically, get enough sleep and you’re halfway there,” Bailey says. “I used to work for a big consultancy, working all hours and travelling, and I hated the lifestyle. When I started my first business I was like: ‘I’m going to take my work-life balance seriously.’ Nonetheless, two years later, an investor turns to me during a crisis and says: ‘Dave, here’s what you’re going to do. You’re going to take a holiday for a week and come back to this fresh.’ It was what I needed.”Now you’re well versed in the major dos and don’ts, it’s time to get down to business.

My background’s made me very conscious of players’ body language and the way I communicate with them.”She is grateful for the insight and perspective offered by a taste of life outside the game’s hermetically sealed bubble. “Studying psychology and playing was difficult,” she says. “It took five years to complete my degree instead of three. But I’m so pleased I was persuaded into doing it, pushed into something different.”Although the WSL is fully professional, wages often remain low and careers can be short. Accordingly Oxtoby, who combines managing Bristol with running her own business, urges a young squad not to abandon part-time studies. “I’m massive on the importance of having dual careers,” she says. “I encourage the players to keep studying, to go out and get another skill set.”On the pitch, a side who, under Willie Kirk, finished a modest eighth last term had everyone taking note after early season draws with Chelsea and Manchester City and a win against Brighton. That run was sufficient to make Oxtoby the first female recipient of the League Managers Association manager of the month award.“It was a surprise and very much the players’ achievement,” she says. “But it was also good for the WSL we don’t want too much of a gap between the top sides and the rest.”Perhaps Australian coaches can bridge the chasm City and Chelsea had been threatening to create? After all, her compatriot Joe Montemurro holds the latest LMA WSL award after leading resurgent Arsenal to top spot.“We must be the solution,” jokes the daughter of an Indigenous Australian father and English mother who grew up 977 miles north of Perth in a remote iron ore mining outpost. “Wickham was real smalltown Australia, we didn’t even have a video store! But, as a child, I enjoyed incredible freedom.”Few of those who saw Oxtoby, then coached by her father, practising ball skills in Wickham envisaged her ultimately breaching the barriers involved in becoming a rare player of Indigenous heritage to star in the W-League.“I was told I’d never be able to play at that level, that I’d never be anywhere near good enough,” recalls the former defender who, eventually, swapped Perth Glory for a contract with Doncaster Belles. “So now I’m proud to be a positive role model for young Aboriginals. I still go back, talk to them and try to give them a positive story. It’s important to show that, with hard work, they, too, can make it.”After a youth largely spent outdoors, with a warm beach invariably close by, forging a new life in England was initially even tougher than “adjusting to all the rules and restrictions” which confronted her after she was dispatched to boarding school as a teenager.“I still miss the Australian sun every day,” Oxtoby says. “But Bristol and the people here are great I’m really enjoying it. I’ve adjusted to the dull skies and cool temperatures and got some warm clothes! But my first 12 months in England were very hard.”If overcoming such culture shock proved testing, her coaching career has been punctuated by challenge. Embracing professional psychology and assorted women’s football roles, it eventually took her to Birmingham, where last season she served as Marc Skinner’s assistant.Suitably impressed, Bristol offered Oxtoby a frontline debut last summer. “Other coaches had more experience,” she says. “But they obviously saw something in me.”So far at least, the WSL’s first psychologist-turned-manager looks an inspired choice."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36bdb780a4384f59553bbb3da18fa0233734b7c4/0_11_3200_1920/master/3200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c0d25306101214b0b8b6f763ed1b448b","title":"gordon taylor football fattest cat pfa","story":"What would your reaction be if I were to point out that in the past week Gordon Taylor has quietly passed the 40th anniversary since he took his place at football’s top table and set about the process of transforming himself from a barrel-chested inside‑forward at Bury, from the puddles and potholes of the old Third Division, into a life of establishment wealth?If you could put aside any cynicism, try not to dwell too long on the deficiencies of his organisation and overlook that it is traditionally he, not Richard Scudamore, who is the real Bagpuss of football’s fat-cat culture, it might even be possible to manage some grudging admiration for such a feat of longevity.When Taylor replaced Derek Dougan as chairman of the Professional Footballers’ Association on 13 November, 1978, the other stories of the time included a strike of bakery workers that had led to bread rationing. Watership Down was at the pictures. A pint of milk cost 11p and the average annual salary was £5,440. Taylor had chestnut hair, a kipper tie and a boy-next-door look. If, without wishing to be too cruel, you lived next door to a boy who turned out to be monotone, isive, wildly over‑remunerated and puffed up with self-importance.In fairness to the old boy, nobody could argue that, on a personal level, his professional life has not been a success when Taylor has hived off preposterously large amounts of money for himself, held a position of influence for four decades and been decorated in the 2008 New Year honours list with an OBE that I am reliably assured doesn’t stand for Other Buggers’ Efforts.Taylor’s first interview as chairman, three years before taking the chief executive role, emphasised his desire to create a better understanding between players, their clubs and referees. He might not have succeeded on that front but he must have done something right to last so long and, though it is a challenge sometimes to remember exactly what that is, he did earn the accolade from the Times in 1985 for being “undoubtedly the most impressive administrator and negotiator in football”. Most heroically, you might recall, when the big television money arrived and he threatened a players’ strike unless his union clawed its way to a decent wedge.The Premier League duly came up with an offer to settle everything amicably. Gordon’s response, true to form, was that they might have to be a lot more amicable than that.Out of that, he hasn’t done too badly bearing in mind we live in an age when marvelling, queasily, at the sums he pays himself feels like an annual part of the football calendar. Last year, the PFA’s accounts revealed it was £2.29m. Previously, his earnings multiplied almost three fold, from £1.13m to £3.37m after bonuses. Which is nice work if you can get it: Taylor was not just raking in more than any other trade union boss on the planet, but upwards of Didier Deschamps and Joachim Löw, managers of the last two World Cup‑winning sides.It is no wonder he has taken exception that Ben Purkiss, the current PFA chairman, has broken ranks by calling for an independent review into how the organisation is run and the possibility, ultimately, of regime change. “Sometimes you have to make a stand for what is right,” Purkiss says. “Football is rapidly evolving, players are rapidly evolving and the PFA needs to evolve, too. Players past, present and future need a PFA for the modern player.” Which is one way of saying the organisation is stuck in a time warp.Taylor, of course, will see it differently and perhaps we should be no longer surprised by the self‑interest at this end of the sport when the Strange Case of Richard Scudamore’s Golden Handshake has given us another eye-watering glimpse into the football bubble over the last week. The news of Bruce Buck, Chelsea’s chairman, arranging for the Premier League’s chief executive – a friend with whom he goes shooting, we are informed – to receive a £5m farewell gift, comprising £250,000 from each club, was certainly a spectacular low. Though we probably should not be surprised that Taylor was conspicuous by his absence in the stampede to point that out. It must be quite hard, I suspect, lecturing about money when one Premier League chairman has previously accused Taylor of “building a mausoleum of greed” and, lest it be forgotten, the PFA’s leader once signed a hush-hush £700,000 payment from News International for being a victim of phone-hacking, as opposed to exposing a scandal he might have reasonably assumed had affected his members. As the News of the World’s lawyers put it in a letter to the Commons culture, media and sport committee, Taylor’s legal team was operating with the clear instructions he “wanted to be vindicated or made rich”.If nothing else, he has achieved that last ambition. I do wonder, though, if there is ever a flicker of embarrassment when he considers that his last reported salary was more than four times the amount the PFA paid that year in benevolent grants for the thousands of former professionals it is supposed to represent and look after.Does the thought occur that the financial distribution can look wildly disproportionate, callous even, when there are so many veterans of the sport hobbling around on arthritic joints or struggling in some cases, through the fog of irreparably damaged minds, to remember the days when they pulled on a football strip? Can Gordon look in the mirror and tell himself, hand on heart, that his priorities have not been badly distorted when most reasonable people might assume the principal purpose of the PFA is to care for the members who have addictions, mental health issues, serious financial difficulties and so on? Is he so brass-necked he can possibly find justification that an organisation with £50m in the bank has, according to Purkiss, spent only £100,000 on its studies into dementia? Or that it was 2002 when the PFA, together with the Football Association, announced a joint 10-year research programme but not until late 2017, unforgivably, that they decided it was time to go through with it properly?The family of Jeff Astle, one of the men who suffered catastrophic brain trauma from repeatedly heading the ball, has already called for Taylor to resign. Astle was 59 when he died and maybe you caught the BBC Inside Out feature when Dawn, the daughter of the former England and West Bromwich Albion striker, walked out of a meeting at PFA headquarters with the man who should have been offering her, and the sport as a whole, more than watery excuses. Not that the evidence of Taylor’s jumbled priorities is restricted to just the one matter. It intrigues me, for example, that the PFA can fork out nearly £2m for an LS Lowry painting, plus £70,000 every year on a box at Manchester City and goodness knows how much more on a museum’s worth of other football memorabilia, but will donate only £125,000 annually to keep the chronically under-resourced Kick It Out ticking over.I also wonder if it ever crosses Gordon’s mind that when the Dispatches documentary Football’s Wall of Silence highlighted, in 1997, the monstrous crimes committed by Barry Bennell, as well as flagging up the very significant likelihood of other paedophiles lurking within the sport, that was the point the leader of the PFA should have recognised there was a serious problem, rather than when Andy Woodward came forward, via the , almost 20 years later.It has not been easy for the FA, Manchester City and some of the other clubs who are most seriously implicated in football’s sexual-abuse scandal to understand why more was not done at the time, mostly because they are investigating regimes that are long gone. But the PFA and Gordon Taylor don’t have that get-out clause. He was there. He has been full-time at the PFA since 1980 and chief executive since 1981.Can he understand, therefore, why so many of the victims are looking his way, wondering why the PFA – the players’ union, for heaven’s sake – is guilty of, at best, a startling lack of curiosity? Or why Deborah Davies, the brilliant journalist who put together the documentary for Channel 4, says his apparent inaction – “I wasn’t aware of any serious commitment by Gordon Taylor to investigate” – was particularly shocking given that he had helped to develop a youth training scheme programme throughout the game? “That was the 1980s,” she says, “when so many of those 16-year-olds had endured years of sexual abuse, partly because they felt no one in the professional game would support them if they spoke out.”As you might expect, the PFA has shifted its priorities, post-Woodward, and been particularly obliging to SAVE, one of the survivors’ groups. But the point remains: how many boys could have been saved if the relevant authorities had acted differently at the time? Some of the letters and other messages that reached the PFA after Dispatches were heartbreaking. And if Clive Sheldon, the QC in charge of the FA’s independent inquiry, makes the same observation, as he undoubtedly should, it feels perfectly reasonable to suggest Taylor should do the decent thing and walk.Don’t bet on it, though. There is a reason why the Daily Mail’s Charlie Sale described Taylor as “untouchable” recently, surrounded by some loyal allies in an organisation that has the feel sometimes of a personalty cult, dominated by one man. The PFA has some good people among its ranks. It is also desperately in need of modernisation and the bottom line here is perfectly simple: it will never happen until there has been a change at the top.What puzzles me, more than anything, is the general reaction throughout football when the sport is reminded of Taylor’s elastic principles. The time, for instance, it was reported that the man who backed a “zero-tolerance” policy towards gambling had splurged £4m on 2,000 bets and owed a bookmaker more than £100,000. Or you might remember his efforts to bar the agent Rachel Anderson from his organisation’s annual dinner because he wanted a men-only event the cack-handed apology after likening Ched Evans to the Hillsborough justice campaigners the tragicomedy of Reginald D Hunter’s N-word routine at the PFA’s 2013 awards do and on and on. Every time, the sport seems to roll its eyes, nod knowingly and accept that is the way Gordon Taylor OBE operates. Nobody, until now, seems willing to take him on properly and ask whether it should be better, and what needs to be done about it.Perhaps that is because he is not an easy man to take on. Purkiss now says he has been informed his eligibility as chairman is under question, on the grounds that the 34-year-old defender is currently a non-contract player at Walsall. It stinks, and once again I am reminded of what Gareth Southgate said about loving the sport but not necessarily liking the industry. Though, strictly speaking, it was William McGregor, founder of the Football League, who made the point first. McGregor was quoted, in 1909, in League Football and the Men Who Made It. “Beware of the clever, sharp men who are creeping into the game,” he said, very astutely."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d638591107a7a30b83277106561d7baf17b4192/0_89_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=306690f79e9076c582b96dd8d8d27a4a","title":"food clothes medicine the people of yemen just want the same life as us","story":"After spending years amid Yemen’s devastation, I have seen conflict and hardship overtake millions of ordinary peopleThe women wanted two things: food and cash.Hunger was a constant. Their families were skinny, and the children had no shoes.Their dinner pot held watery flour. Some meals they added a tomato. The kids weren’t going to school, a cruel irony considering these Yemeni residents – families displaced by war – were living in a classroom, 20 people in total. Stories like these, reported from our team in Hodeida only last week, are becoming more and more common.Even in peacetime, life in Yemen could be difficult. But when you add a long war to the mix, one that has had crushing effects on the average family, you end up close to catastrophe.The wave of severe hunger that humanitarians have been warning about will steamroll the country if there’s no major change. Over the past two months, there has been a massive deterioration in what is available at affordable prices. As the value of the Yemeni rial drops, people simply can’t buy enough food.This intensifying hunger, now moving towards potential famine, will exacerbate the already fragile health situation. More malnutrition will make outbreaks of cholera, measles and diphtheria even worse.In short, we’re talking about a country – one that until now was recently partially developed and functioning – now careering toward absolute devastation.Without a political solution we are going to face a disaster of a size and intensity that the world has not seen in a long time.Way back in 2007, when I arrived in Yemen for the first time, conflict was localised, focused on areas like Sa’ada. The conflict then grew, affecting thousands. Today, with war now in multiple big cities, many, many millions are suffering.Of a population of 28 million people, nearly 18 million survive with the help of food assistance. More than half of the healthcare structures in the country are closed. And with families now having so little buying power, they often must make the excruciating choice between food and medical care.I will soon leave Yemen, after almost three straight years of work here, work that the International Committee of the Red Cross carries out on all sides. A sad but simultaneously hopeful part of my job: this year, we have given out food for one month to nearly 850,000 people. As frontline prisons are often forgotten in conflict, we have also provided food for those incarcerated.Most government workers have not been paid in more than two years. Medical staff are not being paid, yet continue to show up to help people in medical need – a demonstration of true dedication.That’s why those families in that school in Hodeida asked for cash. They are desperate for food, for clothes, for medical care. And they want to make their own decisions. They want life to return to normal.Johannes Bruwer is the outgoing head of delegation for the International Committee of the Red Cross in Yemen, where he has been based on and off for the past decade, including the past three years."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45ccb9e20ecdab57671159f625bf51894eac0b97/0_190_5700_3420/master/5700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c6e7363c927b96a6b0f5d53b005880c","title":"tell us who do you share your home with","story":"As part of a new series in the ’s Weekend magazine we are looking for interesting pairs who live togetherOur notion of the traditional household is changing.

As you pass the shop’s windows, the eye is caught by items ranging from comfy sofas to chainsaws.Mike Webb, who runs the store with his two brothers, said: “Shopworkers and workers do what they do because they love it. That makes a difference. Everyone pulls together. When we did a litter pick and clean-up in the high street recently more than 150 people turned out. I think our regular customers and our visitors feel that this is a special place.”Crickhowell High Street, in an ancient town in the Brecon Beacons national park in Wales, was particularly jolly on Friday, having been crowned the overall winner in the government-run Great British High Street Awards 2018.At a time when many high streets up and down the UK are in the doldrums and struggling to survive, Crickhowell (Welsh name: Crug Hywel) is bucking the trend.Every shop is occupied and when plans to move a national supermarket into a disused pub on the high street were afoot, the town fought back. It argued that nine shops, among them two butchers, a baker and a florist, would be hit. The town won the day.“We are competitors but we work together,” said Raymond Grenfell, the owner of Grenfell’s \u0026amp Sons grocery store. He intended to stay just six months. That was 50 years ago.Emma Corfield-Walters, the owner of the Book-ish book shop, was given an inidual High Street Hero award for the role she has played in making the street so vibrant. “I put it down to people power,” she said.Cynics may claim the town’s high street is thriving because of its well-heeled residents.Corfield-Walters insists thatisn’t fair: “Like any town we have our social issues. And the shops haven’t come in on a wave of money. Some have been here for generations.”MT Cashell, the butcher’s, for example, has been in the town for 44 years. Josh Cashell, 22, was serving Black Mountain beef and Crickhowell lamb chops on Friday. He conceded it might be possible to buy meat cheaper elsewhere. “But the quality won’t be as good. You may get some things cheaper in a supermarket but it won’t be as good. Our meat comes from a few miles away.”Elsewhere in the UK, high street stores are being battered by a raft of threats, including a major change in shopping habits. Consumers are buying more online – about a quarter of fashion is now sold on the internet –and choosing to spend more on experiences such as leisure and holidays.Stores have also faced a big increase in business rates, higher labour costs as a result of a rise in the national living wage and a squeeze on spending power, with real wages still lower than before the financial crisis a decade ago. According to the British Retail Consortium, about 85,000 retail jobs have been lost this year.In Crickhowell, there is a determination to find new ways of thriving. After the supermarket plan was defeated, a limited company with 273 shareholders was set up to renovate three shops – among them a zero-waste shop called Natural Weigh – and three flats. The re-imagined Corn Exchange opened in July.Dean Christy, the managing director of the Corn Exchange Crickhowell, said he believed what had been achieved could be copied elsewhere. “It helps if there’s a threat like the supermarket plan and you need the opportunity. But more than anything you need passion.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92e96375441ba71b39e84fd30a0d033ec67cdae1/0_0_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d5ecded07a0bd206bbfecbe470a23ec","title":"blind date i hoped he was my date","story":"Jonathan, 30, civil servant, and Oliver, 28, masters student What were you hoping for?Is it corny to say love at first sight?

About me being childless about other women. But I’ve never written about men in the same situation. Why should I? If Mick Jagger can have a child who’s younger than his great-grandchild, there’s always hope. Right?Wrong. Dr Robin Hadley, 58, and childless by circumstance, recently completed a PhD exploring the experiences of involuntarily childless older men. “I found,” he says, “there was little difference in the desire to become a parent between female and male childless iniduals. But that study also indicated that for some male participants, not becoming a parent had a greater negative effect. That’s because there are no narratives around childlessness for men.”The narratives for childless women can be awful, but they are changing, because we are talking and writing about them. But for men? Hadley, founder of wantedtobeadad, says, “If a man tells you, ‘I’m infertile’, that’s a really big statement. He’s opening himself up to being seen as lesser somehow, and being judged.”Do men get the pity treatment? “No. But people think I’m weird,” says Kelsey, 43, a designer, and also childless by circumstance. “The idea of a 43-year-old man who isn’t married, who doesn’t have a family… People think it’s odd. I’m not sure I’d feel so weird if I were a 43-year-old woman who didn’t have a family. There’s a plethora of films and TV shows about kooky, cool women. It’s been addressed in our culture. But there isn’t a 43-year-old man who’s single and cool: he’s a loser and he lives in his mum’s basement.“I know women feel they’re ignored,” Kelsey adds, “but they are listened to and their thoughts are engaged with and debated – at least more than men’s. I know a woman will feel childlessness way worse than me – of course – but there is also a biological instinct for men. I always wanted a child. It’s one of the most profound things you can do.”Do men get physically broody? Hadley says, “My interest in involuntarily childless men is in part due to my own sense of broodiness. Within women’s cycles, there’s a time when they are broody and want to have sex. It would be a bit mad biologically if there wasn’t a drive in men to have sex at certain times, too. There’s an actual feeling – ‘I want to have babies’ – on a core level.”Kelsey agrees: “I was really desperate for children, even in my early 20s. Because of my own childhood, I wanted a son. I never thought about having a daughter. I knew I couldn’t change my childhood, which was traumatic, but I thought I could give a child – a boy – the childhood I didn’t have. I thought I’d be a really good dad.“The first time it hit me that I might not have children was when I turned 30. I was upset and talking to my friends and they said, ‘It will happen. You’ll see.’ But I had a feeling it wouldn’t. Then I hit 40 and another low: a feeling of, it’s really not going to happen now.”Jody Day, founder of Gateway Women, the global friendship and support network for childless women, talks about the importance of finding your “tribe”, the women who really understand what you’re feeling there’s no “As a mother” or “You can have my children if you want!” ridiculousness with them. How do childless men cope without a tribe?Silvers has written a play, Terry And Jude, about two older, single men and the impact of childlessness on their lives his short film, England Expects, explores the IVF journey. Why did he create them? “Writing is my form of therapy. Some people talk, I write. I wanted to do rather than think. I’d never really explored this in my head or my heart, never talked about it, because at the time I was just there for my girl, for her agony.Not having a child is the worst thing that has happened to me – the pain, the loss, the grief, the depression, the “meaning fuck-all in society” icing on a rotten cake. Do men feel the same way?In one study, Hadley interviewed 10 men, “most of whom said their childlessness contributed to depression. You start thinking, how am I performing economically? Socially? And if I’m not performing well economically and I’m not doing well socially, and I’m not reproducing biologically – then what am I as a man?“When I was really broody in my 30s, I was very frustrated by all this,” Hadley says. “But I just kept it to myself: being a bit depressed and withdrawn throwing myself into work, into drink. Now, because of my research, I don’t feel shame.The loss will always be there, Silvers says. “The whole thing is grief – for a baby, for my marriage – but what do you do with that? Let it eat you away, or accept it and do something positive with it? The reason I did the film and play was for other childless blokes to know they’re not the only ones.”And what about the Mick Jaggers? “Don’t buy into the Mick Jagger myth that men are fertile from puberty to death,” Hadley says. “Jagger has elite status – he’s not the bloke down Aldi. If you’re 75, an ordinary bloke, and you have a baby, you will get a different sort of attention.”“It’s bullshit that I’m biologically able to have kids when I’m older,” Kelsey says. “Yes, I can. But is it ethically OK? It’s selfish. I could have a child when I’m 50. And be 68 when he is 18. Ridiculous. There has to be a cut-off point. A lot of my devastation at not having kids has already passed. But there is a sense of loss when I see a quiet little boy and he’s reading a book in a restaurant or something, and I think: what a lovely little kid. I can see the joy between the parent and the child, but that’s a million times bigger when you can look at his face and he looks like you. He’s part of you. I can’t imagine what that feels like.”• Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure the discussion remains on the topics raised by the article.Commenting on this piece?

I go to bed about midnight and, as soon as my head hits the pillow, I’m gone. There have been times when I haven’t even heard the end of a sentence.Eat It’s taken me three years to learn that just because I work in the food industry, it doesn’t mean that I have to eat every minute of every day. After Bake Off I put on a stone. Now, if I am hungry I’ll eat, and if I’m not, I won’t. Once a month we have dessert for dinner and my kids don’t have to have anything savoury if they don’t want to. They can have custard on top, or cream – whatever they want.Work In an average week I’ll be testing recipes, doing a voice-over, filming and writing. I cram everything in Monday to Friday because I refuse to give up the weekend. I am not the kind of person who narrates every aspect of my life on social media it’s about posting things that are important to me. One recent post was about the fact that I suffer from panic disorder I know sharing that fact helped a lot of people.Family I am away for days at a time but Abdal is still an awful cook. He makes up for it by helping me clear the kitchen when I’m recipe-testing, and doing the laundry and the vacuuming. I always say to my kids, “It’s not a restaurant, I’m not your maid, the house is a shared responsibility.” They help with the cooking and clean the toilet.Fun We always go on a bike ride early on a Saturday morning. We have two lounges and the “flounge” is our fun lounge, where we have a PlayStation and Wii and play board games on a Friday night. It sounds a bit Playboy mansion, but I have just ordered a beautiful purple velvet sofa for the flounge.

It’s an absent-minded ritual when I see ripe seed. I guess it makes me feel safe to walk around with a potential garden in my pockets.I don’t think the apocalypse is coming, but Brexit is, and the climate is changing. We need seed that can cope with these things, seed that can adapt to our soils and our climate.Most of our seed is produced in places with drier climates and cheaper labour. We need a UK-wide system based on organic, open-pollinated seed. Open-pollinated seed breeds true, meaning that, after pollination by natural means – either an insect, bird, wind or human hands – with another representative of the same variety or by self-pollination, the offspring will be roughly identical to its parents. The “roughly” bit matters because this seed is not uniform. It closely resembles its parents, has their characteristics, but it also has its own genetic ersity, and that means adaptability and resilience to changing conditions. The variations may be subtle (perhaps it ripens a bit earlier), or it may wears its ersity like a badge (a multicoloured cob of corn, say).You can’t do this to open-pollinated seed: a grower can buy seed, save their own and continue to do so for as long as they care. This is called seed sovereignty and there’s a growing worldwide movement to create more of it. It aims to reclaim bioerse seed, to give growers the right to breed and exchange erse, open-pollinated seed that can be saved by anyone.The Gaia Foundation set up the seed sovereignty programme in the UK and Ireland to support and develop an ecologically sustainable seed system. Real Seeds in Wales has been leading the way for years, but there’s an increasing band of independent suppliers of vegetable, herb and flower seeds including the Seed Co-Operative in Spalding and Vital Seeds in Devon.The programme aims to support such seed producers and create more, training small-scale growers, market gardeners, farmers and home growers to conserve threatened seeds and breed new varieties for future resilience. Seed Week starts on 3 December and urges anyone who grows to buy their seed from UK organic or open-pollinated seed producers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29154973f074960f0af69cc6dd7f29cd56de0967/0_50_2016_1210/master/2016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=09e9e989b476cafc49db8d6d0e45625a","title":"guardian passes 1m mark in reader donations katharine viner","story":"Business model showing way for journalism to ‘regain its relevance’, says editor-in-chiefMore than a million people worldwide have contributed to the  in the last three years, with 500,000 paying to support the publication on an ongoing basis, according to  News and Media’s editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner.She said the business model was showing a new way for journalism to “regain its relevance, meaning and trusted place in society”.Viner told the Society of Editors’ annual conference in Salford that many contributors donated specifically because they wanted the  to stay free and outside a paywall, so “progressive journalism can have the widest possible impact”.“Many readers didn’t understand the challenging commercial reality facing all news organisations, but once we told them more, they expressed real interest in wanting to support the ,” she said. “This was helped by the fact that any money made by the  has to be spent on journalism, because of our ownership structure with no shareholders or owner.“This entirely new revenue stream of monthly and one-off contributions is now a crucial part of our plan to get the  to break even by next April.

News organisations must never de-prioritise the vital skill of finding things out, getting to the facts, and reporting them clearly,” she said.At the same time, she said, the  had a responsibility to use its journalistic platform to develop ideas and not just critique what was going wrong in the world.“ will always embrace progressive policies and ideas, but in an age of filter bubbles and hyper-partisan politics, we must also make space for different ideas, and erse opinions,” she said. “Our guiding focus will be to challenge the economic assumptions of the past three decades, which have extended market values such as competition and self-interest far beyond their natural sphere and seized the public realm.” News and Media is aiming to break even this financial year after many years of losses and Viner said initiatives such as the relaunch of  Weekly as a glossy magazine were exceeding expectations, with its biggest group of new subscribers millennials.Viner also used her speech to pay tribute to her predecessor Alan Rusbridger as a fantastic editor who understood and embraced the digital revolution. The former Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre criticised Rusbridger in his lecture on Sunday night.“His record on investigations in the public interest was exceptional, a model for how to hold the powerful to account,” Viner said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0526103a0c5e197a4c1d0f1e9206434ccd2b5600/248_98_1540_924/master/1540.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ec49c73b6390e2cd1340069190cfe8df","title":"bbc women complain andrew neil tweet observer journalist carole cadwalladr","story":"Senior female journalists say deleting comment about Carole Cadwalladr not enoughSenior female BBC journalists have complained to executives at the corporation about the presenter Andrew Neil, after he failed to apologise for calling an Observer journalist a “mad cat woman”.Neil, the host of the late night show This Week and one of the corporation’s most high-profile political interviewers, made the comment about Carole Cadwalladr – whose work helped expose the Cambridge Analytica scandal – as part of a string of tweets posted in the early hours of Tuesday.The language echoed that used by Leave.EU’s founder, Arron Banks, who has regularly branded Cadwalladr a “mad cat lady” during her investigation into his Brexit activities and business empire – comments widely criticised as misogynistic.Neil later deleted the tweets and retweeted a statement from the BBC press office saying he “recognises it was inappropriate” to send the message.But the BBC journalists, who declined to be identified because of potential repercussions, said this was not enough and confirmed complaints had been made to executives about the “sexist” comment on Neil’s combative Twitter account.They also highlighted the “bizarre” juxtaposition of Neil’s criticism of Cadwalladr – whom he dubbed “Karol Kodswallop” and likened to a character from The Simpsons, Eleanor Abernathy – with comments made the following day by the BBC director general, Tony Hall, who said he was appalled by the abuse journalists receive on Twitter.Two senior BBC women also expressed exasperation that the corporation took some female presenters off air earlier this year for impartiality reasons after they tweeted support for equal pay at the corporation, but BBC bosses did not punish Neil for a tweet criticising an inidual at the heart of a major political story.Another BBC journalist complained that “when producers tweet something stupid they are left to swing in the wind” but Neil was given greater freedom due to his status in the corporation.The BBC would not comment on speculation that Neil had refused to formally apologise over the comments. A spokesperson said: “Andrew acknowledges that the tweet was inappropriate, and it was removed shortly after it was posted. The tweet was sent from Andrew’s personal account, however the BBC has social media guidelines which it expects all staff to follow and these have been discussed with Andrew.”The tweets were sent at around 3.15am UK time, but Neil has said he was in the United Arab Emirates to present an awards ceremony. He is the longstanding chair of the Dubai-based publishing company ITP Media Group.Neil, a former Sunday Times editor, often uses his Twitter account to promote pieces published by the rightwing magazine the Spectator. He is chair of its parent company, Press Holdings, which is owned by the billionaire Barclay Brothers.The BBC has previously insisted that, regardless of his personal views, Neil abides by strict impartiality rules and treats politicians of all parties equally while on air.In his tweets Neil also criticised the BBC’s political satire show The Mash Report as “self satisfied, self adulatory, unchallenged leftwing propaganda”.“When it comes to so-called comedy the BBC has long given up on balance, on radio and TV. Nobody seems to care. And I don’t want rightwing comedy, whatever that is. I’d just like comedy. Which is in really short supply. On TV and radio.”He also said the Primal Scream singer Bobby Gillespie, who recently looked on stony-faced as Neil danced on the set of This Week, was a “miserable jock” who likes to “spout Corbynista propaganda from his fancy Islington pad”.Neil has cut back on his TV commitments since marrying Susan Nilsson in a 2015 ceremony in the south of France. In addition to This Week he presents Wednesday’s prime minister’s questions edition of Politics Live."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9decace90bb0a15a7e8889e2046f27a3ce61b2be/0_72_6585_3951/master/6585.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02a76ce2cdd66493d5bfd7d4376ac655","title":"support guardian readers future journalism","story":"By supporting our journalism, you can become part of a global community of over a million  readers with a shared set of core values and a vision for a more hopeful worldThank you to the 1,000,000  readers who have offered us their support over the past three years.

They’ve all had problems using, or been left holding, worthless gift cards after the chain went into administration.With Christmas fast approaching, and reports into the dire state of the high street, consumers are being advised to break the gift card habit and give something else this year – because it’s a Santa certainty that some people who ignore this advice will end up throwing away their cash.Gift cards and voucher sales are worth £6bn a year in the UK, but have long been a poor choice. In 2014 the government warned that £300m is wasted each year because the recipient either loses them, they expire or they can’t spend the balance.The fact that the climate for high street retailers has significantly worsened since then makes gift cards a double no-go this winter. Ask House of Fraser customers how the gift cards and vouchers worked out for them this year.When HMV went into administration in January 2013 the company at first refused to accept vouchers before backtracking. When BHS followed suit, shoppers with gift vouchers were only allowed to use them as part-payment for goods. Other gift card failures include ToysRUs, Maplin, Oddbins, Bench and American Apparel.When a company ceases trading or calls in administrators ahead of a sale to a rival (House of Fraser) the new owner has no obligation to honour the gift cards or vouchers. Those with a £100 gift card from a failed store have to join the other creditors of the company. In reality, most holders never see a penny of their balance.In a bid to retain some goodwill – and to restore confidence in the brand – the new owner may decide to accept vouchers, but with caveats. Following the Sports Direct takeover, House of Fraser initially said it would replace the gift cards. After long delays some customers have received replacements, but others complain they are still out of pocket. Now the company says anyone who had not sent in their gift card by 31 October has lost their money.Similar worries face Evans Cycles customers who bought or were given e-vouchers to buy cycling accessories. The company called in administrators at the end of October. It was immediately bought by Mike Ashley’s Sports Direct. This week signs in 62 stores, and online, warned that the company was unable to accept the firm’s gift cards or vouchers, though it later said it would start accepting them. It has also stopped selling new ones – which could be a merciful relief.Martyn James, of consumer advocacy firm Resolver, says gift cards are loaded with catches, time limits and unfriendly conditions.“Every year, big retailers make a fortune off unclaimed or out of date gift cards and vouchers. Gift cards have expiry dates that aren’t always obvious – sometimes as little as six months. Others require you to spend the entire amount in one go – and you don’t get change or get to leave the credit on the card.He says users with £50 on a card might spend £42, but lose the rest, which is why you see lots of people in January grumpily buying socks they don’t need.However the bigger worry at the moment is the fear the firm will go bust. My advice to anyone who gets a gift card is to spend it as soon as they can, no matter if the business seems to be doing well,” he says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c2738bc552881bfa524e4f9141650ada6a3b44e/0_0_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac83803948248c5b096350e32229fded","title":"quality build homes charles church buyers","story":"Charles Church claims its homes are of ‘unrivalled design and quality’ – but some buyers feel badly let downWhen Victoria Baker and her husband opened the door to their brand new £380,000 five bedroom home in Ingleby Barwick, near Stockton, they were thrilled to finally move into what they thought would be their perfect home.Instead they say they were confronted by a catalogue of issues that has left them stressed and put a strain on their marriage. “It’s been horrific,” admits Baker, 36, who moved into their Charles Church home with Gavin, 35, and their two children in June.“We noticed leaks straight away as we were putting things away under the sink – there was a pool of water under the sink in the kitchen.” They say a stream of further leaks – the downstairs toilet, the sink in their en suite, and the shower in the main bathroom – also appeared.It wasn’t just the plumbing that was a problem. The day after they moved in, the couple say their lounge window cracked later the couple say they encountered about 15 windows with scratches and a hole under the carpet in the lounge.“At first when it was a couple of things, we laughed about it and said, ‘bloody hell, this is bad luck kind of thing’ but then it was like, ‘what have we bought?’” says Baker, an occupational therapist.“We were dealing with customer service going backwards and forwards to get stuff done, they’d never answer the phone, there’d always be calls back. It was really stressful. It was a massive strain on the marriage. Me and Gavin could have split over it. It’s driven us to that point. Our world was consumed by the house and we were panicking over whether it would get sorted.”Baker is just one of a number of Charles Church homeowners who claim to have experienced problems with their brand new homes. On Facebook, groups run by some of those who say they live on Charles Church estates often feature complaints about poor workmanship, and one group is named “Charles Church (Persimmon) Homes From Hell”.Charles Church is the “premium” brand of Britain’s biggest builder, Persimmon, which reported pretax profits of £516.3m for the six months to 30 June, up from £457.4m the year before. Meanwhile, earlier this year its chief executive, Jeff Fairburn, was awarded a £75m bonus – although this was cut from £100m following a shareholder revolt. Fairburn left Persimmon earlier this month “at the company’s request”.When Rebecca Hughes, 34, and her family moved into her £350,000 detached home, which had been used as a show house, on Charles Church’s Hatchell Grange estate in Doncaster, she says a long sequence of problems began to unfold.“The garage had been the office and I was expecting all the sockets to be there but literally they’d gone and cut the electrics off at the wire and nails were sticking out,” says Rebecca, a secondary school teacher, who lives with her husband Paul, 35, and son Oliver, three. When they headed upstairs to the family bathroom, they say they found the toilet unfitted on the floor. Frustrated, the couple began blogging about their experiences with the housebuilder. This prompted action from Charles Church, but Rebecca and Paul say their frustrations continued. Two years after they moved in they claim there are still issues to be resolved, with lights in the kitchen not working and cement splattered on their back door. “You think ‘what’s the point?’ We paid a hell of a lot of money for a house like this.”David and Susan Birch should be enjoying their retirement in their new £265,000 property in Wymondham in Norfolk but the couple say they have been left feeling angry and stressed after a number of problems emerged. As soon as the couple moved into their home in June they spotted mould in the kitchen. “We moved in on the Monday and by the Friday it had risen by two to three feet,” recalls David, 69. “They took the dry lining off the walls and replaced it but we had to endure seven days with infrared heating – in the hot summer – and a dehumidifier to dry it out.”Later they discovered mould under the stairs. They handed Charles Church a snagging list featuring 63 issues. Three months in and they’re still waiting for things to be fixed. “We’re so fed up of it,” says David. “It doesn’t even feel like home. We haven’t settled in. We don’t want to be wasting what we have got left getting the house straight.” A Charles Church spokesman says: “All of our new homes are sold with a two-year Charles Church warranty in addition to a 10-year insurance-backed structural warranty, providing reassurance to customers that any substantive defects will be addressed. Customer satisfaction is of primary importance and our after sales teams make every effort to resolve concerns amicably. The regional management teams will continue to deal directly with inidual customers to address their issues.”The NHBC paid out £84.8m in claims between 2016-17.Campaign group HomeOwners Alliance says the current system does not allow for quality of workmanship and fittings. “Although work is meant to be inspected independently at key stages, the inspection regime is currently failing homebuyers,” says its chief executive Paula Higgins. Instead, she argues, there needs to be a higher body policing the sector.“We’ve been calling for a new homes ombudsman for a long time now as we’re inundated with calls from our members about shoddy workmanship and flawed properties yet there is currently no one holding these developers to account,” she says. “These firms are under pressure to build and with a shortage of skills in the sector corners get cut.”A spokesman for Home Builders Federation says: “Inevitably when you are building hundreds of thousands of any product, in a field in all weathers there will be some, usually very minor issues in a small number of cases. In these instances it is the builders’ responsibility to correct those issues to the satisfaction of the customer.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a980d8e8fdfefb9b6f1ea304ba6496383f5b4c9/0_40_5976_3586/master/5976.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d4e639bc2ef91805b2dcdb99dfc811b","title":"the legacy of islamic state in iraq","story":"Two years on from the ‘liberation’ of Fallujah from Isis control, the ’s Peter Beaumont has returned to the Iraqi city.

The ministers believe there is still time for the prime minister to go back to Brussels and renegotiate her deal, the  reports.May revealed her draft withdrawal agreement with the EU on Wednesday, setting out the terms of the UK’s departure and the transition period.

They were quickly followed out of the government by a number of junior ministers.May defended her deal in a three-hour Commons session, during which several MPs openly declared they would vote against the agreement. With Labour’s frontbench and hard Brexiters refusing to back the deal and May’s party in open revolt, many MPs called on May to face up to the reality that she would struggle to get her deal through parliament.As May took questions from MPs, the high-profile Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg, the chair of the European Research Group, asked if he should write a letter of no confidence. More than 20 Conservative MPs have publicly said they have submitted letters of no confidence in the prime minister. Under Conservative party rules, 48 Conservative MPs must write letters to trigger a confidence vote.The group of five ministers are reportedly hoping that by changing the most controversial details of the withdrawal agreement, May could avoid both a vote of no confidence and a defeat in parliament. Leadsom said she hoped to work with the other four ministers to change the draft withdrawal deal into something “winnable and supportable”, according to the BBC.A key focus of the ministers is the Irish backstop. Under the current arrangement, the UK would not be able to leave the backstop without the EU’s consent.May has vowed to see her agreement through and warned her Tory opponents that their alternate Brexit plans would not make their problems disappear.In an interview with the Daily Mail, she said: “People say, ‘If you could only just do something slightly different, have a Norway model or a Canada model, this backstop issue would go away’. It would not. That issue is still going to be there.“Some politicians get so embroiled in the intricacies of their argument they forget it is not about this theory or that theory, or does it make me look good.”The Conservative party chairman, Brandon Lewis, said May was “prepared for anything”, when asked on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme if she was ready for a leadership challenge.He added: “When we see various different organisations and groups talk about different ways of leaving the EU – Norway, Canada, all of these things – what we have to be clear about … is all of those require a backstop.”Though the “group of five” are hoping to to persuade May to change her deal, EU member states have collectively ruled out any redrafting. Michael Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, told EU ambassadors they should not engage in “bargaining”, despite the deepening political crisis in the UK."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4dbd5d0e6a7b224f4e416a23b22d35c19648d51c/0_167_6016_3608/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8b12edcde4ccd77fab0d799d9e320eab","title":"hip hop hull young people poverty city of culture","story":"A new documentary shows one man’s battle with poverty as he tries to bring rap – and hope – to the city’s most deprived areasTen-year-old Jess Baker (not her real name) stands at a microphone in a tiny recording studio behind a hip-hop clothing shop near Hull city centre. “My brain is all messed up,” she raps, “Music is my passion, it makes me not give up”.Running the sound desk and encouraging her as she raps is Steve Arnott, director of Beats Bus, a project running music and arts workshops for young people in the city, which tackle issues including mental health, bullying and political engagement. “The idea of the Beats Bus first came to me about five years ago,” says Arnott. “There were hip-hop workshops already happening across the city, and I’d started doing workshops for young people. But if you come from a family with no money, parents can’t afford to give their children bus fares every day to come into town.”Arnott is the focus of a new documentary following his attempts to bring creativity and self-expression to young people in Hull’s marginalised communities. The film, A Northern Soul, by Hull-born documentary-maker Sean McAllister, is set against the backdrop of 2017, when Hull was city of culture.Established in 2013 by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, the UK city of culture, awarded every four years, aims to bring the kind of social and economic benefits that Liverpool got from being the European capital of culture in 2008, when it welcomed 9.7 million and its economy got a boost of more than £750m.Hull beat competition from Leicester, Dundee and Swansea to become the second city of culture, after Derry in Northern Ireland won the inaugural bid for 2013. Civic leaders in Derry say that five years on, the effects of its year of culture are still being felt. It was an economic success and has transformed the image of the city, although an audit revealed it did not deliver as many jobs as had been predicted.And last December, Coventry was chosen to be the next city of culture – and was handed £8.5m in last month’s budget to help it prepare heritage and cultural buildings ahead of 2021. The team putting together Coventry’s programme is working with grassroots organisations to ensure events are inclusive. “Austerity is still biting hard,” says Martin Sutherland, chief executive of Coventry City of Culture Trust. “The year cannot just be about a big celebratory arts festival.” As well as tracking the economic impact of the year, Coventry’s team will be analysing the social impact, including on wellbeing, isolation, loneliness and mental health.Hull’s winning bid focused on “a city coming out of the shadows”. Hopes were high for its year as a cultural hub and the potential to transform lives – more than one in three children in the city live in poverty and it is one of England’s 20 most deprived areas. Although the city of culture title does not automatically confer any monetary gain, as a result of becoming city of culture, Hull received £8.5m from the government, £3m from Arts Council England and more than £10m in lottery funding including £3m from the Heritage Lottery Fund to support its programme of events.On the face of it, Hull has reaped the benefits: its year as city of culture attracted more than 5 million people to its events and led to 800 new jobs and almost £220m investment in culture and tourism. “I knew that the city of culture would make Hull really proud,” says Arnott. “The first week was amazing, with thousands of people on the streets crying, cheering, laughing. It raised the pride in our people.”Katy Fuller, an executive producer who helped organise Hull UK City of Culture 2017, now creative director and chief executive of Absolutely Cultured, the organisation running the city’s legacy events, says nine out of 10 residents had been involved in an event during the year – either attending, participating or volunteering.Audiences from the city’s most deprived areas were included in a number of different ways, and performances did not just take place in the city centre. The city of culture organisers, Fuller says, worked with schools, shopping centres and social clubs to put performances in the heart of communities – and one of the year’s showpiece events, the Land of Green Ginger, was presented in six neighbourhoods beyond the city centre. One of the city of culture legacy programmes is supporting theatre companies and artists living and working in Hull, she adds.Yet while Arnott’s Beats Bus colleague Dave Okwesia agrees that the events raised Hull’s profile and brought in both visitors and new businesses to the city centre, he says that the benefits were not felt so much in outlying areas or among grassroots artists. While A Northern Soul is a story about Hull’s year in the cultural spotlight, it’s also a powerful counterblast to the “poverty porn” of TV programmes such as Channel 4’s Benefits Street. Arnott is shown juggling his efforts to get his Beats Bus project on the road with an arduous job in a warehouse, struggling to make ends meet as his debts mount. “In the media, political and national discourse there has been an increase in negative depictions of poverty,” says Campbell Robb, chief executive of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, which part-funded the film. “It became obvious to us that we could not change laws and policies without addressing those attitudes.”Although the film focuses on Arnott, the story it tells of in-work poverty is one faced by growing numbers of people, with one in eight of the UK workforce (3.7 million people) living in poverty. “This film will resonate with everybody who watches it because this is the reality of lots of people’s lives,” says Robb. “While it tells the story of one man, it tells the story of a generation of people.”McAllister says his film is having a zeitgeist moment. Since its premiere at Sheffield documentary festival in June, Arnott and McAllister have travelled nationwide, speaking at dozens of screenings – often the film has been shown alongside Ken Loach’s drama I, Daniel Blake. The documentary will be shown to MPs this month and it is being aired on BBC2 on 18 November.Back in Hull, Arnott has secured £11,500 from crowdfunding to run the Beats Bus as a social enterprise, enabling him to give up his warehouse job and to focus full-time, with four colleagues, on running music, performance and art workshops for young people around the city.“The original idea, which we want to go back to, is approaching communities and estates where kids are knocking about on the streets because they’ve got nothing better to do,” he says. “We want to give them something better to do, give them a bit of advice and maybe stop them getting in trouble, messing about and maybe breaking the law. Youth clubs have been cut – we can be a travelling youth club.”And his ultimate aim is to take the Beats Bus project beyond Hull. “We want to branch out to take it wherever people want it,” he says. “If it works well, it can work well anywhere.”A Northern Soul will be shown on BBC2 at 10pm on 18 November"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbe44e7377425df20f0fcae20fea9be404b32e2e/0_271_5760_3453/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8522cb4adf4034ea952951c62883814d","title":"uk austerity has inflicted great misery on citizens un says","story":"Poverty envoy says callous policies driven by political desire for social re-engineering• ‘I’m scared to eat sometimes’• Women reveal impact of cuts• Children tell UN: ‘It’s unfair’The UK government has inflicted “great misery” on its people with “punitive, mean-spirited, and often callous” austerity policies driven by a political desire to undertake social re-engineering rather than economic necessity, the United Nations poverty envoy has found.Philip Alston, the UN’s rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, ended a two-week fact-finding mission to the UK with a stinging declaration that levels of child poverty were “not just a disgrace, but a social calamity and an economic disaster”, even though the UK is the world’s fifth largest economy,“It is patently unjust and contrary to British values that so many people are living in poverty,” he said, adding that compassion had been abandoned during almost a decade of austerity policies that had been so profound that key elements of the postwar social contract, devised by William Beveridge more than 70 years ago, had been swept away.In an excoriating 24-page report, which will be presented to the UN human rights council in Geneva next year, the eminent human rights lawyer said that in the UK “poverty is a political choice”.He told a press conference in London:The government said it “completely disagreed” with Alston’s analysis. A spokesperson said household incomes were at a record high, income inequality had fallen and that universal credit, which Alston attacked as “Orwellian” and “fast falling into universal discredit”, was supporting people into work faster.“We are absolutely committed to helping people improve their lives while providing the right support for those who need it,” the spokesperson said.Alston’s report follows similar audits of extreme poverty in China, Saudi Arabia, Ghana, Mauritania and the US. Donald Trump’s White House administration launched a furious response after the US was accused of pursuing policies that deliberately forced millions of Americans into financial ruin while lavishing vast riches on the super-wealthy.Charities working to alleviate poverty said the report on the UK was a “wake-up call for government”.It is likely to crystallise growing public unease over the impact of nearly a decade of cuts to the welfare state and public services, which studies have shown have had a disproportionate effect on the poor, the disabled and women. Soaring use of food banks, increasingly visible homelessness and cuts to school budgets have widened concerns about the Conservative party’s fiscal strategy.After visiting towns and cities including London, Oxford, Cardiff, Newcastle, Glasgow and Belfast, Alston said that “obvious to anyone who opens their eyes to see the immense growth in food banks and the queues waiting outside them, the people sleeping rough in the streets, the growth of homelessness, the sense of deep despair that leads even the government to appoint a minister for suicide prevention and civil society to report in depth on unheard-of levels of loneliness and isolation”.He called for the elimination of the five-week delay in receiving benefits under the universal credit system, which has plunged many into destitution. Flaws in its design and implementation harmed claimants’ mental health, finances and work prospects, and benefits sanctions were “harsh and arbitrary”. Vulnerable claimants “struggled to survive”, he said.The ministers he met – including Esther McVey, who was the work and pensions secretary until Thursday, when she resigned over the Brexit deal – were almost entirely dismissive of criticisms of welfare changes and universal credit, he said. Instead, they described critics as political saboteurs or said they failed to understand how it worked.He highlighted the chancellor’s decision in this month’s budget to give a tax cut to the rich rather than using that money to alleviate poverty for millions, adding: “Austerity could easily have spared the poor, if the political will had existed to do so.”Alston said the government was in a state of denial and there was a “striking disconnect” between what ministers said and the testimonies he heard from ordinary people.“Even while devolved authorities in Scotland and Northern Ireland are frantically trying to devise ways to ‘mitigate’, or in other words counteract, at least the worst features of the government’s benefits policy, ministers insisted to me that all is well and running according to plan.”He said he had met people who did not have a safe place for their children to sleep, people who had sold sex for money or shelter, young people who felt gangs were the only way out of destitution, and people with disabilities who were being told they needed to go back to work or lose support, against their doctors’ orders. He described how town hall budgets had been “gutted” in England resulting in a record sell-off of libraries and parks and closures of youth centres.“I have also seen tremendous resilience, strength and generosity, with neighbours supporting one another, councils seeking creative solutions and charities stepping in to fill holes in government services,” he said.On food banks, he said: “I was struck by how much their mobilisation resembled the sort of activity you might expect for a natural disaster or health epidemic.”A common theme of the testimonies he heard was the impact on people’s mental health and feelings of loneliness and fear. “I was surprised by the talk of suicide, by the people I met who said they had considered suicide … There are some pretty serious mental health dimensions.”In his conclusion, Alston called for “the legislative recognition of social rights” in the UK, a move that has long been resisted by UK governments but which is the status quo in countries such as Sweden and Germany.“Labour will stop the roll-out of universal credit, end the benefit freeze and transform the social security system so that it supports people instead of punishing them.”Universal credit has punched us in the face. Before much longer people will turn to crime. People will smash the windows to get what they want.

Not just any old bunch of silver ferns, either, but a team unbeaten in Tests on European soil since 2012 and still the world’s No 1 side. New Zealand are knocked from their rankings perch about as often as Steve Hansen fancies doing Strictly Come Dancing.Ireland, though, are increasingly sure-footed on the game’s biggest stages. At home they have not lost in their last 10 Tests, dating back to New Zealand’s contentious 21-9 victory two years ago. Under Joe Schmidt they now march to a different tune to previous Irish squads. The 40-29 victory over the All Blacks in Chicago in 2016 will always be celebrated but their ambitions remain far from satisfied.As current Six Nations grand slam champions and the world’s second-best team, the chance to take another giant leap beneath the Dublin floodlights now presents itself. New Zealand cannot yet be overhauled in the rankings but they can be undermined psychologically. Hansen’s men, by their own high standards, have wobbled slightly of late and should probably have lost three of their tricky quartet of recent Tests against South Africa (twice), Australia and England. Had England not let a 15-0 first-half lead slip at Twickenham, this week’s mood music would have been appreciably darker.Ireland, either way, have shed any last vestige of an inferiority complex. Schmidt’s attention to detail is legendary and none of his players will take the field unsure of their roles. There is more than a dash of steely Kiwi in them nowadays they will have pored over the England video and concluded New Zealand can be made to look as mortal as anyone. Ireland will seek to play as Eddie Jones’s side did in the first half-hour last Saturday: quick, brusque, direct, hard-nosed and relentless.Motivation will not be a problem, with the heavy-duty, painfully physical loss to the same opponents at the Aviva Stadium in this corresponding fixture two years ago still the subject of much debate. A number of incidents that day would now earn instant red cards and Ireland, while obliged to keep it legal, will be physically braced this time. “Spiky” is the word Schmidt has been using: it will be that and more.All of which makes for the year’s most compelling 80 minutes – “You can’t say it’s just another game,” murmured Johnny Sexton this week – with no shortage of riveting plotlines. The last time Sexton encountered Beauden Barrett, during the drawn 2017 Lions series, it was the former who enjoyed the last laugh. Brodie Retallick and Sam Whitelock may be packing down as a starting duo for a record 50th time in New Zealand’s boiler room but eclipsing the 6ft 10in Devin Toner will be tough. And then there is Schmidt, the brains behind it all. An Ireland win could just see the 53-year-old succeed Hansen as the coach of the All Blacks from 2020 onwards, which would be more than a touch ironic.What a springboard, too, it would give Ireland heading into next year’s World Cup in Japan. Not unlike England in 2003, a compelling victory over New Zealand en route to the tournament would validate everything they are doing and send a message around the rugby world. If they do it, moreover, without Conor Murray, their scrum-half totem, and another absent Lion, the flanker Sean O’Brien, it will be all the more striking.They cannot assume, however, that the visitors will do the job for them. New Zealand, in particular, still boast Retallick, the scourge of England. Neither he nor Whitelock were involved in Chicago and both will be central on Saturday evening. Disrupt Ireland in the lineout and you cut out their heart and lungs: Retallick is the forward the All Blacks would least like to see dropping to one knee in the opening moments.Ireland will also be anxious to get to Aaron Smith, about to win his 82nd cap, and limit Damian McKenzie’s exhilarating footwork to his own 22. Mostly, though, they will be concentrating on building pressure, looking after the ball and then striking, when the moment comes, to maximum effect. As Hansen observed this week: “They’ll find a weakness and they’ll punish you. He’s pretty good, Joe, at finding a trick or two so we’ll be expecting one or two.”Kiwis of a certain age already know what it is like to lose a Test in Dublin. It almost feels like rugby’s Old Testament now but New Zealand’s defeat to Australia in the 1991 World Cup semi-final at the old Lansdowne Road still echoes down the years. It was David Campese’s finest hour: the no-look pass over his shoulder to Tim Horan, the diagonal dagger finish in the left corner. The modern All Blacks will not have to counter Campo’s genius but, as with that fine Wallaby side, Ireland have sufficient wit to make life hugely difficult.Will it, ultimately, be enough? New Zealand, if the sky does fall in on them, can hardly say they were not warned. Only Ryan Crotty’s last-gasp try saved them in Dublin in 2013, since when Ireland have unearthed a golden generation of players – James Ryan, Tadhg Furlong, Garry Ringrose and Jacob Stockdale – far more accustomed to winning than losing.New Zealand also look less settled in certain pivotal positions and Ireland’s defence coach, Andy Farrell, has a proven knack of throttling All Black ambition in big games like this. Ireland have won five and lost five when Saturday’s referee, Wayne Barnes, has been in charge but shaking hands with a northern hemisphere referee on a mild November afternoon in Dublin will add to New Zealand’s faint stirrings of unease.IrelandR Kearney K Earls, G Ringrose, B Aki, J Stockdale J Sexton, K Marmion C Healy, R Best (capt), T Furlong, D Toner, J Ryan, P O’Mahony, J van der Flier, CJ Stander.\u0026nbspReplacements\u0026nbspS Cronin, J McGrath, A Porter, I Henderson, J Murphy, L McGrath, J Carbery, J Larmour.Schmidt, either way, insists he will be delighted with “any old win against the All Blacks … I’ll take 3-0.” The drier conditions, in truth, will probably require his side to score upwards of 25 points, with the quick feet of Joey Carbery and Jordan Larmour potentially useful later. If Sexton stays on for an hour at least and Ireland can retain 15 players on the field, a famous home triumph is a real possibility. If, alternatively, New Zealand find a relieving Irish backstop under screeching pressure, the world champions will feel they can cope with anything in Japan next year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03da81a705a0bbc2840a2a368cc6ea040b80aef6/0_146_2031_1219/master/2031.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e32132f2785026296df87ec4eb01e91","title":"world chess championship game 6 carlsen caruana","story":"Magnus Carlsen narrowly avoided a devastating upset on Friday in the sixth game of his world championship match with Fabiano Caruana in London, scratching back from the brink to save a miraculous draw after 80 moves.The reigning world champion, playing with the white pieces for the first of two consecutive games, was outplayed in the middlegame by the American challenger and forced to rely on accurate defense with no margin for error over the last two hours to secure a peaceful result and preserve a 3-all deadlock at the halfway point of the the best-of-12-games showdown.Caruana, who missed a complex win in the late stages of the six-and-a-half-hour epic at the College at Holborn, came agonizingly close to a decisive upset that would have not only drawn first blood in the €1m ($1.14m) world title match, but would have propelled him to No 1 in the live world ratings, knocking Carlsen from the position he’s held since July 2011.Carlsen, 27, has been ranked No 1 for eight straight years and was considered the world’s best player even before he defeated Viswanathan Anand for the title in 2013. Caruana, 26, is ranked No 2, having earned his place at the table by winning the candidates tournament in March. No American-born player has won or even competed for the world title since Bobby Fischer in 1972.\u0026nbspIt marks the first title match between the world\u0027s top two players since 1990, when Garry Kasparov and Anatoly Karpov faced off for a fifth and final time.\u0026nbspThe match will consist of 12 classical games with each player awarded one point for a win and a half-point for a draw.

With black I probably would have played more carefully early and in the middlegame.”A series of conservative and mostly straightforward draws had come to define the match in the week since it opened with a tense 115-move marathon over seven punishing hours. Friday’s sixth installment didn’t quite push those outer limits, but was marked with an extreme psychological intensity none of the previous games have been able to consistently match.Carlsen opened with a Petroff (1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nf6), playing directly to Caruana’s strength by opting for the the challenger’s opening of choice, then delivered an early surprise by bursting into the formation with (4. Nd3!?). The queens came out immediately after (5. Qe2 Qe7) and were off the board by the eighth move (6. Nf4 Nc6 7. Nd5 Nd4 8. Nxe7 Nxe2).Fifteen of the first 20 moves involved the knights after 9. Nd5 Nd4 10. Na3 Ne6 as both moved quickly, but the crisp pace slowed after 18. Kf2 and the formation of a symmetrical position with no apparent weaknesses on either side. Whatever advantage Carlsen had leveraged early was erased by 21. g3, when the computer assessed the position as dead even.“Just a few moves later I was fighting for equality,” Carlsen said afterward. “Then I got a bit unsettled.”From there Carlsen sought to simplify a position that was looking drawish with a rook exchange (31. Rxc8 Rxc8), but the sequence of moves only tipped the balance in Caruana’s direction. The margin for the American mounted with 7. ... Bd7 38. f5 Bc6 39. Bd1 and he soon found himself with a winning position.As the world No 2 continued to press the action, a clearly frustrated Carlsen refused to crack.

When the entire ground was magically covered by blue plastic sheets in the time it takes to brew a pot of tea the balance of the match had lurched again in England’s favour. Sri Lanka needed 75 runs to win England needed three wickets.This has been a match of so many twists and turns that only a fool was guaranteeing the outcome, but the loss of Angelo Mathews for a restrained yet imperious 88, who was soon to be followed by Dilruwan Perera, meant that England were the favourites again. Against all the odds the match has made it to the fifth day, though the return of those afternoon thunderstorms has contributed to that.Whatever the result, this has been a captivating Test mainly because throughout the first four days no one has been quite sure which team was winning. Moreover, when the ball is moving class will out, which was most notably highlighted by the innings of Joe Root and Mathews, and the cricket has an intensity absent when the game is played on dry slabs of brown concrete.It has been bewildering that so many runs have been scored, 1,198 so far. The surface has been behaving in a similar way to some of those where Jack Leach does most of his bowling at Taunton. Sometimes those matches have been over in two or three days so what is the difference? It is the quality of the batsmen – from both sides – who are not intimidated and do not panic when the ball deviates. They enjoy the challenge rather than give up in despair. There are perils, but if a good batsman survives for 15 minutes he can prosper. So this has been a treat for the thousands of England fans here and the locals have started to become more interested in their beleaguered side.There were more home supporters in the ground at the start of play when the addition of 22 runs by Ben Foakes and Jimmy Anderson at least made the maths simple: England’s lead was 300 runs. Leach ten became the first man to open the bowling and batting for England in the same Test match since Graham Gooch in Faisalabad in 1987 – before that one had to go back to Trevor Bailey.It proved a good decision to ally Leach with Anderson and in any case Sam Curran was off the field with discomfort in his right side, apparently from thumping all those sixes in the first innings. Within the space of eight overs Leach had taken the first three wickets he controlled the shiny new ball well and he had some assistance from a nervy top order. Kaushal Silva raced down the pitch frantically, the ball turned and he was comfortably stumped. In Leach’s next over Dhananjaya de Silva glided a ball from the middle of his bat, whereupon Keaton Jennings produced the first of two moments of wizardry at short-leg, which epitomized England’s zest and zeal in the field. This may be the crucial tiny difference between the sides. Jennings instinctively clasped a fast-travelling ball into his hands before being mobbed by his teammates. Next, the impetuous Kusal Mendis, currently a wayward talent, swept and missed and was lbw after review. Sri Lanka were 26 for three. Perhaps this would be a doddle? Not in this match.It took another intuitive reaction from Jennings to conjure the next wicket. Dimuth Karunaratne and Mathews had added 77 with remarkably few problems. They played late and delicately guided the ball into the gaps of a deep-set field. Karunaratne has batted superbly in this match and should have even more to show for it. He was run out by a Ben Stokes direct hit in the first innings for 63. This time, on 57, he swept deftly against Adil Rashid once again but Jennings, anticipating the stroke, moved to his left at short-leg. The ball hit his left hand and popped into the air so that Foakes could complete the simple part of the catch. Betraying his naivety afterwards Jennings admitted that this was not intentional.Another 73 were added by Mathews and Roshen Silva all too easily until Moeen Ali made his first intervention. An inside edge took Silva’s pad before ballooning to slip. Once again the review system sorted out the correct decision. In came Niroshan Dickwella, impish from the start and eagerly sweeping the majority of the deliveries he faced. By tea, Sri Lanka were well-placed at 219 for five but the loss of those two wickets as the clouds grew darker changed everything.Confronted with the excellence of Mathews and Karunaratne England had battled hard but not flawlessly. After snatching those early wickets Leach, maybe excited by his success, lost some control of his line and length. Initially, Moeen was expensive while Rashid bowled one of his best spells (17 overs on the trot, marred only by an ugly final one) with little reward.After four days, the spinners were the only English bowlers to have taken a wicket."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42894c591b7c566b9c96cd83b7ff6703d6fd6067/0_0_4480_2688/master/4480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d167a3afeec4207a1d7e3118c9b0bd76","title":"sri lanka v england third test day four live","story":"Four wickets from Jack Leach and some spectacular fielding from Keaton Jennings moved England within sight of a famous series victory in Sri LankaWe have a match report for you to peruse, so I’ll leave you with that. The great Tim de Lisle will be here tomorrow morning to describe the end of this marvellous Test match. Thanks for your company, goodnight! Superstar fielder Keaton Jennings is being interviewed on Sky Sports “It’s been a good day’s work. The last four days have been amazing to watch and it’s set up for a bit of a thriller. We need to control the scoring rate the morning session but that hasn’t been easy. It has been the kind of game where wickets fall in clusters. Tea came at a good time for us as it halted their momentum. “I really enjoy being at short leg on this kind of surface as you feel in the game all day. With the first catch, I just stuck out a mitt and the ball stuck. With the second way I was just trying to get in the way – I’d love to say I deliberately parried it to Foakesy but I was trying to catch it!”If England do win this game, they will move up to second in the ICC Test Rankings. Not bad for a team who were perceived to be in disarray when they lost the first Test of last summer to Pakistan.“Ref Mr. Hurley who clearly hasn’t done much homework. Bancroft was Yorkshire’s overseas player the previous season and Bairstow was asked to help him settle in, so no he was not someone that he “hardly knew”, although I would agree that it may have been a little naïve,” says David Horn. “Also anyone who thinks that it was a “head but” hasn’t spent much time in Yorkshire and certainly not in Leeds on a Friday night during the 70s or 80s.”I suppose it wasn’t exactly Red Riding.Sri Lanka will resume tomorrow morning needing 75 runs to win with three wickets remaining. The forecast is dodgy for the afternoon but there should be enough time for one of these sides to wrap up a famous victory.It’s still pouring down, so the umpires have called it off. It looks very unlikely that there will be any more play today. In case you have just stirred, Sri Lanka are 226 for seven, needing another 75 runs for victory, after another twisti-twosti day in this classic match.“Still reeling at news that you are allowed to wager on the outcome of matches in which you are OBOing,” says Brian Withington. “Surely this breaches ICC or  guidelines andor creates potential for disruption in the mockersreporting continuum? Not quite Headingley 1981 value-based punting but potentially troubling nevertheless. Discuss.”You got nothin’ on me.Here’s my personal troll, Ian Copestake “My justification for the abuse I give you btl and outside your cottage is that It keeps you sharp, on the edge, where you gotta be.”Play has finally got under way in the Tiger Moth country of Carrara, where South Africa and Australia’s T20 match has been reduced to 10 overs per side. You won’t believe the score!“Your comment at 10.06,” says Robert Smithson, “was the cricketing equivalent of this.”My influences are nothing if not contemporary.“I thought the btl reaction to your Bairstow piece was insane - other than Root and Anderson, which England players *aren’t* one bad series away from scrutiny?” says Phil Harrison. “But everything gets very emotional and overheated around Jonny due to the tragedy of his father. I get it, I like Jonny too. But top-level cricket isn’t sentimental. Foakes is the better keeper and at the moment, Buttler is the better batsman. He needs to tighten up and rebuild himself as a top three batter - the worry is that he won’t be able to play enough red ball stuff to get it happening.”In this age of squad rotation (another piece I got pelters for!), he’ll get plenty of chances, and he’ll take them. This might actually be a blessing in disguise both for him and England, because it wouldn’t take that great an improvement in his shot selection for him to be a formidable No3.If we’re doing best-case scenarios, and optimism is how Bob rolls, imagine an in-form top eight of Burns, Hameed, Bairstow, Root, Stokes, Buttler, Foakes and Moeen. Sod it, let’s have Woakes at No9 and Curran No10 as well.“With regard to Niall Mullen’s comment, 57th over,” begins Bill Hargreaves, “I thought that’s why they called him ‘Beefy’.” The forecast is for thunderstorms tomorrow. It would be a dreadful shame if this classic match ended in a draw. On the plus side, I had £2 on the draw at 50-1 a few hours ago.“Well- or less well-argued disagreements or actual abuse, threats and stuff?” asks Andrew Benton. “That would never do. Now we know why you keep away from Twitter.”Mainly just mild abuse. The era of death threats has passed, alas. The covers are coming on. England don’t look entirely happy but I’m not sure the umpires had much choice. I suspect that will be it for today.Perera has gone this time. He tried to drive a nice delivery from Leach which drifted and dipped to beat the bat and hit him on the toe. That looked plumb. As Perera walks off, the rain starts to get heavier. I think the players will be going off very soon.65th over: Sri Lanka 226-6 (Dickwella 27, Perera 2) Perera is given out, caught at leg slip by Stokes off Moeen, only for the decision to be overturned by the third umpire. It definitely bounced just in front of Stokes, who was involved in a similar incident in the first Test. Only Stokes will know whether he cheated. I doubt he did, but it’s hard to be certain when you’re 6,000 miles away.64th over: Sri Lanka 223-6 (Dickwella 25, Perera 0) Leach replaces Root. England have endured and eventually enjoyed a few nail-biters this year: they beat India by 31 runs at Edgbaston and by 60 runs at the Ageas Bowl. This is equally tense. Dickwella, who looks frantic even by his standards, makes a mess of a reverse sweep and is hit on the arm. He survives an LBW appeal next ball - it was missng off stump by a mile. It’s suddenly very dark in Pallekele. “Morning Rob,” says Brian Withington. “Fell asleep after the fourth wicket cabaret act, only stirring to witness some round the wicket filth from Rashid. The early, heady promise of Leach’s ‘three before cornflakes’ (8th over) feels like a distant memory. The situation is crying out for another improbable piece of fielding magic from the likes of Stokes, especially given his lack of bowling and runs in this match. Or a YJB swoop in the deep. Or an LBW from Moeen ...” 63rd over: Sri Lanka 221-6 (Dickwella 24, Perera 0) “Bairstow has more reason than most to want to be a wicket-keeper and to right a few perceived wrongs,” says Andy Wilson. “Also his Test average would be higher if he hadn’t played the situation several times (England needing quick runs). I think now he should come back in as a top order batsman and either make it work or come back to Yorks and win us the CCC. Although he may find we have already started the cloning process and we have the Young Jonny ginger wicket-keeper batsman already filled.”He’ll be fine, he’s far too good not to get back in the team and stay there. More importantly in the short term, England need him to be happy and in punishing form during the World Cup.That’s a huge wicket for England in the first over after tea. It turned a long way but the angle from around the wicket meant was hitting the top of leg stump. It was umpire’s call so the on-field decision was vital. Mathews played an immense innings and deserved a hundred.Mathews is given out LBW to Moeen - but he reviews it immediately. It was a fine delivery, which turned sharply from around the wicket, and this looks really close. There’s no inside edge. Here comes62nd over: Sri Lanka 219-5 (Mathews 87, Dickwella 23) Root slows things down to ensure his fifth over is the last before tea. The break has come at a very good time for England, who are in a bit of bother. Dickwella’s cameo has put England under so much pressure, especially with Mathews looking immovable at the other end. One of the many worries for England is that there are still 18 overs until the second new ball is available. Sri Lanka will resume after tea needing 82 to win. For the first time perhaps in the whole match, I would make them favourites.61st over: Sri Lanka 217-5 (Mathews 86, Dickwella 22) Dickwella sweeps Moeen for another single. He has already played a lot of sweeps and reverse sweeps. England are being hoist by their own, erm, broom. And now Root has given away four overthrows! He tried to run Dickwella out from short fine leg and the ball reared viciously over Foakes’s head. “Good morning Rob,” says Richard Crabtree. “Given that average runs per wicket at Pallekele rise from 25 in the first two innings to 35 in the third and 40 in the fourth, don’t you think Joe Root might have put Sri Lanka in to bat first?”Not for me. The pitch looked like a raging turner, not a typical Pallekele surface at all, so it was absolutely the right decision to bat first.60th over: Sri Lanka 209-5 (Mathews 80, Dickwella 20) Dickwella drives Root for four more. He is such a dangerous player and has raced to 20 from 17 balls. This is all starting to feel a bit Headingley 2017.59th over: Sri Lanka 204-5 (Mathews 79, Dickwella 16) Mathews tries to reverse sweep a ball from Moeen which gets very big and hits him on the chest. Dickwella then carts a slog sweep for four to bring Sri Lanka’s target below 100. This match is ever so tight now. I’d be tempted to give Anderson a go at Root’s end, just to see if the ball reverses. Tea is 10 minutes away, and England look in need of a timeout.58th over: Sri Lanka 197-5 (Mathews 79, Dickwella 10) Joe Root replaces Adil Rashid. England are trying to give Dickwella sufficient rope to hang himself but he plays sensibly enough in that over - two from it.57th over: Sri Lanka 195-5 (Mathews 78, Dickwella 9) Dickwella chips Moeen over extra cover and just wide of Leach, running round from mid-off. “I wonder if this has ever been tried in cricket as an alternate form of sledging,” says Niall Mullen. “Who do you think would have been ‘best’ at it? Personally I’d go for David Boon after a transcontinental flight.”Nobody comes to mind to be honest.56th over: Sri Lanka 192-5 (Mathews 77, Dickwella 7) Dickwella reverse sweeps Rashid just wide of Stokes at slip. It was a bump ball. Rashid goes around the wicket to Mathews, who slams consecutive boundaries through extra cover and midwicket. A rare poor over from Rashid today.“A penny for Bairstow’s thoughts?” says Andrew Hurley. “Foakes will continue keeping wicket and Buttler inked in too. As we discussed at the time, he should have accepted the wish of the management to play as a batsman - he has been a little sillystupid the past 18 months (head butting for fun an opposition player you don’t know) on and off the field (getting bowled first few balls all summer, refusing the obvious..).”I’m saying nothing. I wrote a piece two weeks ago saying he had gone from irreplaceable to vulnerable in slightly strange circumstances, and received all sorts of abuse. For what it’s worth, I think he’ll get back in the side next summer at No3.55th over: Sri Lanka 182-5 (Mathews 68, Dickwella 6) The new batsman is the hyperactive Dickwella, who hits his first two balls for two and four. The pace of the game is about to change.Roshen flicked across the line at a flighted delivery which shaved the inside-edge before hitting the pad and deflecting to Root at slip. Foakes was insistent they should review - a brave call given they only have one left - and Ultra-Edge confirmed that Roshen was out.That’s a great review from England and a vital wicket!England think Roshen has been caught at slip via bat and pad. We’re about to find out.54th over: Sri Lanka 176-4 (Mathews 68, Roshen 37) “I know it’s Saturday morning and we’re all a bit old and knackered, but this feels a bit flat,” says Guy Hornsby. “England are letting the game drift. What price a few overs from Jimmy or Stokes, just to get the batsmen thinking? You can’t keep doing the same thing and expecting something to happen, no? Or I’d have had a great England career, rather than writing this email.”I think there’s enough happening, certainly at Rashid’s end, to keep going with spin. But if they get to 190-200 without losing a wicket, I suspect England will have a look to see if there’s any reverse swing.53rd over: Sri Lanka 173-4 (Mathews 67, Roshen 35) Mathews hammers a reverse sweep for four off Moeen, a really brilliant stroke. A matchwinning century would be quite a story after all his recent woes. He survives a stumping referral after a clever piece of work from Foakes, who collected a delivery down the leg side and threw down the stumps. Mathews did lift his back foot but only after the bails were broken.Meanwhile, in case you missed it last night, England all but ensured a semi-final place at the World T20 with a thumping win over South Africa. Anya Shrubsole took a hat-trick and Nat Sciver returned absurd figures of 4-1-4-3.In other news...52nd over: Sri Lanka 167-4 (Mathews 62, Roshen 34) Oh my. Hawkeye suggests that delivery from Moeen was hitting leg stump, so Roshen would have been out had England reviewed it. You can understand why they didn’t, especially with only one remaining. Meanwhile, Roshen Silva is now picking Rashid’s googly, which wasn’t the case earlier in the innings. This has been a memorably intricate Test match.51st over: Sri Lanka 165-4 (Mathews 62, Roshen 33) Leach is replaced by Moeen Ali, whose second ball is a half-volley that Roshen drives beautifully for four. He then survives another big LBW appeal from a ball that pitches a long way outside off stump and turns so viciously that it would have missed leg.“Hello there Rob,” says Rob Lewis. “Having a drink in a hotel overlooking the Golden Horn last night with Wayne Trotman, as Istanbul met Izmir. A slightly frazzled-looking American gentleman who strongly resembled Waldorf from the Muppets approached us. Where are the nightclubs around here buddies? We looked at each other. Sorry, you’re asking the wrong blokes... we have to be up at 7 for the cricket. He looked properly bemused and left us to our talk of Rashid and Leach.”I bet he still isn’t back at his hotel. Imagine the state of that bloke’s self-esteem right now. 50th over: Sri Lanka 159-4 (Mathews 61, Roshen 28) One from Rashid’s over. Sri Lanka need 143 to win.49th over: Sri Lanka 158-4 (Mathews 60, Roshen 28) Mathews plays a lovely shot for one, forcing Leach past extra cover. It might be worth having a look at Moeen at this end. There are two right-handers at the crease but that shouldn’t preclude the offspinner, especially someone who gets as much bounce as Moeen.48th over: Sri Lanka 155-4 (Mathews 57, Roshen 27) The next ball after the appeal is a beauty which rips past Roshen’s outside edge and hits him on the thigh. He is bowling so well here and is England’s key man, certainly while these two are together.It was a good delivery from Rashid, which skidded on and kept low, but it pitched outside leg and that means England lose their first review.Roshen survives a huge LBW appeal from Rashid. England are going to review... I reckon this is umpire’s call at best.47th over: Sri Lanka 152-4 (Mathews 56, Roshen 26) Leach continues after drinks and has a biggish LBW appeal against Roshen turned down by Marais Erasmus. That was surely going past leg stump. A good over form Leach though, who has a nice rhythm at the moment.“You’d expect the spin trio to be competing against each other as well as for the team it’s just the nature of the game,” says John Starbuck. “They should feel pretty safe, though, as there’s little sign of Ben Stokes coming on to knock a few caps off, and Anderson isn’t likely to be required until the new ball.”Thanks Tanya, morning everyone. My money is literally on the draw, £2 at 50-1 based on the weather forecast. But assuming there is a result, I think England will win a nerve-biting, nail-shredding match by around 50 runs. And that’s it from me... handing this intriguing game over to Rob Smyth who is bright-eyed, breakfasted and ready to go. He might even have some dogs nestling by his feet. Rob, where’s your money?46th over: Sri Lanka 151-4 (Roshen 26, Mathews 55) No unplayable googlies from Rashid this time round and the worm turns: Sri Lanka now need 150 to win - less than they’ve already scored. 45th over: Sri Lanka 150-4 (Roshen 26, Mathews 54) Leach playing the straight man here to Rashid’s fireworks. Roshen playing behind his pads and leaving those he can. Tension slowly mounting...44th over: Sri Lanka 150-4 (Roshen 26, Mathews 54) Three dot balls are followed by a spitter from Rashid that lands well outside off stump and turns like billyo - that was an impossible delivery. Mathews is suitably spooked. 43rd over: Sri Lanka 148-4 (Roshen 25, Mathews 54) Matthews cuts Leach again, what style! to square cover but no boundary. Then a four, a thick edge from Roshan. This is a marvellous little partnership.Ian Forth, holds forth (sorry Ian): “It could be that with three spinners in the side that, even subconsciously, each of them is trying to bowl too many magic deliveries and not relying on stock balls. Trying too hard, perhaps, with a view to who gets picked in the future.”42nd over: Sri Lanka 143-4 (Roshen 21, Mathews 53) Mathews and Roshen have the measure of Rashid at the moment. And as I write that a leg-break fizzes in front of Roshen the width of a breakfast fruit platter. I know nothing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ff8bba8c500347faf78fbf9dbde2c72a31597c0/0_307_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14e4bc68f35fbeb2e4d31a87677e7670","title":"share your caribbean highlights for the chance to win a 200 hotel voucher","story":"Send us a tip on affordable experiences in the Caribbean, be they places to stay, activities and attractions, or bars and restaurantsPalm-fringed beaches, rum punch and infectious reggae beats … Carnivals, rainforest and a laid-back vibe … The Caribbean is one of the world’s most alluring holiday destinations, and we want to hear your highlights – especially for those not on an A-lister budget.

At his chosen moment, Pipino slipped out and walked across the Bridge of Sighs, which connects the prisons to the palace. From there, he entered the Consoli room, took the highly valuable Madonna col Bambino (Madonna with Child), painted in the early 1500s, covered it with a blanket and sauntered out of the building through a side door.The theft in January of €2m (£1.7m) worth of jewellery owned by a member of Qatar’s royal family on the final day of an exhibition of Mughal and Maharaja treasures bore all the hallmarks of the Pipino heist – slick, free from violence, and successful.“When I did my robbery, there was only one security guard,” Pipino, 75, told the  this week. “Security has improved a lot since then … but something was amiss. Possibly there were cracks in the alarm system, maybe the alarms weren’t modern enough.”January’s thieves managed to deactivate an alarm system, break into a reinforced case in the Chamber of the Scrutinio – an immense room on the building’s second floor – steal some earrings and a brooch, and melt into a crowd of tourists. Police were so perplexed they were forced to call in experts from Rome.Vito Gagliardi, the chief police commissioner, said at the time that the reinforced case, which was provided by the Qatari curators, had been opened like a tin can. Officers suspected the thieves had scoped out the vast palace, which attracts up to 4,000 visitors a day, before seizing the right moment. Two of the suspects were seen on CCTV.On 9 November, 11 months after the heist, there was a breakthrough when five people were arrested in Croatia. In a further unexpected twist, one of the suspects briefly escaped custody, reportedly by climbing out of a bathroom window at a police station in the Croatian town of Tovarnik. He was later intercepted trying to cross the nearby border into Serbia.Another of the captured suspects is said to be part of the Pink Panthers, an international network of jewel thieves. Investigators had been hunting for the man after €10m of jewels were stolen from a 2011 exhibition in Basel, Switzerland.The mayor of Venice, Luigi Brugnaro, said justice had been delivered “to those who thought they could commit a crime in Venice and get away with it”. Pipino, who spent 20 years in jail for about 3,000 art thefts across Venice, said he believed the suspects had help from a collaborator within the palace,but the police have not said the same publicly.They say it would be impossible to sell the jewels on the black market because they were so well known. Pipino concurred: “Unless the pieces are removed and sold separately, they are unsellable.”He said he had had no intention of selling the painting when he took it from the palace. He was working on behalf of Felice Maniero, the boss of the Mala del Brenta organised crime group, who wanted to use the work as a ransom to secure the release of his cousin from prison. The tactic worked: the painting was returned and his cousin set free within weeks.Pipino insisted he only ever “robbed from the rich to give to the poor” or stole in order to get a favour, in one case to obtain a coveted berth for his boat.Seen as something of a hero in Venice, Pipino also earned the nickname ‘Italy’s most trusted thief’ for the non-violent and tidy way in which he carried out his trade. Some targets even regarded a visit by Pipino as a compliment to their good taste.“I only every worked with my brain and my hands, never guns,” he said.Having grown up in poverty, Pipino said the alleyways of Venice became his “teacher” after he was expelled from school for fighting with the son of a pharmacist who refused to give him the core of his apple to eat.In a book by the journalist Stefano Lorenzetto called Hic Sunt Leones: Venticinque Storie di Veneti Notevoli (Here Be Lions: 25 Stories of Notable Venetians), Pipino described how he was placed in a psychiatric ward before being released and sent to work in a mortuary. While working in a bakery at the age of eight he began to steal pastries.Nowadays Pipino, who has also been accused of drug dealing, which he denies vehemently, and credit card fraud, is consulted by wealthy people looking to make their homes more secure. “I’ll go along to their homes and look at the windows. They tell me: ‘This in an anti-intrusion window,’ and I say: ‘No it isn’t, I can open it within seconds.’”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Incidents occurred in Limerick city from August to November 2018Party will not stay in Government without clarity on confidence and supply dealUse of social media will be limited in court to \u0026lsquobona fide journalists\u0026rsquo and lawyers, says Chief JusticeFlanagan concerned over recent reports of underwear being held up in a rape trialDUP leader understood to have warned business they were being exploited politically\u0026lsquoI think we are seeing the beginning of the end of the whole Brexit project\u0026rsquoPlans feature in early-years strategy to be published by Minister Zappone next weekTaoiseach acknowledges border infrastructure could returnPrime minister gets boost after pro-Brexit minister Michael Gove decided not to resign, and trade secretary Liam Fox backed herSeveral Northern Ireland titles held by company unable to solve debt problemsOperation Barracuda sees Garda, army, fire and ambulance services working togetherMinister for Health says HSE will work with manufacturer \u0026lsquoto ensure timely access\u0026rsquoInside Dublin\u0026rsquos Brexit lockdown where Government secrecy reached new levels this weekRonan McGreevy receives honour from French ambassador in DublinDead man was in his 50s and had returned to his Leixlip home from Ireland football match"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3700088.1542376158!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"putting brexit to the test on the road with a trucker from dublin to germany","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDriver John Carroll gets ready to  leave  Dublin for  Germany.  Photograph:  Nick Bradshaw for The It’s a Saturday afternoon in Mulhuddart, west Dublin and lorry driver John Carroll is packing up for his two-day, six-country journey to Germany.Even on a weekend, the DG McArdle Transport yard is busy with drivers coming and going. Engines roar and refrigerated trailers hum constantly. Nothing stops in an export-import nation like Ireland.Carroll’s intended route, delivering about 1,400 kilos of high-value pharmaceuticals to Wiesbaden near Frankfurt, is a well-worn path for Irish lorries. To minimise transit times and maximise the value of time-sensitive products travelling along delicate pan-European supply chains, Carroll is taking the “landbridge”.To the 52-year-old Dundalk man and thousands of other drivers using this route every year, the UK is a bridge to Europe and a lucrative, barrier-free market of 450 million customers for Irish products.The  travelled with Carroll on his journey: by ferry from Dublin to Liverpool, driving across England to Dover and onto another ferry to Calais in France, through Belgium and The Netherlands to Germany.For years, it has all been relatively plain sailing and driving. But now there is Brexit. There is uncertainty around what the UK’s scheduled departure from the EU on March 29th, 2019 will mean for key supply routes that keep the cycle of Irish trade, valued at tens of billions of euro, turning every year.The fear for transport companies is that border checks that vanished when the European Union dropped its economic frontiers a quarter-century ago will reappear along the borders with the UK.The political storm raging in London this week after British prime minister Theresa May’s cabinet approved the draft orce agreement has done nothing to reassure transport companies over the future of the vital route they operate that ensures an open export-dependent economy like Ireland’s stays open.The draft deal contains guarantees to maintain the invisible border on the island of Ireland and includes a paragraph committing the British to protecting ease of passage over the landbridge. The deal, however, still requires UK parliamentary approval and that is far from assured.“There is absolutely nothing we can do,” says Carroll’s boss David McArdle.As part of contingency planning for a no-deal Brexit, some of McArdle’s customers have asked him to take direct ferries to continental Europe as a test to consider higher costs and longer transit times.A no-deal Brexit and new customs checks on the UK’s borders would be catastrophic for business.“The landbridge through the UK is still the fastest route to Europe. It is going to put hours, days onto journeys,” he says. “It is putting us back to the 1980s.”A sinking October sun lengthens shadows on the road ahead as Carroll drives along the M50 ring-road around Dublin heading to Port Tunnel.Carroll is booked on the 9.30pm ferry to Liverpool and needs to be there in plenty of time the pharmaceuticals he is carrying must remain chilled until they reach their destination in a German factory.All this means the refrigerated trailer, running on a diesel engine, must be kept running and this can only happen, for safety reasons, on the open top deck of the ferry where spaces are limited and in demand.The landbridge is a preferred route for transport companies carrying loads like Carroll’s because of the shorter transit times that minimise inventory costs and other working capital requirements.A study just completed by the Irish Maritime Development Office (IMDO) to understand Brexit’s impact on the landbridge valued Irish trade on the route at €21 billion, about 11 per cent of annual merchandise trade in 2016. Two out of every five tonnes of goods exported to the continent are transported via the landbridge. This is conservatively valued at an average of €18 billion a year.The report found that about 150,000 Irish vehicles use the landbridge each year, carrying about three million tonnes in annual volumes (two million in exports and one million in imports).Carroll reaches Dublin Port with no delays. There is plenty of space to park here now, but he wonders what will happen if customs checks were to appear causing delays.“When Brexit comes, where is all the traffic going to go? People don’t realise how bad it is going to be,” he says.Waiting in an assigned lane for open-deck slots, Carroll is joined in his cab by his friend Pat Murray from Co Cavan who is transporting hanging pork carcasses to continental Europe.Together, Carroll and Murray lament how drivers are heavily regulated on their hours behind the wheel under EU rules. They believe the average Irish consumer has no idea about pan-European supply chains work or that it takes days of road transport to bring fruit, vegetables and other foods to Irish supermarkets.“People just think that the stuff falls out of the sky,” says Murray. “I guarantee you if we weren’t on the road for three days, you’d be hungry. That’s all this country would be able to cope with.”A 30-year veteran of the road, he remembers long delays at borders across Europe in the past, but at least then, he says, drivers could make up time on the road as there were no restrictions on driving times.“There was no time on you, not like now. From when you roll the wheels in the morning, you are watching that all day,” he says, pointing at the tachograph, a device in the cab that records driving times.Drivers must take regular 45-minute stops and rest for at least nine hours a day. This is constantly on drivers’ minds as they attempt to make rest stops and meet scheduled ferries along the landbridge journey.Carroll’s load of pharmaceuticals has been booked in for a delivery slot between 10am and 11am in Germany on Monday so he has carefully planned his ferry times and rest periods.“It is a racing match. You are against the clock from the minute you roll the wheels,” says Murray.Murray describes the M20 London to Dover, a vital artery in the Ireland-to-continental Europe landbridge, as “the main road to Europe”. If Brexit eventually brings border checks, it will be very different.“The M20 will be a car park if it is a hard border,” he says.The P\u0026ampO ferry - a “ro-ro” (roll-on-roll-off) freight vessel – pulls off on time. Over dinner in the ferry’s restaurant, Carroll, Murray and other drivers share concerns about what hold-ups at Dover might mean.Paddy Neary, a long-time driver from Co Louth, recalls horrendous delays at border checkpoints across Europe before the EU single market rules. “Nobody is equipped” if the customs checks return, he says.“It is too terrible to comprehend what it would be like if every truck had to do customs,” he says.Talk turns to alternative routes and whether there are benefits avoiding the UK and taking direct ferries, from Rosslare to Le Havre or Cherbourg. These include using additional capacity on almost exclusively “lo-lo” (lift-on-lift-off) freight routes such as the CLdN Cobelfret ferries from Dublin to Zeebrugge and Rotterdam where containers have to be loaded off and onto lorries.“You wouldn’t be able to do it time wise. Your fruit would be three to four days old before it gets to Ireland,” says Gerry Nolan, a lorry driver from Co Meath who is hauling goods to Cologne in Germany.The longer, direct sea routes to continental ports carry much higher costs and have far less capacity than the landbridge ferries, and drivers would still have long hours on the road to get to Benelux countries. Lo-lo ferries can take only a handful of drivers at a time, creating another capacity problem.“The big factor is the money,” says Nolan. “Who is going to pay for the extra costs?”The IMDO report says journey times to continental Europe can be less than 20 hours via the landbridge, but up to 40 hours for ro-ro traffic on the direct sea routes and up to 60 hours for lo-lo services.“All direct sailings are very lengthy in time and heavy in costs, and do not make sense unless the landbridge becomes heinous,” says Verona Murphy, president of the Irish Road Haulage Association.“However, post-Brexit, the customer will want a definite timeline and then direct sailings may for that reason be the only show in town.”As the ferry steams towards Liverpool, the lorry drivers discuss politics and the nationalism driving Brexit. Many British people do not appreciate the economic damage Brexit will cause to the UK, the drivers say.“It is ideological for some of them,” says Neary. “They are not worried about the harm it is going to have – and it is going to cause awful harm on Ireland.”It takes just 20 minutes for Carroll’s lorry to leave the Port of Liverpool, passing through just one unmanned checkpoint on the Sunday morning before heading out towards the M62 and M6 south to Birmingham and London.It is not clear whether or where they might face customs checks after Brexit.“No one knows. They don’t know here themselves,” he says.It’s not the leaving of Liverpool that worries the Co Louth man but the road to Dover.Carroll encounters minor congestion near Heathrow on the M25 ring-road around London. Joining the M26 motorway connecting the M25 to the M20 to Dover, Carroll says the British authorities are considering using this 16km link road and 21km of the M20 as a temporary lorry park.A contingency plan called Operation Stack has been in place since 2015 on closed sections of the M20 to allow lorries to park while waiting to cross the English Channel when traffic is disrupted.A new plan, called Operation Brock, would create up to 2,000 on-road lorry car parking spaces on the M20. Under no-deal Brexit contingency planning, the M26 in Kent was shut down overnight last month and will be closed again this month and next, to assess whether it could be used as a “parking lot” for lorries.Each day, 10,000 lorries pass through Dover, with little or no delay. All that could change with Brexit. As the lorry speeds through the Kent countryside, Carroll points out the obvious lack of preparedness.“What amenities are there? Bushes and trees. That’s it. No toilets, no showers, no food. When your fridge runs out, it’ll be a disaster,” he says.One way of guaranteeing Irish trucks fast passage through Dover would be to secure international transit paperwork known as TIR or “Transports Internationaux Routiers”. This would allow approved hauliers traverse non-EU countries, like the UK will be, without stopping repeatedly for customs checks.Carroll sees tensions flaring as Irish lorry drivers drive by rows of parked-up UK lorries on the M20.“You’re going to have very agitated drivers that sit and wait maybe a day or two and you’ll come down with your transit document and you are straight through,” he says.“I don’t know how long before someone will get very annoyed.”For Irish hauliers using the landbridge, Brexit, he says, has “the makings of a complete disaster”.Carroll pulls into Dover without much delay. After a tense exchange with a woman at the ferry check-in hut we find ourselves on a later ferry because she says there are no more open-deck spaces on the 2.45pm ferry. Taking the 4pm ferry instead will eat into a valuable hour of Carroll’s driving time.“Can you imagine having to deal with that after waiting for three days up on the M20?” he says.Two hours later, the ferry pulls out of Dover and less than two hours after that, it arrives in Calais, France. Ten minutes later, we drive off the ferry towards the French-Belgian border.There are no delays. By 10pm we reach the overnight stop in Zolder, Belgium for Carroll’s required overnight rest period, after nine hours and 47 minutes of driving, since Liverpool.Carroll pulls out of Zolder for the last leg. We cross the Belgian-Dutch border at 7.50am, crossing briefly into The Netherlands. We reach the Dutch-German border at 8.26am. Again, there are no delays.Two ferries, six countries and 1,100 kilometres of road since Dublin, Carroll pulls into Wiesbaden and makes his delivery time slot at the pharmaceutical company. Door to door, it has taken just over 41 hours.After Brexit, Carroll has no idea whether he could do this trip via the UK landbridge in the same time.“It could be a disaster,” he says. “And if they haven’t got it done right, it will be horrendous.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

When I left him I walked away with $936 (£729) in a bank.Mel B finalised her orce from Belafonte in August, bringing their bitter split to an end.The mother-of-three alleged during the orce proceedings that he was abusive to her and her children, while he accused her of turning his stepdaughter Angel against him.In an interview with the newspaper, she revealed she felt trapped in their relationship. She said: “He made me feel ugly. Like a waste of space. Like I was a terrible mother, a whore. Like I was lucky to be married to him because no one else would put up with trash like me.  I felt emotionally battered, estranged from my family. I felt detested by the very man who promised to love and protect me . . . a man who had a library of sex tapes that could ruin my career and destroy my family.”Her autobiography, entitled Brutally Honest, explores her year-long relationship with Murphy, 57, which ended when she was pregnant.Murphy told reporters he wanted a DNA test to prove Brown\u0027s child was his which broke her heart. Brown said she felt humiliated and the pair went their separate ways while she was months away from giving birth to their child.  Now, more than a decade on, Brown revealed relations between her and Murphy were positive.

When I catch them with a pen in their hand and tell them to stop, they get angry with me, even though it should be the other way around, said Davide Albertini, the owner of a fashion shop a few yards from the entrance to Juliet’s House.“We spent a large amount of money last December to clean up the graffiti but a year on, it’s worse than ever,” he told The .Mr Albertini and other business owners have written to Verona city council asking for more surveillance of the area by local police.“We want to collaborate with the authorities to maintain decorum in the city centre,” he said.A couple kisses on the balcony of Juliet\u0026#39s House in VeronaIn 2008, the city introduced fines of up to €500 (£445) for anyone caught writing graffiti on public or private property, but the penalties are rarely enforced.Like Venice and Florence, which also struggle to manage the effects of mass tourism, Verona is a victim of its own success, attracting an estimated two million visitors a year, the majority of whom want to see Juliet’s House, a former medieval inn.It is not just graffiti that has become a problem. A bronze statue of Juliet had to be removed from the courtyard of the house because so many tourists had taken to rubbing its right breast in the hope of bringing good luck.Business owners in Verona are alarmed by the spread of graffiti around Juliet\u0026#39s House, one of Verona\u0026#39s most popular attractionsA crack appeared in the breast from all the wear and tear, and damage was done to the statue’s right arm, which tourists leant on as they had their photos taken.“The condition of the sculpture was undermined by the contact of so many tourists, particularly the tradition of touching Juliet’s right breast,” s of Juliet’s House said at the time.The bronze had stood in the courtyard since 1972 but was removed in 2014 and replaced by an exact replica created by a local foundry. The original was placed inside a museum within Juliet’s House.“The small hole that remains visible in the breast is a record of the service rendered by the old Juliet for more than 40 years to the lovelorn of the whole world,” the custodians said.The greatest problem with the Brexit deal?

Pressed into a field in Hampshire, it seemed to mirror the look of the original Arecibo message, which gave a host of information about life on Earth that the originators hoped would be decodable to people anywhere in the universe.Where the original Arecibo\u0026nbspmessage had shown blocks of information including depictions of important chemicals like carbon, an illustration of DNA and a picture of a human being. The hoax reply was probably too perfect: carbon was swapped for silicon, the DNA was altered and the human being was replaced with a big-headed alien of the kind seen in science fiction.Arecibo Message anniversary honoured in Google DoodleIt was of course a hoax: among other questions, sceptics wondered why aliens wouldn\u0027t simply have sent a radio message, as we did, rather than dropping down to Earth to press a picture of themselves into crops and then failing to actually alert anyone. But it was a demonstration of the way the original Arecibo\u0026nbspmessage and the search for alien life that it grew out of continues to occupy the minds of people around the world.Scientists don\u0027t ever expect to actually receive a reply to the Arecibo message: it was powerful but specific, pointed at a galaxy cluster that will actually have moved out of the way by the time it travels the 20,000 light years to its destination. It was probably most useful as a demonstration of the technology and a thought experiment that led people to think about what such a message might actually need to say.Similar efforts have been launched that could have more positive results, however. A new initiative called Breakthrough Message – part of a broader group supported by a Russian billionaire and Stephen Hawking, which aims to find life elsewhere in the universe – has invited people to consider how best to write and send a message out into space, though has cautioned that for the moment it will not send out those messages.But some fear that a response wouldn\u0027t come in the form of a message at all. Instead, it would be something altogether more dangerous – and that\u0027s why they advise that we shouldn\u0027t send further signals like the Arecibo message, for fear that they would only put us in peril.Stephen Hawking, for instance, famously said that we should be wary of sending out messages into the universe for fear that they could be answered by someone looking to wipe us out – or, perhaps worse, someone who might wipe us out purely by accident. ‘If aliens visit us, the outcome would be much as when Columbus landed in America, which didn’t turn out well for the Native Americans, he said in a 2010 documentary.And such criticism was even in place when the Arecibo\u0026nbspmessage was first sent. Just days after the dispatch was shot into space, the Royal Astronomer of England,\u0026nbspMartin Ryle, launched an intense blast of criticism at the idea, arguing that it might only alert aliens who are malevolent or hungry, and asking the\u0026nbspInternational Astronomical Union to ban any future messages.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

By mid-December, one bitcoin was worth close to $20,000 (£15,000), but that was the high water mark before the tide turned.A year later, bitcoin is trading at around a third of its peak value but some cryptocurrency analysts believe the market might be on the verge of mirroring the gains it experienced in late 2017. The only caveat is that it might not be bitcoin that leads the charge this time.Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne, who was behind the online retail giant becoming\u0026nbspone of the first places to accept bitcoin back in 2014, said\u0026nbspthat he still expects\u0026nbspthe mass adoption of cryptocurrency, without specifying\u0026nbspwhich one.Speaking to bitcoin enthusiast Naomi Brockwell on her YouTube channel, Mr Byrne said he remained highly sceptical of the traditional financial system. When asked if he saw bitcoin becoming a worldwide currency, he pointed to countries like Venezuela that have experienced significant financial turmoil in recent years.When people start getting into it is when their own financial systems collapse, he said.

This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearBitcoin has enjoyed the most sustained period of stability in its history, helping it address the issue of price volatility that some critics say makes it unsuitable as a form of mainstream payment.\u0026nbspGeneral consensus among market analysts is that this trend is likely to continue in the short term, barring any major news that could send the price shooting in either direction, such as a large-scale hack on a leading exchange, or positive regulation implemented by a financial body.Bitcoin price predictions made by 10 analysts for November\u0027s Finder\u0026nbspCryptocurrency Predictions Survey suggest that the world\u0027s leading digital currency will experience steady growth over the next year, though the upcoming months remain uncertain.Bitcoin wallet give away $125m of cryptocurrency to help growth“Some of our panellists believe external forces could shift the market greatly over the next month, and particularly for bitcoin, Jon Ostler, CEO of Finder, told\u0026nbspThe Independent.\u0026nbspThe upcoming decisions on a Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund being approved or not by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the US Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) deciding whether to accept the application by ICE backed cryptocurrency exchange, Bakkt, are expected before 1 December. So at this stage, it’s difficult to predict exactly what will happen.Looking longer term, Mr Ostler said bitcoin is expected to experience steady growth over the next year, with the panel of experts predicting an average\u0026nbspvalue of $16,732 by the end of 2019. “With bitcoin being very stable and within a range between $6,800 and $6,100, it is hard to suggest anything will change until it breaks this range, said cryptocurrency trader Craig Cobb, who forms part of the panel.leveled out in recent months (CoinMarketCap)But if it\u0027s not bitcoin, a\u0026nbsphint at what this next break-out cryptocurrency might be was given earlier this week by Blockchain, the world\u0027s most popular bitcoin wallet.

We voted to leave and this proposal regains as much control as we can expect whilst still keeping us open for business with our biggest trading partner. Moreover, it delivers a clear path ahead that business so desperately needs.”Business groups welcomed the agreement as progress but the Institute of Directors (IOD) said more detail was needed for firms to assess how they will be impacted.IOD director general Stephen Martin urged ministers to think “long and hard” about how they react to the first-stage agreement.“Leaving the EU without a deal is a very bad outcome for businesses, workers and consumers, and this is simply an inherent risk that comes with voting down any withdrawal deal,” he said.\u0026nbspThe IOD was “heartened” to see that provision had been made to extend the transition period, Mr Martin said. An extension would help to ensure firms have enough time to adjust to any new changes once the UK’s economic relationship with the EU had been agreed.But growing unrest in Westminster has made the prospect of the current deal passing through parliament appear remote.\u0026nbspTwo cabinet members, Dominic Raab and Esther McVey, resigned on Thursday saying they could not support the draft agreement.

Shares in the French car manufacturer\u0026nbsprose as much as 2.4 per cent to €20.25 (£19), outpacing gains of 1.1 per cent for rival Renault.Manufacturers including Airbus have warned for months that they will be forced to pull resources if Brexit leads to border delays, tariffs, or added paperwork that will drive up costs. Theresa May’s plan to ease some of those concerns is on the ropes, leaving her government in crisis and the deal with the EU in limbo with the 29 March orce creeping nearer.As May vowed to see her plan through, Rolls-Royce chief executive Warren East called for a pragmatic approach that allowed some disagreements, with any deal being better than none, he told BBC radio.While few have given details, companies have stepped up contingency planning as the odds rise of the UK\u0026nbspcrashing out of the EU with no deal.BMW chief executive\u0026nbspHarald Krueger said last month at the Paris Motor Show that the car manufacturer, which builds Minis at its Oxford plant in Oxfordshire,\u0026nbspmay have to move production to the Netherlands.

New car registrations are down 7.2 per cent, according to the industry group SMMT. Vauxhall’s have declined 11 per cent, while the Peugeot brand is off 2.8 per cent and Citroen has dropped 3.6 per cent.Earlier this year, PSA announced plans to build a new model of the Vivaro van in Luton and increase production in 2019 with a €100m\u0026nbspinvestment. PSA has announced 650 job cuts at Ellesmere Port since it bought the brand from General Motors\u0026nbsplast year.About 80 per cent of the cars made in the UK\u0026nbspare exported, with half of those going to the EU, according to the SMMT. The UK\u0026nbspaccounts for about 10 per cent of PSA’s global unit sales.Carmakers also import parts and components, which would be vulnerable to any border delays or tariffs. Only 40 per cent of Vauxhall’s Vivaro van components, for example, are produced in the UK, according to a spokesperson. That figure is about 23 per cent for the popular Astra.If there’s no deal, “my responsibility will be to protect my company,” PSA chief executive Carlos Tavares said in Paris.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

They also discern that the most likely future path is for the UK to stay in the EU customs union. This is because:It will be guaranteed to do\u0026nbspso during the transition periodThe transition period could easily be extendedIt will be impossible for the UK to leave the customs union without the EU’s acquiescence andThe indications from leaked Brussels documents are that the EU sees UK membership of the customs union as the central feature of the future trading relationship.For 29 months, those in business have sought clarity and found only fog. For now, and despite every sign that the deal will be rejected by the Commons (at least initially) they are urging its acceptance – if only as the classic lesser of two evils.Mike Hawes, head\u0026nbspof the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders – representing millions of jobs and major UK export sector – was typical of many when he said: “For the automotive industry, Brexit is about damage limitation. The outline agreement is a positive step in avoiding the devastating consequences of no deal and securing a transition period.”The CBI echoed that view, saying: “This deal is a compromise, including for business, but it offers that essential transition period as a step back from the cliff edge.”The business world has for the most part\u0026nbsptried throughout the Brexit process to be as apolitical as possible. One of the more outspoken companies is Young’s, the pub firm, which said: “We have got as much as we can from a business perspective, and we need politicians to support this.”Markets believe that if there is a hard Brexit after all, the hit to the UK economy will be so bad it would need substantial devaluation of the poundThat provides an interesting counterpoint to the vocal pro-Brexit boss of Wetherspoon, Tim Martin, whose objections to the EU’s protectionism are well-known. Small business too has usually been more ided than big business, though in Northern Ireland, understandably, there is near unanimous support for the no hard-border deal secured by the government.The verdict of investors can be read more easily in the pound’s value, share prices and trading volumes than in press releases. As political backing for the Brexit deal started to unravel this week a familiar pattern re-emerged, reversing the upswing we had seen when it seemed there was solid cabinet support.\u0026nbspShares sank in companies that relied heavily on the UK market – housebuilders and banks for example – while those that are global and whose earnings are mostly non-sterling enjoyed a boost (because their euro, yen and dollar profits would buy more pounds when they are “brought home”). Markets believe that if there is a hard Brexit after all, the hit to the UK economy would be so bad it would need substantial devaluation of the pound to make UK exports\u0026nbspcheaper and overcome tariff disadvantages.There is a wider question, too, about the Brexit debate, which was colourfully summed up when Boris Johnson, when still foreign secretary, was reported as saying “f***\u0026nbspbusiness” in an overheated exchange. In other words, whatever the CBI wants is not necessarily the best for the UK economy as a whole.Thus, the Brexit debate can be seen as an argument between the producer interest\u0026nbsp– big business – and the consumer interest\u0026nbsp– families. The EU, through tariffs and other barriers,\u0026nbspprotects its\u0026nbspbusiness,\u0026nbspespecially farming, from global competition. The bloc\u0026nbspprovides a supply of cheap labour and makes food, clothing and many manufactured goods more expensive than they need be. For the public, yes, jobs would be lost in the short term in a hard Brexit, but there would be gains as the budgets of lower-income families would go further in the shops.\u0026nbspSo, just as in the referendum two years ago, business is mostly hostile to Brexit, as well as frustrated about the continuing uncertainties. Even now, business leaders have no clear idea about what the business environment will be like after 11pm on 29 March\u0026nbsp2019.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We voted to leave and this proposal regains as much control as we can expect whilst still keeping us open for business with our biggest trading partner. Moreover, it delivers a clear path ahead that business so desperately needs.”Business groups welcomed the agreement as progress but the Institute of Directors (IOD) said more detail was needed for firms to assess how they will be impacted.IOD director general Stephen Martin urged ministers to think “long and hard” about how they react to the first-stage agreement.“Leaving the EU without a deal is a very bad outcome for businesses, workers and consumers, and this is simply an inherent risk that comes with voting down any withdrawal deal,” he said.\u0026nbspThe IOD was “heartened” to see that provision had been made to extend the transition period, Mr Martin said. An extension would help to ensure firms have enough time to adjust to any new changes once the UK’s economic relationship with the EU had been agreed.But growing unrest in Westminster has made the prospect of the current deal passing through parliament appear remote.\u0026nbspTwo cabinet members, Dominic Raab and Esther McVey, resigned on Thursday saying they could not support the draft agreement. By Friday afternoon 21 MPs had publicly submitted letters backing a vote of no confidence in the prime minister. \u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

Shares in the French car manufacturer\u0026nbsprose as much as 2.4 per cent to €20.25 (£19), outpacing gains of 1.1 per cent for rival Renault.Manufacturers including Airbus have warned for months that they will be forced to pull resources if Brexit leads to border delays, tariffs, or added paperwork that will drive up costs. Theresa May’s plan to ease some of those concerns is on the ropes, leaving her government in crisis and the deal with the EU in limbo with the 29 March orce creeping nearer.As May vowed to see her plan through, Rolls-Royce chief executive Warren East called for a pragmatic approach that allowed some disagreements, with any deal being better than none, he told BBC radio.While few have given details, companies have stepped up contingency planning as the odds rise of the UK\u0026nbspcrashing out of the EU with no deal.BMW chief executive\u0026nbspHarald Krueger said last month at the Paris Motor Show that the car manufacturer, which builds Minis at its Oxford plant in Oxfordshire,\u0026nbspmay have to move production to the Netherlands. Philips has been warning since July that it would do the same with its baby products factory in Glemsford.UK car manufacturing falls again as industry demands Brexit safeguardNo UK car manufacturer ready for Brexit, industry warnsOpel-Vauxhall reports first profit in almost two decadesVauxhall under criminal investigation after cars burst into flamesVauxhall making new investment in Luton despite Brexit uncertaintyVauxhall ‘could shut dealerships’, threatening thousands of jobs “The political situation remains uncertain,” BMW said in an email late Thursday. “As a responsible employer, we must therefore continue to prepare for the worst-case scenario, which is what a no-deal Brexit would represent.”Paris-based PSA employs about 3,000 people in the UK, mainly at plants in Ellesmere Port, where it builds the Astra model south of Liverpool, and Luton which turns out medium-size vans.Brexit, along with a drop in diesel’s popularity, has already hurt UK\u0026nbspcar sales this year. New car registrations are down 7.2 per cent, according to the industry group SMMT. Vauxhall’s have declined 11 per cent, while the Peugeot brand is off 2.8 per cent and Citroen has dropped 3.6 per cent.Earlier this year, PSA announced plans to build a new model of the Vivaro van in Luton and increase production in 2019 with a €100m\u0026nbspinvestment. PSA has announced 650 job cuts at Ellesmere Port since it bought the brand from General Motors\u0026nbsplast year.About 80 per cent of the cars made in the UK\u0026nbspare exported, with half of those going to the EU, according to the SMMT. The UK\u0026nbspaccounts for about 10 per cent of PSA’s global unit sales.Carmakers also import parts and components, which would be vulnerable to any border delays or tariffs. Only 40 per cent of Vauxhall’s Vivaro van components, for example, are produced in the UK, according to a spokesperson. That figure is about 23 per cent for the popular Astra.If there’s no deal, “my responsibility will be to protect my company,” PSA chief executive Carlos Tavares said in Paris.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It’s also worth limiting who can find your Facebook profile with your number and email address. 49 Control access to your TimelineYou can limit who gets to post things on your Timeline and who gets to see posts on your Timeline too. In Settings, go to Timeline and Tagging and edit the sections you want to lock down. When you block someone, they won’t be able to see things you post on your Timeline, tag you, invite you to events or groups, start conversations with you or add you as a friend. To do it, go to Settings and Blocking. Annoyingly, you have to block people on Messenger separately. One of Facebook’s handiest privacy features is the ability to review posts you’re tagged in before they appear on your Timeline. They’ll still be visible on the News Feed while they’re fresh, but won’t be tied to your profile forever. In Timeline and Tagging, enable Timeline review controls. 79 Clean up your appsYou can view a list of all of the apps you’ve connected to your Facebook account by going to Settings and Apps. The list might be longer than you expected it to be. It’s worth tidying this up to ensure things you no longer use lose access to your personal information. 89 Change your ad preferencesYou can view a list of everything Facebook thinks you’re into and tinker with your ad preferences by going to Settings and Adverts.

When the surviving members of the Doors assembled to hear a recording of Kilmer, none could tell which was the impersonation and which the real Morrison.

Sean O’Grady prepares for the worstClick to followThe IndependentWith the best will in the world, and there may be a remarkable shortage of that in the coming months, a chaotic Brexit will make reliable delivery of a huge variety of items more trickyIn the\u0026nbsptwo and a bit years\u0026nbspsince the EU referendum, successive waves of optimism and pessimism have crashed across the nation as hopes for an acceptable outcome\u0026nbsprise and fall. We still don’t know what will be decided at upcoming “crunch” European Union summits –\u0026nbspand the possibility remains that, even if a healthy dose of\u0026nbspgoodwill enables some kind of agreement to be cobbled together, Brexit will be messy.Whatever else, undoing a half-century of integration is bound to cause some distortion. So to be prudent, you might want to “Brexit-proof” your life, just in case. Here is my\u0026nbspfar from exhaustive\u0026nbspguide to some of the things you might (or might not) want to consider as departure day approaches.1. Stock up on loo rollWhat could be more essential to civilised life? Right now your local supermarket will happily sell you as many multipacks of Andrex (other leading brands are available) as you can transport home – but after 29 March\u0026nbsp2019\u0026nbspthere is a risk\u0026nbspthey may need to ration the supply. You see, some 50 per cent of the wood pulp used to make toilet rolls in UK factories comes into the country on lorries from Sweden,\u0026nbspan EU member state. When the lorries get stuck on some ferry somewhere, the factories will soon run out of raw material. They could make up the shortfall with the wood pulp that comes in from Brazil, although apparently that stuff isn’t as comfortable to use. You have been warned.Raab: Those fearing Brexit hit to car industry should show ‘mettle’2. Order your new car nowAround 85 per cent of the UK’s new car market is accounted for by imports,\u0026nbspand there are few vehicles you can buy that don’t have at least some European Union\u0026nbspcontent – including some famous British brands. The Mini, for example, has a crankshaft that crosses the Chanel more than a dozen times as it reaches completion. The Jaguar E-Pace, an excellent sporting SUV, is made in Austria, while only the Astra from the Vauxhall range is made here –\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspagain, it\u0026nbspcontains EU parts. On the other hand, all of BMW’s four-cylinder engines for the likes of the 3 Series are made in Birmingham…Disruption to such automotive supply chains will make delays inevitable for virtually any brand.\u0026nbspTariffs on new car imports, if imposed by the UK, may add to the list price – if you can source the vehicle in the first place. Order now from stock and relax.By the by, if you own a Fiat, Kia, Volkswagen, Nissan, Toyota, Skoda, Seat, Renault, Peugeot, Citroen, Vauxhall, Ford or virtually any other brand with parts from the EU, which includes “British” brands such as Mini, Bentley and Jaguar, then you might also want to buy a few spares. Just in case.3. Apply for an international driving permitThis is fairly crucial if you want to be able to drive legally “over there”.If you are fond of a proper brie, to offer a further random example, you know what to do...One of the main benefits of EU membership we take for granted is the Europe-wide recognition of national driving licences. This could conceivably end if we “crash\u0026nbspout” of the club. An international driving permit will allow you to drive legally throughout\u0026nbspthe EU you’ll need to\u0026nbspapply\u0026nbspfor it personally at a post office, for a reasonable fee of £5.50.4. Lay down some French wines, German salami, Italian pasta, Polish vodka, Belgian chocolates, Spanish manchego, Greek olives…With the best will in the world, and there may be a remarkable shortage of that in the coming months, a chaotic Brexit will make reliable delivery of these sorts of treats more tricky. There are British alternatives to many of them\u0026nbspbut\u0026nbspnot all, obviously. The commercial British olive, for example, is yet to make its appearance. If you are fond of a proper brie, to offer a further random example, you know what to do (no offence Somerset). You can\u0026nbspfreeze\u0026nbspharder cheeses and stick\u0026nbspsome pickled or “brined” cheeses in the pantry. The delicatessen then – such a continental word – is your next shopping destination. You’ll at least enjoy it, but try not to eat it all at once. Get stockpiling.5. Make sure your health insurance covers trips to the EU or EEAThe European Health Card and smooth reciprocal arrangements across the EU for member\u0026nbspcitizens in need of care could disappear. The safest solution might be to apply for some health insurance\u0026nbspthat will cover you in the EU for holidays and business trips.6. Review your investmentsNever a bad idea in any case. If you’re lucky enough to own some, including a (money purchase) pension pot, then be ready for the volatility a chaotic Brexit will bring. Currency movements will probably mean dollar, euro and other foreign currency assets will rise in value you may also find changes in the tax treatment of your stocks, shares, bond and real estate as the UK and EU settle down to their new, less convergent relationship.Fears of a collapse in sterling may be exaggerated but it is something you need to be aware ofWithout going full Project Fear II, there may also be sharpish trends in inflation, interest rates and tax that you might not have foreseen. A change in the Bank of England bank rate, for example, will influence gilt and, thus, annuity rates for people who purchase one with their retirement pot (though of course\u0026nbspyou don’t\u0026nbsphave to go down the annuity route under the newish “pension\u0026nbspfreedoms”). This could be favourable, or not, depending on what happens, but you need to understand what might happen, so far as you can. As ever, do your own research and seek independent financial advice.7. What, the gîte has to go?The timeshare pad in Spain, the cute little conical cottage in Puglia, beach apartment in Cyprus, bolthole in Paris… all favourite British property investments, and hitherto unthreatened by discriminatory taxation or property laws –\u0026nbspbut perhaps no longer.\u0026nbspThere might also be some effect on the popularity of your place if you let it out to UK holidaymakers, many of who will obviously be stuck\u0026nbspin Blighty\u0026nbspeating the cheese and wine reserves they’ve built up (see point 4).Post-Brexit, there may be less certainty that British citizens, resident or not, will enjoy the exact same property rights and tax equality they do now. On the other hand, if the euro, Bulgarian lev or Croatian kuna strengthens against the pound, other things being equal, then the sterling-equivalent value of your real estate may go up.\u0026nbspThere again, fears of a collapse in sterling may be exaggerated\u0026nbspbut it is something again you need to be aware of.8. Double-check the family treeYour ancestry, and one or two other conditions, might help you apply for a passport of another EU member state, should you want one.Don’t forget that although dual citizenship is permitted in the UK, it isn’t available\u0026nbspin all EU states, so you need to check if necessary, make a choice.Usually some form of parentage qualification can deliver a new passport from an EU nation – though a substantial investment can also secure one (see point 6). You will usually need to register your birth, even if it was in Britain, with the country you wish to become a citizen of. Here are a few of the basics to get the ball rolling (though there is much devilish bureaucracy in the detail so beware)...Surge in British people obtaining EU citizenship, new data revealsItalian citizenship: by being born\u0026nbspto an Italian parent and, in some circumstances, via an Italian grandparent. Or by naturalisation – at least 10\u0026nbspyears’ residency.Irish citizenship: yours if\u0026nbspsome of your parents or grandparents were Irish\u0026nbspor, under some circumstances, by marriage to an Irish citizen.\u0026nbspNaturalisation by residency will also get you an Irish passport.Spanish citizenship: for British expats it is possible\u0026nbspto obtain Spanish citizenship via residency, but you will have to surrender your\u0026nbspBritish citizenship – toss a euro\u0026nbspfor it. Alternatively, once you have lived in Spain for five uninterrupted years, you can apply for an “EU long-term residence permit”, which enables you to work and live in Spain on the same basis as Spanish citizens. You can\u0026nbspalso apply if you have a Spanish father or mother.Cypriot citizenship: been married to a Cypriot for at least three years? Time to celebrate!\u0026nbspCypriot parentage will also do the trick,\u0026nbspas will\u0026nbsp“citizenship by investment” – a property worth at least €500,000.\u0026nbspIt might be prudent to make sure your next prescription gets filled in good timeMaltese citizenship: naturalisationresidency for five years should do it. But here too there is a chance of flashing the cash via the Malta Inidual Investor Programme – at least €500,000 in various combinations of Maltese government bonds, and the National Development and Social Fund. Five years of marriage to\u0026nbspa Maltese citizen is another route.\u0026nbspMost EU and EEA countries (eg Norway, Switzerland) are members of the Schengen scheme, meaning no border checks in any case for EU citizens.9. Order your European-made fridge, washing machine, dishwasher…Much the same arguments apply to consumer goods as they do to cars, though the prevalence of Chinese-made products (sometimes with European brand names) means that the possible delays and inconvenience are somewhat less for this class of goods. However, if you really desire a German-made Miele washing machine you might be wise to make a move on one now.10. Buy your foreign currency\u0026nbspnowI don’t have a Brexit crystal ball any more than anyone else but it seems reasonable to conclude that a\u0026nbsphard Brexit, the nearer it gets, could well bring about a hefty depreciation of sterling – as happened the morning after the 2016 referendum, when the pound lost about 15 per cent of its external value (though it did gradually recover). Then again, whenever there is a wave of optimism about the talks, sterling tends to rise. The pound would be expected to slide against all the major currencies in an unexpectedly chaotic scenario, so\u0026nbspif you wish to be cautious\u0026nbspyou could get your euros, dollars, roubles and rupees in now.11. Stock up on medicinesAssuming they have a long shelf life, that is. This is one of the most vexed of all the post-Brexit questions, about which we have heard a lot from politicians. All one can say now on the question of imported medicines is that they will, under UK law, be OK to use\u0026nbspin Britain if they’re already EU approved, as we will adopt all the European Union regulations from day one\u0026nbspof Brexit. However, like so many other goods, there may be delays in transportation, and it might be prudent to make sure your next prescription gets filled in good time. The UK has a competitive pharmaceuticals sector, for now\u0026nbspthere is a reasonable chance that your pills and potions can be sourced by the pharmacy. Keep a weather eye\u0026nbspopen for updates.12. Au pairs, tenants and employees: let\u0026nbspthem go now or hang on for dear lifeWithout a legally sound withdrawal agreement, the rights and status of EU citizens living and working in the UK will need to be clarified, and there is no sign of that yet. Some may decide to leave the UK, even after many years here, which will inevitably\u0026nbspcause great disruption.\u0026nbspYou may therefore\u0026nbspwish to make some contingency arrangements of your own if, say, you rent a house to a Slovak family, have a French au pair or employ workers from Poland. The short story is that they may be hard to replace.13. Take advantage of “the exciting opportunities” offered by BrexitJoking aside, there will be some potential benefits for the new “global Britain”. If you’re the entrepreneurial type, you might well want to seek out new trading opportunities in China or India, as (or\u0026nbspif) tariffs and other restrictions that are now levied on goods and services in either direction are lifted. That could happen as a result of unilateral UK action or, in the longer run, through the kind of ambitious trade deals ministers talk so frequently\u0026nbspabout.All in all,\u0026nbspnow may be a good\u0026nbspmoment to start that business advising Indian students about how to get a visa and apply for a course at a British university. Provided of course the government finds such an arrangement with India that is compatible with its migration targets.Created with Sketch.Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in pictures Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.John Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

Engage in some cross-border arbitrageNot smuggling, you understand, but legitimate trade exploiting anomalies in inidual markets.If the Troubles return post-Brexit, it won’t just be due to the borderThis may be of especial interest to people living near the Irish border, who will have to make the most of whatever is coming their way this\u0026nbspspring. On the one hand, the prices\u0026nbspof various goods will erge because of movements in the exchange rate,\u0026nbspas well as duty, taxation\u0026nbspand regulation. The opportunities will be obvious. On the other hand, the EU or UK may decide to instal more stringent customs controls than before it’s\u0026nbspa sensitive subject. Or they could just forget about Ireland and leave things as they are, tolerating a certain amount of cross-border economic activity. Let’s be honest, no one knows.15. Watch your phone billOne of the greatest of the positive practical differences the EU Commission made in recent years was to cut mobile phone roaming rates among EU states.\u0026nbspIt is not yet clear whether\u0026nbspthat regulation will survive the Brexit process, although it may be caught by the UK withdrawal legislation.16. Check your flightOpinions, even at this relatively late stage, differ on how easy air travel will be post-Brexit. There are many EU regulations that govern passenger air transport\u0026nbsp(and freight for that matter). These\u0026nbspmay be overcome by UK-based\u0026nbspairlines setting up subsidiary companies in the EU\u0026nbspbut carrying on with business as usual – or not. Once again, confusion is the most likely outcome, and you may wish to exercise caution about booking your next flight.17. Learn to love your local uniThe future of European educational projects such as the Erasmus exchange scheme is under active discussion. More broadly, EU students can come and study in Britain at UK tuition fee rates, and that may not be so in future. By the same token, British students going to study in the EU may find themselves facing new fees and charges,\u0026nbspas well as having to factor in the impact\u0026nbspon their living costs of potential shifts to the exchange rate.18. Beware the expat lifeJust as there will be much uncertainty about the future of EU citizens in the UK, so there will be for those Britons living happily in EU countries, working or retired. There will be many issues to consider, some covered above: the cost of healthcare taxes on\u0026nbspproperty and income the payment or uprating of the UK state pension payment of local social security benefits gyrations in the exchange rate,\u0026nbspand the value of real estate across borders\u0026nbspremitted income from the UK the right to bring other family members to come and live with you voting rights and much else.19. Watch out for the RockSounds sinister – but not meant to be. Many Britons have links to Gibraltar, not just for financial reasons. Thus far\u0026nbspan under-discussed aspect of Brexit, Gibraltar is another UK territoryEU land border that raises an awful lot\u0026nbspof questions. The situation is made trickier because the EU has\u0026nbspgranted Spain a veto on future arrangements on Gibraltar. Nothing could change, perhaps\u0026nbspor “concessions” may only amount to the Spanish police having a role at the airport or the Spanish could decide to make life at the border more difficult, even though many Spanish workers rely on Gibraltar for their livelihoods.Created with Sketch.People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit deal Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 march20. Don’t count on future working visits to the EUBy analogy with the US, if things really do get nasty\u0026nbspthen visa-free EU travel may be restricted to holidays and leisure. “Work”, even on a temporary assignment, may be treated differently, as it is by the\u0026nbspStates. Thus a special visa from the EU Belgium\u0026nbspmay be required if, say, a journalist wishes to go to Brussels, ironically, to report on the EU’s activities.\u0026nbspLikewise, an architect who wants to go Prague to supervise some construction work may need\u0026nbspan EUCzech permit. That’s because\u0026nbspif the UK\u0026nbspleaves the single market, British qualifications will not necessarily be recognised by EU states, as they tend to be now. Once again, a “worst case scenario” possibility that has\u0026nbspnot been much discussed.\u0026nbspSo there we are then. With luck, Britain won’t leave the EU at all certainly the pressure for a Final Say referendum is growing by the week. Or maybe we will do so in name only, or perhaps\u0026nbspacross a smooth, seamless transition that will take many months. Then again, Brexit hasn’t enjoyed much luck so far…\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

James Moore considers whether there is any room for social responsibility in the corporate world, or if we should just ditch the spiel on valuesClick to followThe IndependentBusinesses are stakeholders in society, and vice versa“These guys are mad. Call off the invasion. Their system’s going to eat them so we won’t have to. They have these company things that they’re allowing to bust the whole place up. Let’s just sit tight and clean up once they’re done wrecking it.”That’s what an alien might very well say upon looking at the way the titans of the capitalist system have been operating.\u0026nbspYou want examples? Ten years on from the financial crisis that caused a brutal recession and a lost economic decade from which we have still to fully recover and it isn’t hard to find people who’ll tell you that the banks could easily do it again.Tech giants make money from people taking out ads that are designed to corrupt democratic elections, while other companies wreck the environment.\u0026nbspMeanwhile, the carnival of corporate scandal adds a new float every few months. Yet according to the Nobel prize-winning economist Milton Friedman, whose influence permeates through the Anglo-Saxon capitalist world, they’re all only doing what they’re supposed to do: increasing profits by whatever means necessary within the law.\u0026nbspIn his seminal work Capitalism and Freedom,\u0026nbspFriedman baldly stated that “the social responsibility of business is to increase its profits”.\u0026nbspHe had no truck with companies having any regard for\u0026nbspthe societies in which they operate, much less furthering socially useful goals such as\u0026nbsp“providing employment, eliminating discrimination, avoiding pollution and whatever else may be the catchwords of the contemporary crop of reformers”.\u0026nbsp“Businessmen who talk this way are unwitting puppets of the intellectual forces that have been undermining the basis of a free society these past decades,” he opined.\u0026nbspThat view is at odds with what you’ll often hear from modern executives, who like to talk about how important the “values” of the businesses they run are\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspbig up their role as “good corporate citizens”.\u0026nbspFacebook isn’t about making money. It exists to “connect people”. “Don’t be evil”\u0026nbspfamously used to be at the centre of Google’s corporate philosophy until it was quietly removed.\u0026nbspNow it says: “The Google Code of Conduct is one of the ways we put Google’s values into practice. It’s built around the recognition that everything we do in connection with our work at Google will be, and should be, measured against the highest possible standards of ethical business conduct.”Isn’t that nice? Milton must be turning in his grave. You hear similar things on this side of the Atlantic. I once suggested to a very senior executive at a rather famous FTSE 100 company over dinner that his talk about values was basically window dressing, and that cash was king. He became visibly upset.\u0026nbspYet Friedman would have found nothing to take issue with in the investor presentations put out by the aforementioned executive’s employer.\u0026nbspHe might have found today’s fiction of corporate social responsibility frustrating, even infuriating, but he wouldn’t need to scratch too far below the surface to be reassured.The Pew Research Centre recently pointed out that today real\u0026nbspwages\u0026nbspin the US, adjusting for inflation, have about the same purchasing power as they did 40 years ago. Only those at the very top have made real gainsThe majority of western companies and western executives subscribe to and live by his doctrine in nearly every respect, even if they’re sometimes reluctant to admit it.\u0026nbspThat shouldn’t surprise anyone. They are legally required to do so.\u0026nbspBritain’s Companies Act of 2006 –\u0026nbsppassed by a Labour government by the way –\u0026nbsphas the fiduciary duty of directors to shareholders at its core.It states that a director must act “in the way he (sic) considers, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole”.\u0026nbspIn the case of big public companies, the members are shareholders, who invest in them, as Friedman stated, for the purpose of making money.\u0026nbspCapitalism red in tooth and claw rules, say his fanboys, because it has proved far better at delivering prosperity to those living under it than any of the alternatives (Friedman was writing at a time when the main one was Soviet-style communism).\u0026nbspSo, you corporate executives, it’s time to bin all that fluff about values. Go get yourself some CREAM (Cash Rules Everything Around Me, with apologies to the Wu-Tang Clan).\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspThe trouble with that view is it isn’t working so well any more, at least not for the masses, which might explain why extremists of one sort or another are finding such favour, extremists who are mostly bad for business – and yes that includes those on the right, in case you hadn’t noticed Donald Trump’s trade war.\u0026nbspThe Pew Research Centre recently pointed out that today real wages in the US, adjusting for inflation, have about the same purchasing power as they did 40 years ago.\u0026nbspOnly those at the very top have made real gains. Since 2000 their real wages have risen by a cumulative 15.7 per cent, to $2,112 (£1,628) a week – nearly five times the usual weekly earnings of the bottom tenth ($426).\u0026nbspReal wages for the average American worker actually peaked 45 years ago, a couple of years after Friedman published a piece expounding on his profits argument in The New York Times Magazine.\u0026nbspSimilar issues are at work in the UK labour market. Pawel Adrjan, UK economist at Indeed, a job site, recently noted that average pay is still below its 2008 pre-crisis peak.“If real wages had continued growing at their pre-crisis trend, the average person would now be earning £130 more per week than they actually do,” he said.\u0026nbspIn the boardroom it’s a different story. In a 2015 report, the High Pay Centre noted that CEOs in the UK had seen their pay increase by a factor of five since the late 1990s\u0026nbsp– despite no evidence that this resulted in better corporate performance, productivity or economic performance.\u0026nbspThe latter point was eloquently made by Charles Cotton, senior performance and reward advisor at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and\u0026nbspDevelopment, during a hearing of the parliamentary business committee in June.\u0026nbspYet despite the occasional shareholder rebellion, there is scant sign of any real slowdown. A more recent report by the centre found that CEO pay leapt by 11 per cent in 2017, more than four times the pace at which the average worker’s pay increased.\u0026nbspFriedman argued\u0026nbspthat a corporate executive has direct responsibility to his employers “to conduct the business in accordance with their desires, which generally will be to make as much money as possible while conforming to the basic rules of the society”.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Mark Zuckerberg meets world leaders – in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.President Barack Obama talks with Zuckerberg during a town hall style meeting at Facebook headquarters in Palo Alto, California, 20 April 2011David Cameron talks to the Facebook founder during the internet session of the G8 summit in Deauville, France, 26 May 2011German Chancellor Angela Merkel and former French president Nicolas Sarkozy meet Zuckerberg at the G8 summit in Deauville, France, 26 May 2011Zuckerberg talks to Sarkozy at a G8 summit in Deauville, France, 25 May 2011Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe meets the Facebook CEO at the company’s headquarters in Menlo Park, California, 30 April 2015Zuckerberg with former Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda in Tokyo, 29 March 2012Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Zuckerberg at a townhall meeting at Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park, California, 27 September 2015Zuckerberg with other business leaders and the Chinese President Xi JinpingPresident Barack Obama talks with Zuckerberg during a town hall style meeting at Facebook headquarters in Palo Alto, California, 20 April 2011David Cameron talks to the Facebook founder during the internet session of the G8 summit in Deauville, France, 26 May 2011German Chancellor Angela Merkel and former French president Nicolas Sarkozy meet Zuckerberg at the G8 summit in Deauville, France, 26 May 2011Zuckerberg talks to Sarkozy at a G8 summit in Deauville, France, 25 May 2011Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe meets the Facebook CEO at the company’s headquarters in Menlo Park, California, 30 April 2015Zuckerberg with former Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda in Tokyo, 29 March 2012Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Zuckerberg at a townhall meeting at Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park, California, 27 September 2015Zuckerberg with other business leaders and the Chinese President Xi JinpingBut, while they conform to that for the most part, when it comes to the question of their pay –\u0026nbspthey clearly break the rule. They and the non-executive directors who set it frequently act in ways that are ultimately opposed to shareholders interests.\u0026nbspThe situation reached its nadir in the UK with Persimmon Homes and its potential payment of £600m, slated to be shared among just over 130 executives. CEO Jeff Fairburn was due to receive more than £100m through it, although a public furore eventually saw him agreeing to reduce it to £75m.\u0026nbspThe company had been successful on his watch, it’s true, but that success was largely fuelled by the government-funded help to buy scheme, which underwrites mortgages for the first-time buyers Persimmon targets.\u0026nbspIt thus owed much of its success to a de facto public subsidy.\u0026nbspThe chair, and the chair of the remuneration committee who resigned in the midst of the scandal, admitted that the bonus scheme should have been capped, but this was too late to save the shareholders they were supposed to represent, who ended up handing over nearly 10 per cent of their company to its executives. No wonder one commentator referred to it as an act of “corporate looting”.\u0026nbspFiduciary duty? Forget about it!\u0026nbspPart of the reason for the repeated occurrence of this sort of thing is the way the modern company has become, in effect, ownerless – widely held by erse groups of institutional investment funds which buy and sell electronically, rarely vote on company resolutions and sometimes may only be on the shareholder register for a matter of days, even hours.\u0026nbspRemuneration committees would have you believe that they seek to align the interests of executives with those of shareholders, despite their lack of oversight, by making them shareholders too. CREAM for all!Facebook has had its reputation trashed, and paid fines, while also dealing with new rules. There might be worse to comeThe problem with that analysis is executives get their shares for free, and if something is free you don’t really value it. They rarely put their own money at risk. Perish the thought.\u0026nbspThis too often leads to them throwing caution to the wind in pursuit of potentially huge payouts. Why not?If their employer fails really badly, keels over and dies halfway down the track from an overenthusiastic application of the whip, they may lose their jobs. But corporate executives are rarely out of work for long.\u0026nbspTake a look at the career of Andy Hornby, as an example. The HBOS CEO had his hand on the tiller when the bank fell off a cliff, and the government had to step in and find a rescuer (Lloyds) which it then had to bail out.\u0026nbspMr\u0026nbspHornby, who was sharply criticised in a report by the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards, ought to have been unemployable after that. But it wasn’t long before he found a new role as the chief executive of Alliance Boots, before moving on to bookmaker Coral.\u0026nbsp​RBS’s Fred Goodwin wasn’t so lucky thanks to his status as the bogeyman of British banking. But nearly all of his boardroom colleagues had secured alternative work within a couple of years of that bank’s collapse. One wonders what will now happen to those who spent time in the Carillion boardroom. Its executives also went for the bonus long shot jackpot. Expansion and profits uber alles, until the roulette wheel threw up a double zero.There was no bailout in that case, but the taxpayer was nonetheless left with a hefty bill in the wake of yet another glaring example of the capitalism Friedman advocated eating itself. But there are some companies that have eschewed Friedman’s ideas in another, more laudable respect, and with intriguing results.I’m not talking here about the corporate social responsibility\u0026nbspprogrammes most big businesses like to run. They’re often little more than extensions of the marketing budget, designed to send a message to consumers: “Hey you lot, come spend with us. You can feel good about it because even though we screw up the environment, look we’ve built a well in Senegal and we let our people go and help inner-city kids in their lunch hours.”I am instead thinking of those businesses that have actively sought to promote ersity (a favourite of the current crop of reformers) through their hiring\u0026nbsppractices.\u0026nbspFar from suffering through doing so, they have benefited, and handsomely.\u0026nbspMcKinsey, a management consultant renowned for its hard-headed intellectual rigour, sought to study the impact on the\u0026nbspcorporate profitability of hiring both more women and more staff from a minority ethnic background.\u0026nbspIts report –\u0026nbspDelivering Through Diversity –\u0026nbspshows that companies that do this make more money.\u0026nbspThe firm examined 1,000 companies from 12 countries for the 2017 study.\u0026nbspThose with workforces in the top 25 per cent for ethnic ersity were 33 per cent more likely to see higher than average profits than those in the lowest. When it came to gender ersity the figure was 21 per cent.\u0026nbspThe findings particularly stressed the importance of these groups being hired to both management roles (where they are often hardest to find) and in revenue-generating “line”\u0026nbsppositions from where executives are typically drawn.\u0026nbspCompanies that do so comply with Friedman’s demands that they maximise profits by taking his prescription and doing the opposite. \u0026nbspBut the question of whether the “profit at all costs” aim isn’t still destructive remains.\u0026nbspPutting profits first has left Britain with water companies that impose hosepipe bans while gallons upon gallons of water pours into its streets from leaking pipes.\u0026nbspIt has produced the railway debacles that have shattered the faith of the public in privatisation.\u0026nbspIt was for the purposes of bringing in a few extra dollars that Facebook allowed itself to be used by those seeking to influence the US presidential election and the Brexit referendum.All these demonstrate how self-defeating corporate behaviour that puts profits above society can be. The water industry is now dealing with tougher regulation, while the government is poised to announce a review into how rail services are delivered.\u0026nbspIf Labour comes to power both industries face nationalisation, an idea that is finding increasing favour with the public.\u0026nbspFacebook has had its reputation trashed, and paid fines, while also dealing with new rules. There might be worse to come. There probably should be.\u0026nbspWould all this have happened were these businesses to have taken their “social responsibilities” more seriously?It\u0027s not just in the field of hiring that companies would benefit from thinking a little more carefully about what they do and how they do it.\u0026nbspEco-friendly buildings? That’s your energy bill down.\u0026nbspSocially responsible businesses could serve to benefit shareholders, at least those with a time horizon beyond five minutesAct to cut emissions and curb other environmentally damaging behaviours? The costs of environmental destruction could be reduced, resulting in, for example, lower insurance premiums.\u0026nbspSocially responsible businesses could serve to benefit shareholders, at least those with a time horizon beyond five minutes.\u0026nbspIt’s worth considering the experience of Nationwide and John Lewis, one a member-owned mutual, the other an employee-owned partnership, at this point.\u0026nbspThey aren’t without their failings. Nationwide, for example, is as guilty of overpaying its executives as some banks.But as a rule, they manage to balance both long-term financial success, something their owners are still interested in, with a more enlightened stance towards the society they operate within than some of their peers.John Lewis’s constitution is a particularly worthy example. It sets out employee partners’ rights and responsibilities and defines “how power is shared and our collective responsibilities to others”.Mutuals and partnerships fail just as public companies do. But as often as not it is when they follow the destructive playbook of the latter, with too little oversight brought to bear on over-powerful and overpaid executives seeking to maximise profits above all else and taking silly risks to do so. \u0026nbspPerhaps it’s time to consider a revised Companies Act to better balance shareholders’ interests with those of other stakeholders. A very senior Tory, from the party’s sane (non-Brexiteer) wing, pooh-poohed this notion in conversation with me. They argued that an employee, for example, could never be ranked alongside the shareholder owner. But why not? As I’ve tried to demonstrate, it might ultimately work in their favour.\u0026nbspJohn Lewis, where the employees are the owners, hasn’t been immune from the challenges afflicting the high street. But most of its stock market-listed department store rivals would kill to be in the position it is in.\u0026nbspWorks councils are commonplace in Europe, as is employee representation on boards, something Theresa May briefly talked about before beating a hasty retreat. \u0026nbspJohn Lewis chairman Sir Charlie Mayfield to step down in 2020Diversity makes companies richer says McKinsey. Investors take noteIt is true that they haven’t necessarily\u0026nbspserved to curtail executives’ worst instincts –\u0026nbspit isn’t hard to find examples of excessive pay at German companies for example. But look at Germany\u0026nbspand look at Britain and ask yourself which has the better way of doing things. Would anyone other than a die-hard nationalist say anything other than “Vorsprung Durch Technik”?\u0026nbspBritain, and other western nations, have also given businesses responsibility for functions they never had when Friedman was writing.\u0026nbspSo, yes, society does have a big stake in how they are run, and governed. It is high time that was recognised. Society needs seats on the board, a place in the constitution,\u0026nbspa role in corporate thinking. So do workers.\u0026nbspWhen Tony Blair coined the phrase “stakeholder” it was widely criticised as a buzzword (he was rather fond of them).\u0026nbspBut businesses are stakeholders in society, just as society is a stakeholder in businesses.\u0026nbspThe betterment of one\u0026nbspfavours the other, not least because, as that McKinsey study shows, more society can ultimately lead to more money. More CREAM for everyone.It’s time for us to recognise that and to start looking at ways of reforming the system. It really isn’t serving us very well.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It failed to see it – but that failure puts a limit on how big the rock can be, since if it was large enough it would have been spotted, according to a new paper published in\u0026nbspthe Astronomical Journal and coauthored by scientists at NASA\u0027s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.Asteroid could have been spacecraft sailing past us, say scientistsThat helps to lead credence to the theory that the relatively small object is being pushed along by gas that was being thrown out of the object. That gave the effect of adding thrust as it travelled through the solar system, speeding it up.It was that strange speeding up behaviour that led scientists to suggest that it could be an alien probe, sent past Earth by a distant civilisation. The extra propulsion could be caused by the object working as a lightsail, designed to be carried along by solar radiation, Harvard scientists recently suggested.The alternative and more accepted theory of frozen gases inside the object being expelled and pushing it along was dependent on Oumuamua\u0026nbspbeing smaller than typical comets inside of our solar system. With the determination that it probably is, the research seems to suggest theories about it being an alien spacecraft are less likely.Oumuamua has been full of surprises from day one, so we were eager to see what Spitzer might show, said David Trilling, lead author on the new study and a professor of astronomy at Northern Arizona University. The fact that Oumuamua was too small for Spitzer to detect is actually a very valuable result.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

At this biennial event, the participating companies exhibit their latest service robotic technologies and componentsThe robot developed by Seed Solutions sings and dances to music during the Japan Robot Week 2016 at Tokyo Big SightSocial jet lag is a new phenomenon where people shift their sleeping patterns backwards and forwards during weekends and holidays. It is thought to be exaggerated by disruptive things like phones and social networks that encourage people to stay up and follow the news, and\u0026nbspit is thought to affect a vast proportion of the population.Usually, people are forced to wake up much earlier than their biological clock would suggest, as they get up for work. At the weekends, people will often move back again, going to sleep later and making up for it with lie-ins in the morning.This is the reason you\u0027re not sleeping wellNow a new study has found that appears to be causing social jet lag, where people are disrupting their sleep pattern between the week and the weekend.The new research came from a study that looked at\u0026nbspthe Twitter activity of more than 246,000 users from 2012 to 2013. Those tweets were tagged with geographical location, allowing researchers to use them to understand when people were going to sleep and waking up.It found that people across the US seemed to sleep in and tweet later during times that saw large amounts of holidays. Previously, scientists had suspected that social jet lag might change with the seasons and the amount of daylight – and while it does differ through the year, that appears to be more a consequence of the way people\u0027s social schedules change, rather than anything seasonal in itself.We started the study expecting it to be a solar or seasonal effect – that your internal clock will shift in the summer and that will lead to decreases in social jet lag, said Aaron Dinner, professor of chemistry and one of the study\u0027s senior authors. But in fact, that\u0027s not what we found at all. People get up later on weekdays in the summer because their social constraints are relaxed. Weekend behaviour – and presumably a person\u0027s biological clock – does not change much over the year in most counties.The researchers also found that the data about sleep correlated with obesity rates: places that tweeted until later also saw higher rates of obesity. They also correlated with sleep data taken from more traditional studies.I was impressed that so much could be learned from this purely public data set that was not at all intended to tell you about sleep, said Michael Rust, associate professor of molecular genetics, cell biology and physics and the study\u0027s other senior author. In fact, we could rediscover things like the correlation with obesity or levels of social jet lag based on time zone that were found in other studies where people designed surveys to ask about sleep directly.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

While Kate Silverton declared she would be swimming in the sea upon arrival (if you believe that, you’ll believe anything), the dancers are more excited to let loose on the huge sprung dance floor of the Tower Ballroom.The space tends to dwarf the couples so expect backing dancers, props and various examples of ‘faffing around’ (we miss you, Len), which either adds to the spectacle or detracts from the actual dancing, depending on your point of view. And stand by for many, many mentions of Blackpool being the ‘home’ of ballroom dancing, a veritable temple for dancers, the place where Kevin Clifton and AJ Pritchard won their titles etc. This episode is always ideal for drinking games.Away from the clichés, we’re at the stage in the competition where we can expect some sensational dancing. With a perfect 40 still up for grabs, there’s real incentive for the couples to give it some welly.Danny John-Jules eliminated from Strictly Come Dancing amid rowThe 6 talking points from Strictly Come Dancing week 8Faye Tozer and Giovanni Pernice promise a fierce paso doble, Ashley Roberts and Pasha Kovalev are bound to excel with an exuberant jive and the judges will surely coo over Stacey Dooley’s salsa-based homage to Eurovision Queen Gina G.Joe Sugg, who is delighted to be taking his nan with him to Blackpool (she danced there in her twenties), will be simultaneously quickstepping and playing a walking piano, the kind shown in the film, Big.

He tweeted that the position was ”a poisoned chalice”, before claiming that the government was “unlikely to survive until Christmas”.Labour’s shadow minister for the cabinet office Jon Trickett said Theresa May\u0027s decision to appoint Ms Rudd, who was forced to step down as home secretary over the Windrush scandal only months ago, was a desperate choice.“After enforcing Theresa May’s hostile environment in the Home Office, Amber Rudd will now be in charge of the DWP’s hostile environment for disabled people and the poorest in society, he said.\u0026nbsp“With Universal Credit in absolute shambles, appointing a disgraced former minister who was only recently forced to resign for her role in another scandal is a desperate choice by a weak prime minister.”Universal credit replaces six existing benefits – employment support allowance, income support, income-based jobseeker’s allowance, housing benefit, working tax credit and child tax credit – with a single payment.A National Audit Office report released in June found food bank use in Ms Rudd’s constituency,\u0026nbspHastings, had risen by 80 per cent since UC was rolled out there.The\u0026nbsprollout\u0026nbspof UC\u0026nbspstarted with new recipients in pilot areas in 2013, but the scheme has been plagued by delays and it is now\u0026nbspnot due for completion until 2023.Created with Sketch.

Another insider told The Independent others were more focussed on achieving a stronger settlement in the “future framework” – outlining the UK’s final post-Brexit trading relations with the EU – which is still to be hammered out ahead the special EU summit on 25 November.Created with Sketch.

But he added:\u0026nbsp“Nothing is agreed, until everything is agreed.”The EU have been less equivocal, with German chancellor Angela Merkel saying there is “no question” of reopening talks as a document is now “on the table”.Ms Rudd’s return to the cabinet is a boost for Ms May, given that she has backed the current form of the prime minister’s withdrawal agreement.After her new job as work and pensions secretary was announced, Ms Rudd told Emma Barnett on BBC Radio 5 Live: “It is quite exciting this proposal, and I certainly hope the cabinet back it.\u0026nbsp“I think it’s the right combination. It’s a compromise. Everybody knew it was going to have be a compromise, and the people who are throwing mud at it from either side are looking for something perfect.“Perfect was never going to be on offer.”Earlier in the day Eurosceptic MP Steve Baker sought to pressure cabinet members by warning that any who backed Ms May’s approach could forget about becoming party leader – with Mr Gove, Ms Mordaunt, Mr Hunt and Mr Javid\u0026nbspbelieved to harbour ambitions.But a push from Mr Baker and other members of the\u0026nbspEuropean Research Group (ERG) of backbenches to secure a vote of no confidence in the prime minister appeared to have some way to go, with the MP making differing statements during the day on how many letters had been submitted – 48 are needed from MPs to trigger a vote.Tory whips held a meeting on Friday ahead of a potential challenge, while Ms May conducted a conference call with Tory association chairs as she tried to build support for her Brexit deal.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

For these reasons I cannot support the proposed agreement in parliament and would hope that Conservative MPs would do likewise.”The cabinet’s backing, however, means the EU are set to give the green light to a\u0026nbspEuropean Council\u0026nbspsummit at the end of November, which if successful could see a vote on the draft deal in the house of commons in early December.\u0026nbspThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

So I hope that this can be such a basis.\u0026nbspFox admits ‘a deal is better than no deal’ as he backs May’s BrexitEU leaders ‘could be willing’ to renegotiate Brexit, Sturgeon insistsTheresa May calls Brexit press conference amid bid to unseat herMay braced for more cabinet resignations after day of Brexit chaos“The worst case, and most disorderly, is that there is no kind of no deal.”It comes as Westminster waits with baited breath to see whether the prime minister will be subject to a no-confidence vote over the plan. This would be triggered if 48 Tory MPs write to party authorities requesting one, a number that is thought to be close.In Brussels, ambassadors of the 27 remaining EU member states are meeting to put the finishing touches to the “future relationship” part of the deal, which unlike the withdrawal agreement could still change.An account of one meeting on Friday reported by the BBC says EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier paid tribute to Ms May’s conduct in talks, but that he warned the EU should not compromise its principles even if there is a difficult situation in the UK.\u0026nbspHe is said to have warned that even though the UK wants to avoid a no-deal, it should not engage in bargaining – echoing a message similar to that stated by the German chancellor in public.Ambassadors are set to meet again on Sunday ahead of a meeting of EU\u0026nbspministers on Monday, which will make preparations of the planned Brexit summit on the 25 November where the deal will hopefully be finalised.Created with Sketch.

A third of those who replied were undecided.\u0026nbspThe majority (63.3 per cent) backed a second referendum when asked how the government could give people a say on the terms of Britain’s exit from the bloc, while 10.9 per cent suggested a public consultation.About 10 per cent said they trust the government to do a good job, and 7.4 per cent said the UK should just leave the EU.Kajal Odedra, executive director of change.org UK, said people feel “bombarded but gagged by Brexit”, regardless of whether they voted to leave or remain in the European Union.EU to decide whether Brits will need visas in event of no-deal BrexitVoters in most vulnerable Tory seats \u0027back fresh Brexit vote\u0027Every day takes us closer to giving the people the final say on BrexitThornberry says Labour could still back Final Say Brexit referendumCorbyn rejects calls for Final Say referendum, despite Labour backlashJohnson insists May can be forced into Final Say referendum on BrexitWriting exclusively for The Independent, Ms Odedra said: “The choices the government makes in negotiations are critical.\u0026nbsp“But they are being made far away from the public with no consultation whatsoever.\u0026nbsp“When we asked change.org users, only 7 per cent of those polled felt they have been given a chance for their voices to be heard since the referendum.“And 85 per cent felt they didn’t have any say in shaping the government’s Brexit strategy.”Leave voters were more likely to feel heard by ministers at about 23 per cent, while only 1.4 per cent of Remain voters said they had been listened to, according to the poll.Young people were also more likely to feel ignored than older voters, the findings show, with just 8.3 per cent of 16 to 24-year-olds reporting that they believe their voices are being heard.Around a quarter of over-65s said they felt listened to, compared to 20 per cent of those aged 55 to 64, and 10.5 per cent of 25 to 34-year-olds.It comes after a special parliamentary event heard that\u0026nbspmore people back a fresh referendum than oppose one in all of the 67 most marginal Tory seats.The YouGov survey of 25,000 people\u0026nbspalso found that a majority of voters in the Labour constituencies that voted Leave in 2016 now back a fresh referendum, by an average of 59 per cent in favour compared to 41 per cent against.It also comes as more than 3,000 people were expected to attend a major rally in London to urge\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspto reject a bad Brexit deal.Cross-party MPs have backed the call,\u0026nbspincluding Tory Jo Johnson, who resigned from government last week over Theresa May’s Brexit strategy, Labour’s David Lammy and SNP\u0026nbspWestminster leader Ian Blackford.Liberal Democrat MP\u0026nbspLayla Moran, who backs the Best for Britain campaign,\u0026nbspsaid: “No one voted for this pathetic little deal which actually hands over our sovereignty, making the UK a rule taker rather than a rule maker. It is the opposite of taking back control.”Caroline Lucas, former Green party co-leader,\u0026nbspadded: “The only solution is to take the final decision out of the hands of deadlocked politicians, away from the backroom deals, and give it back to the public with a People’s Vote.“On Brexit, it’s clear we have a parliament in stalemate that can’t deliver a clear choice for the future. So it’s time to let the British public do it instead.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The poll of 1,070 UK adults found nearly half (49 percent) are \u0026ldquototally opposed to the Government\u0026rsquos Brexit deal.                No-deal Brexit WARNING: Gibraltar urges MPs to BACK May\u0027s dealBut despite Mr Rees-Mogg roundly condemning Mrs May\u0026rsquos draft agreement, Conservative, Labour and Lib Dem voters who took part in the poll said they would prefer Mrs May as Prime Minister.The survey, conducted by polling agency Survation, was carried out after Jacob Rees-Mogg and other MPs from the European Research Group moved to trigger a vote of no confidence in Theresa May\u0026rsquos leadership.One question asked participants who they preferred as Prime Minister between Mr Rees-Mogg and Mrs May.Tory voters were the most supportive of the current PM, with more than half (58 percent) saying she was their preference.Voters would prefer Theresa May over Jacob Rees-Mogg as PM, a new poll suggests (Image:  IMAGESEPA)Mrs May could face a vote of no confidence as early as next week (Image:  IMAGES)Nearly a third (31 percent) of Conservative voters said they preferred Mr Rees-Mogg while 11 percent said they did not know.The polling also revealed there is more support than opposition for the public to be given another say on Brexit once a future trade UKEU trade deal has been negotiated.Mrs May has expressly ruled out the possibility of a second referendum, but the survey showed 42 percent of respondents were in favour of a People\u0026rsquos Vote while 38 percent were against it.One in five people polled said they did not know if a second referendum should take place.Jacob Rees-Mogg has condemned the draft Brexit deal agreed with Brussels (Image: PA)These latest poll results come at the end of a chaotic week for Theresa May which saw a long-awaited breakthrough in talks with Brussels quickly overshadowed by intense criticism of the negotiated deal.The Prime Minister insists the draft withdrawal agreement is in Britain\u0026rsquos best interests but the terms have been condemned by eurosceptic MPs.In a letter demanding a vote of no confidence in Mrs May\u0026rsquos leadership, Jacob Rees-Mogg branded the deal \u0026ldquoworse than anticipated and warned it \u0026ldquofails to meet the promises given to the nation.The prominent Brexiteer is one of 21 MPs who have publicly called for a vote - 27 shy of the 48 required to trigger one.However he has insisted he has no desire to become Prime Minister and his \u0026ldquoonly ambition is to ensure Britain leaves the European Union.

Farage and Boris Johnson plot in secret Brexit meeting But\u0026nbsp May loyalist Alan Duncan ridiculed the alleged attempt to renegotiate the deal, insisting it is fantasy to think either Mrs May or the European Union would consider opening talks again after two and a half years of negotiations.Speaking to BBC News, Mr Duncan said: It\u0026rsquos not what they demand of Theresa May that\u0026rsquos going to make a difference it\u0026rsquos what we, the UK, can negotiate with the EU that makes the difference.We\u0026rsquove been doing that for two years now and to think that just because some Cabinet minister make demands of the Prime Minister that the details are going to change is fantasy.Mr Duncan suggested failing to support the Prime Minister\u0027s proposed Brexit withdrawal deal could result in a cliff edge exit from the European Union \u0026ndash a conclusion he claimed would be very damaging.READ MORE: Theresa May given SHOCK Cabinet ultimatum - change Brexit deal or we WILL resignBrexit news: Mr Duncan ridiculed Brexiteer ministers trying to pressure May into changing the deal (Image: BBC\u0026bullSKY NEWS)The deal Theresa May unveiled on Wednesday triggered wide discontent among Brexiteer Conservatives and resulted in the resignation of Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab. Six more pro-Brexit politicians also quit, including Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey and Brexit minister Suella Braverman.The Prime Minister is also facing the increasing threat of a vote of no-confidence in the coming days as at least 21 Tory MPs lodged a letter of no confidence with the leader of the backbenchers\u0027 1922 Committee, Sir Graham Brady.Mr Duncan continued: The reality of life is that we have a choice which is to back this which I think everybody should. If we don\u0026rsquot, we\u0026rsquoll probably go over the cliff edge of having no deal at all and leaving without a deal as the alternative. That would be very damaging.It may well be that some of those who are threatening to bring down the Prime Minister really want that. If they do, let them please have the honesty to say so so we know what the real debate is between them and the Prime Minister rather than them ganging up on her and trying to get rid of her.\u0026nbsp                Farage tears apart key factor CORRALLING UK into \u0027WORST\u0027 Brexit dealWhich I think would be an act of absolute folly.The rebel Ministers are reportedly demanding the insertion of a clause suggesting \u0026lsquotechnical solutions\u0026rsquo to the Northern Irish border problem, to avoid the need for a hard border or any extra checks on trade across the Irish sea which would infuriate unionists.BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg commented: \u0026ldquoLeadsom trying to coordinate five Brexiteers - Gove, Fox, Grayling and Mordaunt, to push for change in the language to draft withdrawal text.\u0026ldquoTrouble for May because Cabinet source says resignations \u0026lsquonot off the table\u0026rsquo if there is no further change.However, she also warned their demands are unlikely to be met saying: \u0026ldquoTrouble for them is very unlikely indeed EU will accept changes at this stage.

but the EU has warned that would render the mechanism pointless.It would ensure that no tarfs, quotas, rules of origin or customs processes would be applied to UK-EU trade.At the same time the UK would be able to strike free trade agreements with other countries.On November , thereported that Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab demanded the right to pull Britain out of the EU’s Irish backstop after just three months.The paper claimed the hardline pitch to the Irish government “stunned” Irish officials.Its claimed Mr Raab’s proposal was put to the Irish deputy prime minister Simon Coveney in a private meeting in London.However, the Irish Prime Minister told Theresa May that he will not accept a Brexit deal which gives the UK the unilateral power to halt backstop arrangements for the border with Northern Ireland.The EU has suggested a backstop that would see Northern Ireland staying in the customs union, the EU VAT system and parts of the single market.This will essentially draw a customs border down the middle of the Irish Sea, potentially damaging the union of the UK.Mrs May has suggested a backstop that will see all of the UK aligned with the EU customs union for a limited time after .Brussels has two issues with Mays plan.The first is that May wants the backstop to come to an end after a certain time period the EU thinks this would be self-defeating as its possible no solution for the Irish border would be found.The EU also thinks this risks leaving Britain benefiting from the customs union and single market for years after Brexit - reaping all the benefits without having any of the obligations that full membership would entail.In June  European leaders said Britain was running out of time to do a deal because of the unsolved border problem.In July Theresa May quoted Shakespeare as she insisted the UK would not be broken up with a border down the Irish Sea. Theresa May has told EU leaders she is looking at ways of keeping Britain under their rules for at least another year as part of efforts to break the Brexit deadlock.Addressing the  national bosses at a tense summit in Brussels on the night of October , the PM said she is “ready to consider” extending the  month transition period after the UK leaves the EU next March.The potentially incendiary move has been drawn up by the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier to try to end a bitter impasse over the Irish border.It would mean abiding by all Brussels rules until December  at the earliest.The news comes after talks on Sunday, October , hit a brick wall once again, as the issue of the Irish border continues to cause a headache for Theresa May.Theresa May has insisted any backstop arrangement must apply to the UK as a whole so not to create a border in the Irish Sea.However, talks broke down after the EU had insisted on a second backstop arrangement - just involving Northern Ireland -the UKs version wasnt ready in time, according to Downing Street sources. Mrs May dubbed the continuing row with Brussels over how to avoid a hard border in Ireland as “the one real sticking point left, but a considerable one”.The Democratic Unionist Party has vowed to oppose any new checks on goods passing between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.Irelands Foreign Minister, Simon Coveney, said that EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier indicated that the European Union will allow extra time for talks about the border.Mr Coveney said he was frustrated and disappointed that it was going to take more time than people had hoped.On November , , the PM faced crunch Cabinet showdowns with her ministers where she will set out the details of the agreement she struck with Brussels the previous day.A number of pro-Brexit ministers are feared to be on the brink of walking out over the deal.They believe it would leave Britain tied to the EU customs union for years to come, because of the controversial Irish backstop arrangement.If the Cabinet does block Mrs Mays deal, she could find her position is untenable - leading to a Tory leadership crisis."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000448922573.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"apprentice airline best episode years","story":"It split apart million years ago and, must confess, it had entirely escaped my notice before Wednesday night — when it became the fourth-worst ever suggestion for the name of an airline, behind Black Box, Crash Positions and Ryanair.Or it was until Sabrina, from team Collaborative, came up with something that was worse than all of them — Jet Pop Airlines — and added a little explosion in the logo, just to set passengers’ minds fully at rest.No one involved should beat themselves up over any of these decisions, though, as they helped create the best episode of The Apprentice in years.It probably needed to be, as well. I sense, like the recently axed Big Brother and The X Factor, it’s been living off its reputation for a couple of years.Enjoyable as it’s been, the basic issue with this run has been the lack of a central figure in the mould of Syed Ahmed, Katie Hopkins or the late, great Stuart Baggs to take the series by the scruff of the neck.Some have shown vague promise but the closest thing it’s had to an alpha bell-end is Captain Pangea himself, Kurran Pooni, who was marked out less by his all-round uselessness than by the wrist he broke arm-wrestling back at the house, and his insistence he was “ per cent stepping up as project manager” just before he  per cent stepped down.There was no dodging the bullet, though, last week, when Lord Sugar demanded he PM a marketing campaign “for a noo airline” with accompanying adverts “and a noo unorm as well”.Kurran wasn’t underselling the sense of destiny he felt at this responsibility. “Everything in my le has led to this moment,” he claimed, presumably ’cos he hadn’t done anything  up until that moment.The great thing about this task, though — like all the best Apprentice episodes — was that the laughs were shared round equally.So while advert director Kurran was recreating the Club Tropicana video on Southend seafront, Camilla and Jackie were designing a stewardess’s unorm for the party-themed Jet Pop that wouldn’t see the light of day eveneasyJet suddenly opened a brothel chain in Amsterdam.A horrible thought occurred, though, as she was market-researching at Heathrow.She’s not going to wear that thing pitching to  industry experts at BA HQ, is she  She bloody is, you know.She gave it the full doors-to-manual flirtation as well. So everyone’s mind was already in the gutter before Jackie finished the audience off with the news: “It’s very easy to wipe down, as well.”In the normal course of events, reducing Claude Littner to a helpless giggling wreck would be enough to lose any task.The other team, though, Typhoon, had contrived to come up with something almost as bad, Manage Air, a business-targeted operation whose corporate logo looked like a satanic pentangle and theme tune was AC DC’s Highway To Hell.There was a genuine sense of tension in the boardroom then, which would’ve been ruinedSugar had played it all for laughs.He didn’t, though. He let the contestants hang themselves with their own words before firing Kurran, who could leave with a sense of “job done”.He’s created a bit of Apprentice folklore, after all, and hopefully reminded everyone this show is far from dead.Naturally, in the final taxi scene, he also remained convinced of his genius, boldly declaring: “My advert was gold.”The first and possibly last time in his le where he’s not just  per cent wrong, he’s  per cent right as well.Glorious television.Dianne: “Stephen Fry.”The Time It Takes, Joe Lycett: “Sesame Street’s Big Bird lives in what street ”Oliver: “I don’t know.”Joe Lycett: “A bird in the hand is worth two in the what ”Jon: “Foot.”And Bradley Walsh: “Which former EastEnders star presents the Sky One series Extreme World ”Zoe: “Barbara Windsor.”CELEBRITY Hunted contestant and former Commando Johnny Mercer MP has faced a stark choice this past month.The eternal humiliation of being beaten by Chris and Kem, off Love Island, on the Channel  hide ’n’ seek game.Or two weeks in a confined space with a clearly smitten Kay Burley.Heroically, he chose the latter, enduring her attention and pet namewith the same sort of grit that probably saw him through three tours of Afghanistan.Then, last week, he sneaked off for an unscheduled visit to his we, Felicity, and Burley completely lost her s***.Lost it so badly, in fact, that she threw herself at the mercy of a passing bread truck driver, which led to the best update of the series: “Kay Burley is currently in a -ton lorry, on the M, between junction  and .”She was quickly grassed up, of course, then apprehended at the Warburton’s depot, without the need for a vet or a tranquilliser dart.But while it’s a poorer show without the old mad-whack, there’s still plenty of mileage left in this gripping series.AJ Pritchard is cornered in Shropshire, Olympic silver medallist Louis Smith has just been found hiding in his mate’s Jacuzzi showroomand Baldrick-brained duo Chris  Kemhave somehow given everyone the slip.But as for Johnny Mercer  He’s probably smuggling himself back to the Mouth of Hell fort, in southern Helmand, just for the relative peace and quiet. Paul Merson: “For me it’s six and a half of one and a dozen of the other.”Graeme Souness: “The only one with potential is Martial and Pogba.”Dion Dublin: “Liverpool are in second and a half gear.”And Charlie Nicholas: “Pogba’s either brilliant or a showpony. He played OK last week.”THIS week’s Doctor Who episode introduced us to the Demons Of The Punjab, who turned out to be nothing of the sort.They were just morbid sods who mope around the universe “honouring those who die alone”, like soldiers, holy men and Brendan O’Carroll on For Facts Sakes.No actual science-fiction storyline to speak of then.But that’s not really the point of this viewer-shedding series, which has already got on its high horse about sexism, Donald Trump, American segregationist racism, men giving birth and gun control.Kind of inevitable, then, that the BBC would eventually pour a bucket of its self-loathing sick all over the British Empire, via the partition of India in , with an episode that was every bit as historically powerful as Carry On Up The Khyber.The key dference, of course, was that Bungdit Din and his Burpers weren’t actually being used as a means of brainwashing children.Because If you were expecting Doctor Who to present the flip side of Britain’s relatively benign rule in India , then you’ll also be waiting for the episode where Jodie Whittaker lands in a Soviet gulag and starts teaching children about the brutal idiocy of Marxism.The BBC just doesn’t do anything other than its own left-of-centre view, these days – or irony by the sounds of things.As it’s just been revealed there’ll be no festive episode of Doctor Whobecause it’s “run out” of storylines.Run out  RUN OUT How the hell can a series run out of ideas when it hasn’t had any yet This Morning, Thursday: “Coming up, at quarter to , the rise of the penis filler, Doctor Ranj is here to answer your questions.”The show’s other penis filler, Martin Lewis, will answer them on Monday.IT seems almost wrong to single out just one programme from Sunday’s beautul Armistice Day coverage, but the year’s most meaningful TV awards should probably all go to BBC’s They Shall Not Grow Old, made by Peter Jackson, whose astonishing film gave a voice, laughter, tears and colour to some of the extraordinary men who survived the - trenches.Those of us who watched it, on Sunday, are unlikely ever to forget the experience. Those of you who didn’t, must catch up with it on the BBC iPlayer.Be sure, though, to watch it right through to the credits’ last chorus of Mademoiselle From Armentières, where it names the veterans who have all long since passed but whose memories and souls have never seemed more alive and unforgettable.“It’s quite hard to put your finger on it.”I’ll bet.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s quite unusual in a politician.But then I suppose Trumpo isn’t your usual politician.The US President was at it again in France.The idiotic French President Macron has dug up that idea about a European army, run by those genius minds at the EU.Those of us not keen on the EU always worried about this ridiculous notion — but we were told by pro-EU politicians that it would never happen. Another lie.Macron said Europe should have its own armed forces to guard against interference from Russia, China and — the USA.What a rude and stupid statement to make in the run up to Armistice Day.When French people would do well to remember that it was us — and the Yanks — that saved their benighted country.Sometimes I wonderit was worth it.Trump was right on the case, with one of his famous tweets.He des­cribed Macron’s comments as insulting.And he added thatit wasn’t for the Americans, the French would be speaking German by now. Quite right.And he’s right, too, that the EU nations do not pull their weight when it comes to funding the real alliance against our real enemies, Nato.They all like to snipe from the sidelines at the USA.And resent the Americans for their power, influence and success.And for bailing them out of the last war.But then they expect the yanks to spend vast amounts of money protecting them all.Germany, one of the richest countries in the world, spends only . per cent of its GDP on forces for Nato. That is as pathetic as it is typical.The French themselves spend only . per cent.We’re second only to the Americans in our spending — but even then I would argue that it’s not enough.Our Armed Forces have been cut to the bone over the past two decades.Would we be able to retake the Falkland Islands now,Argentina invaded  I doubt it.The truth is that Nato is the one alliance of which we should be glad to be a member.It is an alliance of largely civilised, largely democratic countries which has held fast against tyrants, despots and warmongers for  years.Most notably, of course, the Cold War, in which the Soviet Union was defeated without a shot being fired.But now Trump is getting a bit tired of Nato because the US always has to spend, spend, spend.And with the Europeans thinking again of having an EU army there are many who think the days of Nato are numbered.That would be a terrible mistake.An EU army to replace Nato It would be bureau­cratic, incompetent and short-funded.And it would surrender before you could say “Macron”.THE Lord Mayor of Sheffield is a ludicrous dingbat called Magid Magid who has been coughed up from somewhere deep in the bowels of the Green Party.Shortly before Remembrance Day he posted a publicity shot of himself online wearing a white poppy and a T-shirt saying “never again!”A good moment, then, to ask the vital question: Have you ever met someone wearing a white poppy who wasn’t a complete and utter moron We wear red poppies to commemorate the terrible loss of le in battle.People wear white poppies to commemorate themselves and their fatuous sensibilities.It’s called showing off.WAGES have risen at the fastest rate for almost a decade.They went up by nearly three per cent in the three months to September, compared to a year earlier – and about time, too.

Suppose we had to submit to a trade and tarf regime designed solely to benefit the other .I hope both sides could agree that such an outcome would be the worst of all possible worlds. And yet, that is where we appear to have ended up.First, under the transition, we shall explicitly be non-voting members for two years.As Brussels has spelt out with brutal clarity, the only change will be that Britain loses its Commissioner, its MEPs and its vote in Council.Then, under the backstop, that status, or something very like it, will be imposed on us in semi-perpetuity.Surely no one — Remain or Leave — can favour such an outcome.I have been arguing since polling day for moderation.I was prepared to accept any compromise, including European Free Trade Association and including Chequers, provided it restored the supremacy of our laws.But the purgatory that now beckons is surely, by any definition, worse than either staying or leaving.From the start, our objective was simply to reach a deal — any deal.Our negotiators, shell-shocked by the referendum result, approached the talks in a spirit of damage limitation.They never seriously contemplated walking away, and the other side smelt their desperation.To be fair, our officials were not helped by the noises coming out of Westminster.How would you expect EU negotiators to react when senior British politicians urge them to hang tough and force a second referendum We might view Tony Blair, John Major and Nick Clegg as has-beens but, believe me, they are seen in Brussels as men of influence.So we fell into a pattern. Britain would make some new concession in the hope of unlocking a deal.Then Brussels would pocket the concession and demand more and — incredibly — British Remainers would cheer.The UK agreed to hand over more money than was due accepted the EU’s absurd and illogical sequencing made an unconditional security guarantee offered to copy EU standards and promised not to be more competitive than its neighbours.Each time, the EU brusquely demanded “more movement”. Each time, Britain rushed to comply.Which brings us to where we are — facing colonial rule from Brussels, of the sort the EU imposed on Bosnia following the Yugoslav war.I am not one of those Brexiteers who half-favoured no deal all along.On the contrary, I was proposing moderation even before the vote, and have repeated that call many times since.But, paradoxically, our reluctance to countenance no deal has made such an outcome likelier.We have reached the point where the terms on offer are less attractive than either a World Trade Organization-based Brexit or a second referendum. This last point is critical.I suspect that two contradictory arguments will now be wheeled out before wavering MPs.Europhiles will be told that the deal, backstop and all, is better than “crashing out” on WTO terms.Conversely, Eurosceptics will be told thatthey don’t approve the deal, Parliament might vote to extend Article , thus imperilling Brexit.These two lines of argument can’t both be true, of course and, in reality, neither of them is.We’re invited to believe thatBoris Johnson and Jo Johnson, from opposite ends of the Brexit spectrum, both oppose the deal, it can’t be too bad. In fact, both Johnsons oppose it because it is a lamentable failure of statecraft.Boris was no Brexit headbanger: He came out for Leave only after the EU refused to give David Cameron any powers back.And Jo is no Remoaner: He has spent two years in Government trying to deliver a reasonable Brexit. If neither of them will back the deal, that tells us something.There is still time — just — to recover our position.As things stand, the backstop has no legal force.The moment it finds its way into a treaty, it will be binding. If any MPs oppose the current approach, now is their chance to act. There won’t be another.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Do not write such things.

He blasted ministers as in denial and dont see any problems.After taking a -day tour of the UK, the UN rep looked at Brexit, Universal Credit, cuts to local services and employment.But critics said he shouldnt be focusing on Britain - and should be looking at poverty in third world areas instead.The Australian professor went to Ireland in  too.Tory MPs insisted the plans were a waste of time and money because the UK is one of the richest countries in the world.But today he claimed that one FIFTH of Britain live in poverty - and .million are destitute and cannot afford basics.In a y report he concluded: British compassion for those who are suffering has been replaced by a punitive, mean-spirited, and often callous approach...As the country moves toward Brexit, the Government should adopt policies designed to ensure that the brunt of the resulting economic burden is not borne by its most vulnerable citizens.He was particularly damning about the new flagship benefits system, which roles six payments into one.It is fast falling into Universal Discredit, he said, saying the DWP were more interested in economic savings and sending messages about lestyles than genuinely helping people.Recipients are immediately plunged into further debt and inevitably struggle mightily to survive, he said.Many claimants also feel that they are forced to jump through hoops for the sake of it, fill out pointless job applications for positions that do not match their qualications, and take inappropriate low-paid, temporary work just to avoid debilitating sanctions.One Conservative Party MP with whom I spoke criticised DWP for adopting a military-style command and control approach.But the analysis was rejected by Conservative MPs.Philip Davies said: “If the UN are serious about tackling poverty they might want to go to the Third World. That would be a more valuable use of their time than coming here and grandstanding with some hard-left agenda.”Fellow Tory David Morris added: “Professor Alston has given no methodology to his conclusions. His job means he is permanently hunting on a poverty safari.”Hundreds of Brits have said they are struggling under the new system, and say they have been pushed in to debt for the long wait for payment. One in six Brits are still not getting their first benefits payment on time, new figures revealed this week.Mr Alston blasted the draconian sanctions regime for small errors and said the test and learn approach was treating vulnerable people like guinea pigs and wreak havoc in real peoples’ lives.The digital-focus of Universal Credit was a key part of that, he added, which fails highly vulnerable Brits.The hardest hit are women, children, people with disabilities and pensioners, Mr Alston said.John Dickie, the Director of the Child Poverty Action Groupin Scotland said today: The Rapporteur’s findings should be a wake-up call for government at every level.UK Ministers now need to wake up to the damage being wreaked and end the freeze on working age benefits, scrap the two child limit and fully restore the value of universal credit.But a Government spokesperson said: We completely disagree with this analysis. With this Government’s changes, household incomes have never been higher, income inequality has fallen, the number of children living in workless households is at a record low and there are now one million fewer people living in absolute poverty compared with .Universal Credit is supporting people into work faster, but we are listening to feedback and have made numerous improvements to the system including ensuring . million households will be up to £ better off a year as a result of raising the work allowance.We are absolutely committed to helping people improve their lives while providing the right support for those who need it."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000449958119.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"536ad worst year to live plague famine","story":"Hard professor Michael McCormick said AD is a prime candidate for the unfortunate accolade of the worst year in the whole of recorded history.At the start of that year, the Middle East, Europe and some parts of Asia faced  months of complete darkness caused by a mysterious fog.It caused snowfall in China, continental-scale crop failure, extreme drought, famine and disease throughout most of the northern hemisphere, reported Daily Mail.The harsh year was caused by a cataclysmic Icelandic eruption, according to scientists.Archaeologist and medieval historian Prof McCormick told Science Magazine the world isnt thought to have recovered until AD - more than  years later.He said: “It was the beginning of one of the worst periods to be alive,not the worst year.”Effects on the climate were so severe that the records tell of “a failure of bread from the years –”.Temperatures in the summer of  fell to between .°C and .°C, making it the coldest decade in the past , years.Historians have long known that the middle of the sixth century was a particularly dark period in what used to be called the Dark Ages.But the source of the mysterious clouds has long been a puzzle.However, McCormick and glaciologist Paul Mayewski at the Climate Change Institute of The University of Maine believe they have figured it out.At a workshop at Hard this week, the team reported that a cataclysmic volcanic eruption in Iceland spewed ash across the Northern Hemisphere early in AD.After that, there were two other massive eruptions in  and .The repeated blows, followed by plague, plunged Europe into economic stagnation that lasted until AD.Volcanic activity is believed to have produced millions of tonnes of ash which spread over vast swathes of the world.Spikes in the ice core for lead proved smelting was taking place to create silver and this coincides with the advent of coin minting which helped revive the economy, according to archaeologist Christopher Loveluck of the University of Nottingham.Researchers found that a century later in AD the silver became the coinage of choice."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000449978902.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"long cold winter space temperatures nasa","story":"Thats the warning from a scientist who fears sunspot activity on the surface of our star has dropped so low that record low temperatures could soon set in.“We see a cooling trend,” says Martin Mlynczak of NASA’s Langley Research Center.“High above Earth’s surface, near the edge of space, our atmosphere is losing heat energy.If current trends continue, it could soon set a Space Age record for cold.”Solar minimum can enhance the effects of space weather, disrupt communications and navigation, and even cause space junk to hang around, NASA said.Mlynczak and his colleagues have recently introduced the Thermosphere Climate Index , which measure the how much heat nitric oxidemolecules are dumping into space.The results come from the SABER instrument onboard NASA’s TIMED satellite, that monitor infrared emissions from carbon dioxideand nitric oxide .By measuring the infrared glow of these molecules, SABER can assess the thermal state of gas at the very top of the atmosphere – a layer researchers call “the thermosphere.”When the thermosphere cools, it shrinks, making the radius of the Earths atmosphere smaller.This means it can delay the natural decay of space junk, resulting in a more cluttered environment around Earth.“Right now, it is very low indeed,” Mlynczak told Space Weather.“SABER is currently measuring  billion Watts of infrared power from NO. That’s  times smaller than we see during more active phases of the solar cycle.”“The thermosphere always cools off during Solar Minimum.

That is expected next week.The comeback of the Hastings MP was the most eye-catching move in a swt reshuffle forced on Mrs May after seven resignations in protest at her soft Brexit deal.She replaces Esther McVey, who quit on Thursday after a bitter row with the PM during a five-hour Cabinet meeting on Wednesday to sign off the draft EU plan.The other vacant Cabinet post of Brexit Secretary was filled by Stephen Barclay, who had been a mid-ranking health minister.Ms Rudd’s first act in office was to mount a stinging attack on Mrs May’s seething Brexiteer critics for navel-gazing.Calling on the plotters to think again, Ms Rudd said: “This is not a time for changing our leader, it is a time for pulling together to remember who we are here to serve.“I worry sometimes that my colleagues are too concerned about the Westminster bubble rather than keeping their eye on what our job is.”Extolling Mrs May’s virtues, Ms Rudd added: “I am confident the Prime Minister can survive — I think she’s demonstrated this week her complete commitment to making sure that she serves the people she was elected to do so.”The combative Cabinet minister also praised Mrs May’s Brexit deal as “a really practical response to leaving the European Union” and “the right combination”.Her rapidwas made possible by an official report last month into the Windrush scandal which cleared her of blame.Ms Rudd now faces the titanic task of completing the introduction of Universal Credit, the new all-in-one benefit beset by delays and controversies.Little-known former solicitor Mr Barclay, , is a Brexiteer and May loyalist, and replaces Dominic Raab.But the job in charge of the Department for Exiting the European Union will now only preside over Brexit’s domestic delivery and No Deal preparations.The PM took full charge of the last ten days of EU orce negotiations.Mr Barclay is a close friend of Mrs May’s chief of staff Gavin Barwell, so is “unlikely to resign in a huff like the previous incumbents”, one senior Tory said.Environment Secretary Michael Gove had been offered the top Brexit job by Mrs May on Thursday but turned it down when she refused to let him go back to Brussels to reopen negotiations.Her radio humiliation came as  Conservative MP Greg Hands commented that the PMs cricketing idol was once deliberately run out by a member of his own side - Ian Botham - for the good of the team.Mr Hands wrote on Twitter: Interesting passage from Leo McKinstrys biography of Geoff Boycott when the England team had to run out their own captain for the benefit of the team. England went on to win by  runs.The PM told LBC: The thing about Geoff Boycott is he was absolutely steady, he kept there at the crease, he carried on and relentlessly went about his goal, and I think thats important.But host Nick Ferrari pointed out the England legend had been run out by Jim Love of Yorkshire in his last match.When he quipped Michael Gove might do the same to her premiership, Mrs May hit back: “I think Michael Gove is Scottish.Two troublemakers for No were also brought back into the fold as Mrs May tried to build bridges.Remain-backing EU rebel Stephen Hammond was made a health minister and Brexiteer John Penrose a Northern Ireland minister.

There has been little preparation made for leaving without a deal, weakening the UK’s negotiating hand and sending a message to the EU that we’ll never walk away.She triggered Article  without knowing what she wanted, then wasted months and months of valuable negotiating time in internal discussions. She signed up to a joint report on the Irish border without telling her Cabinet how that would limit the UK’s options and end up shaping the entire negotiations.Even in recent weeks, she has made mistakes — making it patently obvious to the EU how much of a hurry she was in to get a deal and not letting her own Brexit Secretary seehe could winkle any concessions out of the EU. Given all this, it is not surprising that so many Brexiteers want to vote down her deal.But the question of how Mrs May has handled Brexit so far is NOT THE SAME as the issue of what Parliament should do given where we are now. There is ONLY ONE WAY for Mrs May to break this link.She should say that as soon as the withdrawal legislation is through the Commons, she will stand down as Prime Minister.  This would enable MPs to vote for the deal without that being an endorsement of her handling of Brexit or an invitation for her to negotiate the next stage of Brexit, the UK EU trade deal.One Cabinet minister tells me the PM is now an impediment to this deal passing. Her announcing her departure would make it easier for MPs to vote for the deal.Mrs May’s allies dismiss this idea out of hand. But she needs to do somethingshe is not to see her deal voted down, increasing — as she herself says — the chances of either no deal or no Brexit, both of which would be bad for the country.In Wednesday’s marathon Cabinet meeting, one of Attorney General Geoffrey Cox’s arguments for accepting the deal was that it would be possible for the UK to claw things back in the second half, the actual UK EU trade negotiations.But as any football fan will tell you, a team trailing badly at half-time doesn’t change things round by simply sending the same team in the same formation back on to the pitch.Would Liverpool have come back from - down to win the Champions League in they hadn’t changed anything at the interval  No.  If things really are to be dferent in the second half of these talks, then the UK will need new leadership.Now the problem is that some of these arrangements create an ongoing obligation under international law. So, getting out of all of them unilaterally would involve breaking international law. This would, arguably, be in breach of the ministerial code which requires them to “comply with the law”.But, I understand, it was pointed out at the meeting that the PMhas the power to suspend the ministerial code when necessary.This means the Government could simply get out of the backstop, then dare the EU to take it to court“LOYALTY is a two-way street,” one Cabinet minister told me after Dominic Raab resigned. This minister pointed out that Raab had been cut out of the negotiations so couldn’t be expected to go along with the result of them.David Davis resigned as Brexit Secretary because his advice was ignored. Michael Gove wouldn’t take the job because it came with no real power.Mrs May has appointed a new Brexit Secretary, Steve Barclay. But No are saying he will only be responsible for no-deal planning and the Parliamentary side of the job. He won’t be negotiating.He will also, as a Brexiteer, be sent out to defend this deal. He will be a “flak jacket to go out on TV”, one Leaver tells me.SPECULATION is swirling in Westminster about whether Mrs May will face a vote of no confidence or not in the next week.Several Cabinet Ministers are resigned to a vote happening. Others worry that the vote is ill-timed, that in going for her now the plotters won’t win but will instead ensure she stays on as Prime Minister for another  months and takes charge of the UK EU trade negotiations.A minister complains: “If we strike and miss now, we’ll be shackled to a corpse for a year and Corbyn really will get in.” Butthe rebels do get their  letters, Mrs May might have a harder time in the confidence vote than expected – though she will still win it.Several ministers admit that, in the privacy of the ballot box, they will vote against her.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That means Mr Barclay needs to get our ports, our airports, our security services and our customs authorities ready for March .Chancellor Philip Hammond must be clear, too, that he will use the £billion earmarked for the “orce bill” for a massive programme of infrastructure spending and tax cuts that will supercharge the economy.

Yes, Jeremy Corbyn’s coat. Or as every right-wing bile-spiller called the raincoat he wore over his suit, on a rainy day, at the Cenotaph “a cheap and scruffy anorak which insulted our fallen heroes”. Well,Michael Foot can earn his stripes as a commie spy and a Remembrance Day tramp, why not Corbyn  The row rumbled on until Thursday when, despite the Tories cack-handedly ripping themselves to shreds and trying to drive the country they vow unending love to over the Dover clfs, a leading columnist in The Times penned a diatribe about the man in the “pound MS hooded raincoat”. As though most men in Britain would view a pound coat as cheap. Behind Corbyn at the Cenotaph, Tony Blair showed the way of a true patriot by wearing an expensive black, woollen coat which matched his expensive tan and sombre expression. That’s showing proper respect you see.  You may be directly responsible for sending hundreds of young men and women to their deaths in a futile, shyarguably illegal war, but at least you know what coat to wear when you’re remembering those pointless deaths. David Cameron was no slouching private either. He stood to attention beside Blair in a black Savile Row number, doing his country proud as he did when he marched us into battle against the Brexit he created, then deserted the second that battle was lost. Lest we forget. This brave chap has always known that it ain’t what principles you wear but the way that you wear them. It’s been bred into him. Remember when he told Corbyn in the Commons as he struggled to defend his party’s wilful destruction of the NHS: “My mother would say... put on a proper suit, do up your tie and sing the national anthem.”  It was the classic upper-class shypatrician retort when cornered. Look down on a man’s clothing and question his patriotism. But as Cameron’s party, like his country, now lies broken and humiliated thanks to him, who can he look down on  Whose patriotism can he question  With the layers of Brexit lies peeling away, the public anger towards the man who gambled all our futures in the arrogant belief he could solve the Tory right’s obsession with Europe, is mounting. Rarely is his name spoken without Danny Dyer’s accurate four-letter description of him thrown in.  Social media never tires of repeating shyCameron’s infamous tweet at the  General Election: “Britain faces a simple and inescapable choice – stability and strong Government with me, or chaos with Ed Miliband.” Even the usually mild-mannered Lord Melvyn Bragg has branded him “contemptible” and “a wimp” and asked “who the f*** does he think he is ” I think Cameron now knows who he is. Someone who believed he was born to achieve the impossible and be hailed the greatest Tory leader since Thatcher. But whose reckless vanity managed to achieve a dferent kind of impossible. Becoming the most despised Prime Minister since her. And I really hope, at the Cenotaph, that Tony Blair hugged him close to his black designer coat and thanked him from the bottom of his heart for that.

By lunchtime, there’s already a buzz around the tiny Essex village. Unlike generations of politicians, a United Nations investigator, Philip Alston, is making time to visit during a tour of the UK to shyinvestigate the emergence of ‘extreme poverty’. Today, he delivered his report to a disintegrating UK government what he’s made of the harrowing stories he has been hearing across the country. I hope Alston told ministers about Rob, a nurse, who developed a serious health condition and found himself assessed by “people who barely have a health qualication” and was found ‘fit for work’. Have you got a personal story like this about austerity Britain  Email webnews@mirror  “In January I applied for ESA,” Rob told the UN man. “It took them seven weeks to tell me they had never received the form. I had to live on handouts. Going to a foodbank, it really does make you feel worthless.” And I hope Alston told them about a young disabled woman called Mollie who described “watching poverty crippling my mother”. And Rebecca who spoke about the “hostile environment” of zero-hours work. And a young woman called Raven who spoke up about “girls with toilet paper Sellotaped into their underwear” during their period. Jaywick, which regularly tops the list of ‘most deprived’ parts of the UK, is well used to being the poster child for poverty. A few days ago, a picture of one of its streets – Austin Avenue – was used on an attack advert by the Republican party in the United States. “They’ve no right,” Doris Telford, , a retired advocate for elderly people says. “They’ve never even been here.” Scott Michael, , nods. “We’re fed up of people saying we’re a shanty town,” he says. “We’re a community.”  A tenant of one of the houses in the picture asks not to be identied. “I didn’t have a choice about moving here,” she says. “The council moved me out of London because of the benefit cap. It’s a good enough place but the houses are falling down.” Built when motoring was in its infancy, Jaywick’s streets are named after cars, and the street plan was designed to look like a car grille. In the s, newly mobile families were able to get to the seaside at weekends, and a shyproperty developer had the idea of selling them land to build chalets on.  During the postwar housing crisis people started moving to Jaywick permanently. Now, decades on, many of these originally shytemporary homes are desperately patched up, or in dereliction, but local spirit remains strong. Even the village’s one pub is called the Never Say Die. Today, at the Community Centre, built on what was once the boating lake, most of Jaywick has squeezed in to see Mr Alston, the man from the UN, and to hear searing testimonies organised by Unite Community.  One man, called Steve, tells Alston he and his we had both been made redundant by the job centre. “The debts just kept racking up,” he says. “We were relying on foodbanks. We could just about afford to feed the kids, but we were missing meals. I felt I needed to provide, as a man, and I couldn’t do it. I didn’t realise how bad it had affected me. “In January , I contemplated taking my own le. I thought no one will miss me, I’m useless. I’m just going to end it.” When he tried to get help he was told he could only have telephone counselling. Another speaker, Trisha, tried to take her own le after getting pound, into debt. She’d worked her whole le for the NHS but left with spinal problems. Help from Christians Against Poverty made her realise “I’ve got a lot to live for and a lot to offer”.  But she adds: “Now, my area has gone to Universal Credit and I’m struggling again. All the clothes I’ve got on now are from the British Heart Foundation. I was six weeks with no money coming in, living off baked beans.” She finishes sadly: “It’s a lonely world out there.” Wheelchair-user Erin’s family went from “a comfortable middle-class two-income household” to near destitution after she had a brain haemorrhage.  The family have found themselves excluded from the rental market because of insidious ‘no DSS’ rules. “So I am to be made homeless,” Erin says. “I don’t where I am going to be putting our -year-old child to bed. This is the hostility faced by disabled people under austerity. We’ve even lost the very human right of a home.” Alston is clearly moved by what he’s heard, and he reassures people their testimonies “are not going to be for nothing”.  At the end of the meeting, in carefully chosen words, he echoes one of the final speakers. “Mike says that ‘Austerity is a political choice not an economic necessity’. That’s right. Poverty is a choice. You can choose not to make people poor.” Outside, night has fallen, and opposite the Community Centre the boarded-up Mermaid Inn and the derelict Dolphin Diner are a reminder of what Jaywick once was and could be again, given a fair chance. Today, the world will hear from Alston. How bitterly ironic that while he’s been here one of the politicians most responsible for these stories – Esther McVey, the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions – has resigned. Not from shame, but because she now hopes to become Prime Minister.

The Institute insisted the party was for over s, but after guests claimed  year olds were aboard, admitted under s had been present.The libertarian think tank is favoured by top Tory MPs including Jacob Rees-Mogg. Neate has been pictured enjoying a night out with another Conservative MP who backs the group. None of these figures were present at the boat party, and none were aware of his crimes.One appalled partygoer said the paedophiles appearance came after a pal was banned from attending the same shindig for criticising the group publicly.She said: “It’s , and a think-tank lets men get away with being literally sex offenders, but not women who express dissatisfaction.”She added: “There were under s on the boat.”Neate walked free in October  with a three-year community order and  hours of unpaid work.He was put on the sex offenders’ register for five years after more than  videos and images were found on his computers.Neate, from Cambridge, was snared after police investigated a series of tweets he had sent knocked at his door.After searching his hard drives they found the horric abuse images.He told police he had been “running a business selling adult porn to other adults” but this had spiralled into him searching the dark web for images of child abuse.There were  of the worst category A “moving” images discovered by police, as well as  category B and eight category C pictures.Neate admitted performing sex acts while watching the material and said he was sexually interested in children about  years old.Judge David Farrell QC told Neate “You won’t be getting a second chance” after letting him stay in the community under close watch.He appeared at the ASI party less than a year into his punishment.Attendees at the July  invite-only party complained to officials that Neate had been allowed on-board.But bosses were silent, they said, and did not listen to their complaints.One said “Many guests, some who were underage, wanted something to be done then the ASI did nothing and ignored it”, adding they were “disgusting”.The shindig was the annual celebration for their The Next Generation group, an important social event for young conservatives.On its website the Institute brands it a “network for classical liberals and libertarians under the age of . It meets in Westminster most months of the year.”They add: “TNG events are a great way to meet like-minded people, learn more about libertarian ideas, and get involved with the work of the Adam Smith Institute.“In addition to its regular meetings, The Next Generation also hosts an annual summer party aboard a boat cruising down the Thames- an event which has become something of a Westminster institution.”Recent guests have included former MPs Liz Truss, Douglas Carswell and former Brexit minister David Davis.Matt Kilcoyne, head of communications at the Adam Smith Institute, said: “The Next Generation series of events is for those between the ages of  and  interested in the ideas of classical liberalism.The safety of attendees at our events is of the utmost importance.“Our boat party, held annually, was conducted with a company that operates a strict policy of photo ID for those under the age of .Thank you for bringing to our attention that someone under the age of licence could have attended.“Over  invitations were sent out from an bulk email list.

Lauren Coyle and Reece Hitchcott, both , were found guilty of causing or allowing the death of -month-old Ellie-May Minshull Coyle following a trial, but cleared of her manslaughter. They were each sentenced to  years in prison at Liverpool Crown Court today. Photographs of the bed show slats and sides from her cot had been attached to it with towels and sheets draped over them so the child could not see or get out. The little girl had been forcibly tied to the bed on more than one occasion and restraint marks on her body showed she had had at least one wrist and one ankle tied.  A post-mortem examination found her death was caused by forcible restraint by ligatures in a face down position complicated by hyperthermia. The prosecution said the duvet placed over the tot would have impacted on her ability to control her body temperature, causing her immense suffering, distress and upset. At some point on March , , the little girl stopped breathing and her heart stopped. Coyles father, Sean Coyle, called round to the flat in Preston at sometime between  and .am that morning to check on his daughter and grand-daughter and she told him to be quiet as Ellie-May was sleeping. When he went into her bedroom Hitchcott was crouched over her bed in a gap between the end of the bed and the wall.  He believed he was trying to wake Ellie-May, who was lying on her back. He askedshe was okay and he replied: “Yeah I think so.” Mr Coyle realised something was not right and when he askedshe was breathing. “When Mr Coyle looked at Ellie-May her eyes rolled back into her head and she looked ‘clammy’, the prosecution said during the trial.  Mr Coyle now knew that something terrible had happened to Ellie. An ambulance was called and after ing to the bedroom, Mr Coyle told Hitchcott to get Ellie-May, who still had the duvet over her, out of bed. Hitchcott pulled the covers about half way down the bed and put his hands under her torso and pulled and lted her up. The prosecution queried whether he was struggling to do so as her feet and legs were tied by the pink blanket and other material and he had not had time to unbind her. Mr Coyle and paramedics tried to resuscitate Ellie-May.  She was taken to the Royal Preston Hospital and was declared dead at .am. Police attending the scene found a pink and a blue blanket had been used as ligatures going under the mattress. The blue one - which would have corresponded with Ellie-May’s chest area - was undone but the pink one - which would have corresponded with her legs - was knotted and tied so tightly the sides of the mattress were raised off the bed frame by cm. Coyle later told police Hitchcott had been binding her daughter across the chest with the blue blanket since mid-January saying it would help her settle into a sleep routine and stop her banging her head on the wall.  In a statement which was read to the court, Ellie-Mays father John Minshull said: Every day me and my mum think about Ellie and really miss her, we just wish we could give her a big hug and it breaks our hearts deeply. He added: Now I cant be a dad to her no more, it destroys me inside. The couple, who both denied they had tied the youngster to the bed, were also convicted of one count of child cruelty by caging the child in her bed, and another count of child cruelty by restraining her in the bed. Their lodger, Connor Kirby, , of Octavia Court, Huyton, Liverpool, was cleared of all of the charges.

The bizarre crash happened in Leicester yesterday, and trains had to be delayed while engineers checked there wasnt any structural damage. Driving instructor Talab Jaral was with a pupil when they say the crash - and said it was lucky no one was on the top deck. The -year-old said he was stunned when the Number  First Bus service smashed into the Belgrave bridge at .am yesterday. He told Leicestershire Live: We were waiting at the traffic lights preparing to turn right into Barkby Road and head back towards the city centre. My pupil was driving and I wasnt paying much attention to the bus to be honest. I saw it coming past and I didnt assume it was going to hit the bridge.  Then all of a sudden there as a loud crash, a big bang. It was loud enough to make both my pupil and I jump in our seats. Mr Jaral added: It has gone straight into the bridge and I could see that there were passengers on board. A woman came out of her house next door and started helping some of the people to get them out. I wanted to stop and help but I had to go as my pupil was on a lunch break and it was important that he got back to work on time. But I was reassured that there were people on the scene helping and that the emergency services were on the way. I think it was very fortunate that there was no-one at the front of the bus on the top deck. If they had been they would have been badly hurt I have no doubt. It is very good news that there werent any serious injuries. Leicestershire Police issued a statement about the incident.  A spokeswoman for the force said: We were called just after .am to a double-decker bus that had collided with a bridge in Barkby Road. Five people, who are described as walking wounded, were taken to hospital as a precaution. One person was treated at the scene by the ambulance service for injuries that are not believed to be serious.” A spokesman for First Bus said: One of our buses collided with Barkby Road bridge this morning. We have been informed by the emergency services at the scene that no serious injuries were sustained but five passengers walked away with minor injuries. Our driver was shaken but uninjured.  Network Rail sent engineers to the scene to assess the safety of the structure as train services were temporarily held back for about  minutes. They confirmed that the bridge was safe for services to resume. The bus was removed and Barkby Road reopened by .pm.

After giving birth to son Elliott in February via C-section, Dominique OBrien said her whole world fell apart when she was told by nurses her baby was missing some of his fingers. Dominique, , had decided for her second pregnancy she would have growth scans to monitor the babys progress more carefully after her eldest son Ethan was born extremely small. But in every scan she had, her childs condition - which affects  in , children - remained undetected, with a nurse even telling her during one scan look at your baby waving at you. Dominique has launched a change.org petition, after discovering that its not routine to check for fingers and toes in scans and theres no legal obligation to.  The Netherton mum said shes now considering sterilisation after losing faith in the medical community.Dominique, who gave birth at Liverpool Womens Hospital, said: I remember going for my  week scan with Elliott and the lady doing the scan saying look at your baby waving at you, the Liverpool Echo reports.I had a scan four days before my c-section and nothing was picked up on that. As I went in to give birth the nurse asked meI wanted her to take pictures of the baby coming out on my phone and I said yes. I gave birth and the nurse was reluctant to hand my phone back. Thats when I knew something was wrong.  Nurses told Dominique her baby had two health issues - the first was that he had a tongue tie and the second part of his hand and fingers were missing.

While Prince Harry and Meghan Markles arrival, along with Prince William and Kate Middletons entrance made headlines, other guests included the Earl of Snowdon, Grand Duke and Duchess of Luxembourg, Lady Helen Taylor and Santa Montefiore, Zara Phillips and Mike Tindall.Newlywed Princess Eugenie, who wore an emerald green dress for the occasion and her husband Jack Brooksbank, were also in attendance.But, on the night, it was Prince Edward who appeared to be the biggest talking point.  According to the Daily Mail, Prince Edward, who called himelf the Magical Bisector, apparently sawed nephew Peter Phillips - the son of Princess Anne and her first husband Captain Mark Phillips - in half. Edward, armed with a hand saw, got on stage to perform the old classic illusion for guests. The newspaper also reports that no one danced more enthusiastically in the Palace ballroom than Charles and we Camilla. Musical entertainment on the night was provided by Jools Holland, singer and actor Gary Wilmot, tenor and actor Alfie Boe, and US soprano Renee Fleming.  Other entertainment came in the form of a Welsh choir, Chinese acrobats and Canadian comedian Michel Lauziere, who is known for his novelty standup performances. After guests enjoyed drinks in the Picture Gallery, they then made their way to the ballroom where they feasted on salmon tartlet, poussin with autumn vegetables and an ice cream bombe dessert. Tables were reportedly decorated with blue table clothes, candlesticks and flowers from Highgrove Royal Gardens, which is the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwalls private residence. The Queen paid tribute to her son with a heart-warming toast saying: “It is a privilege for any mother to be able to propose a toast to her son on his th birthday. It means that you have lived long enough to see your child grow up. It is rather like —to use an analogy I am certain will find favour — planting a tree and being able to watch it grow. My mother saw me turn , of course. And she was heard to observe that  is exactly the age when the number of candles on your cake finally exceeds the amount of breath you have to blow them out.  Over his  years, Philip and I have seen Charles become a champion of conservation and the arts, a great charitable leader — a dedicated and respected heir to the throne to stand comparison with any in history — and a wonderful father. Most of all, sustained by his we Camilla, he is his own man, passionate and creative. So this toast is to wish a happy birthday to my son, in every respect a duchy original. To you Charles. To the Prince of Wales.” Other notable guests included Prince Albert of Monaco, Dame Maggie Smith, Dame Judi Dench and Queen Rania of Jordan.

While right-wing extremist Bannon spoke inside the hallowed halls of the union, the crowd chanted: Who protects the Nazis  The police protect the Nazis!, Say it loud, say it clear, Bannon is not welcome here!. Police protected the entrances as Trumps former strategist spoke to a half-empty room inside. The former White House Chief Strategist has long faced accusations of stirring up racial tensions - and many perceive him to be the puppetmaster behind President Trumps toxic rhetoric.  The Oxford Mail reports numerous police officers reportedly in full riot gear were needed to get Bannon inside. He told the Union audience: Nazis and the KKK have no place in our society, they should have never been allowed to march in Charlottesville. The same can be said about Anta and Black Lives Matter - they shouldnt be allowed to do what they are doing. The talk was only announced two days before the event and comes after the cancellation of an appearance by a far-right German leader Alice Weidel at the institution earlier this month. At a time of fierce political isions on both sides of the Atlantic and the rise of right-wing political parties across Europe, many believe Mr Bannon to be one the central figures in the resurgence of the far-right with his aggressive political strategy. He said: I said I wanna unchain the dogs on Megyn Kelly and Im proud of it - politics is war by other methods. He also defended the toxic travel ban enacted at the start of the Trump era, saying: I did the original travel ban, it made our citizens safer. Zero-tolerance at the border is a humanitarian policy.  The protesters who were gathered outside the Union were furious Bannon had been offered a  to speak at the elite university. Michael, , and a history student at Oxford, said: I really dislike this pattern in the Union of people who are chosen to give a  - because they had Alice Weidelfrom the AFDand Tommy Robinson. It gives a  and legitimises the worst kind of political force. I particularly object to how the YouTube channel broadcast this to a far bigger audience than at the Oxford Union. Maritz, , an Austrian student studying politics in Oxford said: Im here to protest against the Student Union events being used for right-wing personalities. I am Austrian and we already have a fascist government so its important to fight right-wing politics while we still can. Anna Yalci, in her s, from Oxford and working in the NHS, said: I am here because I want to protest against the rise of racism and I do not think the Oxford Union should give credibility to Steve Bannon, because he is anti-Muslim - and my husband is a Muslim - and anti-Semitic.  He supports Donald Trump and Donald Trump represents all that is wrong with the current world. I have children and am about to be a grandmother. I do not want them to grow up in a world of hatred which is what Steve Bannon is preaching. While Alex, , a PhD Pathology student said: I just think it is an incredible move on the part of the Union to give a  to someone who spouts hatred and violence just to drum-up membership. I think they are really playing with fire to give a  to someone who wants to cause hatred and crime in the US. Im from the US and when I go back I feel scared in a way I have not felt before. Nick Grant, , and a member of the Socialist Workers Party said: We are socialists who oppose Steve Bannon quite fundamentally. He is someone who is trying to organise internationally for right-wing political forces which oppose migrants, women, sexual minorities and organised workers.  We believe he is a neo-Facist who historically big business organisations turn to at a time of economic crisis. His friend and fellow SWP member Chris Blakey, , said: We are really pleased with the turn out here. From : pm there has been masses of people on the this street and the other entrance and it is a wide range of of anti-fascists, students, academics and normal le people. There were no arrests by police. A spokesman for Thames Valley Police said tonight: Officers are on the scene of a protest in Oxford. We were aware of planned protest activity around the Oxford Union in St Michaels Street. Officers are currently in the area working to prevent any incidents of crime and disorder.  Chief Superintendent Robert France said: Officers are currently outside the Oxford Union in the city centre where an event is taking place. A group of protesters, along with a counter protest group, have been present. Everyone has the right to demonstrate peacefully.

Texan Christopher Precopia was shocked when police arrested him while he was at work last September at a lumberyard in Williamson County. The New York Post reports that the -year-old was accused of burglary with intent to commit other crimes. At the time Precopia had no clue why he was being arrested, until he later discovered that his ex-girlfriend from high school reported him to the police with a made up story. He said: I had no idea why everything was happening, and I was lost. Precopias ex claimed that he broke into her home in Temple before cutting an X into her chest with a box cutter.  Police took him to Williamstown County Jail and released him only after his family posted a pound,bond. But on the night of the alleged attack, the lumberjack worker was actually  miles away at a hotel in Austin with his mum, Erin Precopia. And to prove this, he had taken a selfie of himself with his family on that night, which he shared on social media. Mrs Precopia said: By the grace of God, [the accuser] said it happened on the day when I can say totally,  per cent, where he was at.  Although he had a solid alibi, authorities charged him anyway, which police experts told broadcaster KVUE might have been presumptuous. The station explained that usually police interview suspects before charging them with a crime. Precopias lawyer, Rick Flores, told ABC News in America that at the time of the arrest Precopia asked what the reason was. He claimed that their response was: Something along the lines of, ‘don’t act like you don’t know what we’re talking about’. The police affidavit confirmed that Christopher was charged with first-degree felony burglary of a habitation, with intent to commit additional felonies. Flores added that offence was punishable by up to  yearsconvicted.  Police finally dropped the charges nine months after his arrest when his lawyer brought the alibi evidence - the selfie - to Bell County prosecutors. As she is not being charged with a crime, his accusers identity is not being made public. She later admitted to Temple police that she reported Precopia because of a dficult relationship with him several years earlier. Flores sad: “Most of the time, we deal with grey matters. It’s not normally black or white. But this is one of those cases where I could definitely prove he did not commit this offence.”  Flores said that the family has not been contacted by Precopia’s accuser. He believed that it was “staged”, including destroying a vase and throwing things around her home so it looked like there was a struggle. Precopias mum said the arrest had severely affected him and that “he’s not the same kid he was a year and a half ago, which breaks my heart.”"},{"url":null,"title":"eight pupils prestigious boys school","story":"NewsEight pupils from elite all-boys school expelled over broomstick sex assaultWARNING: GRAPHIC DETAILS - Some students have said the incidents were part of a hazing ritual at St. Michael’s College School in TorontoShareByElaine McCahill:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV NewsEight pupils from a prestigious all-boys school have been expelled following an alleged sexual assault with a broomstick \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailEight pupils from a prestigious all-boys school have been expelled following an alleged sexual assault with a broomstick.

The military cadets has grown from scratch to number , military cadets in just two-and-a-half years, new figures show. Some  boys and girls from northern naval ports Severodvinsk and Arkhangelsk swore their oath of allegiance to the ‘military and patriotic’ movement on board the fearsome ft Dmitry Donskoy, moored in Belomorsk on the White Sea. The Russian YunArmia has smashed the quarter of a million barrier, seeing a rise of more than , recruits since February, with youngsters mainly aged from  to . However, the organisation’s website says children aged -plus can join.  Critics say Putin’s YunArmia is a visible sign of the increased militarisation in Russia under Putin - and liken it to the Hitler Youth. Supporters counter argue the force is a way of installing patriotism and discipline in children, and keeping them out of trouble, while gaining valuable skills. On board the Dmitry Donskoy - the largest submarine of any kind in the world - the cadets were presented with badges with official symbols of the youth movement. After the solemn ceremony,where retired vice admiral Oleg Tregubov took the salute, the children were given a tour of the vessel to see how the crew lives and works.  Cadets from the Baltic to the Pacic are trained in using Kalashnikov weapons in what some experts say is military “propaganda”. Their oath reads: I swear to aim for victories in studies and sports, to live a healthy lestyle, to make myself prepared for the service and labour for the sake of the Motherland, to cherish the memory of the heroes who fought for freedom and independence of our Motherland, to be a patriot and a dignied citizen of Russia. The moving force behind the rise of this youth force is hawkish defence minister Sergei Shoigu, a close ally and personal friend of Putin’s.  When it was formed one Russian website complained that the young army was plagiarising Hitler Youth - but the report was swtly removed.

How you come back from that type of injury is normally how much you put into your rehab.“Mark has given absolutely everything. He is out running, he is out doing the warm-ups with the other players.“Mark is out running with physios when we are training. It is great to see him with his boots on and getting that step closer.“There might be some set-backs along the way with that type of injury but it is all systems go. Mark has been fantastic and the physios could not be more pleased with him.”Reynolds limped off just  minutes into the friendly with Cove Rangers. A scan revealed the extent of the damage and he subsequently underwent surgery in Glasgow.That friendly was abandoned as Cove’s Jordon Brown, , suffered a serious head injury in an accidental collision with Dons defender Considine in the second half.An ambulance was called, with spectators asked to leave, and Brown received treatment for more than  minutes.The ex-Aberdeen youngster has gone on to make regular appearances for Cove this season.“If Mark gets close round about January, in the winter break, to coming back then he has done extremely well,” said McInnes.“It can be a seven to eight-month injury.“Considering he did it in July, as good as Mark is doing and encouraged as we are, we still have to be careful.“It is a serious injury and we have to treat it that way.”Reynolds’ serious knee problem was the first set-back in what would become an injury crisis for Aberdeen in the early throes of this season. At one point, McInnes had eight players out injured.Reynolds and on-loan Watford defender Tommie Hoban, who is recovering from shoulder surgery, are the only two long-term absentees for the Dons now.Aberdeen are to assess the extent of the injury to Devlin that forced him tofrom the Scotland squad.McInnes said: “We did not have our troubles to seek with injuries. It was the worst injury situation since I have been at Aberdeen.“With Mark, he had done all the pre-season work so to then get injured in a pre-season game sticks in the throat a wee bit.“But that is the nature of the game and with injuries you can never foresee when they come.“Thankfully we have dealt with them as a squad and Mark is dealing with his injury.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/11/5bebc517067d0-901x564.jpg ","title":"aberdeens commonwealth games star toni shaw 15 is scottish swimmings trailblazing new ambassador","story":"North-east swimming sensation Toni Shaw was “honoured” to become one of Scotland’s Learn to Swim ambassadors.Albyn School’s Toni, , has had a breakthrough year, starring as the Scots’ youngest athlete at the Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast.She also produced a multi-medal performance at para-swimming’s European Championships in Dublin.The fourth-year pupil began her work getting kids into the water yesterday with a masterclass at Aberdeen Aquatics Centre for  Hanover Street School pupils.Toni, who competes in para-swimming’s S category, said: “I got askedI would like to do the role, and I was really honoured. I think it’s important to show other people with a disability it doesn’t matter.“You can learn to swim and don’t need to go into private lessons. They can go into the normal Learn to Swim programme.“Swimming’s been a huge part of my le. It’s given me more confidence and so many experiences to travel and meet new people.“If you want to take it up I think it’s a really good thing to do.”Toni’s journey in aquatics began on the Learn to Swim programme at Northfield Swimming Pool, before she joined Cults Otters club.Her talent saw her move to join up with the Aberdeen University high-performance squad.The  Tokyo Paralympics hopeful has experience as an instructor – teaching her own mum how to swim.Her role will involve promoting swimming among youngsters at launches across the country, with world, Olympic and European champion Duncan Scott another of the governing body’s ambassadors. vw, px\"  Paul Wilson, disability performance development manager for Scottish Swimming, said: “Toni has had some success on the international stage, so in terms of inspiration to younger athletes she’s the perfect role model for us.“The key thing is, with her age. She’s only , so it’s not a million years ago she went through the Learn to Swim programme.“She can relate to the kids and they can relate to her.”Pathways manager for Scottish Disability Sport Lynne Glen described Toni’s appointment as “trailblazing” and thinks it shows how attitudes towards disability have advanced in Scottish society.She said: “In Toni’s ambassadorial role, she’ll inspire everyone to Learn to Swim.“But there will be specic people who can relate directly to Toni because she has an impairment, making them aware there are opportunities to learn to swim and progressthey want to.“It’s probably the first time any sport has picked an athlete with a disability to promote a mainstream programme .“It’s trailblazing and great to see her get the opportunity to put something back into the sport and inspire the next generation of para-swimmers. vw, px\"  “It absolutely shows how far things have come. There’s two sides of that – there’s inspiring the next generation of para-swimmers who think ‘I’ve got a disability like Toni, I can do that as well’.“There’s also the other side where it’s educating non-disabled people that a para-swimmer at the high-performance level has the same commitment, effort and mindset that’s needed to progress as a non-disabled swimmer.”Scottish Swimming’s Learn to Swim programme is inclusive, with teachers able to adapt lessons so those with disabilities can take part.There are , kids, from pre-school age upwards, on the programme across Scotland.More information is available on the Scottish Swimming and Scottish Disability Sport websites."},{"url":null,"title":"emergency repairs being carried out on burst water main in aberdeen","story":"Emergency repairs are being carried out after a water main burst on a major Aberdeen road.Scottish Water engineers are carrying out repairs in the AB area of the city at North Deeside Road between Bieldside and Milltimber.A spokesman for Scottish Water said: “Engineers are currently on site, responding to a burst water main on North Deeside Road, close to its junction with Old Ferry Road.#Our team has isolated the affected section of main and is in the process of re-routing water through other parts of our network to restore supply to around  customers currently affected.#Repair work on the damaged main will be carried out this evening once supply restoration is complete and after the busiest time for traffic.“We would like to apologise to customers and road users who have experienced disruption this evening and thank them for their patience while our team works to restore normal service as quickly as possible.”A statement on Scottish Water#s website estimated the repair would be complete by around .pm."},{"url":null,"title":"trio of authors visit city","story":"A week-long event to celebrate reading will take place next week.Book Week Scotland runs from Monday to Sunday across the country, with Aberdeen City Libraries one of the organisations taking part.Three authors, Theresa Talbot, Mary Paulson-Ellis and Rosemary Goring, are to give free talks at Aberdeen Central Library on Rosemount Viaduct.Author and broadcaster Theresa will speak about her novels on Monday between pm and .pm, and Mary will host her talk on Wednesday from pm.Rosemary will discuss her work on Saturday between .pm and pm.Councillor John Wheeler, education operational delivery convener, said: “We are delighted to mark Book Week Scotland by welcoming three outstanding authors to Aberdeen Central Library for what I’m sure will be a fascinating and thought-provoking series of talks.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/04/5ae6d19a19b20.jpg ","title":"draft proposal to create fifth tier league three","story":"Plans are afoot in the corridors of power to dramatically overhaul the structure of Scottish football by adding a fth ision to the SPFL.The Evening Express can reveal that a draft proposal has been circulated among some clubs which suggests the creation of a fth tier – to be known as League Three – below the Premiership, Championship, League One and League Two.At present the idea is that the new ision would be made up of four sides coming up from the Highland League, four from the Lowland League and up to four colt sides to create a league of .The plans are at a very early stage with clubs just starting to be sounded out about the proposals with the issue to be discussed in more detail at a meeting in the coming weeks.It is understood that those behind the blueprint see the idea as potentially ticking a lot of boxes for a lot of clubs.The plans would give ambitious Highland and Lowland League clubs more chance of progressing into the SPFL, with four potentially moving up and promotion and relegation between the new ision and the Highland and Lowland Leagues.Since the introduction of the pyramid play-off in , Cove Rangers , Brora Rangers and Buckie Thistle have all attempted to get into League Two as Highland League champions but have been beaten in the play-offs.The proposals would also give League Two clubs fearing relegation the safety net of still being under the SPFL umbrella in League Three.Talk of getting Premiership colt teams into the SPFL league structure has been mooted for a number of years.Celtic and Rangers have driven the agenda over this issue, but this plan opens up the potential for more than just the Glasgow sides to have colt teams in the pyramid. At present, Premiership colt teams feature in the Irn-Bru Challenge Cup, but the idea has been heavily criticised by people throughout Scottish football.This season is the third year colt sides have been in the tournament and so far only one team has reached the quarter-final stage – Motherwell – who face Ross County this afternoon.The current blueprint for League Three would see a promotion system similar to set up between the Championship and League One and League One and League Two, whereby the champions go up and the three teams who finish below the champions are involved in play-offs against the side that finishes second bottom in the league above.Although the plans are at an early stage and a long way from ever being put into action,the idea did gain support it could be damaging for the Highland League.Four teams moving up would weaken the league and there are not many Junior sides who would be prepared both financially or have the infrastructure to make the step up.However, the possibility of colt teams featuring in the Highland and Lowland Leagues has been mooted in the plans, with Ross County and Inverness Caley Thistle being viewed as two exampes who could field colt teams in the Higland League."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 34","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowWe head Loch Caolisport for this week#s reader#s photograph.It was taken by Delores Firth of Ormsary from her garden looking down towards Loch Caolisport and Ellary.Delores said: #The cloud formations were my real focus when I took this picture.#Send your favourite photographs to the Argyllshire Advertiser for publication.

What’s more, eventhey don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in , a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now,  years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings.

Star lost possession in midfield and Connor Crawford’s clearance was closed down by the Kings Park forward whose shot beat Kalache from the edge of the box and the hosts took a - lead on the hour mark.This visibly knocked the confidence of the Star team and Kings added a second goal when poor play again from Star trying to break gted possession to the hosts and once again their striker was on hand to make it - and give Star a mountain to climb in the last twenty minutes.Star didn’t give up however and could have been back in the game when the ball fell to Gregor Peacock in the box, the ing striker hit the shot and the ball was saved by the Kings Park goalkeeper.Kyle Selfridge went close to claiming a late leline but his free kick from twenty yards cannoned off the bar and the game finished - to the home side.The Star management team were disappointed as that’s the first time the Lochgilphead side have failed to score in the league in more than two years.On Saturday November  Red Star play host to Campbeltown pupils in what looks like another tough league match.

They’ve been getting themselves involved in drug-taking. “Mr Thomson could do with some support.” Sherf John Montgomery told the pair: “You both tell me that you want to change – well I can provide you with an opportunity to do that with a community payback order. “If you don’t comply with the terms of the order you’ll be brought back before me and we know what will happen.” Coughtrie and Thomson were ordered to be under supervision for  months.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnCourtsPrestwickAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13471434.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_080918AyrCurrie_09JPG.jpg","title":"ayr rugby club near move","story":"NewsAyr Rugby Club near move to new town centre base at Dam Park as they prepare to sell Millbrae homeThe Millbrae men, who top the Tennents Premiership, are in advanced talks to sell their Millbrae home and move to Dam Park in Ayr town centre.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  OCT NewsDam Park could play host to Ayr Rugby Club as soon as  \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBooming Ayr Rugby Club are nearing a deal to sell their Millbrae home and move to the town centre. Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13594714.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_ayr-u.jpg","title":"ayr united appear itv show","story":"NewsAyr United appear on ITV show The Chase as Bradley Walsh asks questionsThe Honest Men appeared as an answer on hit ITV show The Chase yesterday .Share.\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"facebook|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"messenger|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"twitter|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"whatsapp|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"linkedin|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"flipboard|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"email|share|\"ByLochlin Highet:,  NOV NewsThe Chasers \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyr United have been flying high at the top of the Championship - and now theyve made prime time national TV.

more than , bin collections each year.Figures released through a freedom of information request show that over the last five years, council bin crews have failed to empty more than , bins from around , households.Furthermore, the number of bins missed each year has been rising since , when , bins collections were missed.Three years later, in , that number had risen to ,, and already this year , bins have been missed.Opposition councillors have lined up to criticise the figures, particularly in the wake of allegations that Scottish Borders Council is considering moving to three-weekly bin collections when the budget is proposed in February of next year.Hawick and Denholm councillor Clair Ramage said: ldquoBin collection is a very emotive subject and as councillors we receive many complaints over this very issue.ldquoTo see that there has been a rise in the number of missed bin collections is extremely alarming and has to be investigated as a matter of urgency but this is only the tip of the iceberg.ldquoIn the last month we have been informed that Scottish Borders Council is considering tri-weekly uplts, a change that I am completely opposed to.ldquoAt the moment Scottish Borders Council is struggling as we have seen householders use their recycling bins for general waste when their general waste bins are full.ldquoThis creates other problems, the recycling vehicles are then contaminated with general waste and have to pay penalties to the processing company.ldquoIf bi-weekly lts are not working then tri weekly lts will create even more problems, for example fly tipping.ldquoI realise that budgets are tight but the combination of missed bin collections resulting in rubbish spilling over encouraging vermin is not something that as a community we should accept.Hawick and Hermitage councillor Watson McAteer also commented: \"I do not recall missed bin collections being a statistic that is regularly shared with councillors. Perhaps the fact that for whatever reason , bins have failed to be collected explains why this is not on public record.ldquoI am regularly receiving complaints from constituents who find their bins still full on the pavement after the collection date.ldquoWhile of course there will always be occasions when the council have no control of the situation the figures being produced certainly challenge the current collection policy.ldquoCan you imagine the problems this would causethree-weekly collection was to be introduced  I for one will not support such a move and would ask the council to explain to council tax payers why this problem exists and what they are doing to resolve it.According to data collected by the Local Government Benchmarking Framework, which is a comparison network for Scottish councils, . per cent of Scottish Borders are satisfied with their local refuse collection.However, this is below the Scottish average of . per cent and is the second lowest of the rural and island councils that Scottish Borders Council is grouped with.The council also spends pound. per premises on waste disposal, which is below the Scottish average of pound..Leader of the opposition and Tweeddale East councillor Stuart Bell said that Scottish Borders Council officers work hard to recty issues, but residents need to be aware of how to report missed bin collections.He said: ldquoI will be interested in the councilrsquos conclusions on the long term trend. As I recall there has been a gradual introduction of food waste collections into the larger communities in the last few years, so the number of total collections may have increased at the same time as the number of missed collections has increased.ldquoBut I am concerned to see the detail of missed bin collections. I had expected, and can see, that the number of missed collections is higher in the winter months when the teams can have dficulty getting round in the snow, but it is worrying that the level of missed collections never drops below  in any one month. ldquoThe public needs to know that there is a very easy mechanism of reporting missed collections on the councilrsquos website and, in my experience, refuse and recycling staff at Scottish Borders Council do follow-up on issuesthere is a systematic cause.A spokesperson for Scottish Borders Council said that the number of bins left unemptied each year is actually very small compared to the number the council collection.The authorityrsquos waste management service says it collects around .m bins each year, meaning the number of missed bins equates to less than half a per cent.The spokesperson said: ldquoThe number of missed bin collections over the last five years will be dependent on a number of factors including: the provision of a new weekly food waste service to around , households in  access issues due to obstruction and road closures vehicle breakdowns adverse weather service error an increase in the number of new homes which bins are collected from each year and bins not being presented by householders by am on scheduled collection days and incorrectly reported as missed.ldquoIt is not possible to determine the exact cause of any increase in missed collections but the increasingly challenging winters experienced across the Borders will be having an impact.ldquoThat was the case this year, when the extreme winter conditions experienced in January, February and March caused signicant disruption, with three full days where collections were unable to be carried out across the Borders.ldquoHouseholders reporting a missed collection over this period will have contributed signicantly to the increase this

four-fold in the space of a year.According to figures just released by the Trussell Trust, foodbank use in the Borders has risen by  percent in  months - the highest percentage rise of any local authority area in Scotland.The Trussell Trust, which support a network of  foodbanks operating out of more than  centres across the UK, have reported that between April and September , a total of  emergency food parcels were issued in the Scottish Borders  to adults and  to children.And many other locally-organised foodbank services arent even included in the figures.In comparison, the same period in  saw just  being issued.Despite the percentage increase, the number of parcels issued this year in the Borders remain the lowest in Scotland over the same period.The figures also report a UK-wide increase of  percent in providing emergency supplies to people in crisis.The charity claims the rise in reliance on foodbanks coincides with the UK Governmentrsquos Universal Credit rollout, which was introduced in the Borders during the summer.The charity says the inability of benefit levels to cover essential living costs and issues with payments remains the most common reasons for referral to a foodbank.They said: ldquoUniversal Credit is not the only benefit people at foodbanks are experiencing problems with, but the new system is increasingly driving referrals due to benefit delays, which include waiting for a first payment or having problems with a new claim.The charity is calling for the five week minimum wait for a first Universal Credit payment to be reduced.Emma Revie, Chief Executive of The Trussell Trust explained: ldquoWersquore seeing soaring levels of need at foodbanks. The time to act is now. If the five week wait isnrsquot reduced, the only way to stop even more people being forced to foodbanks this winter will be to pause all new claims to Universal Credit, until funding is in place to reduce the five week wait. Foodbanks cannot continue to pick up the pieces ndash we have to make sure our benefits system can protect people from hunger.Commenting on the figures, Tweeddale MSP Christine Grahame said: ldquoThese are truly heart-breaking figures for the Borders, which bring into sharp focus the devastating impact the Tory government is having on our local community.ldquoThe fact that people cannot afford to eat is a disgrace in any circumstances, but we can see from the statistics that in the previous year there have been  incidences where emergency food has been given to children specically ndash this is an abomination in a developed country such as ours.ldquoWhile sustained Tory cuts have created this problem, we can see that where Universal Credit has rolled out, which is the case in the Borders, it has made things worse.ldquoMichelle Ballantyne MSP who is the Toryrsquos Social Security spokesperson, represents the South of Scotland which covers the Borders ndash despite her ardent defence of Universal Credit in parliament recently, she must see now how devastating this roll out has been.\"I call on her to review her position and urgently press her colleagues at Westminster to halt the roll out of UC, so the fundamental flaws can be addressed.In response Michelle Ballantyne MSP said: ldquoWhile Ms Grahame might be correct that foodbank usage has risen across the UK, she might want to look closer before placing all the blame with the UK Government.\"We should also remember that, despite this increase, foodbank usage in the Borders is still at the lowest number in Scotland.ldquoI would consider it narrow-minded to attribute the entire increase with Universal Credit there are many other factors contributing to foodbank usage across the country.\"Aberdeen City Council and Perth and Kinross have also implemented Universal Credit around the same time as the Borders and the same report notes that foodbank usage has actually decreased in these areas.ldquoHer assertion that Universal Credit is the sole reason that foodbank usage is rising in the Borders just doesnrsquot add up.ldquoI appreciate there are issues with Universal Credit and the UK Government has said they will address them. An example of this is the announcement that there will be increased work allowances which will give a boost to hundreds of thousands of people including a pound boost for couples with children.ldquoI suggest that Ms. Grahame spend less time scaremongering and instead focus on how we can address the drivers of poverty instead."},{"url":null,"title":"pet-of-the-week","story":"This weeks Pet Of The Week, from Borders Pet Rescue, features Willow and Mittens.The charity told us: \"This lovely pair of nine-year-old sisters came into the centre as they couldnt live with the dogs in their previous home.

Therersquos a lot of us in that situation.Councillor George Turnbull , who serves as the ruling administrationrsquos executive member for finance, replied: ldquoMy understanding is that it is one of the many items which will be coming before the council meeting towards the end of November, because I know the council have been in discussion with a private company.ldquoI think theyrsquove been looking at every facility which is still open at this present time.ldquoIn the report that is to come before the council there will be recommendations of dferent levels: some may be closed, some may be refurbished, the charging system might change, but Irsquove not been privy to the draft report.The decision to look into privatising the toilets followed a damning report put to the council in June that showed the decision to charge for using public toilets had netted just a third of the income that Scottish Borders Council had hoped for.The current p charge for using  of the councilrsquos public toilets in the Borders was agreed by a full council meeting in February, following a report in which officers assured members that charging for toilet provision would generate an income of pound, a year.However, the report put to councillors in June estimated that the total yearly income would be just pound,.That analysis, put forth by neighbourhood services manager Jason Hedley, relied on anecdotal evidence to explain the shortcomings in income generation.He wrote: ldquoWhat is apparent from financial monitoring is that revenue income received to date is signicantly less than the estimated levels that were forecast.ldquoA revised full year of income of pound, is now being estimated, a shortfall of some pound, which in turn was expected to also cover the cost of the implementation of comfort schemes.ldquoA signicant body of anecdotal evidence around payment avoidance has been received and observed, including from elected members.ldquoThis centres around tailgating , the lsquogood Samaritanrsquo , families paying one fee for multiple usage or antisocial behaviour, where people vandalise doors or wedge them open, allowing free access to all.A full meeting of Scottish Borders Council will be held on Thursday, November , when councillors are expected to receive a report on the procurement exercise and receive recommendations from council officers on the next course of action for the regionrsquos public toilets."},{"url":null,"title":"how-did-community-action-team-do-in-the-borders","story":"THE regionrsquos Community Action Teamhas released its second quarterly report, providing a snapshot of the teamrsquos performance over a six month period.The CAT was launched in April as a collaboration between Scottish Borders Council and Police Scotland as a way to tackle anti-social behaviour and drug related crime in the Borders.The team is funded via a pound, grant from Scottish Borders Council, and tackles community priorities by fining offending motorists, carrying out high-visibility foot patrols and conducting drug searches of people and properties.The CAT has also led visibility patrols during the common ridings and festivals season, and confiscated alcohol from young people at those events.Between April and September, the team has issued  parking tickets, which is an increase of . per cent on the same period last year, and has issued  road traffic fixed penalty notices and carried out  static roadside checks.Officers have also conducted  personal drug searches and  property searches.

Perhaps a little too early for the jumpers, I attended the Memorial Hall eager to feast upon the much-anticipated performance of these young thespians.Could they really deliver this magical Christmas story and live up to the incredible reputation set by their mentors, Innerleithen  District Amateur Operatic Society  You bet your bottom dollar they did!From the moment the music started and the curtain opened on this stunning production, I along with the audiences were captivated.Playing the hopeful orphan was Freya Wilson. She already looked the part with red hair and freckles, and with stunning vocals she belted out classics lsquoTomorrowrsquo and lsquoMaybersquo, which I have no doubt produced a few tears from the audience. She embraced the character with her cheeky charm and wit, and carried out the role of the ever-optimistic character beautully.Hatching a plan to escape the orphanage and find her parents, Annie is helped by her urchin friends, who had the crowdrsquos toes-tapping and knees bouncing to a fantastically choreographed lsquoHard Knock Lersquo. Credit where itrsquos due, this incredible young cast, who reprised their roles as servants and New Yorkers, were amazing, bringing le to the entire show.But Anniersquos cunning plan to escape fails, and it isnrsquot long before she is dragged back to the evil clutches of the vile Miss Hannigan, played by Lizzie Bell. What was in the champagne bottle, I do not know, but the teenager stumbled about the stage, and conveyed the child-hating orphanage boss to comic perfection. Hanniganrsquos flirtatious manner with Officer Ward , who brings Annie back after running away, had the audience chuckling, and truly convinced us of her distaste for the girls in her care with a jaw-dropping performance of lsquoLittle Girlsrsquo.Anniersquos capture isnrsquot the end of her adventure, itrsquos only just begun, as she s in perfect time to meet Grace Farrell.Miss Farrell is gracefully played by the suave and sophisticated Ava Church, dressed impeccably as the rsquos private secretary to Oliver Warbucks. Annie cheekily seizes a golden opportunity to spend Christmas with Mr Warbucks, and is swept off to live the le of royalty at his mansion.Annie soon melts the heart of wealthy businessman Oliver Warbuckswho gave an endearing performance as the billionaire. The two gave a heart-warming rendition of lsquoI Donrsquot Need Anything But Yoursquo. This will be Thomasrsquos first and last performance with KIYT, but Irsquom sure it wonrsquot be last wersquoll see of this talented young man.After promising to help Annie find her parents, in step the villains of the show ndash scheming Rooster Hannigan and his ditzy blonde girlfriend Lily St Regis.Together with Miss Hannigan, the three plot to swindle Mr Warbucks out of a , dollar reward by posing as Anniersquos parents.Alex Paterson pulls off the flashy self-assured gangster brilliantly, and with his money-grabbing side-kick Lily St Regis, the two are perfectly paired bringing not only the comic element to the show, but impeccable American accents, which polished off their characters.Now at this point I must declare my motherly interest, as Lily was played by my daughter Neve Scott. It is very dficult for one to critic her own child. However, I am very proud to call her a vain, blonde bimbo, red-lipstick wearing, smoking, winey voiced, floozy!The three baddies gave a show-stopping performance of lsquoEasy Streetrsquo which had the audiences in stitches.True to the classic, their evil plotting is foiled and Annie has her happy ending after being adopted by Mr Warbucks. The whole cast came out in glorious chorus for the finale of lsquoTomorrowrsquo.There is one furry four-legged actor who deserves a mention for his tail-wagging performance, the adorable Harry who is no stranger to the spotlight after his dog debut as Toto in the Operarsquos lsquoThe Wizard of Ozrsquo. Stardom beckons for the pooch, whom Irsquom sure could be crowned a Peeblesshire Pet Idol in the future!Praise swept over social media for the young cast last week, leaving many hoping this will be the first of many shows by the talented KIYT cast.

She is originally from another European country but has made Haddington her home, with her husband and two wonderful children.Her explorations of nearby woods led her to discover an unusual grave amongst the trees. It is a grave of a horse, buried in the th century. It was this grave she had offered to show me. To get there we had a beautul walk along a secluded section of the banks of the Tyne. It was the trees I noticed first, of course, which were dotted along the banks of the river.Autumn was just then beginning to brush the trees with its colour, and it was one of those evenings when the setting sun seemed to take its time, bathing the land in bright streaks of orange light. Along the way, Marije paused and said: ldquoThis is my tree.It was a beech tree of signicant age, its branches arching over the Tyne, asfishing. She showed me her sitting place, underneath its embracing canopy. Here the roots curved to make a natural seat. Her older son spoke of seeing kingfishers, and sure enough, this was a perfect place to absorb the majesty of the Tyne as it flowed towards Haddington. Another beech of similar age grew close by. Their branches entwined, making it look like they were sisters holding hands.But I sensed then there was more to Marijersquos connection to this place, although I then had no idea just how powerful her story was.When we finally got to our destination in the woods further upriver, the light was too weak to penetrate the trees. The old grave of the horse was shrouded in darkness.Yet with the help of mobile torches we could view it, and for sure the grave was interesting and worth a story in its own right. I vowed to find out more about its background as we headed back to Marijersquos house in the dying embers of a sunset.When we reached her house we were treated to wonderful hospitality. It was then that Marije told her story of the beech tree.Not long ago she had been diagnosed with cancer. She faced the possibility of being taken by this cruel disease. Numbness and disbelief at first overcame her, then there was the realisation that le might be very short and she would have to leave her two young children.She walked to the beech tree soon after her diagnosis and sat cradled by its roots. Despite having family and friends whose love and support was invaluable, Marije explained it can also be a desperately lonely feeling. ldquoWe all know we canrsquot live forever, she told me, ldquobut to face the reality of my end at such a young age and with children was unbearable.ldquoI went on that walk to the tree in the most dire situation, she told me. ldquoI felt a connection as I sat under the tree, I really felt her old wisdom and energy.Her love for her young children is what gave her strength in the worst of times. The tree seemed to symbolise this powerful bond, its roots deeply holding it safe.ldquoPeople talk about mother nature, Marije said, ldquoand I understand why. When my hair fell out, I lsquogave it backrsquo to nature, underneath the beech. I know it makes me sound weird, but it really helped me.It is not weird, of course. Trees are full of wisdom, not in the sense of actual words but in the spiritual sense. Beech is said to be the matriarch of the wood, sometimes called the mother of the forest. It is a good listener. Our best ideas and inner reflections can come when we sit under the embrace of an old tree even science tells us this now.Sadly not everyone wins the fight against cancer, but thankfully Marije recovered after treatment. The experience has left her treasuring every single day and taking no sunrise for granted. And she is thankful to her beech tree, which was her companion and confidant in those times of emotional agony. It remains for her a place of contemplation and peace, where she can give thanks and absorb the joy of being alive.ldquoI cherish every day now in ways I didnrsquot before, she told me. ldquoI think it is important to allow our kids to feel the connection with nature. That means being in nature, and respecting it. After all, we are all part of it.This was the real story of that walk on that day a story of incredible bravery, pain, love and determination by a young mum I now have the privilege to call a friend."},{"url":null,"title":"labour-ties-bring-meeting-to-a-halt","story":"Prestonpans businessman Ferhan Ashiq had applied to increase the size of an alcohol display ndashand for a name change ndash at one of his stores.But Councillor Jim Goodfellowimmediately recused himself from the application because of his friendship with Mr Ashiq, who is a member of East Lothian Labour Party.After a short adjournment, Councillor Fiona Dugdale , convenor, also declared an interest.Remaining Labour councillor John McMillan, however, said he did not believe his relationship with Mr Ashiq, who has shops in Musselburgh and Prestonpans, could have an impact on his ability to make a decision, while Conservative councillor Jane Henderson said she did not know him.The boardrsquos legal adviser described the situation as ldquounusual but said the board was no longer quorate and Mr Ashiqrsquos application would have to be continued to the next licensing board for a decision.But a bemused Mr Ashiq noted: ldquoWhen it comes to the next meeting I will know most of the board members there.Legal adviser Carlo Grilli advised Mr Ashiq to send his father, whose name was on the application, and an agent instead.The application was to change the name of Mr Ashiqrsquos Prestonpans store on Redburn Road from Day-Today to Day Todayand increase the alcohol display from . square metres to . square metres."},{"url":null,"title":"rare-bottle-of-whisky-to-be-auctioned-for-combat-stress-charity","story":"It is one of only , matured in an American bourbon barrel for eight years, with a cask strength of  per cent alcohol.The auction is part of a fundraiser for Combat Stress, the veteransrsquo mental health charity, and is being organised by the music group the Flying Aspidistras ahead of their concert of remembrance, Now the Guns are Silent, at Gosford House on Sunday.The occasion will be a reflection on the harsh reality of war and the suffering felt beyond the battlefield.Kilchoman distillery on Islay has bottled this special single cask to coincide with the centenary of the end of the First World War.More poignantly, it is also to commemorate the sinking of two troopships, the SS Tuscania and the HMS Otranto, with the loss of nearly  men, in the waters around Islay in .Ailsa Fortune, the events organiser, said: \"The war affected every community in Scotland, from Islay to East Lothian.\"The end of any war leaves many broken lives.

authorities across the country had seen spending on maintaining their roads cut by  per cent since .Iain Gray, East Lothian MSP, said the latest report which revealed the state of the countyrsquos network was a ldquodirect result of cuts to local authority funding by the Scottish Government.He said: ldquoThe condition of roads is a problem across Scotland. This is a direct result of the Scottish Government slashing council funding over this period, with East Lothian Council having suffered cuts of around pound million in the last five years.ldquoEast Lothian Council has done its utmost to protect the budget.ldquoThe Scottish Government needs to recognise the impact its cuts are having and give local authorities the funding they need to protect services, including road maintenance.The county is currently covered by km of roads, ranging from class A routes to unclassied lanes.And an Annual Status and Options Report, produced on behalf of East Lothian Council, has revealed that  per cent are currently in need of repair.The report, which looks at the impact of future funding on network maintenance in the long term, warns that the current level of investment of pound.million a year will mean that more than  per cent of the roads will be in a state of disrepair in  yearsrsquo time.And it reveals that, as an asset, East Lothian Councilrsquos carriageways depreciate in value by poundmillion every year.It also found that nearly km of rural public roads in the county were in poor condition and needed immediate investigation and possible treatment.The report said: ldquoThe level of investment on public roads in East Lothian has not been sufficient to limit the decline in the overall condition of the network.It revealed that additional investment of pound.million over the next  years could signicantlyimprove the state of the roads, with fewer than  per cent likely to need repairs by the end of the decade.Peter Forsyth, asset manager for East Lothian Council, said that the recommendation for operating the carriageways following the report was to continue with the current level of investment.In a report to the councilrsquos policy and performance review committee, he said the costs of corrective treatments, in particular carriageway reconstruction, were ldquoprohibitive and a preventative treatment approach should ldquomitigate the need to invest signicantly.But he warned: ldquoShort-term under-investment could result in major long-term expenditure necessary to recty major defects which could have been addressed earlier.Councillor Jane Henderson , leader of the opposition, said: ldquoOur road infrastructure assets are vital and dficult decisions will need to be made.ldquoWithout investment now the amount of money needed in the future will be a greater problem the old expression of lsquoa stitch in time saves ninersquo was never so apt.ldquoThe decision on how much to spend on roads now will inevitably mean choices. Money will have to be found and some services which are lsquonice to haversquo may have to see new or increased charges.

With  holiday lodges crammed on to the former fairways, the beautul landscape and its wildle will be lost forever. There is another way! A country park, managed by a charitable trust, could deliver fantastic community benefits, education and natural play spaces, as well as jobs and spend in the local community, enhancing rather than damaging the environment.The spokesman said it was ldquohugely questionable that  new self-catered lodges were needed, adding: ldquoAny search on [property rental website] Airbnb will show an average of  self-catering options available in North Berwick pretty much every week between September and May, so an additional  could actually overload and damage the existing tourism market.

Visitors will be able to access it via a walkway.The plans were originally turned down after an objection from Transport Scotland, which felt it would ldquoresult in inappropriate parking which would interfere with the safety and free flow of traffic on the A.However, at the local review body meeting, three councillors disagreed and gave it the go-ahead.Among those approving the plans was ward councillor Norman Hampshire.

It is a collection of stories and anecdotes mainly relating to sporting le and animals.The following tale is inspired from one of the anecdotal stories in Eganrsquos book:ONE autumn evening in the early th century, a storm descended on the county. Dark clouds opened their dreich souls and drenched the land with a torrent of rain. The wind and downpour kept people awake for the whole night, and but by sunrise the tempest was over.Yet all the sudden rain had caused the River Tyne to flood. The folk of Haddington gathered by its banks to witness a strange sight. For the surface of the water was laid with huge masses of hay. The storm had obviously caused the hay recently cut and stacked in the fields upriver to be blown into the flood water, or swept away by it.They watched as small mountains of hay floated by. It was an intriguing sight but of course for farmers it was their winter feed for their animals going waste to the sea.Then someone spotted a swan. It seemed to be attempting to find a place to land. The river was in a torrent and at times the majestic creature seemed to give in to the current and glide on its course until once again it found the strength and motivation to make for the river bank. It was in no imminent danger, but clearly desired to get out of the fast-moving water.As people watched the swan it was noticed that a strange black spot could be seen amidst its white feathers. As the swan drted closer to the bank, people realised what the black spot was: a rat!The rat was clearly alive, at times peeping over the plumage asto see where they were. The swan seemed unperturbed by the ratrsquos presence on its back. In fact, as people watched more closely there seemed to be a connection between the swan and the rat which was most unusual.The royal bird was clearly giving the rat a collie-buckie, or piggy back. How the rat came to be on the swanrsquos back in the first place nobody could tell. The wee creature was very likely at home in one of the bales of hay when it was swept away by the river. In the swirling water it must have struggled to survive.Then rescue came with the swan. Could the creature have scrambled onto the swan without its permission  Surely not! Did the swan actively help the rat  If so, the moment of rescue had been a compassionate act unseen by human eyes. As people followed the drama they realised that the swan was looking for a place to land, not for itself but for its passenger.A crowd had soon gathered to witness the swanrsquos progress. The power of the flood water meant it had real dficulty in finding a place to get close to the river bank. But finally the swan found the strength and opportunity to swim close to the riverrsquos edge.The rat, recognising the opportunity, leaped from the swanrsquos plumage and landed safely on dry land. For an instant the rat turned and looked at the swan, then scampered away. The swan, its mission accomplished, majestically glided back into the main flow of the river.If the rat had thought itself safe then it soon realised this not to be the case. The people watching the spectacle had motivations very dferent to the swan. As soon as the rat landed, dozens of young men, urged on by their elders, chased it with sticks and set their dogs upon it.The animal, having survived naturersquos tempest, now faced an even greater danger his le was sport for humans. The creature zigzagged as people, yelling and howling with delight, chased it this way, then that. The rat, being cornered by a group of about  lads armed with stones and sticks, turned and headed back towards the water.But it didnrsquot make it. The creature was given a deadly blow by a lsquomerciless fellowrsquo. A cheer rang out and people came to view the dead rat. Then a strange silence descended as people reflected, now too late, on what had happened. In the frenzy of the chase it had been so easy to see the rat as merely vermin, rather than a living creature who had struggled to survive and so earned the right to le.People dispersed, no longer cheering.The whole scene had been witnessed by the swan from its vantage point on the river. What its thoughts were on the human behaviour it saw we can only guess.Humans can be made to do this to each other as well, of course. In the frenzy of war, people are encouraged to see others as no more worthy of le than that rat. And the insidious power of this is that both sides are encouraged to think the same way.But deep down, when we touch our humanity, we know how wrong this is. Old soldiers themselves are the first to understand the tragedy of it and see the humanity in those who had been on the lsquoother sidersquo. While there are undoubtedly people who commit evil and need to be stopped, it is the conditions which allow hate to flourish which give rise to their power and influence in the first place.In our remembrance of those who have fallen, let us do so with the reflection and not the frenzy. Let us not forget that the real enemy of us all is hate."},{"url":null,"title":"inspectors-impressed-on-visit-to-elphinstone-primary-school","story":"Parents of youngsters at Elphinstone Primary School and Nursery Class received a letter this week from Education Scotland and the Care Inspectorate following an inspection visit in September.The letter outlined a number of strengths at the school, as well as areas to improve.Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, told the Courier: ldquoWe are pleased that inspectors from both agencies recognise the positive dference that nursery and primary school staff are making for the children and their families in Elphinstone.ldquoThey considered leadership, learning, attainment and wellbeing amongst other areas and concluded that the school was good across these quality indicators.ldquoIrsquom especially pleased to see Alison Cameron receive recognition for her leadership and direction so early in her time as headteacher of the school.ldquoI know that she and the staff team will continue to put pupilsrsquo learning at the heart of all they do.ldquoIrsquod also like to recognise Heather Williamsrsquo work in laying the foundations for this positive outcome during her time at Elphinstone.The letter noted strengths in the schoolrsquos work, including kind and articulate children who make the most of their learning, and the warm, inclusive ethos that creates a family feel.No further inspections are planned, with the school urged to ldquodevelop a strategic, joined-up approach to self-evaluation to ensure that all children can achieve the best possible outcomes and to continue to develop the curriculum.Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet spokeswoman for education, echoed the comments of Mrs Robertson regarding the schoolrsquos former and current headteacher.She said: ldquoThe inspection recognised a number of areas such as the positive relationships across the nursery and school which are making a dference for children and families.ldquoThey also commented that children were making the most of their learning and were provided with real leadership opportunities at the school."},{"url":null,"title":"austerity-over-in-the-county-definitely-not","story":"Jim Lamond, head of East Lothian Council resources, dismissed claims austerity was coming to an end as a report warned of uncertainty about the future of farming, food and drink, and tourism after the UK left the European Union .Audit Scotland identied the potential problems facing East Lothian as the key sectors of its economy came under risk.

Oliver looks way younger than  years on this planet would suggest, and is relaxed, yet on the clock, given one of his brood has to picked up from school in an hour.He certainly has the energy to undertake a tour of the great theatre halls of the land with his new show, telling of the British Isles in  Places, Glasgow this week which expands upon the detail in his new book of the same title. But his is all new to him  ldquoIrsquove spoken in public before, at literary festivals, but not night after night, he says. ldquoI only get a couple of days off during the months and itrsquos quite intense and nerve wracking. Having said that, itrsquos a fascinating and very dferent way of seeing a country. And it makes you question the notion of what a country is. Once you interrogate this notion you realise the audience in the North East [of England], for example, is a very dferent tribe from those in the South.\"You get this throughout Scotland as well. The iety of what you find leaves you confused. At times you donrsquot know where you are.But there is a commonality, I ask. Arent we all in the same boat ndash one which seems to be sinking  He doesnrsquot think so. ldquoWersquove been through everything, from invasion to natural disaster to famine to religious fundamentalism, he says. ldquoWersquove been through civil war, wars of independence, the industrial revolution, two world wars. All of this has unfolded in the same tapestry. This is just a period in history. In a  years there will be dferent issues and a dferent set of politics.Thatrsquos a comfort. Sort of. But meantime, what do we do about Brexit, Neil  ldquoI donrsquot want to deal in that, he says, placing his coffee cup down with a slightly emphatic clump, suggesting hersquos learned to avoid controversy. ldquoIrsquom careful not to offer an opinion on any of that. My tour aim is to put an arm around the shoulder of someone I care about, which is this archipelago. Itrsquos a love letter to the British Isles, a spectacular place which has looked after me, and now itrsquos my turn to look after him ndash or her.He offers a thought: ldquoThe motto of the Isle of Man, lsquoWhichever way you throw me I will standrsquo, the three legged symbol, I think thatrsquos a great motto for people to live by.Thatrsquos easy to say, but wersquore facing confusion, polarisation of politics, right-wing extremism. You must be afraid of the isions politics has produced and the invective that comes with it  It seems everyone wants to be angry.ldquoIrsquom sick of politics, he admits. ldquoIrsquom completely disenchanted with all of it. Politicians lack so much knowledge. If Irsquom honest, I donrsquot think therersquos a politician out there worth listening to, of any creed or colour. I donrsquot have any truck with any of them. Irsquom just looking away at the moment while they do what they do, which is self-aggrandizing and performing their Punch and Judy nonsense. I cannot be bothered with it.He adds: ldquoI was in that arena vaguely for a while on account of a few opinions I was invited to give.He certainly was. Oliver incurred the wrath of the Nationalists back in  when he declared independence for Scotland a \"dead dog.\"But does he now regret becoming involved in the independence debate He pauses for thought. ldquoNo, I think itrsquos important to say what you think is true. But I donrsquot like the atmosphere at the moment whereby you canrsquot say what you think. If you are not pleasing the social media mob you are silenced or destroyed. I was asked some questions and I gave an honest answer.Oliver rejects the offer of half a sconeand instead sips at his coffee cup. ldquoHow it really started for me was when I was being interviewed for Bannockburn  [his TV show] and a journalist asked me about the referendum. ldquoI remember saying, lsquoA referendum is like going shopping for food when yoursquore hungry.rsquo You donrsquot want to be making snap decisions.Because you come away with a packet of Hobnobs and a jar of Nutella  ldquoExactly. I donrsquot think we should have referendums to decide which side of the road we should drive on, never mind kicking the ball back to the general population to determine a nationrsquos destiny. Thatrsquos why we have political democracy, whereby we employ hundreds of people to read tedious paperwork, shout and bawl at each other in a room for as long as it takes. Thatrsquos why these -odd people have a job.He becomes more animated. ldquoReferendums are a bad idea. After the Scottish referendum there were immediate cries for another one. lsquoThat disnae countrsquo. Now therersquos been Europe. And that was seen to be wrong. And so you claim for another one. What do you do  Go for best of three  Or best of five Oliver smiles. ldquoIrsquove never been a card-carrying member of a political party. I used to scoff at university friends who were. In the same way I couldnrsquot understand why anyone would get excited about football. Irsquom not minded that way.Yet, but he is minded to recognise how politics overlaps into culture and issues of identity, which he loves to wax lyrical about on his TV shows. But there are those who donrsquot countenance his passion for explaining the likes of Iona and the coming of Christianity. Some, such as Professor Tom Devine, see Oliver as an irritant.The historian once attacked the fact Oliver had been asked to front a History of Scotland ndash given he didnrsquot have a degree in history.Oliver didnrsquot take Devinersquos comment laying down however, describing the historian as being like of the old grumps from The Muppets.More recently, Oliver got it in the neck when appointed president of the National Trust for Scotland, and many Nationalists demanded his removal, which seemed odd given the TV presenterrsquos passion for this space we live in.But the writer presenter took it on broad shoulders. Did his personal history prepare him for the future stre  Seems so. Hersquos used to adjustment. ldquoI was born in a council flat in Renfrew, my dad moved to Ayr to work [he was a commission salesman] and then to Dumfries. The family was ldquocomfortable, he says. It certainly wasnrsquot an Angelarsquos Ashes set in Scotland storyline. They even managed a holiday to Spain once.Yet, the man who would go on to explain the Picts and Vikings and anacyclosis to uswasnrsquot top of the class at school. ldquoI was in the upper half but I wasnrsquot so great at maths and science so I focused on English and history, which I was quite good at.Oliver was blessed with encouraging parents who most likely were baffled why their son wanted to study archaeology, University I fell in love with the prospectus given it rarely leads to a career. ldquoI did work as an excavator for a few years going on digs, he recalls. ldquoIt was fun, but there was no money in it. And during the winters it became a bit grim.One Friday afternoon he was excavating the Roman Road in Greenock, and on the Monday he was covering a peace protest in Lockerbie for the local newspaper. Why the switch to journalism ldquoI liked the idea of journalism because it was essentially noseyness about people, he explains, grinning. ldquoItrsquos a bit like archaeology in that itrsquos the chance to poke through the rubbish, to find out what people were doing and why. Instinctively, I want to know who, what, where, why and when.Journalism has been as important to his current career, he says, as his time spent scraping dirt with a big spoon. ldquoWhen Irsquove been cast in the likes of Coast as a presenter it helped me get something out of people. And this Magpie-like work taught me how to become engrossed in a subject for a day then drop it, and move onto something .The curious mind continued to search for the next adventure and in  he joined a BT internet company. ldquoI thought that may be my future. I was also fascinated to learn how it had evolved, largely financed by the US military, who wanted to knowcomputers could survive after a nuclear attack. And so they hired these hippies to find out. And then I wondered what do we do with it  What are the consequences of it He answers his own question: ldquoItrsquos created titans such as Mark Zuckerberg, and Amazon, Google and Pay Pal. He adds in soft, serious voice, ldquoNow, Zuckerberg is almost at the point he has more power than Putin, without the missiles.While working for the internet company, Oliver decided to set off for Zululand.ldquoI had met up with my close pal from university Tony Pollard one day in the Granary Bar in Glasgowrsquos Shawlands and we came up with the idea of going to Zululand to make a film [which became the BBCrsquos  documentary, Two Men In A Trench].Boldness has to be part of the reason for Oliverrsquos success. He had a good job, with a good salary, a car and an Amex account. ldquoBut I didnrsquot have a mortgage. I wasnrsquot married. I could take a chance. And I knew I had had experience. When the TV job ran out Irsquod do something .Does the job flipping suggest a malcontent  ldquoNo, when I was at BT I figured Irsquod give it a couple of years, he says with a wee hint of umbrage in his voice for me having suggested such a thing. ldquoAnd we made the film really because we wanted to go to South Africa. The voice warms again: ldquoArchaeology was my first love and we met again. It was like Friends Reunited. And wersquove been together ever since.Hersquos a television natural. But did he always feel confident speaking to the camera  ldquoYes. Irsquove always had a good memory and Irsquom lucky in that I can remember  words in the right order, he says, grinning. ldquoTalking to the camera is not a natural thing to do. Itrsquos like a golf swing. But some people can do it. And I enjoyed being with these like-minded people. It was quite collegiate. I loved it from the get-go.Oliver landed on the box at the right time. ldquoI was   when television began to happen for me. I had few delusions about my own reality. Irsquod been in a few dferent jobs, had the rougher edges knocked off by le experience. Irsquod filled shelves at Presto supermarket while eating the Mars Bars. Irsquod worked on an MS till. He adds, with a wry smile, ldquoIrsquod been dumped often enough by women.Women. Yes, now hersquos married to one. And history taught him he should incorporate this woman into his future. Oliver met his future we Trudi when he was at university. ldquoI was in third year at the time, the president of the archaeology society and she was in first year, and she came in to join. I made a bee-line for her when she walked in the door.He grins. ldquoI donrsquot think she was as impressed by me as I was by her.She must have liked him a little because the pair were together for seven years. ldquoAnd it just sort of fizzled out. Then, years later, I met her wee brother Johnny and we swapped numbers and a few months after that I was back in touch with Trudi. It was asIrsquod seen her the day before.He reflects: ldquoThatrsquos another great thing about my le. Whatever happens, I know Irsquom with someone who remembers me when I was  and a silly arse. She remembers me when I had all sorts of archaeology student affectations, all patchouli oil and cheese cloth shirts. We can remember the teenagers we were.Oliver reveals he had the long hair back in the day. He didnrsquot create the soft Tarzan look for telly. He has just never bothered to have it cut. And it works for him, gives him a USP, although watching him on TV with the wind blasting into his face as he stands on a clf edge he does have to brush it away from his mouth a little too often but, I suppose, a kirby grip or a hair scrunchy would wreck the image.He laughs. ldquoIrsquove been holding out for the Head and Shoulders contract for  years but itrsquos never happened.Therersquos a calm about Oliver, even though he does become animated when he talks about the politics he says he wants nothing to do with. And he clearly loves his le, beaming at the delights of a career which allows him to take his family adventuring in the likes of Australia and New Zealand while filming Coast. Yet with three children hersquos not immune to worry, about the impact of social media, for example. ldquoPeople can have , friends, but ironically they have never been more isolated and lonelier. People go to Facebook ndash I donrsquot ndash hoping to see other people in this clearing in the forest who are equally lonely.Hersquos happy however, very happy. ldquoThe thing I most love these days is writing. I wrote as a student, as a journalist and then in TV with scripts. Irsquove written ten books or so and itrsquos something Irsquoll be able to do.And now hersquos making live appearances. ldquoIrsquove sort of blundered into them. Irsquom out there talking about our world, like Simon Reeve and Dan Snow. Maybe I can do this every year. Why not So the world will be all right, Neil  We need you to tell us it will be. ldquoWe tend to think this is a modern concern, but perhaps Stonehenge and Avebury are partly expressions of feeling the same concerns, people feeling they are little specks in the great scheme of things and wanting to be heard, to make a mark.He grins, reassuringly. ldquoWersquoll be fine, but I wonrsquot beI donrsquot do this school pick-up in time.Neil Oliver ndash The Story of the British Isles in  Places, the Theatre Royal, Glasgow, November ."},{"url":null,"title":"fidelma-cook-cesar-the-existential-dog-with-apologies-to-the-original-existential-cat","story":"Je suis un existentialist.I arrived here exactly four years ago, dragged from my family in the Pas de Calais ndash abandoned in the home of the foreigner.She spoke in a devil tongue and her French was excruciating to my aristocratic ear.I was called Jazzybefore, and now I was to be Ceacutesar.

We order what we want.Then we gape when it turns out those squares have hard-to-notice cuts on them and actually theyrsquore not squares at all but subided into long rather thin rectangles.Aah, theyrsquore half the size then of those that are usually served at al taglio ndash or by-the-slice places ndash in rural Italy where a euro a slice of margherita is still possible.Part of the joy of eating there is simply to have a huge, slobbery, delicious piece of warm baked goodness in the hand. Hold hard though. Allowance has to be made here for the amount of exotic toppings, the transporting across borders, Glasgow prices and, er novelty.And in all fairness pizza al taglio is very expensive in places like Romersquos Pizzarium Di Bonci which often tops the Italian Gambero Rosso guide. Although Baked here is based on Romersquos fashionable al taglio joints, much humbler al taglio is available theand breadth of the country in little bakers who do nothing  but turn out trays of delicious, crusty, creamy pizza that are usually bought by weight.The best Irsquove ever had was much further north in Varese, maybe  years ago. I can still taste its amazing creaminess, but I remember too as a kid being with my Nonna in a small town in Molise where we arrived at an al taglio just as the pizza margherita tray came out the oven. We stood and ate them from greaseproof paper right away.Anyway, whatrsquos the pizza like here  It must be good, Irsquom thinking, because itrsquos .pm on a Sunday night, theyrsquore closing in a few minutes yet therersquos a steady stream through the door.And, generally, it is good. We have slices of the last baked tray from the oven. Margharita ndash thick, puffed up, richly crusted, maybe a little bready but undeniably fresh.The sausage and onion that Cal and Seona share is as it should be. The potato pizza has finely sliced, crisply-edged slices but maybe lacks seasoning. There are more rectangles to taste and try, all exhibiting the Roman style of pizza toppings as art.Maybe a bit more work on the bases, which y in rise, but as we arrived near to closing time there was only that margharita available still hot from the bake. Better to check again when theyrsquore in full flow.There are two rice balls stuffed with cheese too, suppli to you and me, pre-fried and then, because the fryer is now off, reheated in an oven. Not hugely successfully.Therersquos a moment of excitement at a pepperonata topped slice with actual still-rare-in-Scottish-restaurants stracchino, but it turns out to have been substituted with burrata ndash a less pugnacious Italian cheese. Such is le in the last orders lane. Good shout though. And dferent. How long now till the cult fried Neapolitan pizza fritta arrives on these shores  Make it soon please.Baked pizza al taglioDuke StreetGlasgow  Menu: Traditional Italian pizza by the slice. Full marks for the range of toppings, the authentic ingredients and even the authentic cans of Nuova Ricetta Oran soda.  Service Itrsquos self-service at the counter but friendly, chatty staff and a feel that they know therersquos a bit of a buzz about the place.  Atmosphere: It ainrsquot Italy in the east end but nothing wrong with a plain Jane interior made reasonably comfortable.  Price: Tricky one, this, as the slices are small but then the toppings are large and the prices are OK at pound. for pepperoni, pound. for Calabrian sausage. Extremely reasonable soft drinks and dirt cheap Suppli.  Food: Get there when theyrsquore just coming out of the oven and itrsquos well worth the visit. Proper Italian al taglio with great toppings, more work on the base perhaps.

so impressed with the Prime Ministerrsquos resilience and her strength of character.ldquoI sometimes wonder what it is that makes her get up in the morning and come in and face the disobliging

Perhaps it might be called  Hours in Westminster and it would feature a seemingly random selection of words and pictures from the period between pm on Wednesday, November ,  and the same time the following day. Therersquos Theresa May, the signs of emotional dishevelment lining her drawn features, emerging from her Downing Street bunker to tell us that the cabinet has just backed her Brexit draft withdrawal agreement. There she is again  hours later featuring in a live three-hour political evisceration on the floor of the House of Commons, her voice reduced to a croak as she repeats the phrase ldquotake back control, ldquotake back control, ldquotake back control.This would be interspersed with shots of a familiar cast of hard right spectres flitting in and out of the picture. Therersquos Nigel Farage, the millionaire former stockbroker, telling us about being the little man taking on the political elite. Now itrsquos another millionaire, Jacob Rees-Mogg, his grin, like that of his political hero Sir Robert Peel, resembling ldquothe reflection of a sunbeam on a coffin plate. There are as yet unconfirmed reports that Rees-Mogg has asked his fellow Brexiteers on the European Research Group soon to start working on re-negotiating the Magna Carta.David Davis, the former Brexit minister, is trying not to grin as he revives memories of Geoffrey Boycottrsquos straight bat. Now his successor is telling us he felt moved to resign from his post because he could not support the document for which he had been chiefly responsible. Of course we now know that there have been more sightings of Lord Lucan in Brussels these past two years than of this hapless pair. And then therersquos the draft withdrawal agreement itself where the name of every country in the world is mentioned save those of Scotland and Freedonia.In February, , the then Prime Minister, David Cameron, made a speech in London in which he spoke about how the rest of the UK would be diminishedScotland were to leave. He said: ldquoThe UK is the big European success story of this century moving from an island sinking under too much debt, too much borrowing and too much taxation to a country thatrsquos dynamic, exporting, innovating, creating. Scotland is right at the heart of that vision.Not even the most fervent of Scottish Unionists could have predicted how quickly Scotland would fall out of the picture. When Mrs May was taken to task at the absence of any mention of Scotland in the -page document she replied that this wasnrsquot necessary as Scotland was part of the United Kingdom. Few in the SNP were expecting anything more than this and certainly not Mike Russell, formerly the Scottish Governmentrsquos Minister for UK Negotiations on Scotlandrsquos Place in Europe. Earlier this year he spoke to me about some of his frustrations in this role. These principally arose from the large number of joint ministerial meetings that were cancelled by the UK Government during his tenure. You couldnrsquot even accuse the UK Government of treating Scotland with contempt during the Brexit process. To treat someone with contempt you must at least engage with them.Such contempt as the UK Government has shown to Scotland has never been in evidence in its dealings with Northern Irelandrsquos Democratic Unionist Party. That relationship was founded on a bribe of hard cash and is maintained in the same way that rich Victorians once conducted illicit relationships with the domestic staff. Thus, ten representatives of a gerrymandered region created for the sole purpose of reinforcing the cultural superiority of one people over another, were able to take ownership of the entire Brexit process. It remains to be seen what further financial inducements the British state will slip furtively into the hands of the DUP to secure their support for the draft agreement.Accompanying every interview across each of the UKrsquos main television and radio news channels these last three days a persistent drumbeat could be heard. Its message never ceased: ldquoTaking back control of our borders taking back control of our laws. It was espoused by Tory Brexiteers and Remainers alike. Itrsquos easy to forget that they only disagree on minutiae and that they all coalesce around the same over-arching principles: that all dodgy foreigners must be kept out and that the industrial relations enjoyed by th century mill-owners must be regained.The Conservative MP Anne Marie Morris also featured heavily in the political coverage. In , she was one of  landlord MPs who voted down an amendment on rental homes being ldquofit for human habitation. She and her financier husband once featured in a newspaper series about how affluent families could ldquolimit their tax liabilities. On Wednesday night she said that of course Brexit would be ldquobumpy without admitting that it would be somewhat smoother for her. Itrsquos the same approach deployed by her spiritual mentor in the European Research Group, Mr Rees-Mogg who last month said that the ramications of Brexit might not be known for  years. Only people with very large fortunes and estates can speak with such insouciance about actions and their consequences.What we have witnessed these last few days isnrsquot really about the entire future of the UK as the BBCrsquos Laura Kuenssberg pronounced with solemn gravity. Itrsquos about what happens when a small group of the UKrsquos richest and most powerful people quarrel about how best to maintain their hegemony. Carelessly, they also let slip that Scotland and its people occupy not a second of their thoughts.Supporters of independence are naivethey think that any Scot who is satisfied with this arrangement can ever be persuaded by the SNPs economic arguments.

It came against expectations at Westminster.When, on Thursday night, the Environment Secretary turned down the role of Brexit Secretary because Mrs May had refused his request to be able to change the draft deal, it seemed the writing was on the wall.How,Mr Gove thought the deal needed to be renegotiated, could he possibly carry on Having been the \"assassin\" for his onetime chums Cameron and Johnson, what would it have said for his capacity for loyaltythe Scot had wielded the kne a third time By rallying round, Mr Gove helped shore up support for Mrs May, preventing the likes of fellow Brexiteers, Mordaunt, Grayling and Leadsom handing in their resignations.Next week, the PM faces yet another challenge: the threat of a no-confidence vote. But the rebels, having expressed initial confidence they have the  signatures needed to spark a vote, appear increasingly dfident they can secure one.AndMrs May won any vote, her detractors could not challenge her for another year.Tory whips will be busy this week ringing round colleagues, warning them against joining the rebellion, saying it could end with an even greater disaster: a Corbyn government.Intriguingly, while London and Brussels have been adamant there can be no renegotiation of the draft agreement, Leave ministers like Gove, Leadsom, Mordaunt and Grayling are set to meet next week to seethey can push the Brexit door open a bit. There is even talk of the Pizza-clubbers Hunt, Hammond and Javid joining forces in the campaign.The aim is to change the current backstop exit mechanism, which has so antagonised the pro-Brexiteers namely, the UK can only leave the backstop with the EUrsquos say-so.The argument isthis could be amended in some way to allow ndash what in all other walks of le happens ndash free will so Britain could walk away at the moment of its choosing, then the draft deal just might make it through the parliamentary quagmire.At present, the prospect of the draft deal getting through the Commons looks hopeless.

As the editor of Recovering Scotlandrsquos Slavery Past, I try in what follows to inform the debate by presenting the most recent research findings on this question.One key point should be made at the start. Slave trading by ships which sailed directly from Scottish ports to West Africa with goods to exchange for slaves and thence on to the Americas with human cargoes was always a relatively limited activity and seems to have faded away completely after c.. On the other hand, eacutemigreacute Scots merchants, sea captains, seamen and physicians did play a very signicant role in the huge commerce in slaves emanating from Bristol, Liverpool and London.At abolition the British Government provided the vast sum of pound millionin compensation to those who would lose their ldquoproperty in slaves. According to the UCL conclusions, Scottish absentee slave owners were more likely to be rewarded on a per capita basis than their counterparts where in the British Isles.Those compensated came from theand breadth of Scotland, from the Highlands to the Borders, and were not concentrated in Glasgow and the west which for many decades had the closest commercial connections across the Atlantic. Further, not only landed grandees and trading tycoons were compensated. Among the moneyed classes it was not uncommon in the early th century to own slaves as security for interest-bearing loans to colonial trading concerns.Thus, widows, minors, annuitants, clerics, lawyers, professors, shopkeepers, tenant farmers and many others were eventually awarded lump sums as part of the compensation process after abolition. The social mix of the middle classes who profited from slavery was therefore both wide and deep. Slavery and slave ownership spread throughout Scottish finance and commerce before  to an extant unequalled anywhere  in the UK outside the City of London.But this was not all. Among the Scottish external trades of the period c. to c. three commodities were dominant at dferent periods. Before the outbreak of the American War of Independence, tobacco from Virginia, Maryland and North Carolina was king. In the early s Glasgow and its outports imported more American leaf than London and all other English ports combined exported mainly to European markets, tobacco made up more than half of all Scottish exports by value by the early s.After  its hegemony was overtaken by trade to the Caribbean in sugar, rum, cotton and indigo. Inwent manufactured goods, especially ldquoslave cloth from the mills of Scotlandrsquos infant industrial revolution and the linen workers of the East of Scotland. By the end of the Napoleonic Wars in  three-fths of all Scottish exports were bound for the West Indian islands.Then there was cotton. It first came in ships from the Caribbean but that source was quickly superseded from the s by the plantations of the southern USA which alone had the capacity to satisfy the gargantuan appetite of the many new factories for raw material to transform into cotton cloth, the manufacture of which became the leading sector of the Scottish industrial revolution.These three enterprises all had one key feature in common: they could not have existed and then flourished without hard labour in the tobacco, sugar and cotton fields across the Atlantic by armies of black men, women and children bound for le in chattel slavery.Furthermore, merchant profits from these trades did much to provide the capital for Scottish industrialism. The country was one of the poorest in western Europe before c. but paradoxically it managed to fund not only new manufacturing development but also fast urban expansion on an unprecedented scale and a parallel transformation of agriculture and rural society.How so  Fortunes made by some Scots in India were one source but the most crucial was capital flowing from American and Caribbean commerce based on slave labour.These processes came together to establish the material basis for modernisation. Hence few Scots who lived in the th and early th centuries could have been immune from the direct or indirect impact of the slave-based economies on their lives whether or not they were active in the ldquonefarious trade itself.Those involved in slavery have long gone but their legacy lives on in country houses, university and school benefactions, church buildings, statues, civic institutions, museum collections and much more.

Jim therefore tried to find historical accuracy as far as possible by researching contemporary documents and manuscripts that held vital evidence.\"There are certain liberties you can take, like for example the drumming used by the armies preparing for battle and that is often for dramatic effect.\"The film is billed as a \"true David versus Goliath story\" of how the great th-century \"outlaw king\" Robert the Bruce used cunning and bravery to defeat the larger and better-equipped occupying English army.At the films debut during the Toronto Film Festival last year there were a few raised eyebrows when American actor Chris Pine, who plays Bruce, appeared full-frontal naked in one scene.Directed by Oscar-nominated film-maker David Mackenzie the epic was shot in ious Scottish locations throughout  and Jim spent six months working on the diegetic soundtrack.Jim said: \"I had a meeting with David Mackenzie just a few weeks before the shoot and none of this particular aspect was planned.

We all love it.\"Gill Arrowsmith and Shirley Sinclair both thought the painting was \"fantastic\" while Annemarie Simpson thought that a similar venture in Wick would help tackle the \"towns eyesore\" buildings.While on that subject, one dissenting voice condemned the piece and said there was a \"masterpiece eyesore now in Wilson Street thanks to Caithness Horizons\".Beauty is, of course, in the eye of the beholder.The mural depicts a portrait of Thursos renowned botanist and geologist Robert Dick surrounded by a kaleidoscopic representation of the CHMAG facade and the scientists specimen collection.The bold use of line and colour based on modern urban graffiti cannot fail to be noticed just like the mural on nearby Tollemache House but is sited in a much less conspicuous space ndash the gallerys car park.CHMAGs curator Merran Gunn, who was instrumental in commissioning Delaye to create the work, said the artist had also spray painted a wall within the building as part of a show running called Graffito.His earlier piece has an explosive anime style figure punching out of the wall toward the viewer.\"Marcs work is bold and vibrant, electric colours jostle for dominance, and the new outside mural is no exception with tangerine skies set behind the historic Thurso of Robert Dick,\" said Gunn.Thursos illustrious scientist had his herbarium collection feature in an earlier work by the artist Joanne Carr which in turn is featured within Delayes mural ndash a clear case of one artist paying homage to another.\"Graffiti and street art is more relevant than ever whether it be in the art world ndash with the recent record sale of Banksys girl with a balloon ndash or here in the Highlands where graffiti has made its way onto the syllabus at Farr High School through art teacher Tracy Wilkinson,\" she said.After garnering great positive feedback from the current show Merran decided to \"have a moment of spontaneity\" and raised funds through a crowdfunding website and the Dounreay Communities Fund to commission Marc Delaye to breath some le into a fairly drab corner of the town.Tracy Dodson, commercial manager of CHMAG, said that the gallery was \"breaking boundaries\" with Graffito.\"It questions what actually constitutes art and what gets shown in a gallery. Graffito is an exhibition that celebrates artwork that is available to everyone.\"Traditionally graffiti has been seen as anti-social, fringe or even as criminal vandalism, but with an emphasis on social inclusion, we are celebrating street, pop, comic and zine work as mainstream art for hanging in our gallery.\"Tracy unabashedly declares that Graffito is \"aimed at young people and the young at heart, as a way of inviting new and future audiences to a museum and gallery experience\".\"This is a multicoloured on-the-wall exhibition devoted to all manner of graphic mark-making and breaking the boundaries of what art is all about,\" she said. \"We have also hosted street painting and comic workshops, guided gallery tours, and collaborating with our local schools and council.\"Marc Delaye is an established community projects artist with Freshpaint.org which is based on the Black Isle.\"Murals are as alive now as ever before and an excellent way to introduce art to internal and external spaces, giving iniduals and communities something that they can be proud of and enjoy each and every day,\" said Marc.The murals can be privately commissioned and can be an \"ideal means of advertising products, services, messages and campaigns\".Other exhibitors at Graffito include Andy Strachan, of Comic Creations Studios Dundee, David Robertson of Fred Egg Comics and Zu Dominak, all of whom work at the University of Dundee within the Masters degrees in Comics and Graphic Novels ndash the only course of its kind in the UK.Other exhibitors include Victor Nobis and his series Fallen Giants ndash a fantasy dream space where cities like Edinburgh rise and twist through the torso of neon lit giant figures.Graffito finishes on Saturday with a day of childrens workshops, guided tours and a colouring competition.Saturday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"November ,  at : amSee this week#s edition of The Orcadian for over thirty job listings.

We are pleased to confirm we have made some changes to the substation design at Finstown, which we hope will go some way to address concerns raised. We are also pleased to confirm that we will underground the proposed infrastructure at Hoxa Head.#In the coming weeks, SSEN’s project team will continue to assess the responses received as it further refines the project design.SSEN plans to submit its planning applications for the proposed substation at Finstown, the subsea cable and the underground land cable that will connect Finstown to the subsea cable later this year, while a final round of public consultation will be held in Spring  on the onshore infrastructure required to connect the ious renewable projects looking to connect on Orkney to Finstown substation.For more information on the project, including the latest visualisations of the proposed substation at Finstown, please visit: https:www.ssen-transmission projects orkney copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Throughout the coming winter we will monitor the agreed plan to make sure we cover any changes in weather using our existing resources to best effect.ldquoHowever, we all have a duty to take responsibility for our own personal safety which is why I encourage drivers to be aware of our gritting policy as it is simply not possible to treat every road at the same time.She added: ldquoPeople also need to be aware this year to the changes to Saturday and Sunday services.

Buses will be the initial target of the pollution crackdown, with an increasing proportion having to have the cleanest diesel engines to use the zone.For First Glasgow, clean diesel, rather than electric, is the “only show in town” when electrics can only manage  miles before having being charged for four hours, when a typical route involves  miles a day.: Alastair Dalton: Failure to curb cars in cities is throttling busesIt said electric buses were three times the price of diesel ones, at about £, each, and you would never recoup the dference in lower running costs.But the worry must be that while the technology is evolving, there could be repeats of the situation in Glasgow, where its only electric service was threatened with closure because the cost of supporting it become prohibitive for the city council after the four-year-old vehicles’ warranty ran out.Electric buses are smoother and will cut pollution where it matters, such as around passengers waiting at bus stops.But there are likely to be a number of jolts to come on the road to buses becoming greener as well as more attractive to passengers.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4830460.1542310923!/image/image.jpg","title":"kevan christie tv bosses discover formula to make us all get netflix anxiety disorder","story":"Netflix Anxiety Disorder # the social pressure to watch TV box sets # has replaced obsessional interest in music and trainers as the way to define whether you are cool or not, writes Kevan Christie.“Have you seen Killing Eve yet  You should watch it - you’ll love it.

I’ve found myself getting anxiousmy TV planner has less than  per cent capacity left for recording programmes. It’s the same feeling I get when running low on milk or sticking the last piece of bread in the toaster. I also worry that I’ve not got enough Maltesers in my chocolate stash to see me through a marathon box set sesh.To compound the problem, my planner is full of stuff I’ve taped – yes, I still say taped – but know I’ll never watch.This is made up of programmes I watched as a child and still feel nostalgic about – The World at War and the Rockford Files being two examples, although I reckon this is down to the theme tunes.: Dani Garavelli: Killing Eve heralds new lease of leThere’s also a fair chunk of pretentious stuff that I know I’ll never watch but I have taped in the faint hope it might improve me as a person.This includes the Art of France, Germany and Scandinavia, Jean-Luc Godard’s classic  French New Wave drama Vivre sa Vie, starring Anna Karina and the sublime  film noir Crime Wave, starring Sterling Hayden and Charles Bronson, directed by Andre De Toth. This was referenced by the great Stanley Kubrick in his film The Killing. I know all of this useless information because it comes up in blue every time I scroll through my TV planner to see what I’ve taped – before scrolling back to watch Ballers starring Dwayne The Rock Johnson. To my knowledge, Ballers hasn’t been referenced in any classic film noirs but it’s early days.Such is my TV planner anxiety, I’m thinking of putting a note in a will telling my we to delete the  episodes of the Rockford Files that I’ve taped in the event of my passing.The last thing I’d want is for a grieving widow to run out of TV planner space.Don’t get me wrong – I totally understand the benefits of being able to pause the telly while you nip to the loo or make a cup of tea.But there’s definitely a formula to these types of shows, an alchemy that draws us in and keeps us coming back series after series. I know it involves the unexpected death of a main character having learnt that from The Sopranos and The Wire but the rest is as yet a mystery.At this point, I have to ask, does anyone go the pictures anymore Could it be that we’re going through one of those dark periods for cinema, much like  years ago when television was king and movies took a backseat as picture houses started to close  If so, this is a shame.I cherish the memory of Friday,  October,  – the date Goodfellas had its UK cinema release. I remember that day like it was yesterday. I took a half day from my job as a Visual Display Unitoperator with Standard Le to head up to the Dominion  on my own to watch the Scorsese classic.

There was also support from Brexiteer Trade Secretary Liam Fox, who said he had “full confidence in the Prime Minister” and added: “What we need now is stability.”And in a marked departure from Mrs May’s “no deal is better than a bad deal” mantra, he told an event in Bristol: “Ultimately I hope that across Parliament we’ll recognise that a deal is better than no deal.”However, there were signs that the Brexiteers remaining in Cabinet could continue to work against the Prime Minister behind the scenes. There were reports Mr Gove and Mr Fox would meet with International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt and Leader of the Commons Andrea Leadsom to discuss how to push for concessions on the issue of the Irish border backstop.Mrs May sought to shore up her position by bringing one of her closest allies back into government, appointing Amber Rudd as Work and Pensions Secretary.The Prime Minister has also taken personal control of Brexit negotiations with Brussels, appointing a junior figure as Brexit Secretary to oversee domestic preparations for leaving the EU.Stephen Barclay, a former whip and junior minister at the Treasury and Department of Health, takes over from Dominic Raab, who sparked chaos by resigning on Thursday over the draft Brexit withdrawal agreement.There is just over a week left until a planned special EU summit to sign off the UK’s “orce deal”, and finalise a political declaration setting the direction of travel for future trade talks.Downing Street said this would be handled by the Prime Minister and UK officials in Brussels.In a statement, Downing Street declined to say whether the Brexit Secretary post had been offered to anyone  before the North-East Cambridgeshire MP, following reports Mr Gove and the Attorney General Geoffrey Cox had both turned it down, saying only: “He was the Prime Minister’s choice for the job.”Ms Rudd, who stood in for the Prime Minister in televised debates during the  election campaign, resigned as Home Secretary in April over the Windrush scandal.Asked what Mrs May would say to victims of the Windrush scandal who might feel the Hastings  Rye MP’s rehabilitation had come too soon, the PM’s official spokesman said: “The government has apologised, the Prime Minister and Home Secretary apologised for the Windrush scandal … work is ongoing to make sure those people are properly compensated.”Yesterday the Prime Minister had a taste of some of the bewilderment at the deal while taking questions on a morning radio phone-in programme, with one caller telling her she had “appeased” the EU like Neville Chamberlain in his negotiations with Hitler.Another claimed Jacob Rees-Mogg would make a better leader.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4831254.1542396846!/image/image.jpg","title":"rudd urged to ditch dwp policies after damning un report","story":"The new Department for Work and Pensions secretary has been urged to reverse the work of her predecessors, after the impact of UK policies in Scotland was branded #outrageous# by a UN official.Amber Rudd MP was given the post on Friday after Esther McVey MP quit in a row over the Brexit deal.Philip Alston, the UN Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, toured the UK last week and announced his preliminary findings in a report on Friday.: ‘Alex Salmond paid £k from his company while crowdfunding legal challenge’He was scathing of UK Government policy, accusing ministers of being “in a state of denial” over the extent of poverty in the Britain, leading to criticism of UK policy from Scotland’s Communities Secretary.Professor Alston said devolved administrations have tried to mitigate the worst impacts of austerity, despite constitutional and financial constraints.He wrote: “The UK Government’s policies and drastic cuts to social support are entrenching high levels of poverty and inflicting unnecessary misery in one of the richest countries in the world.: Nicola Sturgeon told to forget independence referendum by Theresa May’s deputy“The experience of the United Kingdom, especially since , underscores the conclusion that poverty is a political choice.“Austerity could easily have spared the poor,the political will had existed to do so.“It is outrageous that devolved administrations need to spend resources to shield people from government policies.”Prof Alston highlighted Scottish Government schemes for addressing poverty, including its Fairer Scotland Action Plan.However, he said it is too soon to say whether such “ambitious steps” will make a dference in the country.Communities Secretary Aileen Campbell said: “This report is clear - it is the poorest and most vulnerable in our society who are being hit hardest.“I have repeatedly told the UK Government their failed policies are causing harm and poverty.“Now a UN Rapporteur has clearly outlined that changes are needed - once again I call on the UK Government to listen.“The next Secretary of State for Work and Pensions cannot act like their long line of predecessors.“From Universal Credit to sanctions, whoever takes on that job, must make the changes necessary to reverse the catalogue of cuts and damaging policies.”But a UK Government spokesman said Universal Credit is supporting people into work faster and they are listening to feedback.He added: “We completely disagree with this analysis.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted.

So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

SIC has a poor record of flag flying in my opinion from the senior flagstaff. It#s the UK government#sand Scottish Parliaments policy to encourage councils to fly the Union Flagon a regular daily basis. It#s very rare to see a flag flying any time except on the Lord Lieutenants flag flying days list ofwhich is out of date.It is troubling to hear where the British media still blame German militarism and nationalism for WW, asnationalism and militarism were ever missing from the British national outlook. All major European powers fought to gain advantage over neighbours.It is refreshing though to hear the French President tell world leaders, including Putin and Trump, that nationalism is a #betrayal of patriotism#.#By saying #our interests first and never mind the others#, you stamp out the most precious thing a nation has # its moral values,# he said, thereby insisting these sometimes exist.The European Union used to be widely regarded as a moral endeavour. It seems most of our neighbours still see it that way, as something worthwhile which tempers selfish instincts and secures peace.If Brexit goes ahead the prospect of Britain forgetting its responsibilities as a victor, as Churchill put it in, #for the immediate future of the world# looms large. Let us hope some lessons can be recalled.#Patriotism is when the love of your own people comes first nationalism, when hate for people other than your own comes first.# # Charles de GaulleSadly we see Donald Trump, #America First!, Let#s make America great again#.

Remember #The Only Thing Necessary for the Triumph of Evil is that Good Men Do Nothing#,It is a sad reflection of the many, many people which has died due to war and conflict.There is one institute which promotes, encourages and sanctions war and conflict more so than any other establishment within a modern society.We have probably killed and maimed more people in the last  years than at any other time in  years. What has brought this to the fore is technology but also the institutes which have remained silent on such atrocities, this being the backbone of modern societies driven by economics, our banking systems.Never has there been so much money spent on war and conflict, never have so many countries been destroyed by war and conflict, and who stands by the sideline reaping in massive profits as a result, our banks.The Bible says # For the Love of Money is the Root to All Evils # never a truer word said with our modern banking systems.Rather sad that at a time when we remember those that saw the horror of so many European conflicts, we also saw the French and German leaders announce they want to create a #real# EU Army. I presume by #real# they mean, #the ability to kill people#. Not only was it tactless of Merkel and Macron, we surely have enough standing armed forces already in the world. Do we really need another Jane , I feel sure that Merkel and Macron were not thinking along the same lines as yourself .They stated the need for a ‘ real army’without any references to the huge revenues that could be gained from the manufacture of arms.It’s all very well trying to pass their claim off as being for the strength and safety of Europe but with no reference whatsoever to the economic   financial benefits which would bolster the banking strengths of Germany and France.

A lot of visitor experiences are going to be marred.\"Adam Gough, CairnGorm Mountain representative, who had told of the need for the slopes aimed at beginners and intermediates, was clearly stunned by the rejection.Asked immediately after the decisionan appeal was likely, he said that a statement would be issued later.CNPA head planner Gavin Miles had stressed from the outset the application had to be determined on planning issues ndash landscaping impacts in particular ndash and not on its commercial merits, which had generated much argument.He said the business case was a matter for Natural Retreats.Mr Miles told the committee the articial slope would not extend the ski area in any signicant way but the footprint of obvious development would increase.He commented: \"Initially the team were very concerned about the landscaping but as more information was given to us by the applicants it was considered that in the long term planting would mitigate against that. There would be an impact in the short term of the dry ski slope.\"Whether it will ever be an attraction in its own right and generate signicant income, who knows, but that is not a consideration of the planning process.\"In effect it is a ersication of business in this area and therefore acceptable andit was to strengthen the stability of CairnGorm Mountain then thats a good thing.\"He said there were some hefty planning conditions attached to control the development.CairnGorm Mountains representative said some  per cent of total visits to the resort were in just three winter months of the year.Mr Gough had told the committee Natural Retreats had explored several options in depth to remove the reliance on winter income including mountain biking and zip-wiring but this plan was the most viable at this time.He said it was imperative the attraction can provide year-round employment in order to retain its best staff. This site was the most sheltered for the ski slope and close to other facilities without impacting on other slopes, he said. It could also be used for tubing and other activities.Mr Gough acknowledged the clamour for better ski uplt at CairnGorm which has been overtaken as Scotlands most popular ski resort.He said: \"We would like nothing more than to be able to upgrade ski infrastructure to improve the snowsports experience for everyone but this has to be a long term process built on solid commercial foundations.\"He said the slope could be in operation for  per cent of the year outwith winter and ice would not be a problem as it was easy practice to break it up.ABA secretary Alan Brattey said history showed articial slopes at Scottish resorts including the Lecht, Glenshee and Glencoe had not worked.He also said a bright green Snowflex slope would stand out like a sore thumb and no consideration had been given by the operator to an alternative by market leader, Neveplast, which could be camouflaged.He said that of just over  votes on Facebook on the application,  per cent were against it.Tessa Jones, of the Badenoch and Strathspey Conservation Group, asked the committee: \"What are you going to say to the world about this peatland destruction \"Committee member Dave Fallows moved the application be refused and he was seconded by Carolyn Caddick.He said he appreciated the efforts to mitigate against the ski slope but said: \"It cant possibly soften in the long term the impact that this makes on the area.\"Mrs Caddick said: \"We are going to see it for miles and miles around.\"Peter Argyle had moved in favour of the application saying he had faith in the planning officers conditions but was not supported.Mr Brattey said after the vote: \"This was very much the right decision and wed like to congratulate the planning committee for deciding to reject this planning application against the advice of their planning officials.\"We very much hope that common sense will now prevail and that the plans for the Ptarmigan Building will be dropped.\"We are left to wonder just exactly why HIE allowed their tenant to take such a madcap plan all the way to the CNPAs planning committee who were very decisive in their rejection of it.\"He said HIE should ert the pound million to new uplt. \"The hill business requires to be funicular proofed as soon as possible,\" said Mr Brattey.Saturday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118338.jpg","title":"Helping mountain to reach its peak","story":"Gavin MusgroveA pound MILLION vision to revive CairnGorm Mountain has been laid out to release the resorts immense unlocked potential over the next five to  years.US-based consultancy SE Group believes the resort can attract in the region of , winter visitors per year ndash more in seasons when there are peak snow conditions ndash with the right targeted investments.But controversially they appear to have written-off any future for Coire na Ciste which accounts for one-third of the ski area and boasts the best terrain for skiers and boarders at intermediate level and beyond.Instead the report proposes that all the focus for snowsports is on Coire Cas and two state-of-the art six person chairlts should be installed.There is also a role for the funicular which is currently not running at the resort because of safety fears.However, it is seen as having a subsidiary role as snowsports uplt and to be used and maintained more for non-skiers and ski school customers.Vermont-based SE Group carried out its independent review of uplt infrastructure at the resort between February and September, earlier this year.No funding has been allocated.

It has to be through proper and proportionate channels that we bring this forward.\"She said Natural Retreats is the operator and part of the journey and had bought into it.

This motion was agreed. earlier this week, the chair of the EDI committee, Councillor Allan Henderson said that the council was putting pressure on the Scottish Government to have the route classed as a trunk road. However, during Thursday’s meeting Councillor Cockburn was quick to dismiss the likelihood of this happening: “Who in their right mind would take  miles of the worst road in the Highlands” He said. “After six and a half years we still only have two options… and the delays and the consequences for the wider community have been absolutely shocking.”The SNP member for Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh also went on to question the tendering process behind the work at the bypass, saying: “Was it necessary to shut the road during the day  I believe there was a tender on the table that would have allowed the road to open during the day.”He went on to argue that the council needed to release money straight away to enable design work on the replacement options for the current bypass to begin, adding that it was a matter of urgency due to the risks identied in the  annual sloping report which detailed four very high-risk rock slopes at the Stromeferry bypass.In response to Councillor Cockburn, the council’s head of infrastructure Colin Howell said that the council did receive an alternative tender from a contractor who said they could carry out the required works at night, however, Mr Howell said the cost was signicant and due to concerns about these plans it was decided it would be wise for some of the work to be undertaken during the day.Mr Howell said that while there were ongoing issues with rockfalls and managing slopes, he believed that the council had done a good job. He went on to add that the council were prioritising the high-risk slopes and currently working on the cost and details in relation to stabilising those areas which would be delivered at the next EDI committee meeting.

For anartist of his stature this was courageous, dependent as he was, tosome extent, on commissions from people who, to say the least, wouldnot be subscribers to our paper. But this was an artist who went hisown way in art and who acted as a citizen with a conscience in anIreland where State-imposed censorship distorted not only politicaldebate but also national self-image. For Robert Ballaghcreative work and active citizenship have gone hand in hand all hisle. This is depicted in his double self-portrait ‘Upstairs No.’,one of the many illustrations of his work in this superbly writtenand beautully presented book. It is not a standard autobiographywith chapters set out in chronological order beginning with genealogyand ending with this week’s news. As you would expect from Ballagh,he takes a dferent approach, starting towards the later years andcircling through his days in no particular order before coming backto the present. More than that, he weaves narrative, anecdote andreflection together seamlessly and conversationally showing a skillwith words akin to his skill with brushes. He has a story to tell ofa very ied le, from his unusual family background to his time asa showband guitar player, through his unorthodox beginning as apainter and his development as an artist and an activist. Withfrankness and clarity he tells us how he learned and matured as anartist and his brief commentaries on many of his works areilluminating both of how they were made and the concepts behind them.It makes the reader want to look again and more intensely at thepictures. The Prologue isessentially a dedication to Robert’s late we Betty, his lelonginspiration, mentor and most important critic. The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings. Butthis does not cast a shadow over the book, as her positive presenceis felt throughout, and is celebrated by the author. These days I rarely getthat urge immediately to re-read a book when I reach the end, but Idid with this one. Thankfully the chapters are so well defined thatthey can be read as stand-alone essays or stories. Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’.

The last time nationalists had attempted to hold a parade inside the walls was on St Patrick’s Day  – when they were batoned by the RUC.Housing was a massive issue in Derry and the Derry Housing Action Committeeprovided the focus for leadership as the Civil Rights campaign took off. The DHAC had organised a James Connolly commemoration in the city in July  which was banned by the unionist government.The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Associationagreed to hold a march in Derry on  October. The loyalist Apprentice Boys organisation immediately announced a counter-demonstration with the purpose of forcing the unionist government’s hand to ban the Civil Rights march. But the regime at Stormont did not require forcing because the Home Affairs Minister was ultra-unionist William Craig, who promptly imposed the ban.NICRA held an emergency meeting with the DHAC. Many on the NICRA Executive and some Derry nationalist figures, including John Hume, wanted to cancel the march, but the majority of Derry activists were determined to defy the ban. They won out and the march was to proceed as planned.It was a relatively small march, beginning on Craigavon Bridge with several hundred people. The objective was the Diamond in the city centre.The march was stopped in Duke Street by the RUC. A meeting was held with speakers including Gerry Fitt, Betty Sinclair, Eddie McAteer, Ivan Cooper, Austin Currie and Eamonn McCann. Three Westminster Labour MPs were also present.After the meeting, the marchers found themselves hemmed in on all sides by the RUC. They could not disperse and after a tense stand-off the RUC, oblivious to the presence of TV cameras and photographers, unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons, boots and fists. Water cannons were then used.Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, then a young People’s Democracy activist, recalled:“Quite deliberately, they hosed in the upstairs windows and shopfronts, and they went right across Craigavon Bridge, hosing all the onlookers. The police just went mad.”The RUC attack in Duke Street brought the Civil Rights struggle in Ireland to a world audience for the first time. It was a complete eye-opener to many people in the  Counties and in Britain. But most profound was its effect on young nationalists.Derry man Mickey Devine , the last of the ten Hunger Strikers to die in the H-Blocks of Long Kesh in , recalled:“Like every young person in Derry, my whole way of thinking was tossed upside down by the events of  October . I didn’t even know there was a Civil Rights march I saw it on television.“But that night I was down the town smashing shop windows and stoning the RUC. I developed an intense hatred of the RUC. As a child I had always known not to talk to them or to have anything to do with them, but this was dferent.The RUC attacked the Civil Rights march in Duke Street, Derry, on  October .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27485  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering and pain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contested narratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.- Declan KearneyThis week the NIO consultation on dealing with the legacy of thepast in the north of Ireland closed.It will inform a legislative process and bringforward future legacy legislation.Failure to deal with the past remains one of the most signicantimpediments to political progress here.It is a barrier to the development of a comprehensivereconciliation and healing process in this society.British state policy has been the primary factor in preventinglegacy issues from being addressed or resolved.Powerful sections of the British military and intelligence systemhave never embraced the peace process. They remain psychologically andpolitically locked into a conflict mind-set even twenty years after the GoodFriday Agreement was signed.The role of British State forces and their agents, a refusal toacknowledge and be accountable for their actions, combined with a disregard forsuccessive binding court rulings, has defined the British state’s approach tolegacy matters.That has been reinforced in recent times by a cynical and narrative, including interventions by the British Prime Minister Theresa May,and British Secretary of State in the north, Karen Bradley, to suggest thatonly state forces were being made subject to legacy investigations.These statements are offensive and wrong, and are an egregiousdemonstration of the partisan nature of British policy towards dealing with thepast.They are consistent with the British practice of denying wrongdoing, concealing the truth, and preventing accountability.This poses a major challenge to ensuring that a robust,independent, and impartial facilitation of the legislative process will emergefrom this consultation on addressing the legacy of the past.All sides suffered, and caused suffering to each other during theconflict.There are multiple narratives regarding our tragic past. There isno single narrative despite the attempts of the British state and politicalunionism to assert otherwise.The past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering andpain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contestednarratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.The Stormont House Agreement, , , set out an agreedframework of legacy mechanisms which provided an unprecedented opportunity tocomprehensively deal with the past in all its aspects.Subsequent draft legislation reneged on the British government’sobligations under the SHA by introducing a national security veto, which hadthe effect of blocking a way forward on the issue of legacy.Full implementation of the SHA on a human rights compliant basispresents the best opportunity to deal with the legacy of our past and guaranteea framework which is victim centred.Facilitation of any future legislative process will require thatthe British government must ensure all victims are treated with equality,respect and dignity that the legislation reflects the policy intent of theAgreement and, that the legacy architecture is fully independent, human rightscompliant, and properly resourced and funded.The following key principles should be central to the operation offuture legacy legislation and mechanisms.-          Allprocesses should be victim centred-          Allprocesses must secure the co-operation of all relevant parties to ensuresuccess-          Allprocesses should be based upon equality, respect, and dignity-          Allprocesses must be free from political interference and be absolutelyindependent-         Acknowledgement should be central to the operation of the legacy framework-          The aim ofthat framework should be to enable reconciliation and healing within widersocietyIf there is to be a collective and comprehensive engagement withthe past in a human rights compliant manner, there can be no hierarchy ofvictimhood or humanity.There must be no change to the definition of a victim.High-quality services should be provided to all victims at thepoint of need.This should extend to the immediate provision of a pension for allseriously and psychologically injured during the conflict.The British Government should also immediately release therequired funding to resource the Lord Chief Justice’s inquest plan, as aseparate distinct process from any new legacy mechanisms.The Office of the Police Ombudsman should be adequately andimmediately resourced.Any attempt by the British state to introduce a statute oflimitations to protect its forces and agents would be a violation of the SHA and must be opposed.Full participation and unfettered disclosure by British stateforces and its agents with the legacy mechanisms will be essential to achievefull public confidence in their ability to deliver on behalf of all society.Periodic reviews should be carried out to inform the extent offunding requirements and necessary timeframe, for all legacy mechanisms.Legacy processes should not be limited or impeded by closedmaterial proceedings. In addition, for future legacy mechanisms toasintended, it is essential families are given full access to legal aid.The legacy legislation which ultimately emerges from theconsultation must comply with the policy intent of the SHA by:-          Promotingreconciliation-          Upholdingthe rule of law-         Acknowledging and addressing the suffering of all victims and survivors-         Facilitating the pursuit of justice and information recovery-          Beinghuman rights compliant-          Beingbalanced, proportionate, transparent, accountable, fair, and equalThe full implementation of that Agreement representsthe best potential and opportunity to address the legacy of our politicalconflict and the suffering experienced by everyone during the conflict inIreland, Britain and beyond. So, it is now time to finally deal with the past.  It is time tobuild for the future. It is time to lay the foundations for reconciliation andhealing, and to open up a new phase of the peace

permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster. They had abolished the veto of the House of Lords and Home Rule was due to be implemented in . The Tories seized on the issue of Home Rule as the most effective weapon to bring down the Liberals. Leading members of the British landed aristocracy, capitalists and senior military figures jumped on the bandwagon and backed up Unionist leader Edward Carson with threats of civil warHome Rule was brought in.Amidst the political frenzy there were very few Protestants in Ulster who were prepared to oppose Carsonism. But there were some and among them was the Reverend J.B. Armour of Ballymoney, County Antrim. A minister of the Presbyterian Church, Armour stood out from most of his co-religionists in advocating self-government for Ireland. In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism. Banners in the hall proclaimed “No provisional or provincial government for us” and “Ulster for Ireland and Ireland for us”.The resolution stated that the meeting of Protestants of Ballymoney and the protests in The Route“against the claim of Sir Edward Carson and the self-constituted Provisional Government of Ulster to represent the Protestant community of north-east Ulster” and “disputes the narrow claim that dferences of creed necessarily separate Irishmen and women into hostile camps”. Among the speakers at the Ballymoney meeting were JB Armour himself, historian Alice Stopford Green, Jack White, son of a British Army general and later a leading figure in the Irish Citizen Army, and Roger Casement, who was executed in . This was Casement’s first appearance on a political . With his Antrim family background, Casement regarded the occasion as hugely signicant and in his speech he denounced any notion of partitioning Ireland. The meeting was a once-off and failed to turn the tide of Carsonism but it did show that a signicant minority of Protestants in the North-East were still prepared to stand up for Irish unity and self-government. The meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney in support of Irish self-government was held on  October ,  years ago this week. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27490  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.- Declan KearneyLast weekend the Irish Congress of Trades Unionsand Irish Labour History Society organised a conference to commemorate William Walker in Belfast.Walker was an anti-Home Rule unionist who was a leader in the Belfast Independent Labour Partyin the early twentieth century.When James Connolly, Irelands most signicant historical, socialist republican leader called on the ILPs membership to support socialist unity in Ireland, his appeal provoked a rebuke from Walker.This led to a robust debate between both figures in the pages of Forward between May and July .Their debate came to be known as the Connolly Walker controversy and later became an historical reference point for the anti-imperialist struggle in Ireland.I participated in a  alongside veteran trade unionist Joe Bowers, Ulster Unionist councillor Chris Mc Gimpsey, and ICTU Assistant General Secretary, Owen Reidy, to discuss the post Walker years and the current situation in the north.Not surprisingly we delivered four very dferent perspectives on Walker and his legacy as well as, Brexit the north strategy and politics on the Left and, future prospects.A very challenging but fraternal debate ensued between the lists and the audience.I opened my comments by saying that any consideration today of William Walker’s legacy needs to be within the historic and contemporary reality that the advancement of socialist and Labour politics has been held back due to the effects of British colonial policy in Ireland.He was a product of his native Belfast and directly influenced by the communal environment within which he grew up.He was a protestant in a largely protestant workforce. Sectarianism in the late s and early s stalked Belfast.While Walker was severely limited in his political analysis he was committed to improving the conditions of his fellow workers.He is an integral part of Belfast’s industrial history and his contribution to the city’s labour heritage deserves recognition.British policy in Ireland and its consequences for Irish society has ided Irish workers along communal lines. It has paralysed the labour movement from effectively challenging partition and championing the strategic aim of Irish unity.Partition is the central fault line at the heart of Irish society and politics.Sectarianism remains a visceral blight in this state.Following partition, it was used by the ruling unionist elite to cement the foundation of the state and prevent unity among citizens on issues of common concern.The fact is Labour was indeed told to wait as the resurgent struggle for national independence grew in momentum just over  years ago.The counter revolution which took place post partition represented a strategic setback for labour and working-class interests in the new free state.It eclipsed the seminal influence which socialist republicanism had on the  Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil.The rights of workers became subservient to the conservative elites, north and south.However, sections of the labour movement were compliant with British policy in Ireland and the imposition of partition.That was personied in the political thinking of Walker and others pre partition.This tendency opposed Connollys core position that \"the two currents of revolutionary thought in Ireland, the socialist and the national, were not antagonistic but complementary\".Walkers debate with Connolly reflected a key contradiction inherent in the Irish labour movement and its relationship with the Irish national liberation struggle, and anti-imperialism generally.That contradiction has existed ever since.Walkers brand of ‘Municipal Socialism’ was in reality a euphemism for self-imposed strategic and political limitations which went on to define the Trade Union movement in the north.As a result, the Irish labour movement, particularly in the north has failed to challenge partition and modern British political policy towards Ireland.Partition has been an abject failure. It was never designed to make the northern state a political or economic success.From the beginning this state has carried within it the conditions of inherent instability.It was built upon institutionalised and structural sectarianism which ensured that a substantial minority was destined never to be treated as equals.The Civil Rights Movement fty years ago exposed the inability of the unionist state to treat the minority as equals.That belligerent opposition from powerful sections within political unionism against reform of the northern state persists today in the form of political unionism, and specically DUP hostility towards implementation of the Good Friday Agreementsince .Refusal by the DUP to embrace a rights-based society and equality, culminated in the collapse of the GFA political institutions in January , and our associated political crisis which has continued since then. Those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power-sharing.The party brand is now indistinguishable from financial scandal and sharp practice in government.As a party, the DUP is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic reforms, social modernity, and standards in public office.Its project is negative and tactical, and entirely focused upon slowing down and blocking progressive change, while maintaining a sectarian hegemony within the unionist constituency.The DUP is in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarian, homophobic and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists and many others, including sections of civic unionism, have concluded that the DUP has had its chance and cannot now be trusted in government.They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power at the risk of allowing it to continue practicing discrimination, intimidation, bigotry, or sharp practice.The enduring political crisis is accentuated by systemic structural weaknesses in the regional economy.The required investment in local public services and protection of workers’ rights are confronted with a combination of Tory austerity and Brexit.Pressures on public services are intensying.The regional block grant, or public expenditure settlement, has been reduced by .%.Real term cuts to public funding are now factored into future budget profiles alongside ·         Actual net cuts in take home pay for public and private sector workers·         Welfare cuts and the universal social charge·         Higher inflation and living costs, adults in working families live in relative povertyAverage wages in the north remain lower than ten years ago.Precarious working conditions, zero hours’ contracts, and the scam of bogus self-employment used by some employers are in common practice.Workers’ rights and protections are being systematically reversed.The onset of Brexit will be a catastrophe for the regional and island economiesIt will deepen an existing race to the bottom by further undermining the potential for economic growth, and new investment.The Brexit agenda, twinned with Tory austerity threaten jobs across all economic sectors, workers’ terms and conditions, and, any potential for sustainable public services in the north.The dawning political and economic reality is that Brexit has changed everything.It has exposed the negative role that partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.  The British state has been pushed into an unprecedented, existential political crisis.Brexit is a train wreck being jointly steered by the DUP and extremists in the British Tory party.But it also has become a defining moment for these islands.A new generation is questioning partition.There has been a seismic sht in the ambitions and expectations of citizens in the north.A new political discourse has begun about the future of Ireland north and south, and our relationships with Britain and EuropeThe debate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have moved centre stage.The time has come for a fundamental paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.The Irish government needs to begin preparing constitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish Unity.It should facilitate an open, inclusive national conversation involving all citizens, political parties, social partners, and civic society.That is a dialogue about our collective future on this island which addresses all the concerns, accommodations and compromises relevant to negotiating a new, all Ireland, constitutional, pluralist democracy.Today this new focus upon Irish unity provides Irish trade unionists and workers with an opportunity to influence the debate about future constitutional and political change.Previous moments of political change have required that labour should wait.The emerging challenge for the Irish labour movement north and south is to engage with this emerging discussion.To paraphrase Connolly in his opening contributions to the Connolly Walker debate\"Constitutional change then is almost a certainty of the future.”The labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.I said to the Belfast conference this reality will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting an Irish unity referendum and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.On Monday of this week I reiterated that opinion when I met Patricia King, General Secretary of ICTU in Dublin.Of course, this will be a challenging discussion for the Irish labour movement, as comrades noted both during and after the plenary discussion. But it should not be feared or avoided.Today in modern Ireland there is a battle for hearts and minds about how society is organisedThe status quo has failed us all.Connolly’s vision of a united Ireland which serves the interests of the many instead of the few will not be wished into existence.Labour should not wait again.The Irish labour movement needs to assert itself on the Irish unity debate by introducing a progressive labour agenda to the unfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27491  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe writer, newspaper editor and Irish republican Seumas O’Kelly was a native of Loughrea, County Galway. Author of short stories, plays, poems and a novel, The Weaver’s Grave which was his masterpiece, O’Kelly’s le was cut short because of his commitment to Irish freedom. The O’Kelly family of Loughrea were flour millers and merchants and Seumas received a good education. He was a fellow student of James Joyce in University College Dublin. There is a remarkable photograph of the BA degree class of  including Joyce, O’Kelly and George Clancy. Like O’Kelly, George Clancy, a close friend of Joyce, was to die a tragic death. He was Sinn Féin Mayor of Limerick when on  March  he was murdered in his home by the Black and Tans, on the same night as former Mayor Michael O’Callaghan. Seumas O’Kelly was a committed republican from an early age. He is recorded as one of those to the fore in the centenary commemorations of the  Rising in . He was writing for Arthur Grfith’s Irish Republican Brotherhood-funded newspaper The United Irishman from  and for its successor Sinn Féin from . While a full list of attendees is not available it is probable that he was at the founding meeting of Sinn Féin in November . In  O’Kelly was appointed editor of the Leinster Leader in Naas, County Kildare. He founded a branch of Conradh na Gaeilge in the town and was active in Sinn Féin locally. He welcomed republicans to his home during the annual Wolfe Tone commemorations in nearby Bodenstown. O’Kelly’s first book of stories was published in  and his first play was produced the following year. Several of his plays were produced at the Abbey Theatre. Constantly busy with literary and journalistic work, O’Kelly was subject to poor health. He joined Óglaigh na hÉireann when they were founded in  but was unable to play an active military role. His brother was a Volunteer and was jailed in England after the  Rising. The paper Nationality, edited by Grfith, was established in  and O’Kelly was one of its writers. It was the main organ of Sinn Féin during the  and  by-elections. In May  Grfith was arrested and jailed in England and O’Kelly took over as editor of Nationality. Following the  November  Armistice which ended the First World War, British soldiers and loyalists ran riot through the streets of Dublin, attacking suspected Sinn Féin supporters. On the night of  November a crowd of drunken soldiers invaded the Sinn Féin Ard Oig at  Harcourt Street . Seumas O’Kelly was at his desk in the Nationality office and tried to defend himself with his walking stick. The office was wrecked and O’Kelly collapsed. He was brought to Jervis Street Hospital where he died of a brain haemorrhage. Seumas O’Kelly was honoured with a republican funeral to Glasnevin Cemetery, attended by huge crowds.

In  the Women’s Social and Political Union was founded in England and the militant feminists commenced the battle for the vote. In Ireland there had been groups working for women’s suffrage but the campaign really began here on the instigation of Hanna Sheehy Skeffington and Margaret Cousins. Margaret Cousins came from a unionist family in Dublin but she later wrote: “I belonged in my heart from the beginning to the fighters for freedom.” Her husband James Cousins also rejected the unionism of his background and became involved in the Gaelic revival. Margaret came into contact with the women’s movement in England in . On herto Ireland she co-operated with a remarkable young woman who was to make her mark on Irish history. Hanna Sheehy was the daughter of a Fenian, David Sheehy, who took part in the  Rising and was elected as a Parnellite MP in . Hanna was an exceptional student and excelled academically despite the restrictions on women’s access to education she achieved a first class honours MA in . She became a teacher and married Francis Skeffington. In line with their shared feminist principles they adopted each other’s surnames. Francis resigned his post as registrar of University College because the authorities refused to register women on the same basis as men. In  Hanna and Margaret founded the Irish Women’s Franchise League , with the active support of both Francis Sheehy Skeffington and James Cousins. From the beginning they stressed that the IWFL would address the specic needs of Irish women in “a subject country seeking freedom from England” and would “work on independent Irish lines”. Margaret Cousins described the IWFL’s position: “Its policy was to educate by all forms of propaganda the men, women and children of Ireland to understand and support the members of the League in their demand for votes for women, and to obtain pledges from every Irish Member of Parliament to vote for Women’s Suffrage Bills introduced in the British Houses of Parliament, and to include Women’s Suffrage in any Irish Home Rule Bill.” The IWFL campaigned throughout the country and made an impact beyond their numbers of about  activists. Not all militant women agreed with the IWFL’s tactics the republican group Inghinidhe na hÉireann refused to join in lobbying the British parliament, preferring to “organise a women’s movement on Sinn Féin lines, or on lines even broader still”. Despite this dference, republican women such as Constance Markievicz played an active role in the IWFL’s work and Hanna Sheehy Skeffington herself was strongly republican. Markievicz urged young Irishwomen to prepare to fight: “Arm yourselves with weapons to fight your nation’s cause. Arm your souls with noble and free ideas. Arm your minds with the histories and memories of your country and her martyrs, her language, and a knowledge of her arts and industries. Andin your day the call should come for your body to arm, do not shirk from that either.” Markievicz said Irishwomen were “doubly enslaved with a double battle to fight”. Following the  general election the Irish Party at Westminster was in a position to press the Liberal government to publish a Home Rule Bill. But Redmond and his party still refused to support women’s right to vote. The IWFL became more militant and Hanna and Francis founded the Irish Citizen newspaper to further the cause of women’s rights as well as Irish independence, social justice and pacism. When British politicians visited Ireland they were challenged by the IWFL. Margaret ‘Meg’ Connery confronted British Tory leader Andrew Bonar Law and Unionist leader Edward Carson when they came to Dublin. In Belfast Hanna Sheehy Skeffington challenged Winston Churchill. Margaret Cousins joined protests in England in  and was jailed for a month. In June  eight women from the IWFL smashed windows in Dublin Castle and other prominent buildings. Hanna was arrested at the Castle and she and the seven others were imprisoned in Mountjoy. The following month British Prime Minister Asquith visited Dublin and there were more protests. Three English feminists had followed Asquith to Ireland and they were also jailed for their protests. After a hunger strike in Mountjoy by the English suffragists and the IWFL women, all were released except two of the Englishwomen who were subjected to forced feeding. Many meetings of the IWFL were physically attacked at this time by Redmondites who saw the campaign for women’s suffrage as a threat to their political dominance and their relationship with the British Liberal government. In contrast, republicans such as Pádraig Mac Piarais and Thomas MacDonagh were supporters of the IWFL. The IWFL also won the support of prominent trade unionists James Larkin and James Connolly. They were closely allied with the Irish Women Workers Union in Liberty Hall and in  Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed after a confrontation with the Dublin politan Police during the Great Lockout. She was released after a six-day hunger strike. That year also saw the death in England of feminist Emily Davison who ran on to the course at the Epsom Derby and was trampled by a race horse. Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed again in  for campaigning against recruitment to the British Army. Her influence and that of the IWFL was seen in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic of  which enshrined women’s right to vote. Her friend James Connolly told her: “You will be glad to know that in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic we are including equal citizenship for women.” Hanna replied that she knew who was responsible, meaning Connolly himself. “We were practically unanimous, Only one questioned it,” replied Connolly. Francis Sheehy Skeffington was murdered in Portobello Barracks by a British Army officer during the Easter Rising. Hanna embarked on a tour of the United States to expose the truth about the murder and other British atrocities. She continued to play a leading role in the struggle for Irish freedom, as did many of the pioneering feminists of the IWFL. In  the IWFL saw its central aim achieved when women voted for the first time in the general election which resulted in a massive Sinn Féin victory, although women under  were still excluded. The IWFL actively opposed British rule and supported Dáil Éireann. For example in August  Hanna was badly beaten by the RIC who attacked a Sinn Féin meeting at which she spoke in Kilbeggan, Co. Westmeath. IWFL women went on to champion women’s rights in the decades following the Treaty when they faced the very dferent challenges of a partitioned Ireland with conservative anti-women governments North and South. The Irish Women’s Franchise League was founded  years ago on  November .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27493  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonA wreckers’ agenda is being driven by the DUP and Tory government.

They must not be allowed to destroy the democratic option formaking change in the north.It is these circumstances which bring sharply into focus theIrish governments responsibilities.Those who courageously signed this letter to the Irish government are saying the negative position of the DUP and British governmentmust not be tolerated.These are citizens who want the political institutionsre-established but only on the basis of democracy and equality.They are assertive in their resolve to see a rights basedsociety created, which guarantees rights, respect, and parity of esteem, in ashared, inclusive future.But they are not prepared to be treated as second-classcitizens in this part of Ireland.Those days are over.It is time for the Irish Government to indeed redouble itsefforts to step up to the mark by absolutely opposing the imposition ofBrexit, and guaranteeing equality and rights for all citizens in the north.An Taoiseach and the Irish Government needs to reflect verycarefully about the signicance and timing of this intervention, respondpositively and act decisively, in cooperation with the politicalrepresentatives of Irish citizens, and others in the north, to ensure thattheir democratic rights are delivered upon.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27494  ","story":"• th NOVEMBER  - Newly elected Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams Mícheál Mac DonnchaTHE Ard Fheis of  marked a signicant stage in the political development of Sinn Féin. The historic gathering came in the wake of the campaign in support of the H-Block and Armagh prisoners, the epic Hunger Strikes, the intervention of prisoner candidates, North and South, in  and Sinn Féin’s electoral rise in the Six Counties in  and .The party’s performance in the October  Assembly elections – when five republicans were elected to the body set up by British direct ruler Jim Prior – caused alarm to the SDLP and their supporters in the Establishment parties in the  Counties. Sinn Féin’s lead in boycotting the Assembly was followed by the SDLP for fear of losing further support to republicans. The Fine Gael Labour Government, led by Garret FitzGerald, set up the New Ireland Forum in Dublin mainly as a  for the SDLP. In June , the political establishment in Ireland and Britain was rocked by the election of Sinn Féin Vice-President Gerry Adams as MP for his native west Belfast. For long a leading republican activist, Adams advocated the deeper politicisation and popularisation of the republican struggle and the building of Sinn Féin across the  Counties.The British Tory government of Margaret Thatcher was also concerned at the rise of Sinn Féin. In the week before the Ard Fheis in November , Prior told Tory MPs that Ireland could become a “Cuba off Britain’s west coast”. He said he feared Sinn Féin could overtake the SDLP electorally and “we must do all we can to strengthen constitutional nationalism”. When the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis gathered in the Mansion House in Dublin on  and  November, it was set to elect a new leadership. Ruairí Ó Brádaigh had been president since  and he announced that he would not be seeking re-election. He said the four-province federal Ireland plan, of which he had been a strong advocate, had been rejected at the  Ard Fheis and his approach on other issues, including electoral strategy, had been rejected by the Ard Chomhairle.In his address, the new party president, Gerry Adams, dismissed media claims of a ‘Northern takeover’ and said:“We are not a Northern, nor a Southern party – we are an Irish republican party organised throughout Ireland.”The main theme of his speech was the need for republicans to break out of political isolation and “get among the people in the basic ways which the people accept”. In line with this approach, the Ard Fheis voted to contest European Parliament elections with the intention of taking seatsthey were won. This followed the expansion of party electoral strategy the previous year. The Ard Fheis coincided with a by-election campaign for the Dáil seat of Dublin Central, which was contested by Sinn Féin candidate Christy Burke, turning in a creditable performance. There was further controversy after the Ard Fheis, and discomfort for Fianna Fáil leaders in particular, when Gerry Adams was confirmed as the main speaker at the annual Kilmichael commemoration in west Cork. Gerry Adams was elected president of Sinn Féin at the Ard Fheis of November ,  years ago.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27497  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinSinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit. - Mary Lou McDonald TDAmid all the chaos in Westminster, there are few certainties as to where the Brexit circus will stumble to next.Brexit began as a squabble between the rich and right wing boys of the Tory party. Ireland north or south was never a concern yet we will all pay the cost for generations to come.Brexit represents a huge threat to the social, economic and political le of this island. The outworking of Brexit could be the imposition of hard border.That is why the people of the north - from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1106582.jpg--.jpg?1540373104000\n","title":"allen s meats moves to larger premises in cullybackey","story":"AFTER  years serving the people of Ahoghill Allens Meats has moved to larger premises to meet the demands of the growing business.The butchers shop has relocated to Cullybackey to take over the former Lamont Butchers at  Main Street in the village.Allens Meats needed to acquire larger premises and decided to make the move to Cullybackey after David Lamont retired.Lamont Butchers has been based in Cullybackey since  and Derek Allen and his team will continue to provide the same excellent customer service and top quality produce.Derek said: “The business is growing and we needed more space to enable us to offer a wider range of products.“We would like to thank all our customers in Ahoghill for their support over the last  years.

The Right to Welfare Group are calling for a risk assessment to be carried out by social security decision makers and have developed the Peoples Proposal which is a human rights checklist. “The checklist includes the right to due process, including the right to information and representation, presumption of innocence and transparent decision making prior to the appeal stage.”Councillor Hardy spoke passionate about the Peoples Proposal and about the recent benefit changes.She said it is needed because: On average over  financial sanction are issued against unemployed people every month, while  decisions are made on a monthly basis to stop sickness benefits.People are being financially sanctioned first and then appealed afterwards while suffering forced poverty.She gave figures, saying that: , people were forced to use food banks last year, including , children.

This is not just a statistic, this is a sad reality. Many children are arriving to school hungry. Every child should have the right to food and every child should be free from poverty.

The impact of the changes in welfare delivery are causing a signicant impact in society, especially on those who are the poorest in society.He added: The increasing use of food banks in areas where universal credit has been ruled out, the use of food banks have increased by %.I have seen some horrendous decisions going through. So I think anything that introduces greater clarity and greater consideration of the actualconditions is to be welcomed to try and make this a fairer system.DUP Councillor Billy Ashe said this affected everyone.

The project is part funded by Invest Northern Ireland and the European Regional Development Fund under the Investment for Growth  Jobs Northern IrelandProgramme.I used to be a childminder and had two young children and didnrsquot think it was possible for me to get into the beauty business - but then I went back to college and studied beauty at the Roberta Mechan College, she said.I have a real interest in health and well-being and wanted to offer these services to others. I opened in April this year and I currently offer specialist skincare, nails, massage and waxing.Helen turned her dream into a reality after taking part in the Go For It Programme which is delivered free of charge by a team of experienced business mentors through Northern Irelandrsquos wide network of enterprise agencies.It provides expert advice and help with developing a robust business plan to help turn ideas into a commercial enterprise.Commenting on the success of the programme, Helen said: Often it is hard to know where to start that was my experience before starting the Go For It Programme. The support and guidance offered through it helped me fine tune my business idea from concept to working reality.They helped me with practical things in the early stages like setting out a business plan and doing a detailed analysis. It was great for helping me to budget and forward plan.ldquoI would urge anyone who has ever had the idea of starting up their own business, or evenyou have just started operating your own business to apply for a place on the Go For It Programme. The skills and knowledge imparted is beyond the realms of what you could achieve on your own.Melanie Christie Boyle, Chief Executive of Ballymena Business Centre, on behalf of Mid and East Antrim and Borough Council, added: ldquoHelen joined the Go For It Programme driven by a desire to launch her very own beauty business, driven by a passion to help women improve their skin and help them feel good about themselves.Helen undertook an intensive beauty course under tutelage of an industry expert with a clear vision and motivation to open her own salon as soon as she completed her examinations.We worked with Helen to develop a business plan, focusing on key areas such as defining her service provision, marketing and financial forecasting, as well as helping her secure commercial premises at Ballee and Harryville Community Enterprise Centre.It is great to see how Helen has progressed her business in such as short space of time, building a loyal customer base and a excellent reputation for her quality customer service and using only the very best range of products.If you have a business idea yoursquod like to develop oryou are thinking about starting a business call    or visit: visit www.goforitni.

Looking after the maintenance of it, the operations of it, all the visitors’ services, and the staff and all that side of things.“Anything that happens on the bridge is my responsibility and it’s my job to make sure it gets sorted out.”Trish Johnson making safety checks on the bridge.Born in Belfast, Trish grew up in Banbridge, attended St Mary’s Primary School and then Banbridge Academy where she completed her A Levels before going on to study engineering at the University of Salford, Manchester.After graduating, she says she “sort of fell into” bridge engineering and maintenance – an industry she has remained in for more than  years.Trish, who is better known to family and friends in Northern Ireland as Patricia, has been bridgemaster at Clton for the past two years. But previously she was in charge of maintenance at the Severn Bridge and the Second Severn Crossingand before that looked after bridges and highways across Wiltshire and Avon.She is the first woman to take on the role of bridgemaster at Clton, but says she isn’t tempted to change her title to bridgemistress.An aerial view of the Clton Suspension Bridge, which spans the Avon Gorge and the River Avon.“It is a historic title so it would be unfair to try to change it. I’m happy with bridgemaster, so I wouldn’t want to try to change the course of history!”Trish manages a team of  people including bridge attendants, visitor centre staff, maintenance workers and administration staff, as well as dozens of volunteers who help out with ious projects.“I really enjoy it. It’s fantastic,” she said. “It is a real honour to be looking after such a historic asset. I’ve been in Bristol  or  years now – a long time since I left Northern Ireland – and the bridge has always been a part of my tours when family have been over, so it’s amazing that I’m actually looking after it now. and Santa getting ready for the Twilight Market in Portadown.\"   and Santa getting ready for the Twilight Market in Portadown.\"  Christmas switch-on and twilight market tonight Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"“It is a big responsibility. The bridge itself is over  years old. It is one of the icons of Bristol. We get half a million visitors here every year, so it is my responsibility to make sure the bridge is well maintained, safe to use and that it is there for a long time to come.“It is a historic Grade  listed structure and there are not many historic Grade  listed structures that are still used as a transport asset. We still have four million vehicles cross the bridge every year, so it is a working asset as well as a historical and visitor attraction, so there is a lot to the job and it definitely keeps me busy.”The married mum-of-two admits to being slightly obsessed with bridges, and once even booked a weekend trip to Copenhagen just so she could visit the Öresund Bridge which runs between Denmark and Sweden.Her husband Rob, who works in finance, may not share her passion for bridges, but it seems he’s seen more than his fair share over the years.“When we go on holidays he ends up getting trailed round every bridge,” Trish smiled. “He’s getting used to the bridges by now!”Neither of Trish’s children share her love of engineering either. Her daughter Fiona, , works in marketing, while son Thomas, , is studying economics at university.She says she tried to get them into engineering, without success. But she’s adamant that more needs to be done in the UK in general to encourage young people, particularly girls, to get into science, technology, engineering and mathssubjects.“I think the UK has got the lowest percentage of female engineers in Europe and that’s a sad situation. We’ve probably got about % or less female engineers across the UK, so it is really important that we increase the number of women in engineering. “We need to increase the number of people with engineering skills full stop, but we need to tap in to that whole area of getting girls engaged and interested in engineering,” she continued.“Maths was my big thing. I am one of these geeks really. The problem solving side of things is what I really liked, and still do really, and engineering is perfect for that. There is always a problem you’ve got to sort out, and that’s what gets me out of bed in the morning.“I have done it for  years and I have had a whale of a time and really enjoyed it. It’s not just about getting your hands dirty and the mud and concrete and that side of things, there is so much more to it than that and that’s what we have to try to get across to the youngsters of today.”Trish, whose father Tommy Fee is well known in the Banbridge area for having run\u2028 fitness classes at the local college for more than four decades, has made her le in Bristol and says she has no plans at present tohome to Northern Ireland.“I get drawn back every now and then. I go back to see family and friends. But my husband and kids are here so I don’t think I’ll be moving home just yet, but who knows what we’ll do when we retire.”THE FACTS• The Clton Suspension Bridge opened in . It is a private bridge run by a trust.• The  feet long, ,-tonne structure spans the Avon Gorge and River Avon between Clton in Bristol and Leigh Woods in North Somerset.• The deck of the Grade  listed structure sits  feet above the river.• Its designer, Isambard Kingdom Brunel, was just  when he was appointed project engineer. • Brunel died in  – five years before the bridge he described as “my first love” officially opened.• Today the bridge serves as a crossing for more than four million vehicles every year.• Vehicle drivers have to pay a £ toll to cross the bridge, and the money goes towards the upkeep of the historic structure.• Trish Johnson, the first female bridgemaster, took over the role in October ."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8537099.1529312918!/image/image.jpg","title":"new park ride facility at fane valley welcomed","story":"Local Alderman Junior McCrum has welcomed the new park and ride facility being built adjacent to Fane Valley in Banbridge.

With a limited number of tickets still available, ‘Em Two Balloons duo Gerard Jordan and Ciarán Nolan told Daily Belfast how audiences can expect all their favourite characters from previous stage outings with a wedding bringing together the West and North of the city for its fairytale finale.“This is the fourth year we have brought ‘Em Two Balloons and their Christmas show to the Roddy’s,” explained Ciarán, “we had great success last year with the Terrible Tragedy of the Twinbrook Turkey and we are back again to tell all about the Fairytale of New Lodge. We had Deck the Falls back in , Turkey last year and now this feels like the completion of part of a trilogy.”“The demand for the shows is growing each year,” said Gerard, “audiences have really taken the characters Ciarán and I play and given us such great support. At the start of November we learned that there are only  per cent of the tickets left at the Mac and people are coming in every day to get their tickets early for the Roddy’s. If there were more days in December we would put on more shows as the demand is there.”“Audiences can expect pretty much what they have experienced before, especially in terms of laughter,” said Ciarán. “There are wedding bells in the air in the production, North Belfast is meeting West Belfast and the introduction of the Glider is bringing our characters East. I mean, what’s the most exotic thing for a Westie  It’s’ getting on the Glider and heading East, seeing Stormont in real le,” he laughed. “The characters Gerard and I have created Jean and Joan, Tablets and Muttley and our two doormen Feargal and Maxi are all there as well. Countess and Winalot, the two dogs, are woofing all the way towards Christmas too. Our bride is played by me and called Mini Driver who is from the Oldpark, Feargal is our groom and the all important wedding prep forms part of the story too.”Gerard spoke of how the hard work has been going on behind the scenes since .“It’s been great how much the audiences have backed us. The real compliment is that the audiences keep growing and this year we’ve added matinees into the Mac, we want to branch out to new audiences each year and will be taking the show to Naomh Éanna on December  as well.”Ciarán said that due to overwhelming demand a handful of dates will be performed after Christmas at Fruithill Bowling Club, Gort Na Mona and St Paul’s GAC on the ,  and  of December. “We will be working on new material for  and ‘Em Two Balloons will be bringing out a new production.

We are not a party of no deal. However, the deal before us would irreparably damage the economic and constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom. This is a seminal moment for our nation. We respect everyones right to examine the Prime Ministers draft deal, to interpret it as they see fit and to challenge our views where they feel it is appropriate. However, our position on the proposed deal is in line with what we have said both in private and in public for many weeks. This should come as no surprise to local representatives of business including agri-food.The draft agreement would establish signicant dferences between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom. In legal terms, Annex  to the Protocol would mean Northern Ireland remaining in EU single market rules for goods, including food standards, while Great Britain is not. Economically it would mean vastly increased checks on food and agriculture products entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain. Practically this creates new barriers for businesses, including supermarkets seeking to fill shelves across our province. Others can choose to frame it dferently but in our eyes such a solution cannot be described as anything other than a border in the Irish Sea. While this paints a picture of immediate disruption - even when UK and EU rules are aligned - the greater unknown of this plan is how that disruption could evolve and growand when the rules between sides erge. Although this deal may give certainty to trade on day one, that certainty is far from guaranteed for months and years down the line. There is no legal guarantee on preventing ergence within the UK internal market during the operation of the backstop. Commitments to best endeavours are not enough.Keeping Northern Ireland in the EUs state aid framework also raises the potential for dferences in support and incentives provided to businesses in dferent parts of the UK. Hospitality Ulster have highlighted fears that the plans could halt Northern Irelands campaign for cutting tourism VAT and abolishing air passenger duty. It is also clear that a new Joint Committee would have the power to restrict the maximum level of future support provided to farmers in Northern Ireland. The deal on the table fails to deliver the referendum result in every part of the UK. It leaves our province subject to the rulings of the European Court of Justice. It creates a democratic deficit whereby Northern Ireland would become subservient to EU legislation with zero representation. In real terms, Dublin legislators would have influence over the rules governing us while elected representatives in Belfast or London would have none. This violates the principle of consent. It also extends the role of the devolved institutions and North-South bodies and grants a Joint Committee signicant input into local affairs. This collectively amounts to a breach the Belfast Agreement. The wording of the draft withdrawal agreement also ensures that Dublin and Brussels hold an active veto on whether the backstop ceases to apply in Northern Ireland in the future. Both options - the review mechanism or extension to the transition period - fail to allow the UK to unilaterally move away from the arrangements should it wish to do so. This could leave us in an indefinite limbo and make it harder to leave the backstop than to leave the EU itself. The ability to supersede the backstop in whole or in part also expresses a danger that Great Britain may be able to leave the backstop but Northern Ireland may have to remain. We would be handcuffed to the EU with Brussels holding the keys. Thats not taking back control.We are not alone in our resolve to oppose the risks this deal presents to the Union. Departing Cabinet members hold to our view that this agreement would break up the United Kingdom. Labour has described it as a de facto border in the Irish Sea. The parliamentary debate in the coming days should not be framed as a binary choice between a bad deal or a no-deal. We believe there is widespread cross-bench support for a deal with the EU - but not this deal. We will not, as some have suggested, step back from our commitments to defend the security of the Union and protect the long-term economic interests of Northern Ireland. Ultimately neither can be guaranteed by this deal and for that reason the DUP cannot in good conscience support it.

Its a real issue and it needs urgent attention.\"Alderman Tom Haire, who supports the operation of -hour bus lanes during the week, said he favours a free flowing road network at the weekend, where all lanes are open to all traffic.\"All traffic needs to be able to access the city centre on a Saturday for the overall economic wellbeing of Belfast - and now would be a good time to make that happen,\" the DUP man said. Independent councillor Declan Boyle said ditching the bus lanes on Saturdays was essential for the citys economic revival.\"Bus lanes are right up there with the cost and dficulty of car parking in Belfast as major deterrents to shoppers,\" he said.\"Bus lanes should only operate at peak times during rush hour and at no other time. Saturdays should definitely be out.\"A Translink spokeswoman said: \"We want to make public transport as attractive as possible and keep the city moving. \"Bus lanes help us bring more people into the city centre and with the launch of our Christmas package this week, including fare offers and special services, bus lanes are an important role in successfully delivering this.\" A spokeswoman said the Department for Infrastructure has invested £m in the Belfast Rapid Transit Glider system in keeping with the draft Programme for Governments aim to encourage people to choose sustainable forms of transport.\"In order for Glider to be successful, the services must be able to operate smoothly along the routes,\" she said.\"The bus lanes are vital to ensure bus services can operate at a high frequency and on time to help guarantee journey time reliability. \"This will in turn make public transport a more attractive option and encourage more people to leave their cars at home.\"Evidence from Translink is that while bus patronage on a Saturday is lower than on weekdays it is still signicantly higher than on a Sunday. \"In addition, bus frequency is similar on a Saturday to that on weekdays. In view of this, and the need for consistency to avoid confusion, it is therefore equally important to have bus lane priority on a Saturday. \"The department recently provided additional funding of £, to enable Translink to deliver a high impact festive campaign, offering major fare discounts and extra services.\" "},{"url":null,"title":"hyponatraemia inquiry doctor faces medical standards panel","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He was a paediatric consultant who was working at Altnagelvin Area Hospital when he was asked to review the care given to Lucy Crawford prior to her death.Lucy, the youngest child of a family of three, was admitted to the Erne Hospital in Enniskillen on April , .She was transferred to the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children the following day and died on April ,  at just  months old.John OHara, chair of the Hyponatraemia Inquiry, found that \"Lucys death was caused by a glaring medical error\".Lucy died as a result of hyponatraemia, which is the term for a low level of sodium in the blood stream causing brain cells to swell with too much water.She was one of five children whose treatment and deaths in Northern Ireland hospitals were examined by Mr OHara.In  her parents asked for personal reasons that her death be removed from the inquiry.While that wish was respected, the inquirys chairman said the issues raised by her death remained vital to the wider community.In his subsequent report, Mr OHara raised concerns about the decision to appoint Dr Quinn to review Lucys care, given the fact that he knew some of the doctors who had treated her.He said: \"It is clear to me that Dr Quinn did not approach his task with the necessary degree of professional detachment.\"His familiarity with the organisation and the people who had retained him plainly influenced him.\"Mr OHara added: \" should not have carried out this work on behalf of the trust, and should not have been asked to do so.\"The inquiry chair also criticised some of Dr Quinns findings, which he said \"inidually and cumulatively gave the trust reassurance when its clinicians ought to have been subject to criticism\".The MPTS hearing in February will consider allegations that following Lucys death, Dr Quinn \"attended a meeting and failed to highlight comments made by a colleague inmedical records or take account that the fluids given to the patient could have been a contributory factor.\"It is also alleged that, in June , Dr Quinn prepared a written report in which he failed to record information relating to Lucy, reached the wrong conclusion in respect of fluids administered, and gave a misleading impression of the care provided to Lucy.According to the General Medical Council , Dr Quinn is currently registered without a licence to practise.

Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said he did not believe it was the best deal for Northern Ireland.It follows days of chaos over the Brexit plan agreed between the UK and the EU.As the fallout continued yesterday:Stephen Barclay was named the new Brexit Secretary as Prime Minister Theresa May set about filling her cabinet after several of her top team quit.Speculation grew that the PMs critics have the numbers required to trigger a confidence vote within days.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar admitted it would be \"very dficult\" to avoid a hard border in the event of a no-deal Brexit.Ulster Unionist leader Robin Swann branded the inclusion of the backstop in the withdrawal text as a \"monumental error in judgment\".The proposed deal has sparked chaos within the Conservative Party since it was unveiled on Wednesday. Mrs Mays premiership is hanging by a thread with a series of ministerial resignations and calls from her own MPs for her to stand aside.A vote of no confidence in her leadership could take place as early as next week.The DUP - which Mrs May relies on to stay in power - are also unhappy.Yesterday, however, leading business organisations representing Northern Ireland issued a joint statement in support of the draft agreement.The Confederation of British Industry NI, Federation of Small Businesses NI, Institute of Directors NI and NI Chamber of Commerce said the deal \"provides some much needed clarity that local businesses have been calling for\".\"While by no means perfect, it provides a  to move onto the critical next stage and allows work to begin on the formulation of a comprehensive future trade deal,\" it said. \"Crucially, the provision for an extended transition period offers our members the flexibility and time to adjust to a new relationship with the EU which they must be allowed to do in as smooth and orderly a manner as possible.\"It repeated warnings that a no-deal Brexit would be \"deeply damaging\" and would represent \"a very bad outcome\" for businesses, consumers and the economy.Earlier, the UFU, which represents thousands of farmers, many of whom would traditionally vote DUP, called on the party to vote for the text.UFU chief executive Wesley Aston told the Nolan Show: \"We want to make sure we avoid a no-deal situation. No deal for Northern Ireland agri-food and farming in particular would be absolutely disastrous and we have made that patently clear over this last while.\"He added: \"We would support the deal going through and against that background we would ask the DUP to consider voting for this deal.\"UFU president Ivor Ferguson told the Belfastindependent reports had concluded that a no-deal Brexit would have disastrous consequences for farm businesses and the economy here.He said: \"Ultimately, we would have preferred a UK-wide solution. However, this agreement does provide an insurance policy to prevent a no deal outcome.\"Brian Irwin, chairman of the Northern Ireland Food and Drink Association, also hailed the draft withdrawal agreement, saying it \"provides a way to deliver a smooth exit and an orderly transition to the future relationship with Europe\".But speaking to the Belfast , Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the DUPs view of the deal has not changed.\"We very much respect that there are people within the business community and farming who have a dferent view to us on Brexit, and indeed many of them campaigned against Brexit in the first instance,\" he said.\"Therefore it comes as no surprise that they would want to support a deal that keeps Northern Ireland locked into the EU in terms of both customs and the single market.\"While we respect their opinion, we disagree with their conclusion that this is the best deal we can get for Northern Ireland. We believe that a border in the Irish Sea is not in the interests of either our farmers or our business owners, because Great Britain is by far our biggest and best market.\"It is our view that anything that creates barriers between Northern Ireland and Great Britain in economic terms is not good for our economy.\"Earlier, the Lagan Valley MP faced criticism over comments on the BBCs The View when he was asked to respond to comments supporting the deal from the UFU and the Northern Ireland food and drink sector.\"I dont believe they have read the detail of this, they have not read the  pages,\" he had said.Ian Marshall, a former UFU president turned Irish senator, accused Sir Jeffrey of being \"disrespectful\"."},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland navy hero torpedoed by uboat who went on to serve with prince philip passes away","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Matches between the two sides have historically proved contentious, with the November  clash in Belfast just one month after the Greysteel shooting and Shankill Road bombing remembered in infamy for the tension which surrounded it. Due to security concerns around the match the Republics players were flown to Belfast from Dublin, and the FAI - the football association for the Republic - took the decision to sell none of its ticket allocation. Thursdays international friendly mostly passed off without incident, with the exception of a small number of the Republics fans booing the British national anthem God Save the Queen. Some reciprocal booing could also be heard during the Republics national anthem Amhran na bhFiann. Sinn Fein TD for Cork South-Central Donnchadh O Laoghaire hit out on Twitter at the \"minority of Irish fans\" who chose to boo the British national anthem, calling them \"a disgrace\".

It was more of a worry for my parents when I was diagnosed but it’s just part of everyday le now and as long as I stay on track managing it should be fine.”Harry is one of around seven pupils at his school with diabetes and as well as supporting each other they have the added support of classroom assistant Anne Beattie, the diabetes champion at St Joseph’s Boys’ School in Derry, who knows the complexities only too well as she is also Type , and staff member Rosin McLaughlin is always on hand to help as well. Harry knows how vital it is to check his blood sugar levels regularly and keep track of the carbs and he wears an insulin pump which he administers himself when required.Speaking ahead of World Diabetes Day on November th, the teenager said that while he had missed a lot of P and P following his diagnosis, there was now better awareness in schools about diabetes and help with monitoring blood sugars.He also reassured any young people newly diagnosed with the condition that they can still pursue the same hobbies as their friends, including competitive sports.Like most lads his age, Harry enjoys playing football, is also a good swimmer and golfs twice a week. With entrepreneurship in the genes, he’s already considering dipping his toe in the family business where his mum Martina also works in Customer Service.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshDamian Wilson, who founded Click Energy - Northern Ireland’s fastest growing electricity provider – in , said he was very proud that the eldest of their three children was a role model for young people with diabetes as a result of his own experience with the condition.“Harry is a very caring young man and diabetes hasn’t stood in his way,anything it has made him more headstrong and independent. He loves ‘The Apprentice’ and is a big fan of Sir Alan Sugar so hopefully he will start working here at  to gain some experience.”Currently, there are , people living with either Type  or Type  diabetes in Northern Ireland, and this figure is on the rise, making the need for education and awareness surrounding the condition more important than ever.People with Type  diabetes cannot produce insulin.

It’s the most common type of diabetes in children and young adults, starting suddenly and getting worse quickly. Type  diabetes is treated by daily insulin doses – taken either by injections or via an insulin pump. It is also recommended to follow a healthy diet and take regular physical activity.Jillian Patchett, National Director of Diabetes UK Northern Ireland, welcomed the partnership with Click Energy which included funding for pilot programmes including a new role for Connections Ambassadors to provide help and support in diabetes clinics and also the  Diabetes Volunteer Inspire Awards.She added: “The theme of World Diabetes Day  is Family.

raised after residents of a street in Derry waited nine hours to have power restored to their homes after an underground cable was damaged.The incident happened at the Paddock Lane area in Ballyarnett at pm on Friday, which resulted in a number of homes experiencing a power loss.However, concerns have now been raised that it took NIE nine hours to restore power, given that many of those who live in the area are elderly.Commenting, the independent councillor for the area, Warren Robinson, said that while he understands that certain circumstances could delay power being restored, he was nonetheless concerned at how the issue was handled by NIE.“I was made aware of the problem after being contacted by some residents who were affected. “Concerns were raised in particular because this area houses a large proportion of elderly residents. “I immediately contacted NIE and was informed that a third party contractor had damaged a cable in the area and was told that a repair team were on site but NIE could not give me an estimate for when the fault would be repaired.”Cllr Robinson added: “I understand that sometimes circumstances may mean there is a delay in having repairs carried out but electricity was off in this area for ten hours and my concern would be that elderly residents were left with no information and no offers of help from NIE.”“NIE do have a duty of care to these customers, I believe they have a particular duty of care to our elderly neighbours. googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“NIE need to tell us why it took ten hours for the repair to be carried out. They also need to put measures in place wherebythere is a delay that this is immediately communicated to the affected residents.”Safety Responding, a spokesperson for NIE said that the efforts of engineers had been hampered by ‘adverse weather conditions’, adding that it had been dficult to provide customers with an exact time for when the issue would be resolved due to ‘complexity’ of the problem.“NIE Networks received reports of a fault at Paddock Lane at approximately pm on Friday, November ,” a spokesperson said. “An underground electricity cable had been accidentally damaged by a third-party contractor resulting in a small number of customers experiencing loss of electricity supply. “The damaged cable required isolation for safety reasons before engineers could begin to carry out repairs. The spokesperson continued: “We do endeavour to provide our customers with information where possible, however, it was dficult to provide an exact time for restoration on this occasion due to the unforeseen nature and complexity of the fault, as well as the safety required to undertake the repairs. “This was further compounded by our engineers operating in adverse weather conditions. Following excavation work, repairs were carried out to the damaged cable with supply to all affected customers restored by .pm on Friday.”"},{"url":null,"title":"traffic travel co derry road closed following road traffic collision","story":"The Cookstown Road in Moneymore is closed in both directions following a road traffic collision.Diversions are in place but delays are expected.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshThere is no further information at this stage."},{"url":null,"title":"pictures remembrance sunday in newtown","story":"Newtown came together to mark the centenary of the end of the First World War.

It is also impacting on residents being able to park outside their homes, particularly in the Irish Street, Fountain Street and Saul Street areas.Cllr Sharvin believes the combined voices of the business community and residents can see the charges reduced to their previous level to ldquosupport the economical sustainability of Downpatrick town centre.He is also encouraging people to complete the online survey or pick up a paper copy from the council offices at the Downshire Civic Centre.Cllr Sharvin confirmed he has also asked council officials to survey the condition of its three car parks in Downpatrick, suggesting the surface in Irish Street is ldquoparticularly poor.Downpatrick councillor, Dermot Curran, has also expressed concern about the impact of the increased charges and believes the increasing concern is exactly the kind of issue a tradersrsquo group in the town should be addressing.He added: ldquoThe town needs a thriving business organisation to help with its continued economic regeneration and to discuss issues like increased parking charges. Such a body would provide the business community with a much-needed voice on a range of important issues.The series of roadshows to discuss parking charges moved to The Lodge in Castlewellan and the Newcastle Centre last night and takes place next Tuesday, November , at Ballynahinchrsquos Market House between .pm and .pm, before later moving to The Hub in Saintfield between pm and pm..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Symbolic lantern walk rekindles time WWI ended  ","story":"A SPECIALLY designed beacon was lit in Killyleagh on Sunday night to mark the th anniversary of the end of the First World War.Local man Martin lsquoTinarsquo Charters, , one of Northern Irelandrsquos last survivors from the Second World War, lit the gas beacon of light at the front of Killyleagh Castle to mark the moment the guns finally fell silent.Mr Charters was accompanied by two local schoolchildren, Zac Gordon, from St Maryrsquos Primary School, Killyleagh, and Louise Craig, of Killyleagh Integrated Primary School.The cross-community event was attended by more than  people at the end of Remembrance Sunday.The eveningrsquos events began with a lantern walk from Shrigley to Killyleagh.

worlds brexit","story":"The author of a report, \"Brexit at the Border\", has said that the ldquopressure is on our political parties especially those with the influence of the DUPa \"best of both worlds\" brexit is to become a reality.Dr Katy Hayward, who is a Reader of Sociology at Queens and who has  years research experience on the impact of the EU on the Irish border and peace process, was responding to an article penned by DUP leader Arlene Foster in last weekrsquos Impartial Reporter.In that article Mrs Foster laid out what the ldquobest of both worlds would be for Northern Ireland, which included full access to UK single market, full access to the EU single market, and full access to future UK and EU trade deals.Mrs Foster said that no-one has offered this ldquobest of both worlds to Northern Ireland but Dr Hayward claims that it is possible but onlythe ldquoUK remains closely aligned to the EUrsquos single market andit stays in a customs union with the EU.Dr Hayward does not see a smooth path to any such scenario however.ldquoBut, as Mrs Foster is well aware, the most vocalMPs in the Tory party want the UK to have a far more remote relationship with the EU after Brexit. If they succeed, this would automatically mean more barriers to trade with the EU, including across the Irish border, she stated.Dr Hayward agreed that the Mrs Fosterrsquos argument against any sort of backstop was ldquoperfectly reasonable as it is not ldquothe intended destination. But she still argues that it is of ldquocritical importance.. It is the issue over which the whole Withdrawal Agreement could collapse, leaving all of us in the mire of a lsquoNo Dealrsquo outcome.ldquoIt is therefore very important that all judgements of the backstop are based on a clear and accurate understanding of what it actually means, unclouded by hyperbole.And it is in relation to the backstop where Dr Hayward, who is a Fellow in the Senator George J. Mitchell Institute for Global Peace, Security and Justice, took most issue with Mrs Foster analysis:ldquoFoster claims that Northern Irelandrsquos access to the UK single market would be restricted. In actual fact this is entirely in the hands of the British government ndash it is a domestic issue unrelated to UK-EU negotiations, the Queens Reader asserted, before adding:ldquoSecondly, Foster says that lsquoEU access, comes with the requirement for Northern Ireland to fully adopt and implement EU regulations with no changesrsquo. But it is not necessary to have full regulatory alignment with the EU in order to have tarf free access to its market. That would be like saying wed have to have all our laws imposed by Beijingwe are to get tarf-free access to China.Dr Hayward does however admit that major ergence would require an operational backstop:ldquoThat said,the UK erges widely from the lsquocommon rulebookrsquo of the EUrsquos single market, it would not be possible for goods produced in Northern Ireland to have free movement around the single market as is currently the case. It would be in just such an instance that the backstop could come into play. This would not mean that all EU laws would apply in Northern Ireland but rather that goods produced here could be considered to be of EU standardcertain procedures are followed.In her opinion piece last week Mrs Foster stated that:ldquoFree Trade Agreements donrsquot just cover regulation but tarfs too. This would require not just being in the single market but in the customs union. In other words, a total sea Border descending between Northern Ireland and its largest market, Great Britain.Dr Hayward does not agree however and says ldquothere is absolutely no prospect of a total sea border under any scenario.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

And we have done so against a relentlessly tough market backdrop.”At its most recent trading update, Johnston reported a hit to revenues, mostly due to changes in Google and Facebook algorithms.Mr King said this meant the company had to “re-cut our cloth to match the new reality”.“If this deal is approved, the debt will be reduced, new money will be provided by the new owners, and the business will be in a more stable position,” he added.Future of A Londonderry to Aughnacloy cast into doubt after High Court decision Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"In a statement from the company on Friday, the publisher said “following considerable interest in the formal sales process”, it was decided that none of the offers received delivered sufficient value.“The board has concluded that there is no longer any value in the ordinary shares of the company,” the statement added.Johnston will be de-listed from the London Stock Exchange as part of the process on Monday, Mr King said.He also revealed the  members of the current workforce in the defined benefit pension scheme will see future payments affected by the restructure, in line with pension protection fundpayment rules.Speculation that the publisher might be sold had been growing since it announced the strategic review in March .In August , the company’s share price spiked, surging by as much as % in afternoon trading amid rumours that a mystery buyer was quietly snapping up more stock.Following the announcement Health Secretary Matt Hancock, formerly a culture secretary, tweeted to say the news was “very concerning”.“Makes stark reality of the intense pressure on the press,” he added.Shadow culture secretary and deputy Labour leader, Tom Watson, also tweeted his concern about the “late Friday announcement”, adding that he “will be reaching out to unions and staff over the weekend”.In a second tweet he said: “Johnston Press going into administration is a grim day for local newspapers and another deeply worrying one for local democracy.”Leeds North West Labour MP, Alex Sobel, tweeted to say he was sad that Johnston which owns The Yorkshire Post and the Yorkshire Evening Post was going into administration.“Local papers raising local and regional issues are vital for our democracy,” he added.try catch     .               ..

For us, leaving the European Union without agreement has never been a preferred outcome. We are not a party of no deal however, the deal before us would irreparably damage the economic and constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom. This is a seminal moment for our nation. We respect everyone’s right to examine the prime minister’s draft deal, to interpret it as they see fit and to challenge our views where they feel it appropriate. However, our position on the proposed deal is in line with what we have said in private and in public for many weeks. This should come as no surprise to local representatives of business including agri-food.The draft agreement would establish signicant dferences between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom. In legal terms, Annex  to the Protocol would mean Northern Ireland remaining in EU single market rules for goods, including food standards, while Great Britain is not. Economically it would mean vastly increased checks on food and agriculture products entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain. Practically this creates new barriers for businesses, including supermarkets seeking to fill shelves across our Province. Others can choose to frame it dferently but in our eyes such a solution cannot be described as anything other than a border in the Irish Sea. While this paints a picture of immediate disruption - even when UK and EU rules are aligned - the greater unknown of this plan is how that disruption could evolve and growand when the rules between sides erge. Although this deal may give certainty to trade on day one that certainty is far from guaranteed for months and years down the line. There is no legal guarantee on preventing ergence within the UK internal market during the operation of the backstop. Commitments to ‘best endeavours’ are not enough.Keeping Northern Ireland in the EU’s state aid framework also raises the potential for dferences in support and incentives provided to businesses in dferent parts of the UK. Hospitality Ulster have highlighted fears that the plans could halt Northern Ireland’s campaign for cutting tourism VAT and abolishing air passenger duty. It is also clear that a new Joint Committee would have the power to restrict the maximum level of future support provided to farmers in Northern Ireland. The deal on table fails to deliver the referendum result in every part of the UK. It leaves our Province subject to the rulings of the European Court of Justice. It creates a democratic deficit whereby Northern Ireland would become subservient to EU legislation with zero representation. In real terms, Dublin legislators would have influence over the rules governing us while elected representatives in Belfast or London would have none. This violates the principle of consent. It also extends the role of the devolved institutions and North-South bodies and grants a Joint Committee signicant input into local affairs. This collectively amounts to a breach the Belfast Agreement. The wording of the draft Withdrawal Agreement also ensures that Dublin and Brussels hold an active veto on whether the backstop ceases to apply in Northern Ireland in the future. Both options - the review mechanism or extension to the transition period - fail to allow the UK to unilaterally move away from the arrangements should it wish to do so. This could leave us in an indefinite limbo and make it harder to leave the backstop than to leave the EU itself. The ability to supersede the backstop ‘in whole or in part’ also expresses a danger that Great Britain may be able to leave the backstop but Northern Ireland has to remain. We would be handcuffed to the EU with Brussels holding the keys.That’s not taking back control.We are not alone in our resolve to oppose the risks this deal presents to the Union. Departing cabinet members hold to our view that this agreement would break up the United Kingdom. Labour has described it as ‘a de facto border in Irish Sea’. The parliamentary debate in the coming days should not be framed as a binary choice between a bad deal or a no deal. We believe there is widespread cross-bench support for a deal with the EU - but not this deal. We will not, as some have suggested, step back from our commitments to defend the security of Union and protect the long-term economic interests of Northern Ireland. Ultimately neither can be guaranteed by this deal and for that reason the DUP cannot in good conscience support it.l Ben Lowry, page Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Disclaimer  Privacy  Cookies Policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.newsletter.co.uk/webimage/1.8708176.1542358375!/image/image.jpg","title":"education","story":".... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast Newsletter and agreeing to Johnston Press# Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". s  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+  Education   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business NewsletterRegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News Education Politics Crime Farming Business Transport Environment Health Your Say Opinion Offbeat News Politics Crime Farming Business Transport Environment Health Your Say Opinion Offbeat Sport Football Rugby Union Cricket Golf Motorcycling Boxing More Sport Whats On Music Theatre  Comedy Arts TV  Film Eating Out Lestyle Nostalgia People Family Gadgets  Tech Outdoors Travel Cars Read This           Education      Integrated school to use academic selection for a third of pupilsAn integrated school in Co Down plans to use academic selection to admit more than a third of its pupils next year.

Pic by Victoria Jones PA WireGareth Lee’s complaint of discrimination, backed by the NI Equality Commission, sparked a costly four-and-a-half-year legal battle as Ashers’ owners, the McArthur family, battled to clear their name.The McArthurs, who were supported by The Christian Institute, insisted that they had refused Mr Lee’s order only because the message requested went against their firmly-held Christian beliefs.After losing two previous court challenges in Belfast, last month five Supreme Court judges in London ruled that Ashers had acted lawfully and hadn’t discriminated against Mr Lee on the grounds of his sexuality – a ruling widely hailed as a victory for freedom of conscience.To mark the outcome of the legal battle, The Christian Institute is now planning a series of meetings to “acknowledge the goodness and faithfulness of God throughout the case” and “explain the implications of the ruling for Gospel freedom and freedom of speech.”Simon Calvert from The Christian Institue. Pic by Arthur Allison Pacemaker PressEvents will take place at: The Templeton Hotel, Templepatrick, November , :pm The Lodge Hotel, Coleraine, November , pm The Seagoe Hotel, Portadown, December , pm Corick House Hotel, Clogher, December , :pm and The Iron Hall Evangelical Church, Belfast, December , pm.The events will be led by speakers from The Christian Institute, but it’s understood the McArthurs won’t be attending. “We are delighted to be holding a series of local meetings to allow Christians who have been supporting the McArthur family and praying for them to come together to give thanks to God and hear more about the court ruling and what it means,” Simon Calvert, The Christian Institute’s deputy director for public affairs, told the News Letter.“We were delighted of course with the Supreme Court ruling which strongly underscored our long and proud tradition of free speech for everyone and which vindicated the McArthur family’s quietly courageous stand.”For more information about the events email sandra.mackay@christian.org.ukMan accused of baby rape ‘had extreme porn’ on his phone Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch     .               ..

Looking after the maintenance of it, the operations of it, all the visitors’ services, and the staff and all that side of things.“Anything that happens on the bridge is my responsibility and it’s my job to make sure it gets sorted out.”Trish Johnson making safety checks on the bridge.Born in Belfast, Trish grew up in Banbridge, attended St Mary’s Primary School and then Banbridge Academy where she completed her A Levels before going on to study engineering at the University of Salford, Manchester.After graduating, she says she “sort of fell into” bridge engineering and maintenance – an industry she has remained in for more than  years.Trish, who is better known to family and friends in Northern Ireland as Patricia, has been bridgemaster at Clton for the past two years. But previously she was in charge of maintenance at the Severn Bridge and the Second Severn Crossingand before that looked after bridges and highways across Wiltshire and Avon.She is the first woman to take on the role of bridgemaster at Clton, but says she isn’t tempted to change her title to bridgemistress.An aerial view of the Clton Suspension Bridge, which spans the Avon Gorge and the River Avon.“It is a historic title so it would be unfair to try to change it. I’m happy with bridgemaster, so I wouldn’t want to try to change the course of history!”Trish manages a team of  people including bridge attendants, visitor centre staff, maintenance workers and administration staff, as well as dozens of volunteers who help out with ious projects.“I really enjoy it. It’s fantastic,” she said. “It is a real honour to be looking after such a historic asset. I’ve been in Bristol  or  years now – a long time since I left Northern Ireland – and the bridge has always been a part of my tours when family have been over, so it’s amazing that I’m actually looking after it now.Diane Dodds: NI would be handcuffed to EU with Brussels holding the keys Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“It is a big responsibility. The bridge itself is over  years old. It is one of the icons of Bristol. We get half a million visitors here every year, so it is my responsibility to make sure the bridge is well maintained, safe to use and that it is there for a long time to come.“It is a historic Grade  listed structure and there are not many historic Grade  listed structures that are still used as a transport asset. We still have four million vehicles cross the bridge every year, so it is a working asset as well as a historical and visitor attraction, so there is a lot to the job and it definitely keeps me busy.”The married mum-of-two admits to being slightly obsessed with bridges, and once even booked a weekend trip to Copenhagen just so she could visit the Öresund Bridge which runs between Denmark and Sweden.Her husband Rob, who works in finance, may not share her passion for bridges, but it seems he’s seen more than his fair share over the years.“When we go on holidays he ends up getting trailed round every bridge,” Trish smiled. “He’s getting used to the bridges by now!”Neither of Trish’s children share her love of engineering either. Her daughter Fiona, , works in marketing, while son Thomas, , is studying economics at university.She says she tried to get them into engineering, without success. But she’s adamant that more needs to be done in the UK in general to encourage young people, particularly girls, to get into science, technology, engineering and mathssubjects.“I think the UK has got the lowest percentage of female engineers in Europe and that’s a sad situation. We’ve probably got about % or less female engineers across the UK, so it is really important that we increase the number of women in engineering. “We need to increase the number of people with engineering skills full stop, but we need to tap in to that whole area of getting girls engaged and interested in engineering,” she continued.“Maths was my big thing. I am one of these geeks really. The problem solving side of things is what I really liked, and still do really, and engineering is perfect for that. There is always a problem you’ve got to sort out, and that’s what gets me out of bed in the morning.“I have done it for  years and I have had a whale of a time and really enjoyed it. It’s not just about getting your hands dirty and the mud and concrete and that side of things, there is so much more to it than that and that’s what we have to try to get across to the youngsters of today.”Trish, whose father Tommy Fee is well known in the Banbridge area for having run\u2028 fitness classes at the local college for more than four decades, has made her le in Bristol and says she has no plans at present tohome to Northern Ireland.“I get drawn back every now and then. I go back to see family and friends. But my husband and kids are here so I don’t think I’ll be moving home just yet, but who knows what we’ll do when we retire.”THE FACTS• The Clton Suspension Bridge opened in . It is a private bridge run by a trust.• The  feet long, ,-tonne structure spans the Avon Gorge and River Avon between Clton in Bristol and Leigh Woods in North Somerset.• The deck of the Grade  listed structure sits  feet above the river.• Its designer, Isambard Kingdom Brunel, was just  when he was appointed project engineer. • Brunel died in  – five years before the bridge he described as “my first love” officially opened.• Today the bridge serves as a crossing for more than four million vehicles every year.• Vehicle drivers have to pay a £ toll to cross the bridge, and the money goes towards the upkeep of the historic structure.• Trish Johnson, the first female bridgemaster, took over the role in October .try catch     .               ..

Brexit, of course. I’ve had my fill. Editorial ImageMy brain is tired trying to understand all its nuances. But worse than that, it is distracting me from what is the most important time of the year – Christmas. I have always loved the run-down to Christmas. It’s a time when we begin to think of others, and shop for the loved ones around us. But Brexit has come between me and the festive season making me feel ill towards anyone raising the subject when all I want to be bothered about is what size the turkey should be this year. Politicians  Do we really care tuppence for them just now  Haven’t we seen and heard enough of them spitting venom over the ‘disaster’ ahead  Surely Brexit cannot be more important than the children in Yemen, dying daily in a ghastly war which shows no sign of abating, a war which like the one in Syria could go on for years  In the middle of the Christmas preparations we are faced with many such tragedies. But Brexit is dferent. It’s a war of bickering, a war destined to open up all our political weaknesses, a war which for the Irish and Northern Irish in particular is alarming in its bitterness and the need to settle old scores.Brexit is a drawn out battle we could have done without and I for one never imagined it would put a ‘damper’ on Christmas, a time of year when the charitable gene in us is thinking of other things and people. But politicians have hard hearts. Do they know it’s Christmas and do they care At this time each year we have Children in Need, which the UK as a whole continues to generously support. Going back much further to the s we had Band Aid, an event which really did capture the imagination thanks to the efforts of a pop star Bob Geldof Ben Lowry: Theresa May has ruthlessly but reluctantly felt she had to jettison unionism in Northern IrelandThe defeat of the EU withdrawal deal is the first imperative Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Yet, despite all our efforts children in many parts of the world continue to endure war and famine and what more can we do about it Regularly we put our hands in our purses in response to television and newspaper appeals but still it doesn’t appear to make much of a dference.Charities target us especially in the run-down to Christmas and I have no problem with that. In fact giving to charity is part of Christmas. Appeals are what we expect at this time of the year and people give generously. Our charity shops are full of beautul festive cards and gts to buy and many of us contribute in this way.But Brexit is getting in the way of all the festive spirit which can do so much good for those who need help. The politics of it all has me sapped, fed up, angry and vowing, at one stage, never to vote for a politician ever again. Did we get our fingers bitten back in the s when we signed up for the Common Market  Did we ever think when we signed then that we would end up being bossed around by a cabal of politicians speaking with foreign accents who dare us to withdraw from the ghastly behemoth they created due to our own politicians not reading the fine print or having the brains to see the problems that might arise in our attempt to extricate ourselves.Here I am in the midst of wondering what height my Christmas tree should be, distracted by the possibility that Sinn Fein could well be celebrating that their wildest dream of a united Ireland may be that bit closer come December. My mind is also distracted by the worry that the DUP, their reputation as kingmakers long gone, will be outwitted by the English politicians who really don’t give a toss about us and would gladly see us unhooked and driven into the Irish sea leaving them to become little England again.Soon I will dispatch Himself into the roof space to unearth the Christmas decorations an event I usually celebrate with a glass of my home made sloe gin. But Brexit is well and truly knocking the Christmas spirit out of me. try catch     .               ..

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops.

Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He decided to put together a calendar of his work together to help raise money for the Alzheimers Society, as his father died from the disease in .The -year-old was encouraged to put together the calendar after posting some of his pictures in a local Facebook group.He said: \"I was surprised by the positive response and all the encouraging comments my first set of photos received, said Phil, ldquoWhen I posted another set of photos people started suggesting putting them together in a book or a calendar.\"Mr Lewis said the idea stuck and he asked the group to vote for their favourite photos which would be included in the calendar, before working with local graphic designer Ceri Legg who designed the layout and Beacon Printers, who printed the calendars.Around  calendars were printed altogether which were on sale in shops throughout the town, but have now fully sold out.ldquoI was really worried at first as the number  was suggested to me by the printers, and as soon as I picked them up I start feeling anxious about how exactly I was going to sell  calendars,\" said Mr Lewis.\"I thought that  would have been a more realistic number. I was completely taken aback by the huge response.\"I had people contacting me from all over the world ndash Australia, Spain, Texas, askingI would post calendars to them.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business chats to Danske Bank’s Vicky Davies and Richard Caldwell about the bank’s new Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub and ‘Making more possible’ for Northern Ireland businesses When you are already leading the technology and digital race in Northern Ireland banking, where do you go from there  For Danske Bank, its sights were set on something hugely ambitious, and something philanthropic which it believes can help cultivate, boost and grow the next generation of technology and fintech business start-ups in Northern Ireland. Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub, run in partnership with Catalyst Inc, is a stunning, modern incubator and hub which will see dozens of entrepreneurs and start-up businesses shape and craft their ideas in the heart of Danske Bank’s own Belfast city centre headquarters. The partnership with Catalyst Inc makes a lot of sense, as it already plays host to dozens of knowledge-based businesses across  acres in the Titanic Quarter, and the Innovation Centre in Londonderry. Vicky Davies is managing director of strategy and corporate development at Danske Bank. “We have a clear ambition to be the best bank in Northern Ireland, and we plan to do that by making more possible for our customers, employees, stakeholders and society”, she says. It’s that message, ‘Making more possible’, that adorns the wall of one of the main meeting rooms in the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub. “Banking is changing so fast. It’s relentless in terms of new entrants, innovation and the level of new fintech money coming into the industry.” “We know we need to change at pace, or face being left behind.” “We needed a partner in this venture, and we were looking for someone with reach and expertise,” she said. Following an initial meeting last year with senior management at Catalyst Inc, Vicky says there was an immediate mutual connection, and they went from there. “They have the expertise in running a space like this, and we have access to banking and business expertise – with both of us having great experience in helping businesses to grow. So, every dimension we looked at – it was a really good fit.” The hub is an impressive space, awash with splashes of colour, connectivity, co-working spaces and meeting rooms – including a nod to Princess Leia with an image on a wall – and it is able to play host to around - entrepreneurs and business start-up professionals, with top end cable and fibre internet connections. It’s further evidence of Danske Bank ensuring it’s well ahead of the pack and out in front. It’s about bringing a business from an embryonic start-up, to a thriving company, helping lead the way in its sector. But for Danske, this isn’t all about the bottom line. It’s about creating a thriving hub for the future stars of Northern Ireland’s burgeoning tech sector. And it’s a two-way street – with the bank aiming to learn as much from the start-up businesses nestled in the top-end spacious ground-floor hub, as the other way around. So, what does this mean for Danske Bank in terms of business banking and as an institution further bolstering its credentials in the digital space. Richard Caldwell is managing director of personal banking and small business. “We want to be part of the local fintech journey. We want to help influence and develop ideas,” he says. “There are more than , businesses in Northern Ireland, and we want to continue to support start-ups in general – by putting expertise and support into this partnership, we will help this particular set of small businesses to grow in what is a burgeoning sector.” “Ultimately, real success for us would be seeing products brought to market, and helping businesses grow from an embryonic idea, through to start-up, growth and expansion. With the business maybe ending up as one of our loyal corporate customers in the future.” Richard says research showed that many of Danske Bank’s existing bigger business customers wanted the bank to provide “something more tangible” for start-ups, to grow companies for the future. Although tenants in the new fintech space don’t necessarily have to bank with Danske, the Bank does offer banking support, including everything from a current account, to receiving assistance from a growth adviser to support them with their banking needs. gt “This is a major investment for us,” Richard says. “This is one of the most expensive ground-floor retail premises in Belfast, and we have devoted it to this hub. This is front and centre in the heart of Belfast.” The location of the new hub couldn’t be better – with the new Glider bus linking the hub to Catalyst Inc headquarters in Titanic Quarter. And, as modern tech businesses evolve and reach out to new markets and time zones across the globe, there is also  hour access to the Fintech Hub. The hub has a team of four, two from Danske Bank and two newly recruited by Catalyst Inc. Together Danske Bank and Catalyst Inc have also launched a new online  to help the wider growing number of start-up businesses across Northern Ireland to connect with investors, peers and potential new recruits across Europe - thehub.io helps connect start-ups to relevant resources, such as talent, networks, financing, tools and advice from experts which will help them overcome some of the challenges of scaling up. It is clear that strategically this is a big push by both organisations to play a key supporting role through the provision of both physical and online resources. Digitalisation Richard is keen to point out support for the hubs is just part of a bank-wide digital transformation agenda at Danske. “For example, we want to change the nature of traditional relationship management at the Bank. In addition to managing traditional banking needs as we have always done so well, we are now moving into the added value space. As well as the human touch, customers increasingly want top notch digital solutions to make their lives easier, to give them ease of access and quicker credit decisions.” The digitally-savvy way of thinking is giving Danske Bank competitive advantage, and that is from an already well-established position in the market. Last year they appointed a chief digital officer, who is a member of the Bank’s executive committee. “Our people are still our best asset and will remain so,” Richard said. “We have great people. And customers still highly value that human touch and expert advice. But what the journey looks like for transactions, well we have digital solutions for everything. For your payments, wages, drawing direct debits or paying suppliers. “Right now we are piloting and rolling out digital credit decisions for business customers. This is transforming the credit journey for both our customers and our business relationship managers. For example, one customer recently applied for an overdraft through the digital credit solution and got approval and the funds in their account in  minutes.” Danske Bank was the first of the local Northern Ireland banks to bring in app banking, and solutions such as Samsung Pay, Fitbit Pay and Garmin Pay. And this new Fintech Hub is very much another stride forward. The bank is also leading the pack when it comes to customer satisfaction, right across businesses of all shapes and sizes. “For some time now we have been the market leader in business banking. Research continues to show that our customer satisfaction scores are first for large business, and first for small business,” Richard said. Both Vicky and Richard are keen to see what they predict will be short and long-term benefits from the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub. There’s an organic osmosis, allowing ideas to flow freely between the Danske Bank people visiting from upstairs and those entrepreneurs which it hosts on the ground floor. “The entrepreneurs in the hub bring a fresh mindset, one we can learn from as we continue our own digital journey throughout the bank,” Vicky says. Richard added: “The fintech sector is seen in many quarters as a challenger to traditional banks, but we are embracing it and feel we can grow with it, to the benefit of our customers.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Stud-1.jpg","title":"plans to build  new homes in co antrim","story":"Posted on Wednesday  November  by John Mulgrew Around , new homes could be built in Co Antrim in one of the largest developments to take place here in the last few years, it can be revealed. Plans have now been submitted to construct the homes close to Sprucefield, outside Lisburn. It would also involve a new link road on the M motorway. An initial pre-application notice was issued for the scheme last year, but now the developer behind the scheme – Neptune Carleton – has submitted an outline planning application for the ambitious project. If the plans, which could include , homes on the large site at Blaris, get the go-ahead, it would be one of the largest residential property developments to be built in Northern Ireland in recent years. Elsewhere, this week a major £m housing development in Larne was awarded outline planning permission. Nuport Developments has been given the early go-ahead for  houses on the -acre site at Ballyboley in the town.

Since Wednesday evening, several cabinet members have resigned, opposed to what they see is a softening of Theresa May’s position on leaving the EU. Essentially, for Northern Ireland’s business community in particular, it would remain part of the same customs territory as the rest of the UK and the entire area would be subject to \"level playing field\" commitments requiring the UK to follow EU rules in areas like animal welfare, environmental and workplace protections. Northern Ireland would be in a deeper customs relationship with the EU than where in the UK, and more closely tied to EU market rules. But what do Northern Ireland business groups think   Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium “While it will take some time to go through the  plus pages of the agreement, on the face of it this document provides some reassurance to our industry and the NI consumer. “It provides solutions to customs, tarfs, an innovative solution on VAT, support for the Peace Process and a possible longer transition period. There certainly is some work to be done by both the Westminster Government and  the EU on the checks and administration for goods coming in to Northern Ireland from GB. “That will need to be light touch and be mitigated in further agreements, hopefully to an absolute bare minimum. However this agreement must pass through Parliament. We have always said the backstop is better than no deal.”   Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI director-general “After  months of debate, this agreement by Cabinet is progress. It moves the UK one step away from the nightmare precipice of no deal and the harm it would cause to communities across the country. Securing a transition period has long been firms’ top priority and every day that passes without one means lost investment and jobs, hitting the most vulnerable hardest. “Time is now up. This deal is a compromise, including for business, but it offers that essential transitional period as a step back from the clf-edge. \"More clarity on the final relationship is needed, and uncertainty remains high, but this is an important step forward. “Transition and the backstop are not the intended permanent solutions for either side, but should pave the way for more work on the future deal. This must secure frictionless trade, ambitious access for our world-beating services, and a say over future rules. “The UK has had many months of discussion and ision. A long journey still lies ahead but now is the time for decisions. And the first decision is to avoid no deal.”  Retail NI chief executive, Glyn Roberts and Hospitality Ulster, Colin Neill  “This is a complex and detailed document which needs considerable analysis and further clarication from the UK Government. “We will be consulting our respective memberships on this document and we will set out in greater detail our views when we have completed this process. “Both our organisations have always sought a deal that ensures no delays in the supply chain, which promotes bridges rather than borders and above all , ensures that Northern Ireland businesses have full and free access to the EU and UK single markets. “Retail and Hospitality are two of Northern Ireland’s leading sectors of industry and our voice needs to be heard as this draft deal moves toward a vote in the House of Commons”  Michael Hall, managing partner, EY Northern Ireland “Business will clearly welcome last night’s announcement in that there is now better clarity on the terms of a deal however many will also be reluctant to put contingency plans on hold until there is a stronger signal on whether this will hold politically in the UK and Europe. “The backstop guarantee is a positive development for NI firms operating on an all-island basis, not least the restatement that both sides intend to work towards a free trade agreement longer term, which should not be overlooked. “The scale of political uncertainty and the volatility which this creates can be seen in the signicant currency fluctuations we have witnessed in the past  hours. Firms should not take this lightly and as such, factor these continued unknowns into their scenario planning. “On the positive side, Northern Ireland businesses have continued to expand and employ more people in the period since the Brexit referendum, which we remain hopeful they will continue to do as we look towards a further period of uncertainty. “By focusing on business fundamentals and contingency planning, firms will arm themselves so that they are ready to act when the road ahead becomes clearer.”  FSB NI policy chairman, Tina McKenzie “Businesses have been calling for months for agreement to be reached between the UK and EU negotiators, so it can only be welcome that a text has been agreed and approved by the Cabinet. “We are acutely aware of the political machinations which are ongoing, however it must be remembered that without an agreed withdrawal agreement, the UK will crash out in March , without a transition period, nor agreement on citizens’ rights, nor any plan to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. “While the exact nature of the backstop is being robustly debated, it must be remembered that the backstop will only take effectthe future relationship fails to deliver a frictionless border, after December . “We believe that the Withdrawal Agreement is a signicant step back from the clf edge which would result in a chaotic no deal Brexit that would be deeply damaging and dangerous for our small firms. “We would encourage all political actors to keep this in mind as we move forward.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
