I’d love to shoot him again – he’s got some really good tats these days’I was lucky that my friends had just had a baby, Spencer, and they trusted me with him. The band weren’t on anyone’s radar at that point, so the shoot was really small-scale – there was no art director, no manager or account executive looking over your shoulder.I think I got $1,000 to shoot it – that was for everything, including the gear and the cost of another rescue er. I had a snorkel and an underwater camera on a tripod. First, we trained on a doll. Then we took the little guy, blew a little air into his face and eased him into the water. Dad gave him a small shove, he drifted by the camera – bang, bang, bang, bang, bang – I shot off five frames. Mum pulls him out, he’s cool, so we go again. Put him in – bang, bang, bang, bang, bang – he starts to cry, “OK, we’re done!” We ended up with about 25 frames. It took an hour to set up and five minutes to do.I knew I had the shot. That’s the thing about old-school photography – as a pro, you have to know that you’ve got it before you leave. But when I looked at it more closely I had some doubts. I thought, “Man, it’s such a dick shot!” His unit was so prominent in the picture … he’s a well hung kid for a four-month old, you know? I didn’t know if the label would go for it. So I went to a kids’ swim school and got half a dozen other babies in the water. This one girl was 10 months old, she could really motor, so I shot her from the side. But the label loved the original shot of Spencer and went with that.A guy in New York shot the dollar bill. I wish that I’d done that part, too. It would have been easy, but I didn’t care at the time. I’m just glad I didn’t have to capture it all in one shot. It’s one thing to drown the kid, but another to stick him on a fishhook!I’m still in contact with Spencer. I used to think, “Man, when that kid is 16 he’s gonna hate my guts!” He doesn’t, but he’s conflicted about the picture. He feels that everybody made money off it and he didn’t. I think he deserves something. But it’s always the record labels that make the money.When Spencer was 10, I recreated the image with him for Rolling Stone. He’s done it a few times since with another shooter, which I don’t like! But we’ve got a good relationship, and I’m still tight with his parents. I still notice new things in the picture. Recently, I realised that you can see a handprint on Spencer’s chest. If you look closely – that’s his dad’s handprint!For a while after that shot I was the golden child. People were like, ‘Hey, everything we do should be underwater!’ But the work was sporadic, and it’s a tough medium to work in. The model can’t see or hear you, it’s hard to direct, everything is super slow, it’s like having your feet in mud.I even ended up shooting the band underwater a few months after this shot. That was a hairy job. Looking back, I could have done things differently. I thought 10am would be a nice time of day for them, but of course if you’re in a band it’s not – they were pissed off when they turned up. It was a rare cold, grey day in California, and there were problems with the pool so that was cold, too. The band hadn’t been told about it, so they were, like, “We’ve got to get in the water?” And then the label didn’t like the shots – they wanted something slicker. They said: “We don’t like Kurt Cobain’s hair!” I thought, man, there ain’t nothing I can do about his hair! But those images are really popular now.Of course, if I’d shot this for some band that never went anywhere we wouldn’t be talking about it now – it’d just be a cool picture in a filing cabinet. It’s a big deal to a lot of people, but not to me. I’m proud of how it turned out, but I don’t sit around looking at it. Having said that, I’m going to recreate the image again this summer. I want to shoot a girl ing into a pool, going after a cellphone – because every teenage girl I ever see now is on their phone. I’d also like to shoot Spencer again, but with him totally naked like in the original. He’s 27 now, and has some really good tats these days. Maybe I should call him up.Born: “USA, 1959.

With fans including Oprah Winfrey and Barack Obama, the novel follows ambitious newlyweds Celestial and Roy. “We’re not your garden-variety bourgeois Atlanta Negroes where the husband goes to bed with his laptop under his pillow and the wife dreams about her blue-box jewelry. I was young, hungry and on the come-up. Celestial was an artist, intense and gorgeous,” it begins.Their lives together are just beginning when Roy is sentenced to 12 years in jail for a rape he hasn’t committed. Celestial believes in his innocence, but finds herself taking comfort in her childhood friend Andre until five years later, Roy’s conviction is overturned and he returns home.The novel won from a six-book shortlist that included last year’s Booker winner, Anna Burns’s Milkman, and former Booker winner Pat Barker’s new novel, The Silence of the Girls. Williams said judges deliberated for four hours to make the tough decision.“It’s an incredible examination of America and American life, focusing on the intimacy of a marriage but on a huge political canvas,” she said. “The prose is luminous, striking and utterly moving. How hard it is even when you’re on the outside and are free, how you’re not really free when you have someone in prison.”Jones said: “I am thrilled and honoured. I wasn’t expecting to win. The shortlist was so strong and I was honoured to be among them but I had no idea whether I would win. I didn’t write a speech!”Incarceration is the “boogeyman of black America,” she added. “I decided to look under the bed and tackle it head on.”With her win coinciding with Donald Trump’s trip to the UK, Jones said she had no desire for the president to read her novel.“I’m delighted that Obama read my book and I’m delighted that I had a president in my time that read books and recommended them, who cared about the past and history, who used it to guide us to the future. I have no real hope or desire that the current occupant of the White House will read my book.”The whole shortlist was timely, added Williams, from Barker’s retelling of the Iliad from the perspective of a princess who is made a slave to Achilles, to Madeleine Miller’s twist on Homer’s witch, Circe. An American Marriage also has links to Greek myth Jones told the  that every novel she has written “harks back to the Greeks”, with Celestial being a twist on Penelope, the faithful wife who waits for years for Odysseus – “only modern, independent and famous for her art”.Williams said: “All the shortlisted novels speak clearly about the lives of women in different ways, about oppression and identity and trying to be free in a regime that doesn’t want you to be.”Jones, a novelist and a creative writing professor who lives in Brooklyn, has spoken of finding inspiration in an argument she overheard while she was doing research at Harvard into mass incarceration.“The woman, who was splendidly dressed, and the man – he looked OK. But she looked great! And she said to him, ‘You know you wouldn’t have waited on me for seven years.’ And he shot back, ‘This shit wouldn’t have happened to you in the first place’,” Jones told the Paris Review last year. “And I was like, ‘You know, I don’t know him, but I know she’s probably right. I doubt very seriously that he would wait on her for seven years, and he is probably right that this wouldn’t have happened to her … I was intrigued by them, and so I integrated this very personal conflict with the research I had done.”Williams expressed the hope that – with Obama’s successor currently in the UK – that An American Marriage might find another presidential reader. “It’s very timely given we have the president of America in this country at present. Let’s hope he and the first lady read the book,” she said.The Women’s prize is the UK’s only book award for fiction by women. Running for 24 years, it has been won by writers including Zadie Smith and Lionel Shriver."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b46a2cd282e6e116d1109f026f96557ef74ffbd/0_63_2742_1645/master/2742.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b2d6c0f7842940408e7fb5aba48633c2","title":"dressed shahida bari pocket barbara burman ariane fennetaux review","story":"Bari’s is a personal, subtle exploration of how clothes make us feel Barbara Burman and Ariane Fennetaux uncover the history of old-fashioned pockets“Mistrust all enterprises that require new clothes,” says EM Forster in A Room With a View, adapting a quote from Henry David Thoreau. What a spoilsport. Because surely one of the best bits about starting a new job, getting a dog or even taking up sky-ing is that it gives you permission to fashion yourself in a slightly different way. With the acquisition of new and unusual kit comes the chance to become someone fresher, sexier or, at the very least, someone who is prepared to give yellow a go.The reason we are so desperate to buy or borrow new clothes, says the academic and broadcaster Shahidha Bari in her clever, subtle book, is because they appear to bestow on us a charm and intellect that we can’t quite muster for ourselves. Yet the moment we acquire that new coat or those new trousers, we realise that nothing much has changed at all. For no matter how fancy we look on the surface, underneath we still come with metaphorical trailing threads and odd socks. “Dressing is so hard,” Bari writes. “It is astonishing that we ever find the courage to keep trying as we do every day.”Although her writing is critically informed – Foucault, Deleuze, Cixous and Irigaray all rock up here to chat about schmutter – her tone is insistently personal, intimate even. Between her main chapters she drops in lyrical accounts of her own encounters with specific items of clothing. She tells us about mending a dress for a college friend who has since died, or the first time she wore spiked shoes as a schoolgirl and found herself running like the wind. Other passages are determinedly oblique, as when she buys little girls’ dresses the colour of buttercream yet makes no mention of who they are for. Her future children, her past self? The withholding is deliberate since Bari wants us to think not so much about what clothes say as how they make us feel. Take the suit. The one that she has in mind is worn by Cary Grant in North by Northwest (1959). According to a panel of fashion journalists and stylists convened by GQ in 2006, this suit is “the best in film history and the most influential on men’s style”. Designed by Grant’s Savile Row tailor, Kilgour, French and Stanley, it is neither exactly blue nor grey, and combines a ventless jacket with high-waisted, forward pleated trousers. It is a suit (or suits – during the five month shoot Grant got through eight replicas, since hanging from Mount Rushmore by your fingertips involves a certain wear and tear) that is simultaneously authoritative and insouciant.She is good on dresses too. By rights, of course, they have no business being in any modern woman’s wardrobe. Nearly a hundred years after it became acceptable for “advanced” females to wear “ided skirts” on the tennis court, why would anyone voluntarily shimmy themselves into a garment designed to cling to one’s body while simultaneously restricting its movement (cycling in a dress today still feels like a risky business)? Bari is particularly good on how a dress looks while on a hanger – like a second skin waiting for flesh and blood to make it live. It is this sense of the dress as an alternative self that makes it so potent, far more charged, say, than a well-cut pair of trousers or a merino jumper: “This dress – not a poem, not a painting but a dress – is something, maybe even all things, that we are not.” Which is why it is the item most likely to be languishing, unworn, at the back of the wardrobe, waiting for the moment when we feel good enough – thin enough, feminine enough, just enough enough – to put it on and step out as someone improved and approved.Dresses aren’t always about lack or reproach. In a particularly luscious section, Bari shows us women having fun with frocks. In a 16th-century Dutch tapestry, now in the V\u0026ampA, the figures of the three female Fates are stitched in the most gorgeous red, blue and gold thread. Each fold of their plush skirts seems to promise extra supplies of dense and complex satisfaction. Nothing odd about this you might think – global art is flush with gorgeously dressed girls flaunting their access to fabric. But the point here is that Clotho, Lachesis and Atropos are usually rendered as badly dressed old crones, responsible for producing the threads that other, luckier, people wear. They are the original “spinsters”, a jibe that has historically disclosed anxiety around unmarried women and their economic and sexual self-sufficiency. Here, though, the three Fates are in their best dresses and seem to be enjoying every moment of it. It takes a while to notice that at their feet, quite unregarded, lies another woman. Bari tells us that this drably clothed figure is Chastity, and that the three gorgeously attired Fates appear to have trampled her into the ground.In her final chapter Bari includes a short section of the role of the pocket in the psychology of getting dressed. Barbara Burman and Ariane Fennetaux have written a whole book on the subject. Their pockets, though, are not the modern kind, sewn into the seams of ready-made clothes. Rather, they are the soft, detachable pouches that women used to tie around their waists and hide under their skirts, reaching for them through discreet openings in their petticoats and dresses as required. What particularly interests Burman and Fennetaux is the way in which women of all classes have historically used these tie-on pockets as a supplementary body part to help them negotiate their way through a world that was not built to suit them.Crammed into a woman’s pocket was everything she might need to keep her going for the day, from a snack to a tract from the New Testament. It was also a way of carrying precious cargo safely. Some of the strangest things the authors came across that were stowed away in pockets include two live ducks, the afterbirth of an illegitimate baby and a pocket microscope. Tradeswomen of all sorts, from pedlars to prostitutes, were most likely to stuff theirs with bank notes, which is why when Lucy Locket lost her pocket it was worth a surprised posterity noting that “there was not a penny in it”.Pockets were precious. Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire, ordered hers to be made of finest silk. Middle-class girls effortfully cross-stitched theirs, turning the whole experience into a lesson in precision and patience. Working-class women, meanwhile, patched and darned their pockets relentlessly with sturdy fabric saved from somewhere else in the household’s material economy.The proximity of pockets to the pelvic area inevitably gave them a seamy side – hence the extra layer of salacious meaning in the Lucy Locket nursery rhyme. However, there were some pitiable consequences too. Burman and Fennetaux tell the story of Annie Chapman, one of the women killed by Jack the Ripper in the autumn of 1888. As a semi-itinerant worker, scrabbling a difficult living, Chapman’s pocket was her most valuable possession. The fact that she was still using a tie-on pocket, rather than a new fangled handbag, is testimony to the fact that for vulnerable women living in precarious circumstances, this was still the best way of holding on to your worldly goods.In the early hours of 8 September, Chapman’s mutilated body was found slumped in a yard. Particularly chilling was the fact that her pocket had also been “torn down the front and also at the side” by the murderer, who clearly saw it as a proxy for the woman’s sexual parts. Out of this ritually disembowelled pocket spilled Chapman’s best treasures: an envelope, pills, a small comb and a piece of coarse muslin that she had been hoping to pawn or sell.• Dressed is published by Jonathan Cape (£25).

Or was it Katharine Hepburn?Electric Ladyland wasn’t the only thing Jimi Hendrix released in 1968. One day in that tumultuous year he left his flat on Brook Street, Mayfair, and strolled down nearby Carnaby Street with a birdcage in his hands. I like to think that he was dressed in a tasselled jacket and flares, his favourite Fender Stratocaster slung across his back. Or perhaps he travelled incognito, in a trenchcoat and dark glasses. Either way, somewhere on that street, the heart of Swinging London at the height of peace and love, he opened the door of the cage and unleashed two bright green birds: Adam and Eve, a breeding pair of ring-necked parakeets.As they vanished, a flash of tropical colour against the grey sky, passersby merely shrugged: just more hippy weirdness. Was it a psychedelic stunt? A symbolic gesture of freedom? The result of a week-long drugs bacchanal? No one really knows. What we do know is that this incident is the indisputable origin of London’s population of feral parakeets, which now number in the tens of thousands and have spread from Hounslow to Haringey, Croydon to Crouch End.Unless that story is not true, and actually London’s parakeets arrived in 1951 with Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn. The Hollywood stars were in town filming The African Queen at Isleworth Studios (or Shepperton Studios, depending on who you ask). A romantic adventure set in the equatorial swamps of east Africa, the film required exotic extras, so a flock of ring-necked parakeets was unwisely brought on set. Whether these resourceful birds escaped before, during or after filming has not been definitively established – they certainly don’t appear in the film, which I have watched frame by frame – but what lies beyond all reasonable doubt is that these cinematic escapees were the progenitors of today’s population.Unless, of course, that is fake news, and the parakeets owe their current success to George Michael in the 1990s. Either burglars broke into the singer’s Hampstead townhouse and wrecked his secret aviary – he never reported the crime, presumably wary of police involvement – or they escaped during a drunken argument involving Michael and Boy George in a flat they are rumoured to have shared in Brockley.Unless they made their bid for freedom during the Great Storm of 1987.Unless they escaped from the livestock transportation area in Heathrow airport.Unless they fled Henry VIII’s menagerie at Hampton Court Palace in the mid-16th century and somehow remained hidden for the next 400 years.If you ask random Londoners how parakeets came to thrive in their city – streaking in squadron-like formations through parks, down roads and along canals, following regular “flyways” as punctually as business commuters – the chances are that one of these theories will be told as fact. No one is ever sure where they heard it. They are classic urban myths, spreading through word of mouth, mutating and evolving a little with every teller. Whatever the truth, or lack of it, these stories are a sign that London’s parakeets, in their short time among us, have become deeply lodged in the city’s collective imagination.Sadly, there is a more prosaic explanation. Small, charismatic and brilliantly coloured – though voiced with a horrendous squawk – parakeets have been popular as pets for hundreds of years. We have no idea how many arrived in Britain through London’s busy docks, or how many seized the first opportunity to escape, but dozens or hundreds of iniduals must have gained freedom over the years, flocking together for protection and enthusiastically breeding.Their success was limited at first. The earliest recorded sightings were in Dulwich in 1893 and Brixton in 1894. A breeding pair were reported in Epping Forest in 1930. It wasn’t until the late 20th century that the first large colony was established, roosting noisily in the trees by the river at Kingston-upon-Thames, where they became such a local feature that many people still know the birds as “Kingston parakeets”. For decades they were an exotic novelty, exclusive to south-west London.Then, perhaps 10 years ago, began the great green expansion.First they spread into Richmond and Kew. Then they crossed the Thames. They established themselves in Kensington Gardens, Hyde Park and Regent’s Park, and moved north into Highgate and Hampstead Heath, west into Holland Park and Notting Hill, and east along the Regent’s Canal into Hackney and Walthamstow Marshes. Almost overnight they appeared in places they’d never been in before, and quickly became almost as ubiquitous as pigeons. In the space of a few short years they spread to every borough and even beyond the M25, following in the path of generations of upwardly mobile Londoners by departing the grimy inner city for the Home Counties.Amazingly, this mass colonisation – an audacious ecological shift – went largely unremarked upon until very recently. Despite the parakeets’ colour, numbers and noise, no one (apart from the urban mythologists and boozy anecdotists in pubs) seemed to consider it worthy of attention.They don’t have a problem with the climate. Although people commonly assume parakeets are tropical birds – at home, say, in the sweltering jungles portrayed in The African Queen – their south Asian native range extends into the foothills of the Himalayas, so they are unperturbed by mild English winters. As temperatures rise year-on-year they will probably fare even better: not so much climate refugees as climate beneficiaries.What does this population boom mean for native British birds? Do the parakeets spell disaster for indigenous species? Are they wreaking ecological havoc? Their detractors condemn them as illegal immigrants, invaders aggressively driving out the local population, and the tabloids periodically clamour for a cull. The government has quietly ruled this out as “no longer cost-effective or viable”, concluding that there are simply too many of the birds. In other words, they are here to stay. Their defenders admire their beauty and celebrate their ersity, holding them up as paragons of successful integration. As with the myths surrounding them, often the facts become secondary to what people want to believe. Parakeets are blank canvases on to which Londoners project their own prejudices, values, beliefs, hopes and fears. They have been weaponised.The general consensus from experts, as always, is a lot more nuanced. Rather than making dire predictions of avian apocalypse, most ecologists agree it is too early to tell. There is some concern that parakeets – smart, fast and sociable – can outmanoeuvre garden birds in the feeding frenzy at bird tables, and their choice of nesting sites brings them into competition with nuthatches and other “secondary cavity nesters” that inhabit old woodpecker holes. But so far there seems to be more than enough food and foliage to go around. In terms of the threats facing native British birdlife, the greatest peril comes not from parakeets, but from native British people.In an age of climate emergency, with mass extinction ripping apart the fabric of the living world, when the dominant narrative of our times is one of loss and disappearance, collapse and diminishment, parakeets tell a different story. These plucky newcomers beat the odds, not only surviving but thriving. In a nature-depleted culture, when city dwellers are supposedly alienated from the environment and anything that is feral or wild, parakeets are the subject of outlandish speculation, the source of mystery, imagination and everyday wonder. They are a reminder to look up. To keep paying attention.In the simplest terms, it’s hard not to find that uplifting.The Parakeeting of London: An Adventure in Gonzo Ornithology, by Nick Hunt and Tim Mitchell, is published by Paradise RoadFollow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f677dc629c88602d27ee43319f2a3d5ae0e0af70/0_106_3543_2125/master/3543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f89a4a633c5262563c6f919734394d7","title":"what lies behind the facades of london in pictures","story":"Photographer and trained architect Francisco Ibáñez Hantke sees cities as a spectacle of constant conflict, negotiation and flux.

With access to contraception and abortion under threat, men must do their partA woman who doesn’t want to get pregnant can take a pill, or wear a patch or insert a hormone-filled ring into her vagina. She can have hormone-secreting implants inserted into her arm or her uterus, or she can have a copper IUD inserted, which prevents pregnancy without hormones. She can get a shot. She can place a spermicide-soaked sponge next to her cervix prior to sex, or she can have herself fitted for a diaphragm or cervical cap that acts the same way. If all else fails, she can use the morning-after pill, Plan B. If she never, ever wants children, she can undergo major, irreversible surgery to get her tubes tied.She does all of these herself, booking the doctor’s appointment (none of these birth control methods are available over the counter, with the exception of Plan B), and paying out of pocket for the appointment or using her insurance benefits, if she has them. The site of the birth control is on her body, and she alone will experience the side effects, which in the case of hormonal methods can be numerous and severe. She can’t get pregnant alone – for that, she needs a male partner – but she prevents pregnancy alone. Birth control is perceived to be her responsibility, not his.That birth control is largely a female responsibility and a female burden isn’t usually thought of as a bad thing. In fact, a primary virtue of many of the female birth control methods available is that they are woman-controlled, and do not require much in the way of male participation, male acquiescence or even male knowledge in order to be effectively used. Women who think that their male partners will object to their use of birth control or attempt to stop it can use some methods secretly. Women who think that their male partners will find birth control cumbersome to use or diminishing of their sexual pleasure can simply take care of it themselves, without his needing to be bothered. Every other woman can simply use birth control to control her own life and her own destiny.That the costs, side effects and responsibility are all the woman’s, and the woman’s alone, seems to many like a comparatively small injustice, compared with what birth control – which has only been considered a constitutional right by the US supreme court since 1965 – offers to women in terms of freedom, opportunity and self-determination. Sure, the setup is still unfair, but it is exponentially better than what our grandmothers had to endure.But the freedom for women to use birth control on their own terms may not be guaranteed for long. Abortion opponents have taken aim at Roe by building a legal argument that fertilized eggs should be treated as persons, and they have long claimed that many forms of birth control, such as IUDs and the morning-after pill, are abortifacients and should be outlawed (these contraceptives do not cause abortion). They now have a majority of sympathizers on the Republican-controlled supreme court.In a weird and unwieldy opinion in a recent case involving an Indiana abortion law, Justice Clarence Thomas (of pube on the Coke can fame) mentioned contraception 36 times, even though contraception was not at issue in the case at hand. His colleague John Roberts has referred to the right to privacy, on which the constitutional rights to contraception and abortion are based, as a “so-called right” not to be found in the constitution. The court has already held that employers cannot be compelled to provide contraception coverage to their employees.More broadly, the Trump administration has rolled out a robust anti-contraception agenda in its first term. The administration imposed a domestic gag rule to prevent federal Title X family planning funds from going to groups that provide or reference abortion, and a global gag rule that imposes the same restriction on family planning money spent overseas. It changed a federal program meant to prevent teen pregnancies from a comprehensive sex education method to an abstinence curriculum, and rolled back the Affordable Care Act’s contraception coverage mandate. And its officials have publicly stated that women should be taught “sexual refusal skills” rather than being provided with contraception and abortion access. Meanwhile, states are already criminalizing and jailing women for their pregnancy outcomes, and some are beginning to pass laws that would criminalize abortion.Contraception access, like abortion access, is imperiled. In this new reality, men’s continued indifference and uninvolvement in birth control is no longer merely unfair. It is morally unacceptable. Women have always faced risks from pregnancy: risks to their careers and livelihoods, risks to their education and their potential, risks to their bodies, their health and their lives. Now, misogynists, conservatives and their allies in government are moving to remove access to the tools women use to mitigate these risks, and to potentially criminalize those who do not comply. It is time for men to step up and take pregnancy prevention into their own hands.Many men are willing to participate in contraception, at least in theory, but their tools to do so are unacceptably narrow and limited, and they are generally not willing to undergo inconvenience in order to use them. They can use condoms, a cheap, effective and easy solution with no negative health repercussions. Condoms have the added benefit of helping to protect against sexually transmitted infections. But many men, somewhat selfishly, complain that condoms diminish their pleasure slightly, and so they do not want to use them (that the comparative risk to a woman matters more than the minor diminishment of these men’s pleasure does not seem to occur to these men).Of course, men seeking a longer-term birth control solution can get vasectomies, a minimally invasive and often reversible procedure that renders them unable to impregnate a woman and does not have adverse side effects. But men don’t like this either. They are afraid of the post-procedure pain, which feels like “they got kicked in the boys for a day or two, on and off,” according to the University of Utah urologist Alex Pasturzak, and they sometimes falsely believe that the procedure will inhibit their bodies’ ability to create and absorb testosterone, rendering them effeminate.Then there is the matter of men’s hormonal birth control, the fabled “male pill”. The male pill has long been a dream of feminists who want to redistribute responsibility for pregnancy prevention so that women do not have to carry the burden alone. But the prospects are bleak. Early trials of male hormonal birth control, usually in the form of injections, have shown that drugs are effective in preventing pregnancy, but pharmaceutical companies show little interest in developing or marketing them. But another obstacle is the unwillingness of men to endure the drug’s side effects, and of the medical establishment to permit a drug with side effects similar to those of women’s birth control from being given to men.It’s time for men to step up, and to take on the responsibility for birth control that they have historically left to their women partners – discomfort, inconvenience, expense, and side-effects included. Women’s rights, including the right to legal abortion and contraception, are under attack, and these attacks are going to steadily make women’s birth control more expensive, less easy to access, and potentially illegal. But we all know that men’s right to control their own lives and their own bodies will never be infringed this way. Men will remain free while women are made less free. It is time for men to use that freedom to help women, and take responsibility for pregnancy prevention."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51ea6fb4dcd17ec58403543d9f161ad3c8127c4b/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f515c616fc9790fa35e099d09d80d44","title":"corbyn labour leavers remainers second referendum eu","story":"In his essay on the 1951 Festival of Britain, Michael Frayn drew a contrast between the carnivores and the herbivores. Carnivores were the better off: those who looked after themselves even if it meant preying on the weak. The herbivores were the gentle ruminants of the middle classes, guilty about their advantages and with eyes full of sorrow for the less fortunate.Although founded to give a political voice to the industrial working class, the Labour party has always had its herbivore wing, and when enough white-collar workers and intellectuals have lined up alongside the party’s blue-collar contingent it has proved a winning formula. Labour’s big election victories – 1945, 1966, 1997 – were all examples of successful coalition-building.But the marriage, never entirely comfortable, has come under increasing strain in recent years and looks like breaking down irrevocably over Brexit. The partners have not really been talking to each other, have taken to sleeping in separate beds and are now heading straight for the orce court.Jeremy Corbyn has been doing his best in the marriage guidance counsellor role, but the limitations of his approach were illustrated in the European elections, where Labour performed poorly. The party’s share of the vote was less than half what it secured in the 2017 general election, with Labour-leaning remainers opting for the Liberal Democrats, the Greens or nationalist parties, while Labour-supporting leavers went with the Brexit party. His tactics will be further tested today in the Peterborough byelection, where Nigel Farage’s startup is expected to emerge victorious.Corbyn has edged closer to backing a second referendum in certain circumstances, but it is clear that he still has reservations about going “full remain”. That’s not a particularly comfortable position, and it is strongly opposed by plenty of Labour members. However, it is still a defensible one.Labour will never form a government if its remainer and leaver wings become permanently estranged. While it is certainly true that the majority of Labour voters back remain, a significant minority voted to leave the EU. It is not enough for Labour to pile up votes in the pro-remain big cities: it needs to win marginals in the north, the Midlands and south-east as well – constituencies that voted leave in June 2016 and for the Brexit party last month. Labour’s remainers believe departure from the EU will make those who voted to leave worse off. Labour’s leavers think the remainers are subverting democracy.In these circumstances, Labour is right to try to move on from the referendum and focus on healing the country. There has been plenty of armchair psephology since the results of the European elections, designed to show that remainers won when all their votes were added together. All that can really be said is that a second referendum would be as close as the one in 2016 and confirm that Britain is deeply riven along age, class and geographic lines. London, in case anyone hasn’t noticed, is a separate country.It’s worth noting that Corbyn’s Euroscepticism – for which he takes a lot of stick – was widespread on the left before the referendum. There was opposition to the pro-banker austerity imposed on Ireland and Greece to the pro-employer and anti-trade union judgments handed down by the European court of justice, and nobody was especially impressed by years of sluggish growth and high unemployment. None of this seems to be relevant any more to Labour’s hardcore remainers. To the extent that they admit to any problems, it is with the euro rather than the EU, and since Britain is not part of the single currency it can have the best of all worlds.Even putting to one side the fact that many of today’s remainers were gung-ho for the euro in 2003, this is still a curious argument. Because if you’ve got doubts about the euro you should have doubts about Europe’s entire direction of travel. The euro is Europe’s single biggest project. It was intended to be a symbol both of progress towards ever-deeper union and the means of achieving still further integration. This is not some add-on extra, it is what Europe is all about.Yet the design flaws that were obvious from the outset have become ever more apparent, and there’s no immediate prospect of fixing them. French president Emmanuel Macron thinks more integration – a banking union and a European finance minister – is what’s needed to make the euro work. This would mean German taxpayers writing cheques for the rest of Europe, and there is not the slightest possibility of that happening.The reality is that Europe has a currency that doesn’t work, an economy that doesn’t work and a political process that doesn’t work. Corbyn is often accused of being starry-eyed about the possibility of creating a socialist utopia in Britain and forever harking back to his formative years in the 1970s. But he is not nearly as starry-eyed as some of his critics, who seem to think either that an earthly paradise already exists on the other side of the Channel, or that with a few judicious tweaks there will soon be one.On most issues, Corbyn is clear about what he supports: renationalisation, extra borrowing for public investment, higher taxes for companies and the better off. On Brexit it is different. Labour is now more a party of the gentle ruminants than a party of the industrial working class, and over Brexit the gentle ruminants are proving anything but gentle. They should, however, cut Corbyn some slack. From the Maastricht treaty onwards he has got the European Union a lot more right than they have.• Larry Elliott is the ’s economics editor"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf5d8550a1f7c04972293a6ff5c6807cc59cae26/0_0_6028_3617/master/6028.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7532f8178e50e89c96648ecbb50f8bd2","title":"gay man deported kenya home office mercy","story":"After making my home in England for 10 years, I have received a notice to leave everything I love behind On Monday, I opened the letter I never wanted to receive. After 10 years living in the UK I was told that I am no longer welcome and should make arrangements to leave the country “without delay” or risk being deported in the middle of the night. As a gay man, whose country of birth, Kenya, persecutes homosexuals, I felt my whole world collapse around me as I read the matter-of-fact words on the Home Office headed paper.Perhaps I was naive, but I wasn’t expecting this letter. I’ve been in a battle with the Home Office since 2016, and was locked in detention just last year, but somehow I still thought that they would see sense. This is the government department that this month is decorating its Twitter page with the rainbow flag, and whose own policies should, in theory, preclude them from sending gay people to countries where their safety is at risk. But it was a rejection that I read on Monday – and it’s left me reeling. After two years of legal arguments, in a chaotic and dysfunctional system that has left me in a constant state of uncertainty and anxiety, they simply stated that I do “not qualify for leave on any basis”. It was a crushing blow. I don’t like to think about what it would mean to be removed to Kenya, but in the last few days I have been forced to contemplate it. For a start, it would mean living in a country where expressions of sexual intimacy are outlawed for gay people. Only last month the high court upheld a law which criminalised gay sex – and hangs a 14-year jail sentence over the heads of those who dare to have a relationship with someone they love.It’s not just the law that would threaten me. With my case being so public I would be at risk of extreme homophobia everywhere I went. I know all too well that LGBT people in Kenya struggle to get housing and jobs, and I’d be at serious risk of destitution if I was forced to go there. Imagine being scared everywhere you went, being jobless, homeless and away from the place you know call home – that would be my life in Kenya.The idea of being forced to leave the UK doesn’t just fill me with fear, it also puts into sharp focus all that I would miss from my life here. My mum lives in Bristol and being deported would mean leaving her behind, unsure if or when I might see her again. Bristol is my home, and my rugby team and other LGBT friends are my family. After almost 10 years here I feel safe and happy and I want to keep building my life in my adopted city and use the skills I have to return to work and contribute to society.Ultimately, this isn’t just about me. This behaviour from the Home Office is part of a consistent pattern of ill-treatment towards me and other people seeking asylum. I’ve known so many others to have had their rights and humanity denied. We’ve seen people ejected from the UK who had a legal right to stay here. There have been cases of extreme mistreatment in detention. And there have been countless other cases of LGBT people removed from the UK to countries where their lives are at risk. And a number of people who were recently removed to Jamaica by the Home Office have lost their lives.It doesn’t have to be like this, for me or anyone else. I am simply asking that the Home Office follow its own rules by protecting me from persecution. Rather than patting themselves on the back with their LGBT-friendly Twitter picture they need to wake up to the fact that they are putting my life, and the lives of many others, at risk. This isn’t some sort of game, I’m not a number, I’m a real person with a life in this country who is simply demanding to be protected from extreme danger.While the Home Office is acting with cruelty, the people around me are being nothing but kind. Today I will walk into the police station, facing possible immediate detention, surrounded by my rugby teammates and many others who say they will be there for me at that most terrifying moment.

Factory farming is a horrible business. The economics demand ever greater productivity under conditions of ever greater squalor and cruelty for the animals themselves: the normalisation of what is grimly known as “confinement agriculture”. Chicken McNuggets are the product of something pretty horrendous. Small farmers who are contracted by the big corporations to provide meat product are themselves treated as serfs, the upper homo sapiens layer of degradation.Whistleblowers pay a terrible price for informing the public about what is going on, in terms of harassment and unemployment journalists and reporters are harassed, too. Yet the film ends, as so many documentaries of this sort end, on a note of optimism, a series of relatively upbeat bulletins in white-on-black intertitles – campaigners are having sporadic successes plant-based protein companies and small organic farmers aren’t doing so very badly.But to what conclusion is the film’s logic pointing us? It can only be to stop eating meat and dairy products – like quitting cigarettes – although the film is chary about saying this too clearly or too hectoringly, maybe for fear of alienating its own customer base. The film is about what William Burroughs called the “frozen moment when everyone sees what is at the end of every fork.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d15f4e5809b3764d9e2954869987ce2abbd7bfd/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b41c73cdc368c7f6f0c7a04e6868287a","title":"outside the multiplex the best smaller films to see this summer","story":"From a troubling film about race in America to a shocking documentary about China’s one child policy, this season offers more than just superhero sequelsThere’s enough genuine warmth radiating from San Francisco-set Sundance breakout The Last Black Man in San Francisco to counter any potentially underwhelming weather this summer. Both a melancholic ode to a city transformed by gentrification as well as a tribute to a real-life friendship, the Kickstarter-born project is told through an ultra-stylised lens, lush and poetic despite the harsh truths at its core. It’s a tad twee at times but inarguably persuasive in its announcement of major talent in both director Joe Talbot and his real-life best friend Jimmie Fails, an untrained actor who makes for a charming lead.After he lent his unusual, unhurried style to the vampire genre in 2013’s alluring Only Lovers Left Alive, Jim Jarmusch has decided to move on to zombies in a far more accessible, if rather less well-received new comedy. Opening this year’s Cannes film festival, The Dead Don’t Die takes a starry cast, some of whom are Jarmusch regulars (Bill Murray, Tilda Swinton, Iggy Pop, newly inducted Paterson lead Adam Driver) and some of whom are freshmen (Selena Gomez, Carol Kane, Danny Glover), and throws them into a familiar, yet still funny, small town set-up. It might not be one of his best but it remains a sharp enough alternative to the braindead standard set by the zombie genre.In this inspiring documentary, we meet Tracy Edwards, a British woman recounting a youth filled with inertia, rebellion and ultimately glass ceiling-smashing success. In 1989 she led the first ever all-female crew in the Whitbread Round the World Race, a gruelling nine-month sailing competition that would test them all to their very limits as well as challenge a male-dominated subculture that was willing them to fail. Director Alex Holmes, whose previous work includes a 2014 Lance Armstrong doc, has assembled a rousing, prescient film about a woman who refused to let men dictate what she should or shouldn’t do with her life.US release: 28 June (UK release: out now on digital)Arriving even further under the radar than the other films on this list, writer-director Jan Zabeil’s chilling domestic drama Three Peaks made its way around the festival circuit two years ago but is only receiving a very muted release now. It’s a disturbing three-hander set during a remote vacation which sees tensions arise as a man questions his place as the boyfriend of a mother, played by Oscar nominee Bérénice Bejo, whose son can’t decide whether to embrace or expel him. Spiky and unpredictable, it’s a film that increasingly plays out like a horror, one that will prove even more terrifying for certain family dynamics.Last summer, writer-director Ari Aster scored a sleeper smash with debut Hereditary, a horribly convincing drama about grief that transformed into a slightly less convincing horror about cutting one’s head off. For his follow-up, he’s headed to Sweden for what looks like a Wicker Man-esque tale of a group of millennials who find something far scarier than maypole-dancing when they visit a folksy festival that soon turns into something more ferocious. The trailer promises the unusual sight of horrors unfolding in the light of day and the much-anticipated delight of the wonderful Florence Pugh finally getting a worthy post-Lady Macbeth role.After an Oscar nomination for his role as Mark Zuckerberg in The Social Network, Jesse Eisenberg was thrust into franchise film-making, headlining the Now You See Me films, voicing the lead in the animated Rio adventures and playing the villain in the execrable Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. In the last year, one can sense the actor taking a conscious step away with such fare, preferring the festival circuit over the multiplex with the offbeat Cannes horror Vivarium, Toronto-premiering comedy The Hummingbird Project and SXSW audience hit The Art of Self-Defense. It’s the leftfield tale of a mousy man finding himself through karate after being attacked, and while it does lean on an over-abundance of quirk at times, it has Eisenberg comfortably back in his wheelhouse.One of the most critically adored films from this year’s Sundance film festival, writer-director Lulu Wang’s semi-autobiographical family drama The Farewell has all the makings of an arthouse summer breakout. Based on an episode of This American Life, the plot follows a young woman, played by a revelatory Awkwafina, who must travel to visit her extended family in China after finding out her grandmother has terminal lung cancer. The twist is that her grandmother doesn’t know she’s dying and the family has decided to keep it a secret. There’s an avoidance of farce despite the premise and instead, Wang’s film is filled with gentler comedy while a lingering sadness finally crescendoes during a tearjerker of a climax. It’s a hard film not to fall for.It’s unlikely that the summer will reveal a more compelling performance than that offered up by Kelvin Harrison Jr in Luce, a tough, button-pushing thriller about racial stereotypes that premiered this year at Sundance. The actor, who made a haunting impression in dystopian horror It Comes at Night, stars as a teen living with adopted parents, played by Naomi Watts and Tim Roth, whose background as a child soldier in Eritrea comes back to haunt him. It’s an utterly mesmeric turn, filled with crushing vulnerability and insidious menace, in a brutal, dramatically explosive film that challenges preconceptions and leaves us with difficult, troubling questions to consider.In her follow-up to The Babadook, a film that was immediately catapulted to the upper echelons of many a scariest horrors ever list, writer-director Jennifer Kent has decided to abandon the genre that launched her but not the ferocity that underscored her acclaimed debut. In this period thriller, a 21-year-old Irish convict witnesses the murder of her husband and child and vows revenge on the British officer, played by Sam Claflin, responsible. It’s a violent, gruelling journey across the Tasmanian wilderness and while not as tightly focused as her previous film, it confirms her status as one of the industry’s most exciting and unpredictable new directors to watch.China’s draconian one child policy is explored in harrowing, often overwhelmingly graphic detail in One Child Nation, a powerful, difficult documentary that deservedly won the Grand Jury prize at this year’s Sundance film festival. It’s a story that starts with the film-maker herself, Nanfu Wang, and her experience of being a mother after leaving China to study film in the US. Her newfound role causes her to return home to explore how those who lived through the so-called “population war” remember it and how they have since coped with the devastating after-effects. There are many chilling moments, as interviewees recall the horror of forced late-term abortions, serving as an all-too-prescient reminder of what happens when the state exerts ultimate control over women’s bodies.When a film is shuffled around the release schedule as much as Where’d You Go, Bernadette, it’s usually safe to assume the worst. But with so much going for it, from director Richard Linklater to a cast including Cate Blanchett and Kristen Wiig to the acclaimed source material from author Maria Semple, it would be foolish to discount just yet. The story sees Blanchett playing an intolerant architect who goes missing, leading her daughter to investigate. The trailer has a Secret Life of Walter Mitty remake vibe, which might not necessarily be a good thing but after a few thankless blockbuster roles, at the very least, it’ll be a pleasure to see Blanchett doing a little more."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4f538e61d9b9db31d6026d7b789f239df8de064/324_632_6246_3748/master/6246.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e9eabd5922306664bea702f461b7eccb","title":"kim joy recipe psychedelic marble cupcakes","story":"These special, multicoloured treats are a great way to show your support for people with dementia on Cupcake DayThe Alzheimer’s Society has declared 13 June Cupcake Day, encouraging us to “bake a difference” and support people with dementia.

At that point Real and Chelsea had not agreed on a fee but on Wednesday night they did with the announcement set to follow in the next few days. The two clubs are now preparing the contracts to be signed.The 28-year-old Belgian will leave Stamford Bridge after seven hugely successful years at the club, winning the Premier League twice, one FA Cup and two Europa League titles.The Chelsea manager, Maurizio Sarri, who is also expected to depart, said after the game against Arsenal that he had known about Hazard’s desire to leave for some time. “As you know, Hazard is a wonderful player, but you have to spend two or three months to understand him as a man,” he said. “But when you are able to understand him as a man, he’s a wonderful man. I knew Eden wanted to leave. But I wanted to respect his decision.”Hazard had one year left on his contract and ruled out joining another English club in the buildup to the Europa League final, saying: “No chance, no chance. I am a Blue. It means a lot to me. I cannot play for another club in this country.”Real Madrid are rebuilding their squad after a disappointing campaign in which they finished third in La Liga, 19 points behind Barcelona, having endured 12 defeats.

Win and England will be on course to finish top of Group D and looking at a relatively straightforward passage to the semi-finals. Lose or draw and the prospect of scrabbling to secure second spot and consequently a much trickier route to the latter stages beckons. “It’s one of the biggest games of our lives,” says the Manchester City midfielder.Considering Scott is embarking on her fourth World Cup and is not really given to hyperbole that is quite some statement but she knows Shelley Kerr’s side are almost unrecognisable from the one England thrashed 6-0 in the opening match of Euro 2017 in the Netherlands.“What’s important is that we don’t get lost in the emotion of the occasion,” Scott says. “We have to stay logical and remember it’s just a game of football.”The amount of heavy security, featuring abundant armed police, guarding England’s training base on the outskirts of Nice necessitated visitors undergoing airport-style screening while negotiating considerable French bureaucracy. The landscape felt radically different from the relaxed atmosphere of the last World Cup in Canada four years ago. While threats of terrorist attacks have left France on high alert, England know there can be no room for complacency when they kick off against radically altered opponents on Sunday.“I played in the 6-0 but I haven’t even thought about that game, which probably shows how much I think this one is going to be completely different,” she says. “Scotland didn’t have the experience they have now. I definitely think it’ll be a much tighter affair than the last one.”Jennifer Beattie, Scotland’s key centre‑half, missed Euro 2017 through injury but has arrived in Nice fully fit. “Jennifer’s one of my best friends at Manchester City,” Scott adds. “I remember once last season she had a bad back and I said, ‘Just look after yourself’. And then I said, ‘No, maybe you should overtrain so you’ll be knackered for the summer. We had a bit of banter but Scotland’s definitely not a straightforward game. It’s going to be difficult and we’re going to have to fight for the right to get the ball down and play. It’s important we get that win, so we’ve got to have the right mindset.”It has been announced England will play a friendly against Germany at Wembley on 9 November, as the Lionesses build up to Euro 2021, which they are hosting."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8fe5198fe3f0c529879b206a29c3250aec9e388/0_347_3386_2032/master/3386.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d07f8ff77627a87829ea802ad9ee8257","title":"portugal switzerland nations league semi final match report","story":"What more can be said about the man? He is 35 on his next birthday and, in football, even the greats reach a point when the one opponent they cannot beat is age. Not Cristiano Ronaldo, though – or not yet anyway, judging by this latest demonstration of his uncommon ability to bend football matches to his will.One certainty – if England can make it past the Netherlands to reach the final on Sunday, a recording of this match will provide Gareth Southgate with the hard evidence of what he probably knew already: that to stop Portugal, first you have to stop Ronaldo. Southgate had sent his assistant, Steve Holland, to Porto to try to work out a way of making that happen. When the report is handed to England’s manager it will tell him it is a lot easier said than done.The match culminated in the 53rd hat-trick of Ronaldo’s career and he certainly timed the last two goals, in the 88th and 90th minutes, to maximum effect, just as it had seemed Switzerland were going to take the game into extra-time courtesy of a bewildering VAR volte-face. Ronaldo had other ideas. This was his 157th appearance for Seleção and the 86th, 87th and 88th goals of a 16-year international career that, on this evidence, is far from being on the wane.“He is a genius,” said the Portugal coach, Fernando Santos. “There are genius painters and genius sculptors, but he is a genius in football. Simply a genius. When a player scores three goals in a game, of course he makes the difference.”Ronaldo may not be the jet-heeled teenager he was in 2003, when he made his Portuguese debut with braces on his teeth, but he remains a force of nature and, knowing what the man thinks of himself, he is probably already looking at the world record for international appearances, set by Ahmed Hassan of Egypt with 184. It was difficult not to come away from the Dragão believing that Ronaldo, being Ronaldo, may eventually become the world’s first 200-cap footballer.First things first, there is a final to play and another opportunity for the Euro 2016 winners to show this is a golden age for Portuguese football. Many of the supporters here wore Ronaldo masks. Some held up home-made posters asking for his shirt or, in the case of one middle-aged woman, a piece of embroidery showing the legendary CR7 six-pack. And, when the focus was not all on the man with the captain’s armband, it has to be said that Bernardo Silva was utterly brilliant, too.By the end the only issue was to decide the pick of the goals. The first one was the classic Ronaldo free-kick: 25 yards out, a puff of the cheeks and then the ball struck in such a way it swerved over the wall and into the net without Yann Sommer, Switzerland’s goalkeeper, even moving. The third goal involved a stepover, on the run, to deceive his nearest opponent before curling his shot into the opposite corner and, in between, the five-time Ballon d’Or winner fired in Bernardo’s cross with another splendidly taken right-foot finish.In the process, Ronaldo managed to make the evening feel as though it was entirely about him – which was some feat bearing in mind what happened early in the second half and the question it left about whether, in the short history of VAR, there had ever been a more bewildering sequence of events.Initially the German referee, Felix Brych, had pointed to the spot, correctly, because of Fabian Schär upending Bernardo inside the six-yard area. Then the message flashed up that the officials wanted to check the slow-motion replays and, after staring into the VAR monitor for a couple of minute, the referee pointed to the spot again – this time, however, at the other end of the pitch.Ronaldo had the ball in his hands at the time, waiting to take the penalty, but Brych had decided to penalise Nelson Semedo for an innocuous‑looking challenge on Steven Zuber in Switzerland’s previous attack. Ronaldo had to hand over the ball and watch, hands on hips, as Ricardo Rodríguez levelled the game from 12 yards. It was mystifying what infringement Brych had seen when, in reality, Zuber had tripped himself up. The referee had got it wrong, just as he did earlier in the match when Portugal’s Bruno Fernandes and the Swiss captain, Granit Xhaka, should have been sent off for a pair of wild challenges.At 1-0, Switzerland could consider themselves unfortunate to be behind when they had been the more dangerous side for long spells. Xherdan Shaqiri thrived in his central role, operating just behind Haris Seferovic, who clipped the top of the crossbar with one effort late in the first half.All the time, however, there was the possibility that Ronaldo could conjure up some more of his precious magic. One moment, in particular, stood out: a no-look pass to split open the Swiss defence and send João Félix running through the middle. It was a brilliant piece of deception and deserved a better finish than the 19-year-old debutant could provide.Ronaldo was also guilty of a bad miss in the first half but it would be remarkably po-faced to dwell on that for too long when, ultimately, it was another night that left a football crowd in thrall of his enduring qualities. Ronaldo had the ball as a souvenir and, on this evidence, he will take some stopping when Portugal return to this stadium on Sunday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92a2429af531538a4b75fa68543605f325c80db7/224_129_3276_1966/master/3276.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c74d1986def96a9d4dbcf2506e9b8682","title":"toni duggan equality footballl england barcelona womens world cup","story":"Striker wants better facilities and better crowds for women’s football but does not think England’s Lionesses should earn the same as their male counterpartsWith the USA women’s national team’s lawsuit, filed in March, against US Soccer alleging “institutionalised gender discrimination” ongoing and calls from Professional Footballers Australia to close the $370m (£292m) gap in the World Cup prize fund, equality is a hot topic.“I have a strong opinion on it,” Duggan says of the battle in the US, “and I believe they should be doing it because they’re more successful than their men’s team.” But her views on the disparity in England are very different. “Should we be doing it? No. Because we don’t bring in the money that the men do – we’re not as successful as them yet. They bring in a lot more money than us commercially and are more successful. When people ask me: ‘Should I earn the same money as the men?’ No, I don’t believe I should because they’re on a bigger scale than me, they have more fans, are more popular. I believe the girls should be better paid but not the same as the men.”The 27-year-old has just finished her second season with Barcelona which culminated in a 4-1 defeat by Lyon in the Spanish side’s first Champions League final. The game at the Wanda politano she refers to, a 2-0 win against Atlético Madrid in March, attracted a league‑record crowd of 60,739. For Duggan, who scored in that victory, it was the quality of the attendance, not the quantity, that was key.“There’s a picture of me celebrating and behind me there’s actually a man putting one finger up,” she recalls. “I’m not promoting that or saying it’s a good thing but it kind of showed what it meant. You could feel the passion in the stadium that day. It was a real atmosphere, it was a massive game and it was only a league game.“In England, I think we get about 30,000 for maybe an FA Cup final and there are lots of kids on the seats, which is nice don’t get me wrong, but it’s a calm atmosphere.”In contrast the game at the politano felt like a “proper game”. “The fans really wanted to be there for their team – the Atlético supporters were giving us stick, they were booing us, there were flares. I’m not encouraging all of it – there are some things in the men’s game we don’t want – but I’m just saying it felt like a proper atmosphere.Duggan adds by way of explanation: “In Spain there’s a lot more publicity … when we’re successful we’re front page of the newspaper – every newspaper and the big ones, Marca and others – but then also when we lose we’re slated. That’s the level the game is at.

Have you ever had to wait for a much-needed cup of tea because your mug needed an update first? During the interminable minutes while said update downloads, installs, and reboots itself, you have plenty of time to think about what our future homes will look like.Like it or not, most people’s houses are already full of internet-connected devices, and the number is only going to rise. In a few years, your washing machine will talk to your air quality sensor to find out the weather, then automatically switch on the drying cycle because it’s raining outside, before WhatsApping you to let you know your clothes are ready (and you just know it’ll use a load of emojis because some guy in the marketing office thought it was cool).The internet of things (IoT) is pretty good for all of us when it works. It means your devices can talk to each other – and you – to keep your home running just the way you like it. Until the wifi goes down, at which point you wonder what was so wrong with good old-fashioned light switches while you sit in the dark.As our knick-knacks get ever more connected, stable wifi is going to become as important as electricity. But while power cuts are blessedly rare, wifi outages are much more common, and we even put up with parts of our homes having no signal. Can you imagine saying: “Oh sorry, that room doesn’t have electricity”? So why is it OK when it comes to wifi?Neil Illingworth, head of innovation at Virgin Media, reckons things can only get smarter. “Our homes are filling with more and more connected devices such as smart lightbulbs, thermostats, speakers, smoke alarms, movement sensors, vacuum cleaners, and a whole lot more in the near future.”Of course, every internet-connected device is another thing that won’t work if the wifi fails, as Illingworth explains: “It’s not just humans who enjoy good wifi speeds, our devices like them, too.” It’s bad enough having to call a locksmith, but ignoring the peals of laughter down the phone when you try to explain you’re locked out because the wifi is down isn’t anyone’s idea of a good time.One upside of the rampant technological progress we’re experiencing at the moment, though, is Intelligent WiFi. Rather than requiring technical knowhow or multiple phone calls, Virgin Media’s new product is a home wifi network that fixes itself.Combining the Hub 3 router, Virgin Media Connect app and artificial intelligence of the non-scary type, Intelligent WiFi constantly scans your home internet to find areas with interference, and frequencies that your devices are connected to. Whenever it finds something that’s less than perfect, it automatically adjusts the settings to bring it up to speed – literally.While you won’t be interrupted by the daily tweaks Intelligent WiFi makes to your network, you’ll definitely notice the overall effect: a smart home running smoothly. So this means we’re on the road to the end of weak signals and blackspots around the home, inexplicitly slow loading times, or greedy devices hogging all the data.Intelligent WiFi oversees every last gizmo, making sure they not only get the signal they need, but that no device is left behind. You can even go in to the Connect app and see all the devices using the wifi, and pause inidual gadgets if you want to – such as when the kids are playing Xbox when they’re supposed to be doing homework.While you’re in the Connect app, you can also easily share your wifi details with friends who’ve come over for a cuppa and a chat. Do make sure you have a few non-smart mugs in the house, though – just in case of an apocalypse …Looking for faster connectivity?

Writer Sarah Pyper shares some handy tips and the best apps to help you stay on top of everythingLike 4.2m others in the UK – and a further 1.8m who’d like to – I often work from home. Once a euphemism for staying in bed and watching hours of daytime TV, working from home is now an everyday occurrence for those developing businesses, working flexible hours around the care of loved ones, or just avoiding spending time jammed into the armpits of their fellow commuters. All you need is a laptop, a reliable wifi connection and you’re set.But if you don’t have reliable wifi, it doesn’t matter how organised you are, how snazzy your tech is, or which shiny new game you’ve got to occupy your kids with, it will all fall apart. Thick walls, mirrors and even windows can create wifi blackspots that turn your home-working dream into a nightmare. However, Virgin Media’s new Intelligent WiFi with Hub 3, WiFi boosters and Connect app can be relied on to save the day. While the Intelligent WiFi system is designed to deliver the best wifi signal across your home, the Connect app also allows you to pause specific devices – which comes in particularly handy when you need to put the kids to bed.As someone who juggles writing and editing with social media side projects and caring for two children, my home isn’t just my castle, it’s my office, my gym, my laundry and my sanctuary – so I rely on home tech and some key apps to get it all done.Digital helpWith digital assistants such as Amazon’s Alexa, Google’s Assistant or Apple’s Siri, you can delegate domestic tasks while you work. They can turn up your heating, adjust the lighting using smart bulbs, feed your pet with devices such as Feed and go Smart Pet Feeder, or control a video doorbell such as Nest Hello so you don’t have to get up to see who’s interrupting you. If it’s time for a break, your smart kettle can start making a cuppa, while your smart toaster warms a slice. Even better, you can link your assistant to a robot vacuum cleaner such as Roomba to clean your carpet, or iRobot Braava, which will mop your floor, meaning you can ace your deadlines and complete your chores at the same time.Keep the kids occupiedA bored child trying to join in your conference call, especially at a tricky moment, has the potential to shatter that illusion of professionalism you’ve been carefully cultivating– just ask Prof Robert Kelly, whose four-year-old daughter interrupted a live TV interview with BBC News. My deadlines and reputation have often been saved by a well-timed gaming app for the kids. Minecraft is a long-time family favourite where you can build entire worlds, and Roblox sees the kids connecting with their friends in a bid to run a pizza parlour, adopt a baby or take care of a pet kitten. If emergency strikes, relinquish your phone and let them take selfies with special effects filters until you’re done. Works every single time.Seek inspirationWhen I need to feel more productive, I listen to the How I Built This podcast’s interviews with successful business owners such as Bobbi Brown for inspiration. Or, for a quick energy boost, the 7 Minute Workout app gets you moving with a set of 30-second exercises. If all else fails, ask Siri to play an upbeat playlist on Spotify at top volume, and thank your lucky stars you’re not in a communal office.Beat the working-from-home bluesThe downsides of working at home can be the domestic distractions (the kettle needs descaling) and feeling isolated (there are only so many conversations you can have with the cat). If things get a little quiet, I switch on Coffitivity or Noisli, which provide background noise so you can pretend you’re strolling through woodland or a Parisian street while you sort out your accounts. To avoid procrastination, I turn to Forest or Tomato Timer. Plant a virtual tree on Forest and it will grow – but only as long as you focus on your work and don’t check any other apps. Tomato Timer helps you follow the Pomodoro Technique where you work intensely for 25 minutes then take a five-minute break when you’ve finished your task.Looking for faster connectivity?

The proposals form part of a public consultation being launched today.The requirement that intended parents have a genetic link to the child should be ended, the report proposes, halting discrimination against iniduals and couples who are infertile and thereby prevented from having children through surrogacy.The ban on profit-seeking, commercial surrogacy agencies should remain, it is suggested, although the consultation is seeking public views on surrogacy payments.The laws governing surrogacy have not changed since they were introduced in the 1980s. The precise number of surrogate births is unknown, but there were around 400 parental order proceedings in 2016 to regularise such births.Sir Nicholas Green, chair of the Law Commission said: “More and more people are turning to surrogacy to have a child and start their family. We therefore need to make sure that the process is meeting the needs of all those involved.“However, the laws around surrogacy are outdated and no longer fit for purpose. We think our proposals will create a system that works for the surrogates, the parents and, most importantly, the child.”Lady Paton, chair of the Scottish Law Commission, said: “Surrogacy has become a significant issue in today’s society. The interests of all the parties involved must be properly regulated and protected. That is the focus of our proposals.”Dustin Lance Black, a surrogate father and campaigner, said: “Without our wonderful surrogate and clear surrogacy law, we would not have been able to have our first child or begin building the family we’ve always wanted.”“Good, clear law helps people make stronger, clearer decisions. Solid, definitive surrogacy law in the UK will have the power to keep surrogates, egg donors, intended parents, children, and families safe. This consultation is vital for ensuring the UK succeeds in building the best surrogacy law in the world.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c63c982e5e8320c28a6a3701875b9591dba3f8f1/0_0_4000_2667/master/4000.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=638b8aa0debcf23aebdf6137c7d5e0ed 960w","title":"china other tiananmens podcast","story":"Hundreds of Chinese cities were involved in the student-led demos in 1989. ’s Lily Kuo discusses the uprisings outside of Beijing.

Scientists say the discovery could help solve longstanding mysteries about the ancestors of native North Americans.While it is commonly believed the ancestors of native North Americans arrived from Eurasia via a now submerged land bridge called Beringia, exactly which groups crossed and gave rise to native North American populations has been difficult to unpick.Now scientists say they might have found some answers to the conundrums.Writing in the journal Nature, Eske Willerslev and colleagues reveal how they drew on existing data from modern populations as well as analysing ancient DNA from the remains of 34 iniduals obtained from sites around north-eastern Siberia, dating from more than 31,000 years ago up to 600 years ago.The key remains were fragments of two tiny human milk teeth, shed by males, found at a place in Russia called Yana Rhinoceros Horn Site. First excavated in 2001, the site offers the earliest direct evidence of humans in north-eastern Siberia, with finds also including bone items and stone tools. Indirect evidence of human populations in north-eastern Siberia goes back to more than 40,000 years ago.While it had previously been thought that these remains might be from the ancestors of native North Americans, the DNA data suggests otherwise.“What we see here is a much more complex story than what we believed was the case,” said Willerslev, director of the Lundbeck Foundation Centre for Geogenetics at the University of Copenhagen.The results reveal these iniduals were part of a previously unknown yet widespread group, dubbed the Ancient North Siberians by the team, who were genetically distinct from both Western Eurasians and East Asians. The researchers say they split off from the former 38,000 years ago – in other words, very shortly after Western Eurasians and East Asians themselves became genetically distinct. “They were living as big game hunters of woolly mammoth and woolly rhinoceros,” said Willerslev.But, crucially, this population does not appear to be the direct ancestor of Native Americans.Instead, analysis of the collection of genomes suggests the population that became the ancestors of native North Americans was the result of liaisons about 20,000 years ago between East Asians, who travelled north, and a group distantly related to the Ancient Northern Siberians. The East Asians also mixed with other descendants of Ancient Northern Siberians to give rise to another group, who the team dub the Ancient Paleo Siberians, who went on to supplant the existing group.The team add that one possibility is that the mixing involving the East Asians occurred in southern Beringia – one of the areas that could have offered respite from harshening conditions at the time.They Ancient Paleo Siberians were themselves supplanted by another band of East Asians heading north about 10,000 years ago that gave rise to a group dubbed the “Neo-Siberians”. “The vast majority of the genetic makeup of present day Siberians comes from this last push,” said Willerslev. “This is also the reason you don’t have any very close connection between contemporary Siberians and Native Americans.”John Hoffecker from the University of Colorado Boulder, who was not involved in the study, welcomed the research, saying a striking feature of the study is that humans were faring well in north-eastern Siberia, even in very difficult conditions, 30,000 years ago – with the genetic data from the teeth suggesting the males belonged to a population of about 500 people.“That’s a pretty healthy population,” he said. “We had no idea 30 years ago that we had this robust healthy hunter-gatherer population thriving up in the high Arctic 30,000 years ago – it is amazing.”Hoffecker added the presence of the group suggests it was the ice sheets in North America, not hostile conditions in Beringia, that kept people from reaching the Americas sooner."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abc0a0db6e5f523fb1e1190d4b3a057fb2340141/0_460_5100_3060/master/5100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d96c879b337989361cd33b9b3a828c45","title":"high rents in english cities forcing young to stay in small towns","story":"Young people can no longer afford to move to cities where wages are higher, says Resolution FoundationOne of the defining patterns of English life in which young people move from small towns with limited prospects to bigger cities to seek their fortune is in dramatic decline, research has revealed.Whereas previous generations were able to move to big cities such as London and Manchester or regional hubs like Leeds and Bristol to develop their careers, the current millennial generation is enduring a slump in mobility caused by rising rents, which can wipe out all of the financial gains of a move.Because moving jobs is the best way of increasing pay and being geographically mobile is the best way of finding those jobs, the thinktank said the trend could “stunt young people’s pay and career prospects”.“Young people today are often stereotyped as being footloose when it comes to work,” said Lindsay Judge, senior policy analyst at Resolution. “But in fact they are moving around for new job opportunities far less frequently than they used to. A key reason why people move around for work is the lure of a bigger salary. But increasingly those pay gains are being swallowed up by high housing costs.”Hannah Wilde, 30, from Sunderland, said she scrapped a plan to move to London to pursue a career in publishing when she looked at rents in the capital.“Some rooms in London were the same price as my full monthly wage from my first job in digital marketing in Sunderland,” she said. “Initially I was frustrated because I felt like I was missing out on some fantastic opportunities in the bigger cities due to rising rent. However, I have had some brilliant opportunities with companies in the north-east and have just recently secured a social media manager role for a rapidly growing skincare company in Durham.”Milo, 25, a video producer from Totnes in Devon, said he decided to move to London anyway, but recognises the financial risks.“The big cities don’t give you that safety net,” he said. “If you’re short on rent it’s by quite a lot. A hard living forces you to be vigilant and consistently reassess your place there so you’d better be making the most of it.”The phenomenon is not just affecting the young. Someone working in a school in Cornwall, for example, would be considerably poorer moving to a similar job in Bristol."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9bfde2385333ce8e659a4ab390eae85e668a871d/0_92_6256_3754/master/6256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f60aac47b44aeecdd6e313ac3fe17e69","title":"report calls for reform of uk medical watchdog to regain doctors trust","story":"General Medical Council accepts advice on clinical misconduct, ethnic minority focus and error avoidanceThe General Medical Council must fundamentally reform to regain the trust of the doctors it regulates and end their “toxic fear” of reprisals if they make mistakes, says a hard-hitting report.The independent review report was in response to the uproar from doctors over the treatment of a trainee paediatrician, Hadiza Bawa-Garba, who was convicted by the courts of gross negligence manslaughter and given a suspended sentence.The GMC did all it could to get Bawa-Garba struck off the medical register, appealing to the courts when its own medical tribunal said she should just be suspended. Many in the medical profession thought this an outrage. Bawa-Garba had an exemplary record for her six years in medicine until the death of Jack Adcock, a six-year-old in her care, when she was under pressure and without proper supervision in a poorly resourced hospital.Leslie Hamilton, a former children’s heart surgeon who chaired the review, wrote in his foreword to the report: “Many questioned why an inidual trainee working under pressure should carry the blame for what they considered to be wider systemic failings within her working environment. They recognised her situation in their own working lives and felt that ‘there but for the grace of god go I’.”Bawa-Garba’s conviction and the GMC’s action was the immediate focus for doctors’ sense of fear and injustice, but, the report said, it was “part of a more fundamental loss of confidence in the GMC and in the operation of a fair and just culture in medicine”.“All doctors could identify with her,” said Hamilton. “She was recognised as a good doctor. They looked at this good doctor and couldn’t work out … what made her make errors that were so bad that a jury actually thought they were criminal. And that just sent a shiver of fear. So there was already huge concern. And when the GMC took their appeal, that was the final straw, if you like.”The report said the GMC should be stripped of its power to appeal against the decisions of its disciplinary tribunals. It had to acknowledge that its relationship with the medical profession had been “severely damaged” and it should take steps to support doctors and rebuild trust.While relatively few doctors have been prosecuted for gross negligence manslaughter or culpable homicide, those investigated for these and other issues are disproportionately from ethnic minority backgrounds. These doctors often do not feel confident enough to raise concerns, fearing they will be blamed more than white doctors. The report recommended that work be done to ensure greater inclusion and make sure doctors were better supported.Expert witnesses played a big part in the conviction of another doctor, the colorectal surgeon David Sellu, who was jailed for gross negligence manslaughter but then acquitted on appeal. The case against him brought by the GMC was also thrown out. The report said there were widespread concerns about the evidence given by medical experts, and that the GMC had to be transparent about the qualifications of the experts it used. The report recommended that two experts should be required in any case about clinical misconduct.The GMC has accepted all of the recommendations. Charlie Massey, the GMC’s chief executive, said the council had already started looking into some of the issues raised by the report, such as the high skew of referrals of doctors from ethnic minorities, and practitioners’ mental well-being.“In some ways all of this underlies the importance of our wider strategy. My ambition for the GMC is that we are better able to anticipate where doctors may make mistakes and avoid them. I’m very committed to the GMC being seen as less of an ivory tower passing judgment,” Massey, said.The Bawa-Garba case damaged relations between the GMC and the medical royal colleges. The Royal College of Physicians commended the GMC for its willingness to adopt the report’s recommendations, but said it would “openly and robustly hold the GMC to account” and added: “It is unclear to many of our fellows and members if the GMC has apologised for any part it played in the breakdown of the relationship. A clearer apology would be a positive step.”The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health said the case had had a profound effect on paediatricians. “The accounts of systemic errors, short staffing, IT issues and lack of support for this particular trainee that contributed to the tragic death of a child, has led trainees to tell us they carry a sense of trepidation before the start every shift,” said its president, Russell Viner. “The burning question now for those who own the actions is how quickly will they be delivered? With other medical royal colleges we will move urgently to do our part.”The British Medical Association backed the need for a culture based on learning not blame. “This culture shift is vital to help avert such tragedies, and give the public confidence in the health service, while reassuring doctors and other staff that they will not be unfairly blamed when things go wrong,” said Chaand Nagpaul, the BMA’s council chair."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7814552db48b6bba8f16bf0c410e31dc17a4b32b/296_821_3797_2278/master/3797.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8f7a066b5bed7327e5700f2301b2cdef","title":"india south africa cricket world cup match report","story":"• South Africa 227-9, India 230-4• Rohit Sharma century guides India to six-wicket victoryStrike three, you’re just about out. This is the looming fate for South Africa after their six-wicket defeat by India – a third loss in the space of a week to begin their campaign – which probably leaves them with the task of winning all six of their remaining games to make the final four of this World Cup. Steering the chase in customary fashion, Rohit Sharma scored his 23rd ODI century, finishing unbeaten on 122 off 144 balls, to give the men in blue the ideal start.The comfortable margin – Virat Kohli’s side reaching the victory target of 228 with 2.3 overs to spare – belies the fact that for the briefest moment, the period when Kagiso Rabada was charging in to start the Proteas’ defence of 227 for nine, the contest was red hot.In a timely return to form, the leader of Faf du Plessis’s attack was a man inspired. Perhaps this had to do with the performance of Rabada’s opposing number Jasprit Bumrah, whose own outstanding opening burst – winning the edges of the opening duo Hashim Amla (6) and Quinton de Kock (10) – left South Africa well behind the game after winning the toss. Reinforcing why he is the No 1-ranked bowler in the world coming into this competition, the captivating right-arm quick beat the bat like this was the 1999 World Cup with the hooping Dukes ball.At an average speed of 141kph, some 5kph higher than his shift against England last week, Rabada had Shikhar Dhawan (8) caught behind and celebrated in a fashion that looked like he was ready to explode. When Kohli walked out, the man he described as “immature” in the buildup, the scene was set. A rapid bouncer started their clash, followed by a searing yorker.It did not last. Taking responsibility for the situation, Sharma smashed Rabada – who nearly had him caught in the cordon on one – for 14 in his next over, punctuated with a hook shot that cleared the rope. This resulted in Kohli facing only one further delivery in the barrage. The Indian captain eventually fell for an unconvincing 18 when the score was on 54 courtesy of a lovely piece of seam bowling from Andile Phehlukwayo and an even better one-handed catch by the wicketkeeper De Kock, but by then Sharma was well in.It was Bumrah who set up the pins of India’s bowling effort but Yuzvendra Chahal (four for 51) knocked them down through the middle overs, depriving South Africa of oxygen. Du Plessis’s (38) and Rassie van der Dussen’s (22) stand of 54 for the third wicket advanced the score from 24 for two. Enter India’s leg-spinner, who castled them both in the 20th over.A major plank of India’s plan is for their slow bowlers to squeeze the life out of the opposition between the power plays. After Chahal’s double strike, the left-arm wrist-spinner Kuldeep Yadav (one for 46) trapped JP Duminy (3) three overs later. Cleverly, Kohli then introduced the part-timer Kedar Jadhav, who got through four overs of his innocuous side-arm darts for 16 runs. David Miller (31) and Phelukhwayo (34) stayed the course but could not break the shackles, the former caught and bowled when Chahal returned, the latter stumped.An admirable rearguard stand of 66 between Chris Morris (42 off 34 balls) and Rabada (31 off 35) helped retrieve the situation to an extent in the final 10 overs, but India went into the interval having conceded just three in a classy 50th over from Bhuvneshwar Kumar (two for 44).After Sharma put the brakes on Rabada’s charge, he did what he has so often when chasing and took his time. When Morris was in operation – he sent down three maidens across an unlucky afternoon – he was happy to watch, scoring just six runs from 23 balls. He did not change approach when an lbw decision went his way in the 12th over, nor when an outside edge was inches away from finishing his day in the 24th. He is as cool as they come.After passing 50 in 70 balls, there was one final interrogation from Rabada to get through, a spell that picked up the wicket of the No 4 KL Rahul (23) when chipping to cover with 89 runs still needed at just a run a ball. But by that point a Sharma century – raised from his 128th delivery – was as much a formality as the overall task alongside MS Dhoni.If there was going to be a miracle for South Africa, it would have required Miller to catch Sharma in the 44th over when the score was 193. But, inexplicably, the rudimentary chance was shelled to the utter delight of the partisan Indian audience and the despair of Rabada, who fought to the end. Sure enough, the century-maker ramped the next ball for four. The vignette neatly summed up the Proteas’ first week in the tournament. At least Morris (one for 36) got his name in the book, albeit falling on the stumps when taking a skied Dhoni chance when India needed 15 to salute.

She has not indulged her passion for cake-baking on this trip – keeping her diet simple to conquer a cold – and she has rarely turned to her musical playlists.Never mind that one of her favourites, Van Morrison, might have written Days Like This for what she is about to experience. It is as if she has stripped her life of her usual distractions to concentrate on the challenge facing her on Friday – beating one of the best teenagers in the game, Marketa Vondrousova, to become the first British woman in the final of the French Open since Sue Barker 43 years ago.But she is not glum or wound-up about the task. She smiles and laughs constantly. She is, she says, very happy. It shows.The pressure of performing at the highest level of her sport appeared to strangle her talent for a worryingly long period, but any self-doubt dwindled to invisibility when she cracked the top 10 three years ago, and even in her crash to No 50 last July she refused to buckle under the weight of criticism. She had not long suffered defeat in her fourth consecutive first-round match at these championships, and seemed lost on clay. Konta did not take kindly to the suggestion that clay was her surface from hell, particularly in Paris.Looking back at her excellent run here this time, she said there was no urge to prove her critics wrong – as Andy Murray often has done.And those setbacks, it transpires, she handled with her underpinning philosophy in life and tennis: acceptance. It is a Kiplingesque attitude to success and failure, shaped by her former Spanish coach Esteban Carril, and his friend, the late Juan Coto, who was Konta’s life coach. Konta rarely talks about Coto, who died in 2016, but was keen to name-check him and Carril when explaining what has become her core mantra.“Acceptance has been a part of my vocabulary and part of my thought process for many years now, probably since Esteban and Juan. It got reignited, strengthened and more relevant in the last year and a half or so. There are a lot of situations that we find ourselves in in this sport that are quite removed from reality in a lot of ways. It’s very much not real life.As Billie Jean King said of Konta on Wednesday: “Her concentration is better day in and day out. I feel like some days she gets like too hyped up. She seems to be very calm right now.”Konta does not want to be chilled out to the point of complacency on Friday, after Wednesday’s rain pushed her semi-final back, and there is little chance of that against Vondrousova. The 19-year-old Czech, who arrived at this tournament ranked 38 in the world and will leave well in advance of that, has all the weapons to be a major force in tennis.She has already delivered on her immense promise with an expansive and intelligent game to beat three seeds here, saving three set points on Tuesday to oust the clay-court specialist Petra Martic, who had won their four previous matches.Blessed with a bright, teenager’s belief that anything is possible, Vondrousova, nevertheless, is no wide-eyed kid. As she said after beating Martic in two tight sets: “It’s not happening every day, right? I’m just really happy with my game.” As she should be.Konta is reluctant to be labelled a favourite in her third grand slam semi-final, after losing twice as an underdog, to Angelique Kerber at the Australian Open in 2016 and Venus Williams at Wimbledon in 2017."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ef1ca21ba3e05e2b00ece835c0e53f4407924de/0_289_5349_3209/master/5349.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d570c56f8208e50adcb40418441ea27","title":"england moeen ali cricket","story":"People supporting cricket is the important thing and when they come to World Cup games it is our job to entertain themWe let ourselves down against Pakistan. As Eoin Morgan told us after the match, we cannot allow standards to slip in the field because it can make the difference. And it really did. Mistakes can happen. Sometimes they can build up over the course of an innings and put people even more on edge, which makes it snowball further.But in this instance I don’t believe that was the case. It was just a general sloppiness and pretty frustrating after we put in one of our best showings against South Africa.The nature of the tournament means an early defeat isn’t terminal. There were inidual performances during the game – centuries from Joe Root and Jos Buttler – and after the South Africa game that tells me we remain in good shape. We have Bangladesh this Saturday and with it a chance to get back on track.Naturally I was pleased with my bowling and picking up three wickets. Coming on to bowl in the opening powerplay might look stressful for a spinner but I actually quite like it. The expectation remains on the batsmen to score and that brings opportunities. Myself and Mark Wood built up some good pressure after their openers started well and it was nice to peg them back.The ball is coming out nicely at the moment. I felt at Trent Bridge I located the right pace at which to bowl. The stumping of Fakhar Zaman was really satisfying too, because he’s such a dangerous player and after spotting him coming down, I bowled it a fraction slower and got some good turn out of the track. Jos did some great work to pull it off.In terms of my batting, I’m disappointed I couldn’t get us over the line. Coming in with 10 runs an over required is difficult and as I’m not a massive power-hitter, it’s a case of getting one away early and going from there. It just didn’t happen this time but – and this might sound strange – I genuinely don’t feel out of nick. There is no reason to feel flustered about my recent scores.During the Indian Premier League I found some pretty decent form and I feel I am training just as well. The difference was that those runs came up the order when you get a few more balls to settle. Root, Buttler and Ben Stokes are guys who get this. But my role means you don’t always have that luxury and so scores will inevitably fluctuate.The atmosphere at Trent Bridge was pretty intense, with a lot of Pakistan supporters in the ground. We have spoken about this as a team because we know it will continue throughout the World Cup. But it really should not affect us because we are used to these crowds, either at home and overseas.I had some fun out in the field. Some people were chanting “He’s one of our own” or asking me if I was fasting because of Ramadan. And I saw a few Liverpool shirts, which I gave the thumbs-up to. The fact is, whoever people are supporting, they are there to have a good time and our job is to entertain them.Am I one of their own? To be honest, growing up I always felt slightly different to my mates as I always supported England first and they tended to follow Pakistan. I genuinely thought they should be the same as me. But over time I have changed my view on this.Firstly, it doesn’t actually matter if someone who was born in the UK supports another country. If people have a strong affiliation to Pakistan, for example, through their roots, why can’t they support them? Who cares, right? People following cricket is the important thing.And secondly, it is changing over time. When we get to the third and fourth generation immigrant families and beyond there will be more England supporters among them, maybe even the majority. I have had British Asians tell me they support England because of me or Adil Rashid and that’s great to hear.And was I fasting during the match? I have played cricket while fasting during Ramadan previously but for the start of this World Cup and the series against Pakistan beforehand I have kept it to training days and days off.You have dispensation to pause when you are travelling and I have taken up this option on match days. Even fasting on training days takes it out of you and so I think it was the sensible move. It means I have around seven days of fasting to make up now and I will be doing so over the coming weeks.I always have a slight sense of sadness when Ramadan ends. It’s such an amazing, blessed month. For me it is like a training camp for the year. You reflect on your life and things you can improve on. And it’s not about food and drink, it’s about learning to be a better person.So I’d like to say eid mubarak to our supporters and everyone celebrating around the world. I hope they had a blessed Ramadan and can take the spirit of the month through to the rest of the year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31591b7d76d77c642e96d9dc65aeeffb18379d11/0_129_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fd769f912636690af52413590a564c5d","title":"chinas huawei signs deal to develop 5g network in russia","story":"Huawei welcomes agreement in area ‘of strategic importance’ after meeting between Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin Huawei, the Chinese technology company considered a security threat by the US, has signed a deal with Russian telecoms company MTS to develop a 5G network in the country over the next year.The agreement was signed on the sidelines of a meeting between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Russian president Vladimir Putin in Moscow.The deal will see “the development of 5G technologies and the pilot launch of fifth-generation networks in 2019-2020”, MTS said in a statement on Wednesday.Quoted in the statement, Huawei’s Guo Ping, one of the company’s chairmen on rotation, said he was “very happy” with the agreement “in an area of strategic importance like 5G”.At a Moscow meeting between Putin and Xi, the Chinese leader called his Russian counterpart his “close friend”, noting that they had met nearly 30 times over the past six years. The trip is Xi’s eighth to Russia since 2012.“We will strengthen our mutual support on key issues,” Xi said, sitting next to Putin in an ornate Kremlin hall.Moscow’s ties with the US have declined sharply over the Ukrainian crisis, the war in Syria and the allegations of Kremlin meddling in the US 2016 presidential elections, while China is engaged in a spiralling trade war with Washington.“Protectionism and unilateral approaches are on the rise, and a policy of force and hegemonism is increasingly taking hold,” Xi said.Huawei has been in turmoil since May, when the Trump administration banned US companies from selling high-tech equipment to Huawei over suspicions it was spying for Beijing.Experts say the US decision, which is to come into force within three months, threatens the survival of the company, which is highly dependent on US chips for its phones.Several companies have already distanced themselves from Huawei, including Google, whose Android system equips the vast majority of smartphones in the world.Huawei’s reported potential involvement in Britain’s 5G network has proved politically sensitive and Theresa May’s government insists no decision has been made on the issue.Agence France-Presse and Associated Press contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ead18d1b23b6cdaa33f6731c0c417a8f0576552/539_452_3726_2236/master/3726.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=548aaa2cbb4ce837508d757542e646f5","title":"samsung galaxy s10 review the sweet spot","story":"Top-end smartphone balances a big screen with smaller body, good performance and triple cameraThe Galaxy S10 is Samsung’s middle-of-the-road top-end phone, featuring a large screen in a pretty compact body for those who don’t like the current breed of massive flagship superphones.The regular, non-plus versions of Samsung’s Galaxy S line have always been the sweet spot between size, price and performance. They offer big, beautiful screens in bodies that are practically tiny by today’s giant-phone standards.The Galaxy S10 isn’t all that small, of course, measuring 70.4mm wide and 149.9mm tall with a stunning 6.1in QHD+ AMOLED screen. It’s about the same size as Apple’s iPhone XS, and considerably smaller than the Galaxy S10+, Huawei P30 Pro and OnePlus 7 Pro. It’s also one of the lightest top-end smartphones on the market at just 157g: 18g lighter than the S10+ and a full 49g lighter than the OnePlus 7 Pro.Its size and weight make it one of easiest top-end phones to handle and pocket. Not once did the Galaxy S10 feel liable to being dropped, even when using it one-handed in packed trains.The design of the Galaxy S10 is attractive, particularly in its pearlescent white, but doesn’t rock the boat. The front is glass so is the back. They both curve at the edges to a thin polished metal band. The screen has a small circular cutout through which the selfie camera pokes.The display also hides Samsung’s ultrasonic fingerprint scanner for unlocking the phone with your thumb on the screen. Arguably the most unusual aspect of the Galaxy S10 is the existence of a headphone socket in the bottom – a rare sight for a top-end smartphone in 2019.The phone is water resistant to IP68 standards, or depths of up to 1.5 metres in fresh water for 30 minutes. Drop the S10 in the loo and you’ll be able to rinse it afterwards.The Galaxy S10 has the same processor, memory and storage as the larger Galaxy S10+ and therefore performs similarly. In this US this means Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 855 processor, but outside in the UK, Europe and many other regions it means Samsung’s own Exynos 9820, as tested here.Generally the S10 is as snappy as most of the competition, with no noticeable lag. It won’t match the very fastest phones, such as the OnePlus 7 Pro, but it keeps up with the competition and is a big leap over the two-year-old Galaxy S8.Battery life on the S10 was a disappointing 25 hours between charges. With the screen set to FHD+ and the always-on display (AOD) setting off, the phone would last from 7am on day one until 8am on day two, dying on the train into work. That was while browsing and using apps for five hours with plenty of push messages and emails, watching 60 minutes of offline video, shooting about five photos a day and listening to about five hours of Spotify using Bluetooth headphones.The Galaxy S10 runs Samsung’s new One UI version of Android 9 Pie.One UI is a big upgrade over previous versions of Samsung’s software, refocused around making phones with large screens more usable. While more beneficial for the larger Galaxy S10+, the S10 still benefits from generally having the top half of the phone for viewing information and the bottom half for touch-based interactions.That puts menus, buttons and other touch-interaction points in easier reach of your thumb. Others are doing similar with Android, including Google, but Samsung is the most successful to date – something Apple and its back button in the top left of the screen should take note of.One weak point compared with competitors is Samsung’s gesture navigation system, which simply replaces the standard back, home and overview buttons with swipe pads that do the same thing in the same place on the screen. It’s less ergonomic and fluid than rival systems such as that used by OnePlus, Huawei or even Google’s upcoming Android Q.Samsung’s Bixby voice assistant is serviceable, but not as good as Google Assistant, often failing to understand what is said, so is safe to just avoid.The fingerprint reader is embedded under the screen, using ultrasound to read your ridges through the display. Most other in-display fingerprint readers are optical, which is less secure than ultrasonic sensors, but both can still be fooled like most biometric systems with the right equipment.Overall, the fingerprint scanner is more convenient built right into the screen, but isn’t as fast as traditional capacitive sensors or the fastest of new optical sensors such as that fitted to the OnePlus 7 Pro.The Galaxy S10’s triple rear camera is one of the better systems on the market and is the same as that fitted to the larger Galaxy S10+. It’s main 12-megapixel camera, 12-megapixel telephoto camera and a 16-megapixel ultrawide-angle camera work together for easy and flexible shooting modes zooming from 0.5 to 2x, and on to a 10x hybrid zoom.In good light the camera produces some really good photos, with great detail, colour and fast autofocus. In low light the S10 is solid but far behind the very best on the market, even with Samsung’s dedicated night mode.The ultrawide-angle camera is a lot of fun, as is the live focus mode, which records depth information so you can blur the background in portraits or perform colour isolation. You can also post shots straight to Instagram using a dedicated camera mode, while video capture is also excellent.Overall, the rear camera on the S10 matches rivals from Apple, but falls short of the best from Huawei. The S10 also has an excellent single selfie camera poking through the screen.The Samsung Galaxy S10 is an all-round great phone that thankfully keeps things at a manageable size. It still has a big, beautiful screen that’s great for watching videos, but it doesn’t make your hand hurt holding it.Performance is good, the camera’s good and the software is the start of a rethink of how we use big phones. The ultrasonic fingerprint scanner works well enough too and there’s even a headphone socket.My only real complaint is battery life is only just acceptable. You will have to charge the Galaxy S10 before a night out to make sure it will get you home, or at least activate some of the power saving modes.If you’re looking for a great phone that’s on the smaller side of the gigantic-phone revolution, there aren’t many better than the Galaxy S10.Pros: stunning screen, ultrasonic in-display fingerprint scanner, hole-punch notch, wireless charging and powershare, great camera, good performance, good software, good haptics, headphone socket, microSD card slot, dual-simCons: battery life could be better, relatively slow charging, low-light performance not as good as rivals This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

What are her options? I now have a Lenovo laptop which has Windows 10 installed, but to be honest with you, I preferred Windows 7, which was on my last two computers. What would you suggest? ElizabethAs most Windows 7 users know – and if they don’t yet, Microsoft will nag them about it soon – Windows 7’s support stops in January 2020. After that, there will be no more security updates, except for companies that pay an annual fee that doubles every year. This is a powerful incentive to migrate from Windows 7 to Windows 10.My best suggestion is just to get used to Windows 10. Some people cling to obsolete versions of Windows but eventually most of them recognise they would have been better off if they had moved earlier. New versions of Windows always provide more stability and better security, even if they get other things wrong. (Full screen apps in Windows 8 is a classic example but Microsoft fixed that in Windows 10.)I shared your love of Windows 7: I recommended people to move to it as soon as possible and stick with it for as long as possible. I kept it on my desktop PC, which doesn’t have a touchscreen, instead of moving to Windows 8. I changed my mind after using Windows 10 for some time, because it did more and worked better. That persuaded me to stick with the free upgrade.Try using Windows 10 for six months before having a play with an earlier version. Hindsight often makes the old stuff look clunky and out of date.Do you miss any features from Windows 7? Microsoft dumped several things in the transition via Windows 8. The main ones were the Windows Media Centre, the bundled games, the desktop gadgets and the built-in DVD compatibility. The separate Windows Live Essentials suite, including Windows Live Mail and Movie Maker, was terminated with extreme prejudice.Windows Media Centre was the home theatre software launched with XP and not many people used it. (It is not to be confused with the Windows Media Player, which continues.) The desktop gadgets introduced with Windows Vista also perished but most people only used the nice clock.For some Windows 7 users the games were the biggest loss. Happily, there are free clones of Solitaire, Spider Solitaire, Hearts, FreeCell (the best!) and Minesweeper. Microsoft also has some free but ad-supported versions in the Microsoft Store. Chess Titans, developed by the now-defunct Oberon Games, is harder to replace but Chess Giants (€9.90) is pitching for that market. Otherwise, Windows XP games run in Windows 10 and (so far) Windows updates do not remove them.Games, Live Mail and some other programs were casualties of Microsoft’s shift from traditional desktop programs (which use the Win32 applications programming interface) to packaged Microsoft Store apps (which use the new WinRT or Windows Runtime API). Store apps are easier to install, update and remove because they don’t use the Windows Registry. They are also touch-friendly, more secure, and can be suspended in the background to save resources.However, not all the old Win32 utilities are dead. Microsoft Paint and Internet Explorer still ship with Windows 10, despite being replaced by Paint 3D and Edge. The Control Panel lives on because not everything has been transferred to the Settings app. Windows Live Mail mostly works despite being replaced by the Mail app.If you desperately miss an old Windows 7 program, you may be able to get it back via Sergey Tkachenko’s Winaero Tweaker. This includes Windows Photo Viewer and old versions of Calculator, Sticky Notes and Task Manager.Users have always been able to change Windows’ appearance, and you can easily make Windows 10 look more like Windows 7. The simplest option is to change your current background wallpaper to whatever you used in Windows 7. The standard offering was a wavy Windows logo in the middle of a blue sky but you probably changed that to something prettier.Microsoft also changed the Taskbar. This used to be a semi-transparent blue with an orb at the left end and no search box. Windows 10 has a black Taskbar with a tiny white flag at the left end, plus a search box.You can make the search box disappear by right-clicking on the Taskbar, selecting Cortana and then Hidden on the drop-down menu. After that, if you click the white Windows icon and start typing something, the search box will reappear. Frankly, I think usability is improved by having a search box that you can see.You can change the colour of the Taskbar by right-clicking on the desktop and selecting Personalise. This brings up the Personalisation page in the Settings (cogwheel) app. Select Colors then scroll down to the More Options section. Tick the two boxes there to show accent colours on the Taskbar and in title bars and windows borders, then select a colour from the array provided. I think it’s worth ticking only the second box, to add an accent colour (eg navy blue) to title bars but the Taskbar looks better in black.The Settings app also has separate pages for the Start menu and Taskbar. Use these to choose which programs to show.Some people seem desperate to get their Windows 7 Start menu back, or an earlier “classic” menu, though I don’t understand why. Today, all your most used programs should be on the Taskbar, where you can run them with one click, or by hitting WinKey-6 or whatever (that will run whichever program is sixth in line). You can run less-used programs by double-clicking their desktop icons, or by clicking the Start menu and then the program’s Live Tile. That’s still only two clicks.Live Tiles are big, so they are easy to hit, even with a blunt finger. You can make them bigger or smaller, position them in groups and remove all the ones you don’t want. (Right-click, select “Unpin from Start”.) There’s no rational reason for wanting to scroll through extended menus of tiny text. You should switch to Windows 10’s simpler, faster approach.However, menu masochists will be pleased to learn that the two most popular Start menu replacements from the Windows 8 era are still available. Classic Shell is no longer being developed but you can still download it from the original site. Alternatively, try the Open Shell version that is being developed by volunteers. Meanwhile, Stardock has developed Start8 into Start10, which costs $4.99 after a free trial period.Classic Shell takes over the otherwise useful right-click on the Start menu to access its settings. For a fuller Windows 7 effect, use these settings to change the white icon to an orb and change the Skin entry from  to Windows Aero.You may be happier if Windows 10 looks and works more like Windows 7 but don’t go mad and start crippling its functionality. It’s foolish to remove the Notifications panel, rather than just using the Settings to remove any links you don’t need. It’s even more foolish to use Internet Explorer today unless a website won’t work in anything else. It’s a waste of time to remove apps you don’t think you want because it won’t save any space or increase performance. You can hide or remove their icons and forget about them but you’ll still be able to run them from the search box if you need them. In particular, don’t mess with the Microsoft Store.Windows 10 runs an SIHClient – for Server-Initiated Healing – which tries to repair any damage to the operating system. I sometimes wonder if it spends more time protecting the OS from users than from external threats. Unless your name is Mark Russinovich, the less you mess around with Windows 10’s internals, the better it will work.Have you got a question?

We’d like your help in documenting their recoveryEngland and Wales have about 140,000 miles of footpaths, but it is estimated more than 10,000 have been lost from current maps. Volunteers have been working tirelessly to rediscover them and put in legal applications for the recovery of lost paths before a government deadline in 2026 after which claims will no longer be accepted.If you have already found a lost footpath, how did you find and identify it? If you put in an application for a path to be recovered we’d also like to hear about it.Below are some tips on how to rediscover a lost footpath:1. The first port of call is the Ramblers, whose website gives clear advice on how to identify a lost path and make an application. The method involves comparing new and old maps, plus examination of historical sources. Walking and exploration is involved, but don’t forget that a lost path has to be proven before you can use it, otherwise you are trespassing.2. It is also important to be sure you are not replicating work already underway. This government website can give you information on current applications.3. You may also know of paths that are used regularly, but are not on the definitive map (you can ask your local council to see that map). Any footpath walked by the public for 20 years without any attempt by the landowner to prevent access can be made a right of way. Check your local walking groups for people actively walking along unmapped routes to help establish this right.You can share your tips and stories with us in the encrypted form below.

The beach before them a morass of tank traps and barbed wire. “As our boat touched sand and the ramp went down, I became a visitor to hell,” US private Harry Parley later recalled.The horror and the heroism of the D-day landings came home to me once more as I watched a film at the Musée du Débarquement (D-Day Landings Museum) in Arromanches-les-Bains. Seventy-five years ago, on 6 June 1944, this small town was at the western end of Gold Beach – code name for one of the five stretches of the Normandy coast chosen for the allied invasion of German-occupied France.The museum’s panoramic windows look out over a wide strand where the vestiges of those landings are still clearly visible: mighty fragments of the portable Mulberry harbours – shipped across the Channel in sections to form a huge makeshift port – still resist the waves out at sea, or sprawl on the sand like mighty beached whales.In stark contrast to the hardships faced by the troops in 1944, I stayed in comfortable hotels, with my luggage transported ahead. So I was unencumbered as I explored Normandy’s Calvados départment on an electric bicycle that was something of an indulgence – the flat terrain here is hardly taxing.I bowled along quiet country lanes, riverbank paths, rutted farm tracks and the occasional outbreak of cobbles. Indeed, I often found myself turning my electrical helpmeet off so that I could slow down and savour the little stone villages, blossoming apple orchards and seemingly endless fields of deep green flax and bright yellow rapeseed that gave the scenery the look of a vast inland sea.The first of my self-guided tours took me on a 12-mile loop from the village of Crépon (a church, a bar-tabac, a bespoke umbrella factory) to Ver-sur-Mer on Gold Beach and Courseulles-sur-Mer on Juno.It was at the former that I first encountered what would soon become a familiar sight: banners attached to the lampposts, each bearing a photograph of an allied soldier, sailor or airman, with his name and the words “WWII Heroes”. These served as a constant reminder that the largest amphibious landing in history was composed of hundreds of thousands of personal stories, many of which ended in tragedy.One soldier who survived to tell the tale was Canadian sergeant Garth Webb, who co-founded the Juno Beach Centre museum with two fellow veterans to mark the contribution made by his fellow countrymen. It’s a worthy tribute to the 14,000 Canadians who fought in the Battle of Normandy, 359 of whom perished on D-day itself. “Every single man under Webb’s command had been killed in the first hour,” my guide, Louis, told me.Rather than give a blow-by-blow account of the landings, the museum attempts to explain the reasons why Canadians volunteered to fight here, with combatants telling their own stories to camera. To remind visitors just how young they all were, the museum deliberately employs youthful Canadians as guides. A new exhibition also tells a largely unheard story: that of women whose active service contributed to the allied victory.“It’s also the only museum to offer tours of bunkers,” Louis informed me proudly. Dug out by volunteers from the sand that had engulfed them for decades, the two bunkers he took me into had been built in 1941 and 1944 and demonstrated how the course of the war had changed between those years. The first is a comparatively flimsy affair, thrown up by a conquering German army with little to fear. The later bunker has concrete walls two metres thick and openings at the sides from which guns could strafe the beach.My hotel in the village of Crépon was a fortification from a far more distant era. La Ferme de la Rançonnière is a 13th-century semi-fortified farm rebuilt in the 17th century and reputedly equipped with a tunnel connecting it with the Château de Creully two miles away. It offers guests a welcome tot of calvados, the cockle-warming apple brandy. It’s one of a trio of local apple-based alcoholic drinks (there are no vineyards hereabouts) and takes its name from the départment. The others are pommeau – partly fermented farm-produced apple juice mixed with calvados, which has a reputation for undoing the unwary – and cidre in many forms.Each night, with a clear-ish head, I studied the copious trip notes supplied by tour operator Inntravel. These included instructions for marking up the next day’s trails on the map provided. Much of the time I was following véloroutes, the well-signposted cycleways that crisscross France. There were also detailed instructions of the “take the first left after the red barn” variety. You would really have to make an effort to go wrong: I only managed it once when, with my boundless capacity for self-sabotage, I heeded neither map nor instructions.I did make it without mishap to Arromanches-les-Bains, where I slipped into the Arromanches 360 Circular Cinema to watch the film, Normandy’s 100 Days. Projected on to a 360-degree screen, the film uses actual footage from the campaign. With half a dozen clips all playing at once around me, and a soundtrack of battle noise that I felt in my stomach as much as my ears, it induced a powerful sense of disorientation. I could only guess what it must have felt like for those who were there. It was impossible not to feel both awed by their courage and audacity, and also aghast at the sheer insanity of war.The following day, at the small harbour town of Port-en-Bessin, I climbed the hillside to watch the revolving bridge below me swing open, admitting a string of little trawlers into port, their catch soon to be sold at the market on the pier. On the summit of the hill above me, one Captain Terry Cousins gave his life leading a final, desperate but ultimately successful assault on what had seemed an impregnable German position. The taking of Port-en-Bessin meant that Operation Pluto (Pipe Lines Under the Ocean) could make landfall, supplying the allies with much-needed fuel.From there it is just a few miles to the low dunes on Omaha Beach. Swallows darted about the waves as I gazed out to sea, while a lone wheatear, tail bobbing furiously, hunted for lunch in the sand at my feet.Omaha was taken by the Americans, and it was with a brine-laden breeze filling my lungs that I pedalled to the immaculately maintained Normandy American Cemetery in Colleville-sur-Mer. Herds of schoolchildren crowded into a gargantuan memorial to inspect enormous murals showing how the beach-head was established and how its creation would eventually lead to VE Day.Part of the price for that victory lay behind them: the graves of 9,388 soldiers, their identical white crosses standing stiffly in ranks of military straightness above the five miles of beach where many of them had fallen.Two days after D-day, Bayeux, which had been largely spared by the war, became the first town in France to be liberated. I enjoyed a leisurely stroll around its cornucopia of medieval buildings, including the magnificent cathedral. My hotel, the Lion d’Or, an 18th-century coaching house, was relatively modern in comparison. It also served up an unusual dessert for a region so obsessed with la pomme – a carrot mousse cake confection with orange chantilly cream and tarragon ice-cream that sent my dining companion into raptures. I discovered that the hotel had played its own part in the war – Generals Montgomery, Eisenhower and de Gaulle had all slept here.But, of course, Bayeux is best known for its tapestry (or, more correctly, embroidery). The cloth tells the story of another successful invasion – that of England in 1066. I confess I hadn’t expected to be quite so bowled over by seeing it in the flesh (or rather the flax) but it was a remarkable experience.The details are extraordinary – right down to the mace flourished in battle by Bishop Odo (soon to become the Earl of Kent), William the Conqueror’s half-brother. According to the excellent audioguide, he had chosen this club-like weapon to finesse one of the stickier points of medieval theology: “A prelate wasn’t allowed to draw blood but he could knock people out.”• The trip was provided by Inntravel, whose self-guided Bayeux \u0026amp Beaches of Normandy tour includes six nights’ B\u0026ampB, four dinners, cycle hire, maps and luggage transfer and costs from £945pp excluding transport (or from £1,175pp with train travel from London to Bayeux from £1,020pp self-drive, including Dover-Calais ferry electric bike £80 extra).

Here’s its 23 episodes so far, from worst to bestAn hour of television so relentlessly dour that it leaves nothing for anyone to cling to. Andrea Riseborough plays a surly murderer forced to cover her tracks as she goes on another surly murder spree. The scene where she murders a blind baby with a hammer that’s still dripping with gore from his father’s skull remains the epitome of Black Mirror’s off-putting tendency to be nasty for the sake of it.A compilation of half-thought-out, sub-Saw morality tales that tread so much worn ground (a woman’s consciousness is transferred into an abandoned toy, a murderer is turned into a hologram that can be repeatedly electrocuted) that it teeters on the edge of self-parody. Plus, and this is rare for Black Mirror, it’s so pleased with itself that you just want to punch it.The end of this episode – in which hackers blackmail a boy for masturbating to porn – is the television equivalent of being beaten over the head with an especially stupid rock. The boy murders a man. The hackers release the masturbation footage anyway. There’s a montage of people crying and screaming to Radiohead’s most overblown song, and then it turns out that the boy was watching child porn all along. A conveyor belt of Charlie Brooker’s worst excesses, this is an episode that feels as if it was made by a broken Black Mirror algorithm.Miley Cyrus plays Britney Spears, had Britney inexplicably decided to download her entire personality into a Furby. It’s hard to see what the message of this episode is – Fame is hard? Managers are evil? Pop music is bad? – and even harder to care.Black Museum, but festive. Every idea here – what if you could download someone’s personality into a thing? What if you could block someone, but with your brain? – appears in other Black Mirror episodes in a more satisfying form.Points scored for preempting the rise in populist non-politicians – here, a wiseacre cartoon bear becomes an unlikely political figurehead – but points lost for execution. Especially the climax, where the man who controlled the bear suddenly finds himself homeless and truncheoned in a dystopian police state, which is a little bit of a leap.A soldier stalks the earth, murdering a number of grotesque mutant monsters. But wait, what if those monsters were just normal people disguised by an augmented reality chip in the soldier’s head? Bet you didn’t see that coming, did you? Except you did, right from the very first frame.Black Mirror isn’t exactly a series that shies away from a heavy-handed metaphor, but the climax of this Jodie Foster-directed story – where a girl literally beats her mother to death with an iPad – is so hilariously on the nose that it has to be self-satire. Because, if it isn’t, hoo boy.Black Mirror is often written off as: “What if phones, but too much?” However, in Smithereens, Andrew Scott updates this to: “What if acting, but too much?” There are moments of scenery chewing in Smithereens that would put locust plagues to shame, but underneath that is a very simple and fairly effective hostage thriller that works right up until you realise that its larger message is literally just: “Wow, people look at their phones a lot.”Another episode about an augmented reality chip, although this fares much better than Men Against Fire because it forgoes any Important Message About the World in favour of flat-out genre silliness. This is a horror story, plain and simple, and Brooker clearly has fun splashing around with all its campy conventions.Your tolerance for White Bear will largely depend on your tolerance for unexplained screaming, because that’s what most of this episode consists of. There is crying, and then there’s screaming and then there’s more crying. The late-stage twist – our protagonist is a murderer who had her memory wiped so that the public can punish her anew every day – is just about clever enough to justify all the preceding noise.In a dystopian future, the only way out of poverty is to debase yourself on television. The protagonist, when given his shot on TV, breaks down and embarks on a Howard Beale rant about how vapid and awful television is. The rant connects with audiences, and he’s rewarded with a sanitised television show of his own. Brooker and his co-writer wife Konnie Huq call this ‘The Screenwipe story’, for good reason.Black Mirror’s first feature-length episode is about a swarm of robot bees that murder people who unknowingly use certain hashtags. However, hokey premise aside, this is a smart and well-executed police procedural that is much more gripping than you’d expect.The robot dog one. Shot in black and white and just 41 minutes long, Metalhead is a model of gleaming propulsion. All you need to know – and all you’re told – is that the dogs are out to kill the humans. The rest of the episode is taut and dread-filled and benefits hugely from any lack of real explanation. Metalhead is the Terminator version of White Bear, and all the better for it.The episode that started it all is still a very good beginner’s guide to Black Mirror. There’s an outlandish premise (the prime minster must have sex with a pig on TV) with an overcooked message (it’s a stunt masterminded to draw attention to society’s obsession with the media) that has moments of true transcendence (the waves of glee and horror and pity that pass through the audience in real time). A high watermark.Easily the best of the newest Black Mirror batch, Striking Vipers uses its cast of Marvel stars to tell a sweetly unexpected story. Two old friends discover that a VR videogame allows them to explore their feelings for one another in a new and interesting way. Despite its tendency to go dark, Black Mirror’s best episodes have a core of pure humanity. This is one of the most human stories yet.And this is another. At its worst (see the ending of The Waldo Moment), Black Mirror suffers from a berserk desire for catastrophe. Here, though, the opposite is true. We’re introduced to a hellish dating app, which tells the daters exactly how long their relationship will last as soon as they meet. Our heroes try to escape their fate, but find themselves trapped in a miserable labyrinth of stern authoritarianism. Then, just when all hope is lost, the episode pulls out and reveals that rarest of things: a happy Black Mirror ending. Wonders may never cease.Black Mirror’s fourth season introduced itself in a Technicolor blast a big-budget, all-star reimagining of Star Trek that quickly descends into a very necessary deconstruction of toxic fandom. It’s not only one of the best arguments for Black Mirror upping and leaving for Netflix – honestly, try to imagine this on a Channel 4 budget – but one of the best episodes altogether. It’s gripping and timely, but it’s also very funny and doesn’t end on an abject bummer. Amazing.Written by Peep Show’s Jesse Armstrong, this is possibly the most agonising Black Mirror yet. Set in a world where everyone is basically fitted with a cerebral dashcam, it revolves around a single suspicion of infidelity that balloons into all-consuming terror. By the conclusion, when years of secrets and betrayals have been permanently smashed to pieces in unsparing detail, you feel as if you’ve been beaten to a pulp.Even if you hated this episode – I didn’t, but others did – you cannot fault its ambition. A Choose Your Own Adventure-style interactive story about the creation of a video game, the simple existence of Bandersnatch is the result of herculean toil from a team as big as an army. Credit must go to Brooker for deploying it with such verve, too. Not many writers could get away with debuting a new type of storytelling by direct critiquing its limitations as brazenly as he did. The moment where “Netflix” appears as an interactive option, for example, is just sublime.Everyone loves San Junipero. It’s won Baftas and Emmys and GLAAD awards, and appeared at the top of several lists like this. And for good reason, too. It’s absolutely beautiful. It’s futuristic and nostalgic. It’s bleak and hopeful. It features characters who aren’t just empty cyphers for techno-misery. San Junipero was arguably the episode that pushed Black Mirror over the top for many viewers. It’s a triumph.However, I still prefer Nosee. A critique of Uber-style ratings, where your socioeconomic status hangs upon the scores you receive from other people, Nosee plays out like an episode of Fawlty Towers. Bryce Dallas Howard’s transformation from careful perfectionist to furious prisoner is beautifully weighted. Even better, since it was co-written by Mike Schur, it’s hard not to retrospectively see this as a direct precursor to The Good Place.But then there’s Be Right Back. A near-perfect demonstration of all that Black Mirror can be, Be Right Back transcends its slightly overused premise – let’s put someone’s personality into a thing – to create something that’s tender and funny and intimate and sad. Hayley Atwell and Domhnall Gleeson are perfect as two lovers separated by death. This was the first time that Black Mirror proved it could be something other than unstoppably harrowing, and it has yet to be bettered."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e6a81880f8d0f19cac863c258ef92aef84ba9ea/0_64_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb839766aeb05c3c613e626eb90d8b6f","title":"centre left social democrats set to win in denmark elections","story":"Danes follow Nordic trend away from populism but leader Mette Frederiksen could struggle to form coalitionAlthough the Social Democrat-led “red bloc” of leftist parties won 91 seats in the 179-seat Folketing, against 75 for Rasmussen’s rival “blue bloc”, Mette Frederiksen, the Social Democrat leader, has said she intends to form a minority government with ad hoc support from parties across the spectrum.Forming a coalition could prove difficult as other parties on the left mostly do not back the Social Democrats’ controversial immigration policies. Frederiksen has also rejected a proposal from Rasmussen to enter a “grand coalition” with his Liberals, although the two biggest parties have a majority between them.Rasmussen conceded defeat on Wednesday night, saying he would hand his government’s resignation to Queen Margrethe on Thursday. “As things stand, Mette Frederiksen has a chance to form a government,” he said. “I don’t think it will be easy for her.” He said he would be “standing by the phone” for eventual coalition talks.Frederiksen told a victory party that Denmark had “chosen a new majority, and a new direction … After tonight, we will put welfare first in Denmark again. Welfare, climate, education, children, future. Think of what we can do together. We now have the hope to change Denmark.”The centre-left party focused its campaign on climate issues and the defence of Denmark’s prized welfare state, promising to reverse years of spending cuts to education and healthcare, and maintain its tough approach on immigration.Long a benchmark for welfare, the Nordic social model has come under increasing pressure in recent years due to ageing populations. In Denmark, reforms have led to economic growth above the EU average, but successive budget cuts have left more people paying for services that used to be free.Finland’s Social Democrats narrowly won elections in April on a promise to raise taxes to increase social spending levels, while Sweden’s centre-left party held on to power last year by pledging welfare reforms.Denmark’s mainstream parties have in recent years adopted hardline anti-immigration policies previously the preserve of the far right, which immigrants and human rights campaigners believe have led to a rise in racist abuse and discrimination.But Frederiksen has refused to accept criticism of her position on immigration. The Social Democrats have backed many of the restrictive immigration measures passed by the outgoing government, most of them at the instigation – and with the parliamentary support – of the far-right DPP.These have included a ban on wearing the Islamic burqa and niqab in public, as well as a widely-criticised “jewellery bill” allowing police to seize refugees’ valuables to help pay the cost of their treatment by the state. Both the Social Democrats and Liberals have argued that stricter immigration policies were needed to protect the welfare system.The nationalist, anti-immigration DPP, which has heavily influenced Denmark’s politics over the past two decades by supporting successive centre-right governments in exchange for tighter immigration policies, has lost support as the mainstream parties have increasingly adopted its discourse."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67bdf947e2ff0d07fe8bc67da78137dbf4baa78e/0_56_4189_2514/master/4189.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8f3b2a1fb169af5cc0670df2221a148d","title":"high heels at work are necessary says japan labour minister","story":"Ministry responds to #KuToo petition calling for end to women having to wear heels at workJapan’s health and labour minister has defended workplaces that require women to wear high heels to work, arguing it is “necessary and appropriate” after a petition was filed against the practice.The remark came when Takumi Nemoto was asked to comment on a petition by a group of women who want the government to ban workplaces from requiring female jobseekers and employees to wear high heels.“It is socially accepted as something that falls within the realm of being occupationally necessary and appropriate,” Nemoto told a legislative committee on Wednesday.The petition was submitted to the labour ministry on Tuesday. The campaign has been dubbed \u001d#KuToo, a play on words from the Japanese word “kutsu”, meaning shoes, and “kutsuu”, meaning “pain”. It is also a reference to the global \u001d#MeToo movement against sexual abuse.The movement was launched by the actor and freelance writer Yumi Ishikawa and quickly won support from thousands of people online.Campaigners say wearing high heels in Japan is near-obligatory when job hunting or working in many Japanese companies.Some campaigners describe high heels as akin to modern-day foot-binding, while others have urged a broader loosening of dress codes in Japan, where business suits for men are ubiquitous in the workplace.In 2015, the director of the Cannes film festival apologised after a controversy blew up over women being denied access to the red carpet for not wearing high heels. But Cannes kept the dress code, despite a protest by the Hollywood superstar Julia Roberts who went barefoot the next year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b4b2a7d01051d8712e49cd936c5c4cadf0e70a0/301_147_2501_1501/master/2501.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d5de601122163d8170d996efd8da21ed","title":"thailand military backed pm prayuth chan ocha voted in after junta creates loose coalition","story":"Prayuth Chan-ocha to lead government with slim majority after weeks of backroom talksThe former head of Thailand’s military junta has been selected as the country’s next prime minister, securing the military’s already tight grip on power after the first Thai election in eight years.Prayuth Chan-ocha, who has been PM for the past five years after a military coup in 2014, will lead a coalition government. He was voted back in on Wednesday by the newly formed democratic parliament.Prayuth’s confirmation as prime minister came after more than 12 hours of deliberations by MPs. He was not present for the debate or the late-night vote.Phalang Pracharat, the political party that operates as a proxy for the military, had earlier cobbled together a ruling coalition that has a slim parliamentary majority, with 254 seats in the 500-seat lower house.Wednesday’s developments confirmed what many had feared, that an election supposed to signal Thailand’s return to democracy would lead to a continuation of military rule.Prayuth’ previous term was defined by the jailing of critics, a ban on protests and political activity and the suppression of free speech and free media.Most had expected the military coalition deal, in which the medium-sized Democrat and Bhumjaithai parties and 16 small entities agreed to unite with Phalang Pracharat, but it has taken weeks of backroom negotiations to secure, suggesting an uneasy and unwieldy alliance.The Democrat party, Thailand’s oldest and most traditional party, had been particularly resistant to joining the coalition, because senior party figures feared the long-term consequences of aligning themselves with the military. Running against Prayuth for prime minister was Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit, the head of the progressive Future Forward party. He was put forward by the Democratic Front alliance of seven parties, including Future Forward and the pro-democracy party Pheu Thai. The alliance will form a united opposition.Pheu Thai, which is affiliated with the populist former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, won most seats in the election but not enough to form a majority government.The odds were heavily weighed in favour of Prayuth’s return. According to the Thai constitution, written by the junta in 2016, the prime minister is voted for by both the elected lower house and the unelected senate, which has 250 members appointed by the junta. Prayuth secured an easy victory with 500 votes to Thanathorn’s 244, with four abstentions.Thanathorn’s repeated efforts to stand up to the military have cost him already. On the eve of parliament’s opening two weeks ago, Thailand’s constitutional court ruled to suspend him from his duties as an MP while it investigates him for violating election law.If he is found guilty, he will be banned from politics completely.The election on 24 March was dogged by allegations of irregularities, fraud and accusations that the military had manipulated the results. Future Forward MPs reported being offered up to 120 million baht (£3m) by Phalang Pracharat to switch sides and it took 45 days for the official results to be declared, which was unprecedented in Thailand."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7eac5a984e00881f3f81a5b39750bf93cf02eab0/0_330_4951_2971/master/4951.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=22cc8c4c4603bab2f8da4d4493dc25f1","title":"washington urges riyadh to end military crackdown in sudan","story":"Washington takes unusual step of calling on kingdom to bring about end to military crackdownThe thorny question of Saudi Arabian political influence across the Middle East and Africa is back in the spotlight again with Washington taking the unusual step of effectively telling Riyadh to end Sudan’s military crackdown.In an unusual public statement the US state department revealed that its undersecretary for political affairs, the diplomat David Hale, had phoned the Saudi deputy defence minister, Khaled bin Salman, to ask him to use the country’s influence to end the brutal repression against peaceful protesters by the Sudanese Transitional Military Council (TMC) in Sudan.It has hardly been a secret that Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have gained influence in Sudan following the overthrow of the dictator Omar al-Bashir in April. Critics of Saudi Arabia will see a pattern of behaviour, evident in Libya and Yemen, in which Saudi Arabia moves to marginalise rivals Iran and Qatar, as well as to install autocratic regimes built on repression.But it is rare for the Americans, normally so close to Saudi Arabia on regional issues, to make so public their representations to Riyadh on the need for civilian rule and for democracy to run its course.Saudi Arabia may claim the Sudanese crackdown was an independent judgment by the interim leader, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, but the army general has in recent weeks paid visits to Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Egypt.More importantly the deputy president of the council, Mohamed Hamdan Dagolo, the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) militia leader known as Hemedti, met the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, in Jeddah on 24 May, and pledged to stand with the kingdom against all threats, including Iran. He vowed Sudanese troops would continue fighting alongside Saudi Arabia against the Houthi rebels in Yemen.Dagolo is widely seen as the true decision-maker in Khartoum, and the figure behind moves to stall negotiations about the transition to democracy and resist protesters’ demands that they be included in the transitional body.That Dagolo chose Riyadh for his first overseas trip since the fall of Bashir was hardly surprising. In April Saudi Arabia pledged to provide $3bn in funds to Khartoum, a move designed to stabilise the exchange rate and strengthen the military.Until recently there was no sign that the US disapproved of its great ally gaining influence in Sudan. The US made no complaint when, on 30 May, Sudanese security officers notified al-Jazeera’s office in Khartoum saying the military council had decided to withdraw the Qatari state-owned TV network’s work permits without providing an official reason. The shutdown came as the authorities began a clampdown against a protest camp in the capital.But the scale of the bloody assault on the Khartoum protesters this week led to a change in tone in Washington, and an irritation if not exasperation with Saudi foreign policy.The US national security adviser, John Bolton, tweeted: “The unprovoked violence of Sudan’s security forces against peaceful demonstrators in Khartoum is abhorrent. The TMC must respect the right to peaceful demonstration and speed transition to a civilian-led government, which the Sudanese people have rightfully demanded.” The tweet was followed by the publicised call between Hale and bin Salman.Yet the involvement of Saudi and the UAE, the leading Sunni “counter revolutionary” states, is part of a wider pattern of jostling for influence across the mainly Muslim Horn of Africa. Between 2000 and 2017, Gulf states invested $13bn in the region, mainly in Sudan and Ethiopia, according to a study by the Clingendael Institute, a thinktank in the Netherlands.Broadly, on one side lies Qatar and Turkey, and on the other the counter-revolutionary states opposed to Islamism. At stake is the capture of strategic ports, improved maritime security, and privileged access to the rapidly emerging economies.Saudi has been particularly active across the Horn of Africa and instrumental last autumn in negotiating a peace treaty between Ethiopia and Eritrea. Abiy Ahmed, Ethiopia’s prime minister, was given $3bn in aid and investments from the UAE upon taking office in April 2018, including a $1bn deposit in the country’s central bank. In Yemen again it is the UAE and Saudi Arabia that head a coalition that has led to a four-year civil war aimed at reinstalling Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, as leader. Hadi spends most of his time in Riyadh and is no poster boy for democracy but Saudi will not abandon the war, regardless of the casualties, because it regards Iranian-backed Houthis as a permanent security threat.Equally in Libya, where a bloody military stalemate persists in Tripoli, Marshall Khalifa Haftar by most accounts would not have tried to seize the capital in defiance of a UN peace plan without UAE military hardware, and Saudi political backing.The question now is whether in Sudan, unlike Libya and Yemen, the US government is prepared to do more than simply dial Riyadh once."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3bb3196fffb3a5abaea563be223329e92ba1c496/637_423_3309_1984/master/3309.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ab0fae64d0406cd48e14f6cac738af33","title":"aung san suu kyi finds common ground with viktor orban over islam","story":"On a rare trip to Europe, Myanmar leader and Hungary PM discuss issue of ‘growing Muslim populations’From her failure to speak out against ethnic cleansing to imprisoning journalists, the reputation of Aung San Suu Kyi in the west has taken a battering in recent months.But the leader of Myanmar has found a new ally in far-right, staunchly anti-immigrant Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán.In a rare trip to Europe, state counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, the Nobel peace prize laureate who was once the figurehead of the fight for democracy in Myanmar, met Orbán in Budapest. There, the two leaders found common ground on the subject of immigration and Islam .“The two leaders highlighted that one of the greatest challenges at present for both countries and their respective regions – south-east Asia and Europe – is migration,” read a statement released after their meeting.“They noted that both regions have seen the emergence of the issue of co-existence with continuously growing Muslim populations.”Once lauded as the great democratic hope for Myanmar, Aung San Suu Kyi, who was elected as civilian leader in 2015 after living under house arrest by the military for 15 years, has proved a marked disappointment to most western governments who were her champions.Her failure to condemn the military’s violent crackdown on the Muslim Rohingya minority in 2017 – which saw thousands of Rohingya raped and killed in what the UN described as an exercise in ethnic cleansing – and her defence of the military’s brutal actions against Myanmar’s Muslims have proved particularly contentious.Aung San Suu Kyi’s government has since repeatedly failed to offer assurances to the million Rohingya now living in refugee camps in Bangladesh, where they fled over the border for safety, that if they return their security and pathway to citizenship would be guaranteed.Orban, meanwhile, has an equally bad track record. His government declared a “a crisis situation due to mass immigration” in 2015, stirring up fear in Hungary over an alleged threat of migrants. The Council of Europe’s commissioner for human rights released a recent report accusing Orbán’s government of using anti-migrant rhetoric that fuels “xenophobic attitudes, fear and hatred”.Aung San Suu Kyi has increasingly spoken out against the imposition of western ideas and principles in Myanmar, a view which was reflected by Orbán in the statement released after their meeting, where he emphasised his rejection of the “export of democracy” from other western countries.A spokesperson for the Myanmar government could not be reached for comment.Aung San Suu Kyi’s trip to central Europe was with the aim to strengthen economic ties in the region. Prior to Hungary, she visted the Czech Republic where she met with Prime Minister Andrej Babiš."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74cf4ae090b1e1c75d6759a27b5b783738ddc184/0_149_4064_2438/master/4064.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=93e370b43e095b81421775cf5c93ea8d","title":"thursday briefing young people locked into small town prospects","story":"Today’s rent too high in cities where they might earn more … Ford expected to close Bridgend plant … and Cornish town seeks new GPHello, it’s Warren Murray reading you in this morning.Tens of thousands of French and foreign visitors have converged on the Normandy coast for this year’s commemorations to honour the dwindling number of firsthand witnesses to the fighting. Justin Trudeau will attend a ceremony at Juno beach, where Canadian forces were in charge of the assault. On 6 June 1944, now known as the “longest day”, 156,000 troops landed on the beaches chosen for the D-day invasion, most of them American, British and Canadian. It remains the largest amphibious assault in history, claiming the lives of an estimated 4,400 troops in the first day alone.Bad news for Bridgend – Ford is planning to close its Bridgend engine plant in Wales, with the likely loss of about 1,700 jobs. The announcement is expected today at the plant, which has been making engines since 1980. Cost-cutting by Ford across Europe, the end of the plant’s contract to make engines for Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), and of course Brexit are thought to be factors in the decision. Honda has announced the closure of its Swindon plant in 2021 while Nissan has scrapped plans to built its X-Trail model at Sunderland. JLR, Britain’s biggest carmaker, is also cutting jobs. The Unite union is due to meet with Ford management this morning.Trump tramples Troubles – Donald Trump has managed to compare Ireland’s post-Brexit border dilemma to the US border with Mexico. The US president, sitting next to a visibly uncomfortable taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, said: “I think it will all work out very well, and also for you with your wall, your border.” Varadkar interjected that Ireland wished to avoid a border or a wall. “I think you do, I think you do,” Trump said. “The way it works now is good, you want to try and to keep it that way.” The awkward meeting at Shannon airport took part amid a heavy police and security presence in Ireland with the visit by Trump, unpopular in the country, the subject of protests in Shannon and Dublin. Today, Trump will travel to France for D-day commemorations before returning to his currently barricaded golf and hotel resort in Doonbeg, County Clare, and then going home.Denmark’s mainstream parties have in recent years adopted hardline anti-immigration policies previously the preserve of the far right. Frederiksen has defended her party’s backing for many of the restrictive immigration measures passed by the outgoing government, mostly instigated and supported by the DPP. Most of the other “red bloc” parties do not back the Social Democrats’ immigration policies, so coalition-making looks tricky.Surrogacy reform overdue – Laws governing surrogacy should be updated to allow intended parents to assume the status of legal parents as soon as a baby is born, rather than having to wait months, according to the law commissions of England, Wales and Scotland. Their consultation recommends ending the requirement for intended parents to have a genetic link to the child. Profit-seeking surrogacy agencies should remain banned, the commission’s report suggests, while calling for public views on surrogacy payments. The consultation also calls for a national register allowing those born through surrogacy access to information about their conception. Current surrogacy laws are unchanged since the 1980s.Fish and scripts – The Cornish fishing village of Mevagissey is looking for a new GP. Dr Katherine James has announced she will be handing back her contract to run the local surgery on 31 July and it is feared 5,300 patients will be forced to travel elsewhere for treatment.The town has launched a campaign – hashtag #willyoubemygp – aiming to woo doctors with picturesque, winding streets, friendly folk and superior fish and chips. In a campaign video posted on the Cornwall Channel, a crowd of residents chant: “Be our GP. We are a lovely community. We need you.” Dr Marlene Behennah, Mevagissey-born and a doctor at the surgery for 30 years until 2002, said she was “very very sad” the surgery might close. “I mean, this is my life’s work.”Lily Kuo, the ’s Beijing bureau chief, discusses reporting on the hundreds of other Chinese cities that were involved in the student protests in 1989.

It fits the facts – across developed economies, the biggest rise in inequality since 1945 occurred in the US and UK from 1980 onwards.But that explanation, writes Jonathan Aldred, is too top-down: it is all about what politicians and other elites do to us, and looks like a convenient myth that lets us avoid thinking about another possibility: that through our electoral choices and decisions in daily life we have supported rising inequality, or at least acquiesced in it. “Inequality is unlikely to fall much in the future unless our attitudes turn unequivocally against it. Among other things, we will need to accept that how much people earn in the market is often not what they deserve, and that the tax they pay is not taking from what is rightfully theirs.”English football lurched back to the bad old days on Wednesday night when hundreds of supporters were baton-charged by riot police after hurling bottles and goading officers at a fan zone in Porto. Meanwhile, Cristiano Ronaldo’s two late goals, added to a first-half effort, gave Portugal a 3-1 win in the Nations League semi-final after Switzerland.

Mexican and American officials claimed progress in White House talks late on Wednesday but Donald Trump declared it was “not nearly enough” to halt the import taxes he wants to impose if the flow of migrants to America’s southern border is not addressed. The IMF managing director, Christine Lagarde, has told Reuters that escalating tariff threats are sapping business and market confidence, and could slow growth that is currently expected to improve next year.

Their destruction, fuelled by rampant consumption and obsession with economic growth, is accelerating.“The evidence is crystal clear: nature is in trouble. Therefore we are in trouble,” declared Sandra Díaz, who co-chaired the completion of a global assessment of bioersity published this week.There is a dual threat to life on Earth: species loss and climate change. The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Bioersity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) ranked the main factors causing species loss: changes in land and sea use exploitation of organisms climate change pollution and invasive alien species.These are “eroding the foundations of our economies, livelihoods, food security, health and quality of life worldwide”, and climate breakdown could soon become the main driver.Nature is being destroyed at such a rate that a million species are at risk. On the day the IPBES report made headlines, Dr Allan Mee of the Golden Eagle Trust checked for sightings of the Ring Ouzel in the MacGillycuddy’s Reeks in Co Kerry, one of just two of its remaining habitats in Ireland. “No birds located. Sad but likely witnessing local extinction of the species, once found in 28 Irish counties,” he tweeted. Pádraic Fogarty of the Irish Wildlife Trust replied: “This is mass extinction unfolding before our eyes.”How is the potentially lethal cocktail of bioersity loss and climate disruption going to impact on coming generations in contrasting parts of the globe? Equally, what does it mean for an animal that dominates the Irish landscape (the cow), and the majestic lion, not critically endangered yet rapidly disappearing?The baby born in IrelandConscious of what the next generation is facing, Australian Jim Scheer helped set up the FridaysForFuture climate action movement in Ireland, which is driven by young people. As for the babies of today, “their freedom is limited”, he believes. As a child, “the most I had to worry about was, ‘is there air in the tyres of my bike?’” he says.They are facing a whole different world of realities, a place where the First World problem of “where will I go on my holidays?” may be replaced by “where is my next meal coming from?”The issues weigh heavily on the current generation of young people, he believes, which is why “coming together to grieve” – a feature of recent protests – matters, and is part of telling the truth. There is much frustration too at the inaction of elders.“Uncertain” is the future of that child, says climate activist Dr Lorna Gold. Hope is emerging through the climate movement but, looking at the timelines required for transformational shift, there is “more and more uncertainty”.Children growing up in Ireland will be relatively protected, by location, wealth and assets they will have access to, “but even in the best-case scenario, it will be a diminished world.”This will be due to loss of species and a more complicated world, disrupted by climate and associated conflict, where Dr Gold fears the freedom to explore and travel in relative peace is undermined. It’s a place of learning from the internet rather than real life. The pluses will be better local connectedness with “their own earth” and nearby food production.That Irish child will never hear the corncrake or the curlew, says climatologist Prof John Sweeney, and, as they grow, they will be confronted with hard choices on lifestyle and mobility. The fossil fuel-driven car will be forced out by regulation, he says, but different ways of getting off the island, for example, will be needed if aviation does not overcome its emissions issues.By mid-century, most will live in green cities with an almost total absence of the private car. The transport revolution will be in urban areas but slower to come to the countryside until battery technology improves, Sweeney notes.A near zero-carbon world will mean less air pollution. Clean energy in their home and workplace will mainly come from offshore wind.A downside will be more extreme weather events attributable to climate change more intense storms and rainfall, increased flooding with sea level rises – and yet water shortages in summer.The child born today in Ireland – and the adult they become – will cope far better than their counterpart elsewhere.The developing world babyA baby born today in a developing country, on the other hand, will be at the frontline of climate disruption, says Christian Aid Ireland policy and advocacy adviser Jennifer Higgins. They will have to contend with stronger cyclones, warmer days and nights, more unpredictable rains and longer heatwaves.“Here in Ireland we will have the resources and ability to adapt and deal with these unprecedented weather events, but in many parts of the world, going to Tesco to stock up on sliced pan won’t be a possibility.”They will be the ones who will suffer the worst consequences of our inaction on climate change. “Sustained periods of unseasonably heavy rain can have a damaging impact on agriculture, causing the loss of topsoil and serious nutrient leaching,” says Higgins.In Ireland, save for the odd hosepipe ban, water is always on tap for domestic, industrial and agricultural use. “But in the developing world, where most people depend on agriculture to earn a living or just stay alive, it’s a scarce and precious resource.”Those living in coastal regions will suffer a loss of coral reefs, which half a billion people rely on for fish. For those born among indigenous communities in tropical rainforests, not only will they lose their homeland – already being eroded by increasing industrialisation – but there will be loss of habitat that acts as the lungs of the earth and regulates rainfall.Children will be most susceptible to the increasing diseases that a changing climate will leave in its wake, she adds. Their education may be disrupted when schools are used as shelters when disaster hits their communities.If temperatures increase in already hot areas, it will diminish scarce resources to sustain life and will force many to become refugees.But this may “dwarf numbers caused by conflict or political and economic necessity. When their land becomes uninhabitable because of drought, flood or sea-level rise, they will have to seek a safer place to live,” Higgins predicts.It may be a world where techniques such as conservation agriculture transform crop production and smartphone technology helps drive rural economies backed by deployment of cheap solar PV. But extreme weather events will continue to threaten food production, as seen with recent cyclones in southern Africa.Gold fears a business-as-usual approach means such circumstances can become an intractable problem very quickly, and says solutions are beyond most communities on cost grounds. Therefore the child is facing increased malnutrition, chronic hunger, dependency on external aid, and political instability – an existence marked by inequality and injustice.The IPBES report starkly outlines how indigenous peoples and the poorest are most reliant on land and sea for survival. The combination of land grabs by multinationals facilitated by corrupt governments, extreme climate events and bioersity loss add up to a very bleak future for their offspring, Gold concludes.The future of the cow Humans are not the only beings whose lives will change. The IPBES report emphasises that the effects will be felt first among animals and other living things.In Ireland, there are currently more cattle than people, and they are the most common large animal. For many, the cow (for beef and milk) is the bellwether of Irish agriculture and rural life. For others, it’s the problem because of associated carbon emissions.Teagasc’s head of communications, Eric Donald, says cattle numbers are currently a matter for inidual farmers. With no quotas, no policy instruments are in place. In future we are likely to have fewer beef and more dairy cattle.On emissions, Donald says there is wide acceptance of the need to implement mitigation measures – a process is already in train.Having a grass-based system to feed those cattle will be critical to sustainable farms from an environmental, economic and social perspective, Donald adds. Ireland will need to find export markets for 80 to 90 per cent of its product. Meat consumption may decrease on an inidual basis and there may be a shift to plant-based diets, but increased population growth will mean “demand won’t drop significantly”.But cattle will have to compete for space due to a more erse range of crops, land being used for bioenergy and afforestation (increasingly native woodlands and not just on marginal land) that will act as important carbon sinks, and hedgerows ensuring better bioersity and pollinator capacity.To question beef consumption may currently be an Irish “no-no”, but the reality is the consumers of tomorrow will be confronted by a wide range of new plant and synthetic proteins that will taste surprisingly good and be cheaper, which is likely to mean less red meat is consumed – in line with health guidelines.Eric Donald defends the pursuit of higher genetic quality as a means of increasing efficiency and lowering emissions, especially “because lifetime productivity is better”. With extending grazing seasons, it’s the key measure in improving farm sustainability guidelines. It also complements changes in fertiliser use and slurry management.But John Sweeney says the Irish cow is “reaching limits in terms of genetics”. Like pedigree dogs, they are less able to cope with change and stress compared with native species.Unquestionably, there will be fewer of them, he believes, “if we want to maintain bioersity for future generations”.Expansion in the cattle population has coincided with deterioration in water quality, with widespread glyphosate contamination (one study has found 20 per cent of Irish adults have traces of the herbicide in their urine), nitrates pollution and an emerging ammonia problem.“Continued expansion of the national herd is not compatible with this report. That’s where the crux comes.”The future of the lionJennifer Higgins joins in a lament for so many endangered mammals.Of all species threatened, IWT campaign officer Pádraic Fogarty is shocked by the latest indicators for hippos, giraffes and lions. In particular, “it would be an absolutely travesty if lions were to go extinct . . . The magnificent animal has permeated our culture and imagination, from children’s stories to the pillars on Trafalgar Square.”But maps don’t lie. In 1950 there were 400,000 lions in the wild. Today there are 23,000-39,000 lions in all of Africa, which is “extremely low” in global terms, when once they lived in Ancient Greece and North Africa, and became extinct in Greece only around 100BC.Outside of southern Africa, numbers of lions in 23 unfenced reserves in 11 countries are estimated to have dropped by 62 per cent between 1993 and 2014. Asia is home to a small subpopulation in the Indian state of Gujarat, where numbers are growing, but it’s just a pin on the globe.“There is no data to say that lions are about to disappear, but their populations are shrinking fast,” he explains. The species is classified as vulnerable but the slide into the “endangered” and then “critically endangered” categories looms, while “threatened with extinction” is applied to its current status.For Fogarty, the same pressures apply to other mammals, but the lion’s wellbeing is further undermined by gametrophy hunting and false western-world notions that it is somehow good for population numbers. All told, we are facing a scenario where lions will “shrink to a few corners of the planet”.What to doThis is not going to be sorted by putting bird tables in back gardens. The Ipbes report shows nature-based solutions can help bring “transformative change”, but there is a greater systemic problem.In the past 50 years, the human population has doubled, the global economy has grown nearly four-fold, and global trade has grown tenfold, together driving up the demands for energy, food and materials.Thinking that endless economic growth is possible and not valuing the essential services provided by nature is a delusion leading to catastrophe, Sweeney believes.“Until we get away from euros and cents and GDP, we will be in a cul-de-sac . . . Unless we rethink how we value the services provided by the natural world and include them explicitly in a wellbeing measure, we delude ourselves that a sustainable future is possible.”That was the core message in a submission this week to EU leaders meeting on the future of Europe by the European Environmental Bureau (EEB) and more than 200 academics, including John Sweeney, policy experts and civil society groups.There is an onus too on iniduals to act, according to EEB vice president Attracta Uí Bhroin. “It’s not enough for us to sit on the sofa and watch David Attenborough’s latest breathtaking and terrifying documentary and shake our heads. Every politician coming near your front door needs to know environmental sustainability is your priority, and must be Europe’s priority.”Fogarty hopes people now see the connections between climate breakdown and mass extinction, that they are two sides of the same coin. “We have all of the solutions to hand, but what we’ve been lacking is any sense of urgency to get on with it.”He senses momentum moving in the right direction, though the lack of a response from the Taoiseach or any Government minister “makes me feel that they are still hoping it’s an issue that will go away. We can’t really afford this level of disengagement when we need to be getting on with things.”Scheer is brutally frank about future voters born today. “I don’t think people get a choice of what games they play.”They will have to be focused on survival. “It feels as we have handed them a shitstorm.”As for the current generation, too many are stuck in business-as-usual mode. There is a need to raise consciousness quickly. “Ignorance is not a choice” given the IPBES report. “It’s not an opinion, it’s scientific. It’s happening.”Kevin O\u0027Sullivan is Environment and Science Editor and former Editor of The "},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Police believe William McCormick, last seen in Comber on Thursday, was murderedVaradkar says talks with Trump at Shannon Airport included Ireland\u0026rsquos trade surplus with USEric and Donald jnr claim Irish support for their father\u0026rsquos visit \u0026lsquooutweighed\u0026rsquo protests \u0026lsquoby 10 to 1\u0026rsquoRoss permitted more than 1,000 military overflights and landings in 2018Redistribution of tax revenue to poorer homes \u0026lsquowould reduce income inequality\u0026rsquoSome 25 flights carrying explosives from US to Afghanistan went through State since 2014D\u0026uacuten Laoghaire \u0026lsquorapid build\u0026rsquo project the first modular council housing scheme consideredPat McCormick (55) was last seen in Comber on Thursday May 30thAn international study, led by UCD researchers, created food and packaging prototypes from agricultural and food-processing wasteNESC report focuses on public transport and higher density housingHigh security in Clare as US president spends night at his Doonbeg resort after Varadkar meetingHSE accused of releasing price rise details on day Donald Trump visited IrelandCampaign aims for adoption of tariff-based release system to set minimum sentencesPhilip Douglas (31) jailed for three years after cocaine and MDMA worth \u0026euro122,000 foundUS president compares Irish border issue with his proposed wall with MexicoGabriel Makhlouf facing an inquiry during last weeks in New Zealand finance ministryTwo garda\u0026iacute honoured in Spain for work tackling organised crimeVictim who was raped from when she was nine until she was aged 14, said \u0026lsquoit was part of my week\u0026rsquoNew research seems to undercut theories about ancestry of native North AmericansFirm estimates that to restart the project from scratch would set it back five years"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3915884.1559767960!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"more than 750 000 troops use irish airspace in five years","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUS troops at Shannon Airport call home shortly after arriving in 2006. File photograph: Matt KavanaghMore than 750,000 foreign troops, the vast majority from the US, have been given permission by the Government to pass through Irish airports or airspace in the past five years.Most of these flights have also carried weapons, though some changes introduced by the Minister for Transport Shane Ross when he took office in 2016 have seen certain types of munitions prohibited from flights passing through Ireland. These are explosives classed as “dangerous goods” under aviation law.However, Mr Ross permitted more than 1,000 overflights and landings last year, and the figures show that numbers are increasing. In the first four months of this year, permission was granted for 212 flights carrying weapons to fly through Irish airspace (one application was refused) and 190 flights were granted permission to land (one was refused).Typically, the flights are civilian aircraft that have been chartered by foreign militaries, usually the United States Air Force.The carriage of weapons is prohibited by air transport regulations, but the Minister for Transport is empowered to issue exemptions which were done at a rate of about 20 a week last year.The troops are usually en route to US bases in a variety of destinations, in Europe, the Middle East and Asia, including Afghanistan, or returning to the US.Military transportsMilitary transports are authorised under a separate system, where the Department of Foreign Affairs has the authority to grant permission to foreign military aircraft to land here or fly through Irish airspace.These are granted on the basis the aircraft is “unarmed, carries no arms, ammunition or explosives, is not engaged in intelligence gathering, and that the flight in question does not form any part of military exercises or operations”, the department says. However, the State does not carry out any inspections to ensure these conditions are being met. Most flights granted landing or overflight rights are from the US.Figures compiled by the Department of Foreign Affairs last year showed that, in addition to the civilian flights, there were more than 2,000 landings or overflights by military aircraft in 2017, the vast majority from the US.The facilitation of US use of Shannon and Irish airspace for military transports and flights has been routinely criticised by anti-war campaigners but has been continued by all governments."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3916069.1559769449!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"rising number of foreign troops passing through ireland","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUS troops at Shannon Airport in 2006. File photograph: Matt KavanaghThe number of foreign troops, the majority from the US, who have passed through Ireland or its airspace in civilian aircraft almost doubled between 2014 and last year, figures from the Department of Transport reveal.The number has increased from 101,029 in 2014 to 191,216 in the 10½ months to mid-November last.The figures show that more than 760,000 foreign troops travelled through Irish airports or airspace in the past five years in civilian aircraft chartered by foreign military.A total of 280,669 foreign troops landed at Irish airports while a further 486,256 flew overhead through Irish airspace in the period.More than 86,000 foreign troops landed at Irish airports in the first 10½ months of last year, the highest number in any of the five years for which figures were provided.Overall, more than 1,000 aircraft carrying troops andor munitions were granted permission to land in or overfly Ireland last year.Under Irish law, civilian flights carrying weapons must be given prior permission to overfly or land by the Minister for Transport.Some of the chartered planes that passed through Irish airspace since the start of 2014 included 25 flights carrying explosives from the US to Afghanistan, SA80 rifles going from the UK to Canada, semi-automatic rifles from the US to the UK, explosives and detonating fuses from the US to Qatar, bombs with bursting charge from the US to Germany, and 9mm Jericho pistols from the US to Ethiopia.When he became Minister for Transport in 2016, Shane Ross stopped granting permission for a small number of flights carrying explosives, his spokeswoman confirmed. However, this is a small fraction of the overall numbers of flights for which permission is granted. His spokeswoman confirmed that the policy change concerned only explosives, classed as “dangerous goods” under the regulations, while other weapons continue to travel through Ireland.In June 2016, a month after Mr Ross took office, airlines that routinely transported certain types of weapons were contacted by Department of Transport officials notifying them that the Minister would not be allowing “dangerous goods” to continue overfly Ireland or pass through airports here.A spokeswoman for the department said Mr Ross had used his discretion on about 10 occasions since taking office. Two of these decisions were taken on June 10th, 2016 when, despite officials in his own department and the Department of Foreign Affairs recommending the passage of Class 1 explosives, a rocket, small arms and cartridges through Irish airspace from the US to Afghanistan and of Class 1 explosives from the US to Germany, Mr Ross said no.Under international aviation rules, goods such as explosives, detonating fuses and smoke ammunition fall within the dangerous goods category but heavy machine guns, grenade launchers and other firearms are not considered as such once they are not loaded.There were 41 applications to transport these kinds of goods over the State in 2014 (26 granted) and 74 such applications in 2015 (46 granted). In the first four months of 2016, while Paschal Donohoe was minister for transport, nine of 14 applications were granted. However, in the latter part of the year, under Mr Ross, just five of 34 were approved.One of the 17 applications received in 2017 was approved, this was for an Irish Defence Forces plane leaving to participate in a UN mission in Lebanon, and none of the four applications received last year was sanctioned.DiscretionIn replies to parliamentary questions since, Mr Ross said he had used his discretion to refuse several applications, something which he noted had “rarely, if ever” been done in the past.“These applications related to the transport of munitions of war, categorised as dangerous goods, ie munitions of war that contain material that is explosive, corrosive, flammable, toxic,” he told the Dáil.However, a review of the administration of the law governing overflights and landings commissioned in 2017 has not been completed.The US military accounted for at least 93 per cent of all flights that passed through Irish airports or airspace, with the American troops going to 39 different countries. Most of these were either returning to the US (385,353) from a variety of locations around the world or travelling to Germany (184,435) where the US has its military headquarters in Europe.A large number of US troops also travelled to Kuwait (133,762), Jordan (2,212), the UAE (2,786) and Bahrain (2,186) – all of which are part of the US-backed and Saudi-led coalition involved in the war in Yemen. The US has also flown 1,798 troops to its military base in Djibouti, which is separated from Yemen by the Red Sea and is seen as a significant location on the route to the Suez Canal.Surprising destinationsThe flights that transited through Irish airports and airspace  four continents, with the US sending troops to some surprising destinations.For example, the US has sent 2,459 troops to Kyrgyzstan and a further 124 to neighbouring Tajikistan, both of which border the rival superpower China.Four flights carrying troops, their personal weapons and armoured vehicles all landed in Ireland en route to Iraq. Two flights carried 10 troops each while the other two, unusually, did not specify how many troops were on board. There were no flights to Iraq in any of the other years examined.Three flights carrying 790 US troops travelled to Russia. The first flight in 2014 was an overflight carrying 350 troops while the other two flights landed in Ireland on March 21st and 24th, 2017 before carrying the combined 440 troops on to Russia.These flights are in addition to the 2,759 requests made to the Department of Foreign Affairs between January 2014 and June 2018 for permission for military planes (as distinct from civilian flights chartered by foreign military) to land in Ireland. The US accounted for 2,350 (85 per cent) of these. The department declined when asked to provide more details surrounding these flights.“Arrangements under which permission is granted for foreign military aircraft to land at Irish airports are governed by strict conditions,” a spokesman said. “These routinely include stipulations that the aircraft must be unarmed, carry no arms, ammunition or explosives and must not engage in intelligence gathering, and that the flights in question must not form part of any military exercise or operation.”Longstanding agreementA tranche of diplomatic cables previously released by Wikileaks give an insight into the longstanding agreement between Ireland and the US to allow US military personal or munitions of war to fly over Ireland or land at Irish airports.“Shannon remains a key transit point for US troops and material bound for theatres in the global war on terror, while yielding diplomatic benefits for the Irish Government and significant revenues for the airport and regional economy,” says one cable sent by the then US ambassador to Ireland James Kenny, which was dated September 5th, 2006 and marked confidential.Foreign troops transiting Irish airports or passing through Irish airspace are permitted only on the basis that their personal weapons are not loaded and that the ammunition is secured to a point where it is inaccessible.However, questions have previously been raised by anti-war campaigners about the level of scrutiny placed by Irish authorities on flights chartered by foreign militaries. The Irish position is that the civilian aircraft are permitted to carry arms – as the above figures show – but that the military aircraft are granted permission on the basis that they are not carrying arms. However, there are no security checks on their contents of the planes that pass through Ireland."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3915847.1559753606!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"troops and munitions passing through ireland what is happening","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tProtestors march to Shannon Airport to protest about US military equipment and troops passing through the airport. Photograph: Alan BetsonHas Ireland always allowed munitions of war to pass through or over the State? No. The initial legislation governing munitions of war passing through Ireland dates back to the early years of the Free State. Article 26 of the Air Navigation (General) regulations 1930 explicitly prohibits the transportation of munitions of war, other than those of the Saorstát Éireann (Irish Free State).It was not until 1964 that the minister for transport was given discretion to decide if munitions of war could pass through or over Ireland.Where is this weaponry and equipment being transported to, and by whom? Civilian planes chartered by the US military going between the US and Afghanistan flew over Ireland most frequently between 2014 and last November. These were civilian aircraft chartered by the US military carrying weapons and other military equipment. While no troops bound for Afghanistan passed through Irish airports or airspace during that period, there were 65 overflights from the US that carried munitions of war. Fifty-seven of these flights were carrying what was classified as “dangerous goods” such as explosives, while others carried small arms, weapons cartridges and other materials. Weapons and equipment that passed through Irish airports or airspace were transported to 21 different countries around the world.What happens with actual military planes? The Department of Foreign Affairs is responsible for granting permission to military planes (as distinct from civilian flights chartered by foreign military) seeking to land in Ireland. The only available data for these planes shows the number of requests by country. Some 2,759 requests were made to the department between the start of 2014 and last June, with the US accounting for 2,350 (85 per cent) of these. When asked to provide more detail surrounding these flights, the department declined.“Arrangements under which permission is granted for foreign military aircraft to land at Irish airports are governed by strict conditions,” it said. “These routinely include stipulations that the aircraft must be unarmed, carry no arms, ammunition or explosives and must not engage in intelligence gathering, and that the flights in question must not form part of any military exercise or operation.”Has the State effectively banned such flights? There is no official protocol in place but the last flight to receive permission to overfly Ireland with “dangerous goods” on board was on July 17th, 2016 when Mr Ross approved the carriage of weapons cartridges and inert projectiles. Since then no other flight has transited through Ireland en route to Afghanistan, with Mr Ross refusing three subsequent requests for flights to Afghanistan. A month later he refused a seemingly identical flight carrying weapons cartridges and inert projectiles. In May 4th of last year he refused a flight carrying two igniters and cartridges, which are classed as “dangerous goods” and on October 2nd last he refused a flight carrying two helicopters.Why is nobody complaining? The amount of flights that it has affected by the banning of “dangerous goods” through Ireland is small enough to not make a significant difference, especially in relation to overflights. However, if this policy was to be extended to troops, there would be serious diplomatic connotations. The US government has consistently stressed the importance of Shannon Airport for the transport of American troops to “theatres of war” around the world.Does anyone in Dublin officialdom mind that this has happened? Officials at the Department of Transport said there was no opposition to the move and they passed on the message to airlines that routinely carried “dangerous goods” through Irish airports or airspace that they would no longer receive permission to do so."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3916054.1559774977!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"us president optimistic over stalled visa scheme for irish","story":"President Trump reacts to President Higgins statement that the US pulling out of the landmark Paris Agreement on climate change was “regressive and pernicious”.

Mr Varadkar said they also  discussed the taxation in Ireland of large companies. Photograph:  PoolGetty ImagesHopes that thousands of Irish citizens could gain access to a new class of visa have been raised after US president Donald Trump said he intervened with those blocking the stalled proposal in the US Congress.The E3 visa scheme, which passed the House of Representatives last year but failed to get the required, unanimous support of the Senate, was discussed at the bilateral meeting between Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Mr Trump in Shannon Airport yesterday.Mr Varadkar said the issue of Ireland’s trade surplus with the US was also raised.Arkansas senator Tom Cotton blocked the E3 Bill that would have allocated a proportion of visas – currently only available to Australians – to Irish citizens. Mr Trump, in his first public comments on the matter, said he had spoken to Mr Cotton.“I spoke to the one vote – who’s a great senator, by the way,” he told reporters ahead of the meeting. “And we think we’re going to be successful.“He doesn’t mean to do any harm – that I can tell you,” Mr Trump said of Mr Cotton. “He was telling me he loves Ireland, actually. So I think we’re going to be in good shape.”Bill reintroducedJohn Deasy, the Government’s special envoy to the US Congress, has been liaising with Mick Mulvaney, Mr Trump’s chief of staff, on the E3 Bill. Applicants for an E3 visa must have a job in the US to qualify and have certain academic or other qualifying credentials. The Bill was reintroduced in the House of Representatives last month by Richard Neal, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.Those who attended the bilateral meeting at Shannon Airport included Steve Mnuchin, the US treasury secretary John Bolton, the national security adviser, and Mr Mulvaney.Last week, the US treasury placed Ireland on a list of nine countries it is monitoring for running a trade surplus with the US.Along with countries including Germany, Ireland, among EU countries, has one of the largest trade surpluses with the US, meaning that it exports more to the US than it imports, mainly due to the large presence of US multinationals here, and in the export-heavy pharmaceutical sector.‘Fair share’He said they also talked about the taxation of large companies.“I emphasised very much our view that tech companies in the tech sector, the pharmaceutical sectors, are very welcome in Ireland. But I also expressed the very strong view that the Irish Government has which is that big companies that make big profits should pay their fair share of tax.”Meanwhile, Mr Trump’s nominee to become the next US ambassador to Ireland, Ed Crawford, is expected to be confirmed by the US Senate next week.Mr Trump will travel to Normandy, France, on Thursday for events to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the D-Day landings before returning to his resort in Doonbeg, Co Clare, resort that evening. He is expected to play golf at the resort on Friday before returning to the US in the afternoon."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/05/17/TELEMMGLPICT000147339863_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"judges given new expenses policy telegraph discovers judiciary","story":"The Ministry of Justice approved expenses including shampoo and crockery.  Lord Chief Justice, Lord Ian Burnett, pictured, claimed for multiple journeys to and from his homeMinistry of JusticeThe judiciary are to be given a new expenses policy after The Daily  found that Britain\u0027s most senior judges have claimed for crockery, shampoo and a taxi to transport ceremonial robes on taxpayer-funded expenses.Expenses data released under the Freedom of Information Act shows how some of the most high-profile members of the judiciary in England and Wales have had claims for everyday items as well first-class trains approved, even though they receive a salary of at least £180,000.At present, judges are encouraged to follow the expenses policy for Ministry of Justice (MOJ) civil servants, and the judiciary has also set out specific guidance relating to travel, accommodation and relocation....To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletMinistry of JusticeD-Day commemorations: Theresa May says \u0026#39thank you\u0026#39 to veterans in emotional speech to mark 75th anniversary - latest updatesHow the D-Day landings forged the Special RelationshipComment: We must never forget the sacrifice of D-Day, or the cooperation that made it a triumph Comment: D-Day still stands as one of our nation\u0026#39s greatest triumphsJapan’s labour minister mocked for saying high heels ‘necessary and reasonable’ at workDonald Trump says Ireland\u0026#39s Brexit \u0026#39wall\u0026#39 issue will work out \u0026#39very well\u0026#39D-Day commemorations: Queen pays tribute to \u0026#39resilience of wartime generation - my generation\u0026#39Spinning and yoga classes should be introduced by employers during lunchtime, NICE saysRetired people will \u0026#39exhaust\u0026#39 pensions long before they die unless current system is radically reformed, IFS boss saysSmall dog trend is fuelling number of people hospitalised for bites, Royal College of Surgeons sayParents should get legal responsibility for surrogate children from birth, says Law CommissionVillage pub at centre of TB row after grandmother died and regulars told to get themselves tested for diseaseFire at pop star\u0026#39s mansion investigated as arson, week after he was cleared of rapeShepherd who beat 2,500 others to win picturesque farm tells court how dream turned into a nightmareJapanese \u0026#39forest bathing\u0026#39 backed by Duchess of Cambridge \u0026#39should be prescribed on the NHS\u0026#39Smartphones have killed the Loch Ness Monster, zoologist tells festivalD-Day veterans jump for their country 75 years on from their historic mission Mayor with prosthetic leg faces social media abuse over footwearWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"expenses podcast lone campaigner took whole parliament","story":"Journalist and freedom of information campaigner, Heather BrookeTucked away in the back of New Labour’s 1997 manifesto is a promise.

But it was only when they sent it off to be cleaned that they discovered its worth.The picture cleaners suspected they had a treasure on their hands and called in a specialist London gallery, who purchased it and put it up for sale at the European Fine Art Fair in Maastricht in March. Yesterday the Getty Museum came forward to announce that it was the buyer, paying around £4 million for the work.But the museum faces a potential fight to take the picture out of the country, as a reviewing committee run by The Arts Council as advisers to the Culture Secretary must rule on whether it is of national importance.If the board reaches that conclusion, British institutions will be given a set period of time in which to fundraise and match the asking price.The Los Angeles museum, founded by the billionaire J Paul Getty, said the “remarkable discovery” would be a major addition to its holdings. It already has two Wright paintings.Wright used silver leaf to enhance the illuminating effect of candelight“Two Boys with a Bladder is a masterpiece that counts among Joseph Wright of Derby’s most accomplished nocturnal subjects and reflects the experimental interests of artists and scientists of the Enlightenment.“Should we obtain the necessary export licence from England, the painting will join two other works by the artist at the Getty, adding a completely new and engaging note to our 18th century paintings collection,” a museum spokesman said.The oil on canvas painting was composed in 1768-70 as a pair with Two Girls Dressing a Kitten by Candlelight, which hangs in London’s Kenwood House.The pig’s bladder, commonly used as a toy rattle or balloon in 18th century England, is lit by a concealed candle. Wright used silver foil in this painting to heighten the illuminating effect. In total, he produced around 20 candlelight paintings, of which 16 are in museum collections. The most famous, An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump, is in the National Gallery.The Joseph Wright Gallery in Derby is home to 27 of his paintings, but it will not be bidding for Two Boys with a Bladder. The gallery’s director, Tony Butler, said: “We would rather it not leave the country, but it is better that it goes to a museum than a private collector.“Most regional museums have seen swingeing cuts to funding by the local authority. We have lost 40 per cent of revenue from the local council. We can’t be chasing after pictures to keep them in the country when we need revenue to develop our facilities and services. Right at this moment, there are more pressing priorities.”D-Day commemorations: Theresa May says \u0026#39thank you\u0026#39 to veterans in emotional speech to mark 75th anniversary - latest updatesHow the D-Day landings forged the Special RelationshipComment: We must never forget the sacrifice of D-Day, or the cooperation that made it a triumph Comment: D-Day still stands as one of our nation\u0026#39s greatest triumphsJapan’s labour minister mocked for saying high heels ‘necessary and reasonable’ at workDonald Trump says Ireland\u0026#39s Brexit \u0026#39wall\u0026#39 issue will work out \u0026#39very well\u0026#39D-Day commemorations: Queen pays tribute to \u0026#39resilience of wartime generation - my generation\u0026#39Small dog trend is fuelling number of people hospitalised for bites, Royal College of Surgeons saySpinning and yoga classes should be introduced by employers during lunchtime, NICE saysRetired people will \u0026#39exhaust\u0026#39 pensions long before they die unless current system is radically reformed, IFS boss saysParents should get legal responsibility for surrogate children from birth, says Law CommissionVillage pub at centre of TB row after grandmother died and regulars told to get themselves tested for diseaseFire at pop star\u0026#39s mansion investigated as arson, week after he was cleared of rapeShepherd who beat 2,500 others to win picturesque farm tells court how dream turned into a nightmareJapanese \u0026#39forest bathing\u0026#39 backed by Duchess of Cambridge \u0026#39should be prescribed on the NHS\u0026#39Smartphones have killed the Loch Ness Monster, zoologist tells festivalD-Day veterans jump for their country 75 years on from their historic mission Mayor with prosthetic leg faces social media abuse over footwearWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"roshan salih correction","story":"Contrary to what he appeared to suggest at the time, Roshan Salih did not in fact attend or film an Enfield North Labour constituency party meeting as articles of Sept 7 stated rather, his Press TV colleague filmed the meeting and was later suspended from the Party.There is no evidence that he tweeted a picture of lavatory roll imprinted with the Israeli flag in order to \u0027taunt\u0027 the meeting Chairman, as one article stated, albeit that  he has tweeted such a picture in the past. Mr Salih has also asked us to put his position that he is not a member of the Labour Party.

Figures from the Office for National Statistics show that more than 131 million working days were lost to sickness in 2017, including 13 million working days lost to mental ill-health.Professor Gillian Leng, deputy chief executive and director of health and social care at Nice, described the new guidelines as “a win-win for everyone,” adding: If the United Kingdom\u0027s 5.7 million small and medium sized businesses encouraged their workforce to be more active, they are more likely to reap the benefits of having engaged employees who are more productive and are less likely to take time off sick.Simple things like providing secure bicycle storage, showers and changing facilities can go a long way to enabling people to cycle to work or to meetings.As a society we are facing an obesity crisis caused in part by people not exercising enough. We need people to change their lifestyle and to take more exercise.If they can do this during the working day, not only will they benefit, but so too will their employers and the NHS.”Please review our commenting policyD-Day commemorations: Theresa May says \u0026#39thank you\u0026#39 to veterans in emotional speech to mark 75th anniversary - latest updatesHow the D-Day landings forged the Special RelationshipComment: We must never forget the sacrifice of D-Day, or the cooperation that made it a triumph Comment: D-Day still stands as one of our nation\u0026#39s greatest triumphsJapan’s labour minister mocked for saying high heels ‘necessary and reasonable’ at workDonald Trump says Ireland\u0026#39s Brexit \u0026#39wall\u0026#39 issue will work out \u0026#39very well\u0026#39D-Day commemorations: Queen pays tribute to \u0026#39resilience of wartime generation - my generation\u0026#39Retired people will \u0026#39exhaust\u0026#39 pensions long before they die unless current system is radically reformed, IFS boss saysSmall dog trend is fuelling number of people hospitalised for bites, Royal College of Surgeons sayParents should get legal responsibility for surrogate children from birth, says Law CommissionVillage pub at centre of TB row after grandmother died and regulars told to get themselves tested for diseaseFire at pop star\u0026#39s mansion investigated as arson, week after he was cleared of rapeShepherd who beat 2,500 others to win picturesque farm tells court how dream turned into a nightmareJapanese \u0026#39forest bathing\u0026#39 backed by Duchess of Cambridge \u0026#39should be prescribed on the NHS\u0026#39Smartphones have killed the Loch Ness Monster, zoologist tells festivalD-Day veterans jump for their country 75 years on from their historic mission Mayor with prosthetic leg faces social media abuse over footwearFight to keep forgotten Joseph Wright of Derby masterpiece in the UK after it was bought by Getty Museum We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"d day commemorations theresa may prince wales attend normandy","story":"Prince of Wales to attend cathedral service in BayeuxThe D-Day clues were there, if only Hitler had done the  crosswordThe definitive story of D-Day - by those who lived to tell the tale D-Day heroes set sail for Normandy on MV Boudicca in a blaze of gloryQueen pays tribute to \u0027resilience of wartime generation - my generation\u0027​Theresa May addressed the D-Day veterans at a commemoration ceremony in Normandy and in an emotionally-charged speech said the only two words I can say - thank you.The Prime Minister joined French President Emmanuel Macron in Normandy this morning for a second day of events marking the 75th anniversary of the D-Day landings.Mrs May attended an inauguration ceremony in northern France for a memorial to commemorate more than 20,000 members of the British armed forces who died there in summer 1944.Closing her speech in Ver-sur-Mer, she said: Here in Normandy, the names of those British men and women who lost their lives will forever sit across The Channel from their homeland. We\u0027ll always remember their courage and conviction. And to the veterans that are here today - I want to say the only two words I can: Thank you.World War II reenactors stand on Omaha Beach, in Normandy, France, at dawn The British Normandy Memorial, funded by the Normandy Memorial Trust, is being built on a hillside in Ver-sur-Mer, overlooking Gold Beach, one of the key sites for British troops during the Normandy Landings.Mr Macron is joining the Prime Minister at the ceremony, where a sculpture created by David Williams-Ellis will be unveiled marking the beginning of construction for the memorial.After the memorial inauguration, Mrs May, in one of her final official engagements as Conservative leader, will join veterans and the Prince of Wales at a cathedral service in Bayeux.The city, close to the northern French coast, was the first major place to be liberated, after the Allied forces invasion.Ahead of the commemorations, Theresa May said: It is a privilege to be in Normandy today for the 75th anniversary of the D-Day Landings and to pay my respects to the troops who gave their lives for the freedom we cherish today.As we come together to pay tribute to the service and sacrifice of those who died for our liberty 75 years ago - we promise to honour their memory for generations to come.D-Day 75th anniversary: The Portsmouth and Normandy celebrations, in picturesMeanwhile, many veterans will flock to the town of Arromanches for a series of events.Activities on Thursday will mark key events in the operation.

The force of our friendship will outlast current events.Talking to Mrs May, he says: It has been a pleasure to work alongside you, before the pair embraced.They didn\u0027t quite burst into a hug - but it was as close as it could be. Veterans and their families are arriving for a service of remembrance at Bayeux Cathedral.They will be joined by Prime Minister Theresa May, and the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall for the commemoration marking 75 years since D-Day.Joe Shute is there for The .

The city was a big army depot for the Germans but they knew we were coming and mostly left it to us apart from a few snipers.Cornwall has numerous comrades buried in Bayeux as well as the surrounding cemeteries. I have come every year for the last 40 years, he says. It is always very emotional.Our news reporter Phoebe Southworth is in Arrmomanches-les-Bains. Here is her report from the morning\u0027s proceedings.At 6.26am UK time this morning, the exact minute the first British troops landed on the beaches of Normandy in 1944, Lone Piper Major Trevor Macey-Lillie performed to crowds from on top of a concrete section on Mulberry Harbour in Arromanches-les-Bains.Spectators have gathered on the shores among hundreds of military vehicles bearing Union flags, which will be paraded across the shores and up through the harbour at 9.30am.Women wearing war-era style dress jived on the beach as live singers entertained the crowds with French and English tracks.The Prime Minister is now talking to D-Day veterans, shaking hands with them and sharing stories. Theresa May meeting the veteransTheresa May and Emmanuel Macron have laid a wreath on the first stone of the Ver-sur-Mer memorial, which sits in front of a new statue of three D-Day soldiers.Laying of the wreathLa Marseillaise then rings out from a brass band, followed by God Save The Queen.Veterans then lay their own wreath and salute the statue. Seven British D-Day veterans were accompanied by four children, including Sir Winston Churchill\u0027s great-great grandson John Churchill, to lay flowers in front of a sculpture at the memorial depicting three British soldiers storming the beaches.It was created by David Williams-Ellis to mark the beginning of construction for the memorial, which is expected to be completed within a year.The ceremony concluded with a piped lament from Trooper Kurtis Rankin of The Royal Dragoon Guards.The Prime Minister has closed her speech in Ver-sur-Mer. She said: Here in Normandy, the names of those British men and women who lost their lives will forever sit across The Channel from their homeland. We\u0027ll always remember their courage and conviction. And to the veterans that are here today - I want to say the only two words I can: Thank you.Prime Minister says it is humbling to be in France today. Says it\u0027s impossible to imagine the raw courage it took for D-Day veterans to land on the beaches. Thank you for your service and your sacrifice, she adds.Mrs May said the Battle of Normandy is Something that means so much to the veterans\u0027 community and the British nation.She adds: It\u0027s incredibly moving to be here today, looking out over the beaches where one of the greatest battles for freedom this world has ever known took place.And it is truly humbling to do so with the men who were there that day.It\u0027s an honour for all of us to share this moment with you.Mrs May continued: Standing here as the waves wash quietly onto the shore below us, it is almost impossible to grasp the raw courage it must have taken that day to leap from the landing craft and into the surf despite the fury of battle...If one day can be said to have determined the fate of generations to come in France, in Britain, in Europe and the world, that day was June 6, 1944.The Normandy Memorial Trust’s statue can be seen behind the speakers at Ver-sur-Mer.Later, the first stone of the future memorial will be laid, in the presence of veterans, British Prime Minister Theresa May and French Prime Minister Emmanuel Macron. Once fully built the British Normandy Memorial will record the names of those under British command who lost their lives in Normandy between the D-Day landings and 31 August 1944. Also honoured will be the tens of thousands of French citizens who lost their lives during the period.The French President is up to talk to the gathered crowd.Addressing the audience, President Macron said: I am honoured to stand alongside Theresa May today to launch construction work for the British memorial at Ver-sur-Mer.The British people have long dreamt of this memorial.He added: This is where, 75 years ago, on June 6, 1944, almost 25,000 British soldiers landed in France to free the country from Nazi control.This is where young men, many of whom had never set foot on French soil, landed at dawn under German fire, risking their lives while fighting their way up the beach, which was littered with obstacles and mines.He added: It is time to remedy the fact that no memorial pays tribute to the United Kingdom\u0027s contribution to the Battle of Normandy.He said the monument would also be a symbol of the ties binding France and the UK.He said: Nothing will break them. Nothing can ever break ties that have been bound in bloodshed and shared values.The debates taking place today cannot affect the strength of our joint history and our shared future.President Macron assured Mrs May of his friendship, adding: Leaders may come and go but their achievements remain.The force of our friendship will outlast current events.Talking to Theresa May, he says: It has been a pleasure to work alongside you, before the pair embrace.Private Liam Dawson is now giving a reading.His father and uncle were both in the Green Howards, a predecessor of the modern-day Yorkshire Regiment.The Green Howards were a key regiment during the D-Day invasion and Stanley Hollis of the Green Howards won the only VC of D-Day a short distance from the memorial site. Liam joined the British Army in 2017 at the age of eighteen.He joined 2nd Battalion the Yorkshire Regiment and has recently served overseas in Kabul, Afghanistan.Several D-Day veterans are at Ver-sur-Mer to drink in the commemorations. The ceremony has begun in France in Ver-sur-Mer.On 6 June 1944 the British 50th Infantry Division landed at Ver-sur-Mer as part of Operation Overlord.The commune of Ver-sur-Mer in Calvados is located along Gold Beach and is currently the town chosen to host the main British monument of the Normandy landings.And just like that - here he is. Emmanuel Macron and Theresa May Theresa May is waiting at Ver-sur-Mer for her French counterpart ahead of today\u0027s D-Day commemorations. Today is the 75th anniversary of the landings. The British Prime Minister is ready and waiting in France. The Prime Minister is waiting for Mr Macron at Ver-sur-Mer.To fully understand just how remarkable the achievement of D-Day and the Normandy campaign that followed was, it is worth casting the net back four years to that darkest hour, June 1940.Britain and France had declared war against Germany, confident that they had the resources, wealth, and global reach to stop Hitler and the tide of Nazism.For all Germany’s grandstanding and military drum-beating, Hitler’s Reich lay at the heart of Europe, with little access to the world’s oceans, with neither a decent navy nor merchant navy and therefore lacked the resources needed to conduct a modern war.Britain’s Royal Navy immediately imposed an economic blockade while France mobilised its vast army of millions. Britain and France, admittedly apprehensive, nonetheless expected to prevail.By June 1940, such hopes had been shattered. German shock and awe had delivered its Blitzkrieg, mighty France had crumbled and the forces of totalitarianism and nationalism were sweeping across.Read the full article.The invasion force was not only the greatest assembled in history but D-Day was an exceptional feat of arms, logistics and leadership that relied upon meticulous planning, phenomenal levels of secrecy and disinformation and the closest possible co-operation between Britain and her Allies, especially those from across the Atlantic.This emphasis on collaboration, without which D-Day could not have happened, has been to the fore once again in recent days with the state visit to the UK of Donald Trump. The US president is seen as an iconoclast when it comes to supporting the post-war global order and its multilateral institutions like the UN and Nato.President of the United States, Donald Trump reads from the 32nd U.S. President President Franklin D. Roosevelt\u0026#39s prayer to the US on stage during the D-Day CommemorationsMany European leaders will hope his presence at the D-Day commemorations will have modified his protectionist instincts, though the best way they can achieve that is to pay a greater share of the cost of their own defence.Read the full editorial. Today\u0027s commemorations have kicked off with the tradition of a lone piper playing a lament on the remaining Mulberry Harbour in the Normandy town called Port Winston.Standing atop the structure, Pipe Major Trevor Macey-Lillie, of 19th Regiment Royal Artillery (The Scottish Gunners) performed Highland Laddie at 7.25am local time,  signalling the minute the invasion began and the moment the first British soldier landed on Gold beach.Pipe Major Trevor Macey-Lillie of the Scots Royal artillery performs at Mulberry harbour Crowds gathered on the beach below him and lined the promenade, applauding his performance.Afterwards his performance on Arromanches beach, Pipe Major Macey-Lillie said:  That was nerve wracking to do but I feel very proud and it was a privilege to  do it.More than 300 veterans will be flocking to the town of Arromanches for a series of events on Wednesday to mark the 75th anniversary of D-Day.Just as in the UK, the D-Day anniversary featured on the front pages of many newspapers in France and Germany on Thursday.Le Figaro: The morning of freedomAalener Nachrichten: Merkel and the \u0026#39gift of the story\u0026#39Allgäuer Anzeigeblatt: A beach in JuneD-Day veterans and other people are marking exactly 75 years since the invasion of Normandy that helped change the course of the Second World War.As the sun rose on  Thursday over Omaha Beach, about 100 people gathered at dawn on the edge of the waters that ran red here on June 6, 1944, the first of five code-named beaches where Allied forces came ashore to push the Nazis out of France.World War II reenactors stand looking out to sea on Omaha Beach, in Normandy, France, at dawnAmerican Richard Clapp said it was sobering to admire the beautiful sunrise where Allied troops came ashore.Norwegian Sigrid Flaata drove from Oslo in a 1942 restored jeep to honour the soldiers who died on D-Day.Belgian Filip Van Hecke called his journey a small effort to pay homage.It\u0027s an early start today as a host of ceremonies and events are due to take place to mark D-Day. 06:25:  A lone piper from 19th Regiment Royal Artillery will play on the Mulberry Harbour in Arromanches-les-Bains to mark 75 years to the minute since the first British soldier landed and the start  of the amphibious invasion of Gold Beach.Lone Piper Major Trevor Macey-Lillie 19th Regiment RA (The Scottish Gunners) rehearses at the Mulberry Harbour07:30:  Normandy Memorial inauguration ceremony at Ver-sur-Mer.

Nearly 4,000 have been found with many more being discovered all the time, and scientists have been shocked by how many of them there are.But only a limited number of them are actually able to sustain life. Many are either too close or too far away from their sun – meaning that any water, required for life, would either evaporate away or freeze up.Some of those planets, however, could also have moons. And some of those moons might have the right conditions for liquid water and therefore alien life.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An image from Nasa\u0027s Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) shows a 200,000 mile long solar filament ripping through the Sun\u0027s corona in September 2013230 Nasa Celebrates 50 Years of SpacewalkingFor 50 years, NASA has been suiting up for spacewalking.

Doing so is difficult because the moons are so small and distant from Earth.To overcome that, Dr Sutton used computer simulations to model the rings around an exoplanet known as\u0026nbspJ1407b. Those rings are 200 times bigger than\u0026nbsp those around Saturn and researchers looked to see whether the gaps in them were the result of moons.The research failed to show that the scattered particles around the edge of the ring were not likely to have been caused by another undiscovered moon. But the hunt for more exomoons – and the aliens that could potentially live on them – continues.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Here\u0027s whyClick to followThe IndependentSir Philip Green plans to continue with efforts to restructure his Arcadia Group over the coming daysThe rule in the City is you don’t hold a vote you can’t win.\u0026nbspThe adjournment of today’s crunch Arcadia creditors’ meeting to discuss the Company Voluntary Arrangement proposed by Sir Philip Green needs to be seen in that context.\u0026nbspReports through the day indicated significant resistance from landlords.\u0026nbspGreen told to fund Arcadia\u0027s \u0027worrying\u0027 pension deficit with own moneySir Philip Green\u0027s Arcadia Group confirms slew of shop closuresIn the past, the big ones have been inclined to back CVAs - a form of insolvency that allows struggling retailers to secure rent reductions and the closure of unprofitable stores.\u0026nbspIn the current climate the reasoning has been that you either accept less or get nothing. Landlords don’t exactly have queues of replacement tenants lining up outside their doors and it’s usually the smaller owners in smaller towns with less clout that end up with nothing through the closure plans.\u0026nbspThe tycoon had secured the support of British Land and Hammerson and (crucially) pensions watchdogs, but Intu, the big shopping centre owner, said no and so did others.\u0026nbspWith the plans requiring 75 per cent support to go through, their\u0026nbspchances looked more and more slim as the day went on.What made this one so different to the other CVAs\u0026nbspand restructurings that have gone through?\u0026nbspLandlords, including big ones, have been getting increasingly fed up\u0026nbspof retailers putting the burden of their difficulties on to their shoulders.\u0026nbspThey also reasoned that if Sir Philip secured the big rental discounts he\u0027s after then other tenants would demand the same, and perhaps threaten to follow him down the CVA route in time.\u0026nbspIt’s fair to question the role he personally played in all this too, with his aggressive, abrasive style of doing business and the demands he’s made of landlords in the past. This could have contributed to the reluctance of some to give any quarter now he needs their help. You reap what you sow in business. \u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

We believe that with this adjournment, there is a reasonable prospect of reaching an agreement that the majority of landlords will support.”Shopping centre owner Intu told Arcadia\u0026nbspon Wednesday that it will not back proposals to slash rents and close around 50 stores.Created with Sketch.

House of FraserHomebase has recently dropped the Bunnings association from its storesHowever, big landlords including British Land and Hammerson are said to have backed Arcadia\u0027s Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA), with others still wavering.Intu, which owns the Trafford centre in Manchester and Lakeside in Essex, counts Arcadia brands as tenants in 35 of its units.Intu reportedly refused\u0026nbspto back the plans because it would have to justify the rent cuts to other tenants.Landlords are cautious about offering discounts to certain tenants at a time when many retailers under pressure from falling sales, high rents, business rates and increasing wages.\u0026nbspArcadia, which owns brands including Topshop, Miss Selfridge, Evans and Burton had planned to shut 50 UK stores and cut rents on another 194.\u0026nbspJonathan De Mello, a director at retail consultancy Harper Dennis Hobbs, said large landlords feel that Sir Philip has already “played hardball” over rent rises in the past. “The CVA proposal comes in addition to that.\u0026nbsp“Landlords feel that Philip Green wants to get out of certain liabilities but they feel they have reduced rents enough.”If Sir Philip\u0027s Arcadia group\u0026nbspwere to enter administration it would become the most high-profile in a series of retail collapses.Debenhams\u0026nbspand House of Fraser, have called in the administrators in recent months, while Toys R\u0027 Us and Maplin have disappeared completely.Sir Philip Green\u0027s Arcadia Group confirms slew of shop closuresSir Philip, once lauded as the king of the high street, cleared a major hurdle on Tuesday after receiving the backing of the Pensions Regulator (TPR) for his rescue plans.The retail mogul agreed to inject\u0026nbspan additional £25m into Arcadia\u0027s\u0026nbsppension fund, taking the total\u0026nbspamount pledged in cash and security to more than £300m.News of\u0026nbspthe agreement came shortly after the watchdog ordered Sir Philip to pay in an extra £50m\u0026nbspin order to secure its support for\u0026nbspArcadia\u0027s CVA.Arcadia said Lady Green, the group\u0027s ultimate owner, had signed off the additional cash.The Pensions Regulator said: Following extensive discussions with the company, shareholders, the trustees of the pension schemes, the PPF and advisers, we are pleased that additional security has been agreed in support for the pension schemes which brings the total security value to £210m.This is in addition to agreed contributions of £100m to be paid to the schemes by Lady Green.Given this enhanced level of support, we now consider the updated CVA proposals are sufficient because they provide better protection for scheme members in these difficult circumstances.We recognise that the best support for any pension scheme is a trading employer and we feel the CVA proposals now provide the right balance between security for the pension schemes and the chance of sustainability for the company.The Pension Protection Fund (PPF) is due to vote on whether to support the scheme on Wednesday.Arcadia\u0027s brands have struggled to keep up with changing fashion trends and competition from Primark as well as online rivals.Critics have accused Sir Philip of underinvesting in the group\u0027s stores.

Wine was found to be most effective in reducing the risk due to the chemical compounds that balance blood sugar levels. 144 Junk food ads could be banned before watershedJunk food adverts on TV and online could be banned before 9pm as part of Government plans to fight the epidemic of childhood obesity.244 Breeding with neanderthals helped humans fight diseasesOn migrating from Africa around 70,000 years ago, humans bumped into the neanderthals of Eurasia. While humans were weak to the diseases of the new lands, breeding with the resident neanderthals made for a better equipped immune system344 Cancer breath test to be trialled in BritainThe breath biopsy device is designed to detect cancer hallmarks in molecules exhaled by patients444 Average 10 year old has consumed the recommended amount of sugar for an adult By their 10th birthdy, children have on average already eaten more sugar than the recommended amount for an 18 year old. The average 10 year old consumes the equivalent to 13 sugar cubes a day, 8 more than is recommendedWhile there is not enough evidence of harm to recommend UK-wide limits on screen use, the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health have advised that children should avoid screens for an hour before bed time to avoid disrupting their sleep644 Daily aspirin is unnecessary for older people in good health, study findsA study published in the New England Journal of Medicine has found that many elderly people are taking daily aspirin to little or no avail744 Vaping could lead to cancer, US study findsA study by the University of Minnesota\u0027s Masonic Cancer Centre has found that the carcinogenic chemicals formaldehyde, acrolein, and methylglyoxal are present in the saliva of E-cigarette users844 More children are obese and diabetic944 Most child antidepressants are ineffective and can lead to suicidal thoughtsThe majority of antidepressants are ineffective and may be unsafe, for children and teenager with major depression, experts have warned. In what is the most comprehensive comparison of 14 commonly prescribed antidepressant drugs to date, researchers found that only one brand was more effective at relieving symptoms of depression than a placebo. Another popular drug, venlafaxine, was shown increase the risk users engaging in suicidal thoughts and attempts at suicide1044 Gay, lesbian and bisexual adults at higher risk of heart disease, study claimsResearchers at the Baptist Health South Florida Clinic in Miami  focused on seven areas of controllable heart health and found these minority groups were particularly likely to be smokers and to have poorly controlled blood sugar1144 Breakfast cereals targeted at children contain \u0027steadily high\u0027 sugar levels since 1992 despite producer claimsA major pressure group has issued a fresh warning about perilously high amounts of sugar in breakfast cereals, specifically those designed for children, and has said that levels have barely been cut at all in the last two and a half decadesNew guidance by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the body which determines what treatment the NHS should fund, said lax road repairs and car-dominated streets were contributing to the obesity epidemic by preventing members of the public from keeping active1344 New menopause drugs offer women relief from \u0027debilitating\u0027 hot flushesA new class of treatments for women going through the menopause is able to reduce numbers of debilitating hot flushes by as much as three quarters in a matter of days, a trial has found.1444 Doctors should prescribe more antidepressants for people with mental health problems, study findsResearch from Oxford University found that more than one million extra people suffering from mental health problems would benefit from being prescribed drugs and criticised “ideological” reasons doctors use to avoid doing so.1544 Student dies of flu after NHS advice to stay at home and avoid A\u0026ampEThe family of a teenager who died from flu has urged people not to delay going to A\u0026ampE if they are worried about their symptoms. Melissa Whiteley, an 18-year-old engineering student from Hanford in Stoke-on-Trent, fell ill at Christmas and died in hospital a month later.1644 Government to review thousands of harmful vaginal mesh implantsThe Government has pledged to review tens of thousands of cases where women have been given harmful vaginal mesh implants.1744 Jeremy Hunt announces \u0027zero suicides ambition\u0027 for the NHSThe NHS will be asked to go further to prevent the deaths of patients in its care as part of a “zero suicide ambition” being launched today.1844 Human trials start with cancer treatment that primes immune system to kill off tumoursHuman trials have begun with a new cancer therapy that can prime the immune system to eradicate tumours. The treatment, that works similarly to a vaccine, is a combination of two existing drugs, of which tiny amounts are injected into the solid bulk of a tumour. 1944 Babies\u0027 health suffers from being born near fracking sites, finds major studyMothers living within a kilometre of a fracking site were 25 per cent more likely to have a child born at low birth weight, which increase their chances of asthma, ADHD and other issues2044 NHS reviewing thousands of cervical cancer smear tests after women wrongly given all-clearThousands of cervical cancer screening results are under review after failings at a laboratory meant some women were incorrectly given the all-clear. A number of women have already been told to contact their doctors following the identification of “procedural issues” in the service provided by Pathology First Laboratory.2144 Potential key to halting breast cancer\u0027s spread discovered by scientistsMost breast cancer patients do not die from their initial tumour, but from secondary malignant growths (metastases), where cancer cells are able to enter the blood and survive to invade new sites. Asparagine, a molecule named after asparagus where it was first identified in high quantities, has now been shown to be an essential ingredient for tumour cells to gain these migratory properties.2244 NHS nursing vacancies at record high with more than 34,000 roles advertisedA record number of nursing and midwifery positions are currently being advertised by the NHS, with more than 34,000 positions currently vacant, according to the latest data. Demand for nurses was 19 per cent higher between July and September 2017 than the same period two years ago.2344 Cannabis extract could provide ‘new class of treatment’ for psychosisCBD has a broadly opposite effect to delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main active component  in cannabis and the substance that causes paranoia and anxiety.2444 Over 75,000 sign petition calling for Richard Branson\u0027s Virgin Care to hand settlement money back to NHSMr Branson’s company sued the NHS last year after it lost out on an £82m contract to provide children’s health services across Surrey, citing concerns over “serious flaws” in the way the contract was awarded2544 More than 700 fewer nurses training in England in first year after NHS bursary scrappedThe numbers of people accepted to study nursing in England fell 3 per cent in 2017, while the numbers accepted in Wales and Scotland, where the bursaries were kept, increased 8.4 per cent and 8 per cent respectively2644 Landmark study links Tory austerity to 120,000 deathsThe paper found that there were 45,000 more deaths in the first four years of Tory-led efficiencies than would have been expected if funding had stayed at pre-election levels.Hours of commuting may be mind-numbingly dull, but new research shows that it might also be having an adverse effect on both your health and performance at work.  Longer commutes also appear to have a significant impact on mental wellbeing, with those commuting longer 33 per cent more likely to suffer from depression2844 You cannot be fit and fatIt is not possible to be overweight and healthy, a major new study has concluded. The study of 3.5 million Britons found that even “metabolically healthy” obese people are still at a higher risk of heart disease or a stroke than those with a normal weight rangeWhen you feel particularly exhausted, it can definitely feel like you are also lacking in brain capacity. Now, a new study has suggested this could be because chronic sleep deprivation can actually cause the brain to eat itselfDavid Lloyd Gyms have launched a new health and fitness class which is essentially a bunch of people taking a nap for 45 minutes. The fitness group was spurred to launch the ‘napercise’ class after research revealed 86 per cent of parents said they were fatigued. The class is therefore predominantly aimed at parents but you actually do not have to have children to take part3144 \u0027Fundamental right to health\u0027 to be axed after Brexit, lawyers warnTobacco and alcohol companies could win more easily in court cases such as the recent battle over plain cigarette packaging if the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights is abandoned, a barrister and public health professor have said.3244 \u0027Thousands dying\u0027 due to fear over non-existent statin side-effectsA major new study into the side effects of the cholesterol-lowering medicine suggests common symptoms such as muscle pain and weakness are not caused by the drugs themselves3344 Babies born to fathers aged under 25 have higher risk of autismNew research has found that babies born to fathers under the age of 25 or over 51 are at higher risk of developing autism and other social disorders. The study, conducted by the Seaver Autism Center for Research and Treatment at Mount Sinai, found that these children are actually more advanced than their peers as infants, but then fall behind by the time they hit their teenage years.3444 Cycling to work ‘could halve risk of cancer and heart disease’Commuters who swap their car or bus pass for a bike could cut their risk of developing heart disease and cancer by almost half, new research suggests – but campaigners have warned there is still an “urgent need” to improve road conditions for cyclists.3544 Playing Tetris in hospital after a traumatic incident could prevent PTSDScientists conducted the research on 71 car crash victims as they were waiting for treatment at one hospital’s accident and emergency department. They asked half of the patients to briefly recall the incident and then play the classic computer game, the others were given a written activity to complete. The researchers, from Karolinska Institute in Sweden and the University of Oxford, found that the patients who had played Tetris reported fewer intrusive memories, commonly known as flashbacks, in the week that followed3644 Vaping backed as healthier nicotine alternative to cigarettes after latest studyVaping has been given an emphatic thumbs up by health experts after the first long-term study of its effects in ex-smokers.3744 Common method of cooking rice can leave traces of arsenic in food, scientists warnMillions of people are putting themselves at risk by cooking their rice incorrectly, scientists have warned.3844 Contraceptive gel that creates ‘reversible vasectomy’ shown to be effective in monkeysAn injectable contraceptive gel that acts as a ‘reversible vasectomy’ is a step closer to being offered to men following successful trials on monkeys.3944 Shift work and heavy lifting may reduce women’s fertility, study findsWomen who work at night or do irregular shifts may experience a decline in fertility, a new study has found.4044 Japanese government tells people to stop overworkingThe Japanese government has announced measures to limit the amount of overtime employees can do – in an attempt to stop people literally working themselves to death.4144 High blood pressure may protect over 80s from dementiaIt is well known that high blood pressure is a risk factor for dementia, so the results of a new study from the University of California, Irvine, are quite surprising. The researchers found that people who developed high blood pressure between the ages of 80-89 are less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease (the most common form of dementia) over the next three years than people of the same age with normal blood pressure.4244 \u0027Universal cancer vaccine’ breakthrough claimed by expertsScientists have taken a “very positive step” towards creating a universal vaccine against cancer that makes the body’s immune system attack tumours as if they were a virus, experts have said. Writing in Nature, an international team of researchers described how they had taken pieces of cancer’s genetic RNA code, put them into tiny nanoparticles of fat and then injected the mixture into the bloodstreams of three patients in the advanced stages of the disease. The patients\u0027 immune systems responded by producing killer T-cells designed to attack cancer. The vaccine was also found to be effective in fighting “aggressively growing” tumours in mice, according to researchers, who were led by Professor Ugur Sahin from Johannes Gutenberg University in Germany4344 Research shows that diabetes drug can be used to stop first signs of Parkinson’sScientists in a new study show that the first signs of Parkinson’s can be stopped. The UCL study is still in its research period but the team are ‘excited’. Today’s Parkinson’s drugs manage the symptoms of the disease but ultimately do not stop its progression in the brain.4444 Drinking alcohol could reduce risk of diabetesA new study shows that drinking alcohol three to four days a week could reduce the risk of diabetes. Wine was found to be most effective in reducing the risk due to the chemical compounds that balance blood sugar levels. Urine samples were used to gauge calorie consumption at the start of the race in California, and after 20 weeks of back-to-back marathons nearing Washington DC.They found competitors were burning 600 fewer calories a day than would be predicted by their initial pace.If they had carried on at their original rate of energy expenditure the participants would not have been able to complete more than half the race.Why cardio is better for your metabolism than strength trainingHow to develop willpower according to an ultramarathon runner Man who ran 135 miles says ultramarathons make him hallucinateWhile this was the longest event where metabolic data has been evaluated, researchers\u0026nbspfound cyclists in the summer Tour de France, 100-mile marathon runners and\u0026nbspexplorers crossing Antarctica showed a similar “downshift” in energy expenditure to the 2.5-times base-rate ceiling.There was no apparent temperature effect, and researchers said this was “unexpected” as previous theories had suggested that the body’s maximum energy consumption is set by its ability to dissipate heat.The research also found pregnant mothers’ bodies burnt calories at close to 2.5-times energy-expenditure limit seen in endurance athletes, suggesting\u0026nbspthe endurance threshold applies independent of the muscles or organs involved.“Humans have evolved greater endurance capabilities than other apes, which has typically been ascribed to selection for increased physical activity, particularly long-distance running,” the authors wrote in the journal Science Advances.But raising this endurance threshold might have also had advantages in allowing\u0026nbsplonger pregnancies, or larger – more energy intensive – brains than our primate ancestors.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention. But beneath its hazy synths and electronics are songs of endurance and inner peace, of settling after a flurry of activity. 439 Bring Me the Horizon  – AmoBMTH frontman Oli Sykes wants to assert the fragility of the boundary between love and hate. Amo is a way of exploring that, even down to the title itself.539 Nina Nesbitt – The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will ChangeNesbitt is back with her second LP, switching to a brand of soul and R\u0026ampB-fused pop that feels bang on time, and suits her far better. The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change has slick, polished production from Fraser T Smith (Adele), Lostboy (Anne-Marie), Jordan Riley (Zara Larsson), and Nesbitt herself.This self-titled record, a loose but beautifully crafted collection of folk-rock songs, explores the kinds of anxieties intrinsic to the modern age – the longing to be at once noticed and invisible the paralysing effects of limitless information, and the desire to do good versus the desire to be seen doing good.The album is packed with personal confessions for the fans – “Arianators” – to pick over. It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (Helen Brown)The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album – Assume Form – with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: “Can’t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...”While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey\u0027s magpie’s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that. With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date.The album title of the year gives us an image of Brexit Britain trashed by Old Etonians David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but the fifth studio work from the punk duo has more than social commentary to offer. There’s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in “Kebab Spider” – “the skint get used in loo roll shoes” – but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be.“Do you still have that photograph? Would you use it to hurt me?” asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of “Body”. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power. It’s a masterclass in narrative songwriting.With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums – including 2017’s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland – fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers.1339 Solange – When I Get HomeSolange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music. Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose.1439 Foals – Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1)FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont)Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out.1739 Karen O and Danger Mouse – Lux PrimaLux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse – real name Brian Joseph Burton – during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.Rose – who found fame in the UK’s indie-folk scene as an unofficial member of Bombay Bicycle Club in 2010, only to walk away amid the band’s growing hype – is darkly compelling on No Words Left. Assisted by producer Tim Bidwell, who worked on Rose’s last record Something’s Changing, she sounds braver than she ever has before. There are moments that recall her Communion labelmate Ben Howard, on his latest album, Noonday Dream, and others that nod to the quiet stoicism of Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)The record is loosely conceptual insomuch as it’s punctuated with mock adverts for “WWAY HEALTH, our 247 care programme”. But don’t be put off: Miss Universe is a brilliant collection of songs, an expansive melange of indie, jazz, pop and trip-hop that flits between a lo-fi sparseness and something The Strokes would play. Yanya – who is of Turkish-Irish-Bajan heritage – grew up in London on a mix of Pixies, Nina Simone, The Libertines and Amy Winehouse, and this unlikely combination is certainly reflected in the sound. (Patrick Smith)2139 Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (Elisa Bray)Comprising songs from Segall’s eclectic (that’s putting it lightly) catalogue and performed by him and the Freedom Band (Mikal Cronin, Charles Moothart, Emmett Kelly, and Ben Boye), the album is delightfully short and sweet. It is certainly a drastic switch-up from Freedom’s Goblin (2018), which had 19 tracks and ran for 75 minutes.If you want to know how hard it is to categorise Titanic Rising – the enthralling fourth album from Weyes Blood – look no further than the American musician’s own attempt to do so. It is, she says, “The Kinks meet the Second World War, or Bob Seger meets Enya.”Tension aside, there’s a great sense of fun here. The title track is pure euphoria, as restless synths of a Utah Saints or Orbital rave break into swelling bass and melody. And they create the full club experience with “Got to Keep On”, on which the four-to-the-floor beat, funky rhythm guitar, sweet backing vocals and chiming bells make way for the simple sounds of happy party-goers just as the anticipation builds, so does the instrumentation into a hypnotic crescendo. It’s masterful production. (Elisa Bray)Six months after the release of Oxnard, Anderson .Paak returns with another Dr Dre-produced record, Ventura. Where the former was overflowing with choppy, experimental sounds, guest appearances and clumsy attempts at Gil Scott Heron-esque revolutionary lyrics, the sequel – recorded around the same time – streamlines .Paak’s sound, making for a tightly packaged, melodic and danceable album.Two years after the release of his Mercury Prize-nominated debut Yesterday’s Gone, the south London hip-hop artist unveils its follow-up, Not Waving, But Drowning. And if any two records could portray how quickly someone can grow from a boy to a man, it’s these.2739 Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouNo one could accuse Lizzo of holding back. Not when it comes to her voice – which is raw and rowdy, so laden with personality even the vulnerable moments are a joy to listen to –  and certainly not when it comes to her message of unabashed self-love. That’s the predominant theme of the singer  rapper  flautist-extraordinaire’s hugely likeable third album, Cuz I Love You.It seems as likely as Old Man Steptoe dining with the Rees-Mogg, but this new tactic of burying their confrontational gruesomeness beneath a veneer of alt-rock respectability for album three works well for Fat White Family. Drenched in chamber strings and celestial harmonies, the plush yet sinister “Oh Sebastian” could be Pet Sounds selling its soul to the devil. “Fringe Runner” is so sleek and funksome it could be a New Romantic “White Lines (Don’t Don’t Do It)” “Kim’s Sunsets” is a piece of refined cosmic reggae resembling a blissed-out “Bankrobber”.2939 Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date.SOAK reaches to outsiders once again on her new album. 3139 The Cranberries – In the EndThere’s a cruel irony that the release of The Cranberries’ final album should come just a week after journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead by the New IRA during a riot in Londonderry. “Zombie” was a protest song written by the band’s late frontwoman Dolores O’Riordan after two children were killed by IRA bombs – was released. She was deeply affected by the deaths, and would no doubt have been devastated by recent events in Northern Ireland as well.On her third record, Aldous Harding combines the gothic folk of her self-titled 2014 debut with the dramatically intimate tones of her follow-up album Party.Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs.On his debut album, the 24-year-old Collard mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto.   Dedicated covers the full, but generic, spectrum of relationships: dizzying love, lust, and break-ups. But whether she’s pining for the return of a former love in the funky disco banger “Julien”, or singing about masturbating post-break-up in lead single “Party For One” (“I’ll be the one If you don’t care about me Making love to myself Back on my beat”), the vibe remains positively jubilant.Getty Images for Spotify3639 Tyler, the Creator - IGOR“I don’t know where I’m going,” Tyler, the Creator begins on the song “I THINK”. “But I know what I’m showing.” The US artist’s words ring true throughout his fifth studio album, IGOR, where he adopts the dark and twisted mutterings of the Frankenstein character from which the record gets its name. It’s been a long wait for Flying Lotus’s new album. In fact, the LA producer has been masterminding Flamagra for the past five years – snatching moments between collaborating with Kendrick Lamar on To Pimp a Butterfly, directing and writing the comic horror movie Kuso, producing much of Thundercat’s Drunk and growing his Brainfeeder label.A heftier sound is never at the cost of melody, which shines through in Thomson’s vocals, the rest of the band’s backing falsetto, and the searing blues grooves stamped all over Future Dust. Those qualities are captured nowhere more satisfyingly than on “25”. “All Over Town” is their singalong anthem, neatly positioned in the middle to ease the pace.In keeping with the relatively restrained guest spots, it’s heartening just how much Skepta has rejected overloading Ignorance is Bliss with high-profile producers, preferring instead to burrow into his own aesthetic. There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums.It’s not uncommon for an artist to be influenced by the place they grew up in. Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention.

She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (Helen Brown)The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album – Assume Form – with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: “Can’t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...”While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey\u0027s magpie’s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that. With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date.The album title of the year gives us an image of Brexit Britain trashed by Old Etonians David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but the fifth studio work from the punk duo has more than social commentary to offer. There’s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in “Kebab Spider” – “the skint get used in loo roll shoes” – but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be.“Do you still have that photograph? Would you use it to hurt me?” asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of “Body”. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power. It’s a masterclass in narrative songwriting.With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums – including 2017’s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland – fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers.1339 Solange – When I Get HomeSolange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music. Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose.1439 Foals – Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1)FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont)Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out.1739 Karen O and Danger Mouse – Lux PrimaLux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse – real name Brian Joseph Burton – during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.Rose – who found fame in the UK’s indie-folk scene as an unofficial member of Bombay Bicycle Club in 2010, only to walk away amid the band’s growing hype – is darkly compelling on No Words Left. Assisted by producer Tim Bidwell, who worked on Rose’s last record Something’s Changing, she sounds braver than she ever has before. There are moments that recall her Communion labelmate Ben Howard, on his latest album, Noonday Dream, and others that nod to the quiet stoicism of Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)The record is loosely conceptual insomuch as it’s punctuated with mock adverts for “WWAY HEALTH, our 247 care programme”. But don’t be put off: Miss Universe is a brilliant collection of songs, an expansive melange of indie, jazz, pop and trip-hop that flits between a lo-fi sparseness and something The Strokes would play. Yanya – who is of Turkish-Irish-Bajan heritage – grew up in London on a mix of Pixies, Nina Simone, The Libertines and Amy Winehouse, and this unlikely combination is certainly reflected in the sound. (Patrick Smith)2139 Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (Elisa Bray)Comprising songs from Segall’s eclectic (that’s putting it lightly) catalogue and performed by him and the Freedom Band (Mikal Cronin, Charles Moothart, Emmett Kelly, and Ben Boye), the album is delightfully short and sweet. It is certainly a drastic switch-up from Freedom’s Goblin (2018), which had 19 tracks and ran for 75 minutes.If you want to know how hard it is to categorise Titanic Rising – the enthralling fourth album from Weyes Blood – look no further than the American musician’s own attempt to do so. It is, she says, “The Kinks meet the Second World War, or Bob Seger meets Enya.”Tension aside, there’s a great sense of fun here. The title track is pure euphoria, as restless synths of a Utah Saints or Orbital rave break into swelling bass and melody. And they create the full club experience with “Got to Keep On”, on which the four-to-the-floor beat, funky rhythm guitar, sweet backing vocals and chiming bells make way for the simple sounds of happy party-goers just as the anticipation builds, so does the instrumentation into a hypnotic crescendo. It’s masterful production. (Elisa Bray)Six months after the release of Oxnard, Anderson .Paak returns with another Dr Dre-produced record, Ventura. Where the former was overflowing with choppy, experimental sounds, guest appearances and clumsy attempts at Gil Scott Heron-esque revolutionary lyrics, the sequel – recorded around the same time – streamlines .Paak’s sound, making for a tightly packaged, melodic and danceable album.Two years after the release of his Mercury Prize-nominated debut Yesterday’s Gone, the south London hip-hop artist unveils its follow-up, Not Waving, But Drowning. And if any two records could portray how quickly someone can grow from a boy to a man, it’s these.2739 Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouNo one could accuse Lizzo of holding back. Not when it comes to her voice – which is raw and rowdy, so laden with personality even the vulnerable moments are a joy to listen to –  and certainly not when it comes to her message of unabashed self-love. That’s the predominant theme of the singer  rapper  flautist-extraordinaire’s hugely likeable third album, Cuz I Love You.It seems as likely as Old Man Steptoe dining with the Rees-Mogg, but this new tactic of burying their confrontational gruesomeness beneath a veneer of alt-rock respectability for album three works well for Fat White Family. Drenched in chamber strings and celestial harmonies, the plush yet sinister “Oh Sebastian” could be Pet Sounds selling its soul to the devil. “Fringe Runner” is so sleek and funksome it could be a New Romantic “White Lines (Don’t Don’t Do It)” “Kim’s Sunsets” is a piece of refined cosmic reggae resembling a blissed-out “Bankrobber”.2939 Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date.SOAK reaches to outsiders once again on her new album. 3139 The Cranberries – In the EndThere’s a cruel irony that the release of The Cranberries’ final album should come just a week after journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead by the New IRA during a riot in Londonderry. “Zombie” was a protest song written by the band’s late frontwoman Dolores O’Riordan after two children were killed by IRA bombs – was released. She was deeply affected by the deaths, and would no doubt have been devastated by recent events in Northern Ireland as well.On her third record, Aldous Harding combines the gothic folk of her self-titled 2014 debut with the dramatically intimate tones of her follow-up album Party.Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs.On his debut album, the 24-year-old Collard mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto.   Dedicated covers the full, but generic, spectrum of relationships: dizzying love, lust, and break-ups. But whether she’s pining for the return of a former love in the funky disco banger “Julien”, or singing about masturbating post-break-up in lead single “Party For One” (“I’ll be the one If you don’t care about me Making love to myself Back on my beat”), the vibe remains positively jubilant.Getty Images for Spotify3639 Tyler, the Creator - IGOR“I don’t know where I’m going,” Tyler, the Creator begins on the song “I THINK”. “But I know what I’m showing.” The US artist’s words ring true throughout his fifth studio album, IGOR, where he adopts the dark and twisted mutterings of the Frankenstein character from which the record gets its name. It’s been a long wait for Flying Lotus’s new album. In fact, the LA producer has been masterminding Flamagra for the past five years – snatching moments between collaborating with Kendrick Lamar on To Pimp a Butterfly, directing and writing the comic horror movie Kuso, producing much of Thundercat’s Drunk and growing his Brainfeeder label.A heftier sound is never at the cost of melody, which shines through in Thomson’s vocals, the rest of the band’s backing falsetto, and the searing blues grooves stamped all over Future Dust. Those qualities are captured nowhere more satisfyingly than on “25”. “All Over Town” is their singalong anthem, neatly positioned in the middle to ease the pace.In keeping with the relatively restrained guest spots, it’s heartening just how much Skepta has rejected overloading Ignorance is Bliss with high-profile producers, preferring instead to burrow into his own aesthetic. There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums.“We had an absolute blast but there were certain parts of it where it just got a little bit toxic.”One Direction has been on hiatus since 2016 to allow its members (Payne, Niall Horan, Harry Styles and Louis Tomlinson) to pursue different projects.Payne, who is now 25 years old, released his first solo EP, titled\u0026nbspFirst Time, in August 2018.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Patrick Cockburn sounds out the localsClick to followThe IndependentThe River Wye flows through Herefordshire, which is more ‘feudal’ than neighbouring counties. Many big landowners ‘are the same as a hundred years ago’Herefordshire, a county of apple blossom and wild daffodils overlooked by the dark Welsh hills, is England’s arcadia. Its landscape inspired the magical land of Narnia according to CS\u0026nbspLewis. Its ancient gnarled oaks were the reputed model for the Ents, the fabulous trees that walk through the woods and talk to hobbits and wizards in JRR Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspFor anybody in search of an idyllic pastoral England, Herefordshire appears to be the right place to come. Everything is on a human scale, from the small cathedral city of Hereford with a population of 70,000, to the scattering of towns, villages, and hamlets filled with black-and-white timber frame houses. For those seeking signs of a more robust England, recalling heroic battlefields from Agincourt to Arnhem, there is the comforting presence of the SAS headquarters on the outskirts of Hereford. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMany people living here do not relish change for understandable reasons and regret the changes in Britain since the country entered the EU a half century ago. “There is a lot of nostalgia in Herefordshire,” says local historian David Whitehead. He notes that local newspapers like to run two-page spreads of old photographs of the county in the inter-war period when life appeared to be more stable and predictable. “People feel closer to the past here than in most of England,” he says.A feeling that Britain should not abandon a successful tradition of standing on its own is particularly strong in this county, which voted to leave the EU by 59 to 41 per cent in the referendum of 2016, a result which was confirmed by the outcome of the EU parliamentary election on 24 May.Brexit voters are a broad coalition of different and often contradictory interests, held together by a conviction that the EU is the cause of their troubles. The grouping includes well-off farmers, fed up with bureaucracy but happy to receive substantial\u0026nbspsubsidies, retirees in bucolic villages, and those “left behind”\u0026nbspor “left out”\u0026nbspfor whom Britain’s EU years have brought insecure ill-paying jobs, housing too expensive to buy, and a flood of immigrants.Created with Sketch. Show all 6Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The beauty and tranquillity of Herefordshire are deceptive: polarisation over Brexit is as deep here as in Islington or Sunderland. Dr Nick Meyer, a retired GP in Ledbury in the east of the county, replied to a question about political isions by saying he was planning on the following weekend to go on a boat trip with four friends, three of whom, including himself, were staunch Remainers and the fourth a committed Leave supporters. The Remainers had wondered if they should leave their friend behind to avoid rancorous disputes, but had finally decided to include him in the hope that they might change his mind during the sailing trip.“Brexit is very destructive in the way it has created a ided Britain,” says Dr Meyer. “Feeling about it is much stronger than it is between those supporting different political parties.”The level of anxiety over Brexit is no less than in metropolitan Britain. Tom Tibbets, who two years ago started a craft cider making business, says that he suffers acutely from Brexit related worries. “I have stress-related alopecia, which means that my hair is falling out,” he says, leaning forward to show a depleted but still substantial mop of dark hair. “According to my doctor this is all stress related.”Herefordshire is more “feudal” than neighbouring counties\u0026nbspand Whitehead says that many big landowners “are the same as a hundred years ago”.\u0026nbspHe says that much of the land between Ross-on-Wye in the south and Hereford in the north belongs to the Duchy of Cornwall, a purchase they made in the 1950s.Overall, however, \u0026nbspHerefordshire is an impoverished county with few jobs for young people, who go elsewhere for work, while well-off professionals from London and Birmingham buy local houses for half the price they would pay at home. “It is an underdeveloped county with poor roads, social services, buses and schools,” says Dr Meyer, who has worked in Herefordshire as a doctor for 30 years.In Herefordshire, as in the rest of Britain, it is easy to discover the reasons why people want Britain to stay in the EU: they make concrete arguments about the economically disastrous consequences of leaving. But Brexiters have a different set of priorities revolving around the supposed threat to Britain’s independence as a nation state by power-hungry bureaucrats in Brussels and other continental capitals. This argument is buttressed by compelling if dubious claims that the EU has for years been bleeding Britain financially and, once out, we will get the money back. \u0026nbspJohn Forsyth is one of many former SAS soldiers who has stayed in Herefordshire and works as a health and safety consultant. He says he voted as a young soldier in the 1975 referendum in favour of membership of the Common Market, but he was dismayed to find that “it has evolved towards a state of Europe”. He sees the EU as corrupt, incompetent and undemocratic: “The reason I want to leave is that I see the EU as this inflexible bureaucratic monstrosity. We would do better to look after our own interests and be able to change our own laws.” He believes that that the referendum did lead to an upsurge in racism, to which he is much opposed, and agrees that Britain has been politically polarised by Brexit, though he believes this will disappear \u0026nbspin time.He does not use the word ‘self-determination’ but his views are very similar to those of nationalists the world over, from the American fighting for independence in the 18th century to the Irish and Indians in the 20th. In all cases, there was a natural desire by people to control their own lives and a tendency to blame all their ills on the British government. Many of the criticisms were justified but scapegoating contains hidden dangers, whether the target is London or Brussels, because it means that those seeking to break free from a detested central authority do not have to devise practical policies of their own. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspEven so, it is strange to hear farmers in Herefordshire say they voted to leave the EU when they have benefited immensely from its subsidies. “The county voted massively for Brexit, but the people who are going to lose from Brexit are the farmers,” says James Marsden, an environmentalist who formerly worked for the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). The most important of these is “the basic payment scheme of £205 per hectare, which is paid not on what you do, but on how much land you own.” He says that outside the EU the smaller farmers will inevitably go the wall unless, as the Defra minister Michael Gove proposed last year, subsidies are in future geared to farmers cultivating the land in an environmentally friendly way.Ents, in Tolkien’s ‘Lord of the Rings’\u0026nbsp(Alamy)For now the reverse is happening: Marsden pointed through the windows of the house where we were talking at the pretty-looking cider apple orchard where the uniform rows of bush-sized trees were in full bloom. “What we are looking at,” he said, “is an intensely managed monoculture: the trees are not managed by hand but by machinery they are sprayed four times a year there are herbicidal patches beneath the trees. From the point of view of ersity, you might as well be growing rape seed or grain.”\u0026nbspOverall, Brexit will have two contradictory consequences for the rural environment: it will help preserve it because there will be fewer\u0026nbspfarmers, but will also damage it because those who stay in business – the larger ones with more capital to buy new machinery - will exploit it more intensively unless they are tightly regulated. He says small hill farmers in Wales, where he works part of the time, are highly conscious that they are facing extinction post-Brexit, but “in my parish in Herefordshire, they are still in denial”.Some are, in fact, deeply worried about their future. Owen Whittall \u0026nbspfarms cattle, sheep and mixed crops on 800 acres and is conflicted about Brexit. “I remember the morning of the referendum. My wife voted ‘in’ and I voted ‘out’ and I was not a happy person. I felt very uneasy with my decision and I am still not happy.”He thinks that many of the smaller farmers will not survive outside the EU unless they get a second job, intensify their farming, or accept a lower standard of living. He says with some scorn that a lot of well-paid professional people from the cities will be “buying idyllic little farms with a few Hereford and Dexter cattle and doing the lifestyle thing”.Dr Meyer, the Ledbury GP, says: “It will be disastrous for the farming community, but most farmers I know were for Brexit.” He says that one important reason for this was the EU’s bureaucratic hoops that even fervent Remainers confirm are fearsomely difficult. Tom Tibbets, the cider-maker who campaigned against Brexit, says he knows from personal experience that even moving a pig to the abattoir for personal consumption requires endless time-consuming paperwork. On the other hand, once these bureaucratic hurdles are negotiated, the flat rate subsidy is paid without further effort. Farmers do not volunteer what they get\u0026nbspbut one, on a medium-sized farm, said they were getting £30,000 a year.This is all very different from Narnia. Julian Whitmarsh, who owns the “Jules” restaurant’ in the picture post card village of Weobley, has a caustic take on social developments in rural Herefordshire. “Agriculture has ceased to be a craft and has become an industry,” he says. “It employs fewer and fewer people because the big farms that once employed eight workers now employ one.” He complains that villages are full of people who have sold their houses in the cities and “put on green wellies and are playing at Ambridge” (the fictional village in The Archers, the long-running BBC radio soap opera on rural life).His explanation as to why so many people in Herefordshire voted against their own best interests is that they are instinctively right wing and badly informed. Then there are the newspapers on which they rely for information about the EU and everything else in the world. He says: “The Daily Mail sells 50 copies every morning in Weobley and The Daily  almost as many copies. while there are about five who buy  and quite a few of us buy the i.”\u0026nbsp The strong Liberal Democrat and Green vote in the European parliamentary election in Herefordshire does not quite confirm this picture of right wing domination, but it sounds broadly correct.Not all agriculture is industrialised. Cider apples can be shaken loose and hoovered up by machine, but not eating apples, blue berries or strawberries which must be picked by hand. Workers are still needed to do the dirty jobs in the poultry units that are springing up all over the county. Such jobs have been done hitherto by a great influx of foreign labour from Eastern Europe who not only work as pickers or pruners but as vets in the abattoirs and managers in the hotels. Farmers say that this labour force, on which they depend, is in increasingly short supply because of fears of Brexit, the low value of the pound and improved economies in Poland, Hungry and elsewhere.Corbyn is right – only a general election can unite Leave and RemainRemain parties must ditch tribalism and work to stop a no-deal BrexitRenewable energy lets consumers save money and the planetIf sugar is killing us, why does Britain farm so much of it?Esther Rudge, a fourth generation farmer, worries about whether or not she will be able to go on getting the 30 foreign labourers, mostly Poles, whom she has formerly employed to pick her eating apples. Others face greater problems which they may be slow to appreciate: she and her husband have friends “who employ 1,000 foreign workers but still voted Leave”.An even greater threat facing British farming is the prospect that, after a no-deal Brexit, a British government might be desperate for a trade deal with the United States. The price for this might be the opening up of the British market to cheap American farm produce. “Agriculture could be the sacrificial lamb,” Rudge believes, “so you would get cheap beef and chicken coming into the country.” Even without such a deal, she fears that a British crash out of the EU leading to trade on WTO rules would ruin the British livestock industry.Some commentators have compared the prospects for British farming after Brexit as being like playing Russian roulette, but with only one chamber of the revolver unloaded. Others, with long experience of farming in the region,\u0026nbsphave a less cataclysmic but still gloomy view of the prospects for farmers. Francis Chester-Master, a landowner and land agent, gives a summary of the prospects with or without Brexit.Chester-Master says that what is most damaging for rural Britain is the continued uncertainty over whether or not Britain will leave the EU. But this uncertainty may not be a temporary problem supposing Brexit occurs. Rudge, who runs a successful medium-sized farm, says that outside the EU Britain “will be a small fish in a large pool” and small fish necessarily live day to day at the mercy of forces they do not control. Old certainties are evaporating and nobody can predict what will take their place.\u0026nbsp The farmers of Hereford – and in the rest of Britain – have deepened the uncertainties they were seeking to escape.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We believe that with this adjournment, there is a reasonable prospect of reaching an agreement that the majority of landlords will support.”Shopping centre owner Intu told Arcadia\u0026nbspon Wednesday that it will not back proposals to slash rents and close around 50 stores.Created with Sketch.

House of FraserHomebase has recently dropped the Bunnings association from its storesHowever, big landlords including British Land and Hammerson are said to have backed Arcadia\u0027s Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA), with others still wavering.Intu, which owns the Trafford centre in Manchester and Lakeside in Essex, counts Arcadia brands as tenants in 35 of its units.Intu reportedly refused\u0026nbspto back the plans because it would have to justify the rent cuts to other tenants.Landlords are cautious about offering discounts to certain tenants at a time when many retailers under pressure from falling sales, high rents, business rates and increasing wages.\u0026nbspArcadia, which owns brands including Topshop, Miss Selfridge, Evans and Burton had planned to shut 50 UK stores and cut rents on another 194.\u0026nbspJonathan De Mello, a director at retail consultancy Harper Dennis Hobbs, said large landlords feel that Sir Philip has already “played hardball” over rent rises in the past. “The CVA proposal comes in addition to that.\u0026nbsp“Landlords feel that Philip Green wants to get out of certain liabilities but they feel they have reduced rents enough.”If Sir Philip\u0027s Arcadia group\u0026nbspwere to enter administration it would become the most high-profile in a series of retail collapses.Debenhams\u0026nbspand House of Fraser, have called in the administrators in recent months, while Toys R\u0027 Us and Maplin have disappeared completely.Sir Philip Green\u0027s Arcadia Group confirms slew of shop closuresSir Philip, once lauded as the king of the high street, cleared a major hurdle on Tuesday after receiving the backing of the Pensions Regulator (TPR) for his rescue plans.The retail mogul agreed to inject\u0026nbspan additional £25m into Arcadia\u0027s\u0026nbsppension fund, taking the total\u0026nbspamount pledged in cash and security to more than £300m.News of\u0026nbspthe agreement came shortly after the watchdog ordered Sir Philip to pay in an extra £50m\u0026nbspin order to secure its support for\u0026nbspArcadia\u0027s CVA.Arcadia said Lady Green, the group\u0027s ultimate owner, had signed off the additional cash.The Pensions Regulator said: Following extensive discussions with the company, shareholders, the trustees of the pension schemes, the PPF and advisers, we are pleased that additional security has been agreed in support for the pension schemes which brings the total security value to £210m.This is in addition to agreed contributions of £100m to be paid to the schemes by Lady Green.Given this enhanced level of support, we now consider the updated CVA proposals are sufficient because they provide better protection for scheme members in these difficult circumstances.We recognise that the best support for any pension scheme is a trading employer and we feel the CVA proposals now provide the right balance between security for the pension schemes and the chance of sustainability for the company.The Pension Protection Fund (PPF) is due to vote on whether to support the scheme on Wednesday.Arcadia\u0027s brands have struggled to keep up with changing fashion trends and competition from Primark as well as online rivals.Critics have accused Sir Philip of underinvesting in the group\u0027s stores.

Unfortunately, Beckham is not alone in apparently thinking that time spent driving can also be usefully spent doing something else.But it isn’t just phones that can distract us while driving. Increasingly, vehicles come pre-installed with technology that promises to improve our lives and let us get that little bit more productivity out of our journey –\u0026nbspbe it digital assistants such as Alexa or parking-assist systems. Many such technologies are designed to keep us safe, but could they actually be dangerous – giving us a false impression that our attention can be focused elsewhere? We have been finding out.Interestingly, most drivers seem to support the view that hand-held phone use is risky, as it involves the driver potentially taking their hands off the wheel. They also know it is illegal. The problem is that many drivers still continue to use their phones “hands-free” behind the wheel, because the law allows them to do so providing their hands are on the wheel. This implies it is a safe alternative.But research clearly shows that the driving behaviour and crash risk of a phone-using driver (whether that is hand-held or hands-free) is similar to, and sometimes worse than, that of a drunk driver. Our research has shown that phone use carries a significant cost to a driver’s attention, making them far more prone to errors, including failures in visual perception and inability to detect and react to hazards.The real problem with phone use is the cognitive demands it places on a driver. If we try to allocate attention to another engaging task at the same time as driving, our performance in both tasks suffers.Created with Sketch.Science news in pictures Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.120 Elephant poaching rates drop in AfricaAfrican elephant poaching rates have dropped by 60 per cent in six years, an international study has found. 220 Ancient four-legged whale discovered in PeruScientists have identified a four-legged creature with webbed feet to be an ancestor of the whale.

Drivers can now ask Alexa or Google Assistant a question, listen to text messages read aloud by the vehicle and use voice commands to initiate phone calls. All of this tech also works on the assumption that if it’s only your voice you are using, there are no safety implications.This is problematic as a wealth of research demonstrates that this kind of “infotainment” technology actually causes some of the distraction that contributes to driver error.Driving is complex and fast-paced, requiring the processing of information from multiple inputs, yet often we are made to feel as though it is easy. But demands on attention when driving vary from minute to minute, meaning any focus allocated elsewhere is a precious resource which may not be available when the driver faces an unexpected event. Listening to music, however, is less of a problem as it isn’t interactive in the same way as other technologies.As failure at the wheel can have devastating consequences, it is unsurprising that the idea of technological solutions to mitigate driver error are also becoming more common. It’s likely that Beckham’s Bentley has (at the very least)\u0026nbspan anti-lock braking system, parking-assist, reversing sensors and lane-keeping technology. Such technology has led to a trend in advertising that encourages a belief that our modern cars can pretty much drive themselves.Uber partnering with US army on flying car technologyThe European parliament recently announced that, from 2022, all new cars should be fitted with intelligent speed assistance, along with other safety features designed to alert drivers if they are distracted\u0026nbspor feel\u0026nbspdrowsy.But will these technologies increase safety, or could they encourage further distraction? Clearly, drivers are not great at respecting speed limits, so it may seem like a good idea to aim to take the choice of whether to speed or not out of our hands. To make something “techno-fixable” though, you need to reduce complex driving behaviour to dichotomies of “safe” and “dangerous”. Technology needs to be told which behaviour triggers which response in simple, binary terms as it cannot (yet) handle ifs and buts and context. But the risk is that this may encourage us to believe that 30mph, for example, is inherently safe, even when 20mph, or even less, might have been the safer choice. This is something we would like to explore further in our research.Likewise, tech that warns a driver if they are showing signs of drowsiness or intoxication, and parks their car for them if they don’t respond correctly, could actually encourage drivers to think that they can drive when unfit because the car will step in and save them. Technology can be marketed as improving safety, but safety requires understanding – not dichotomies.Millions of \u0027grossly polluting\u0027 diesel cars still on Europe\u0027s roadsVolvo XC90 review: Can an SUV make sense as a low-carbon eco car?Car Review: Toyota Corolla Hybrid – a car to surprise and delightWe know that a driver with their hands obligingly at the “10\u0026nbspand two position” can nonetheless be dangerously distracted. Yet we are continually introducing technologies to our vehicles that are distracting. Sadly, we can’t be sure that manufacturers are motivated by selling safety, as opposed to a version of safety that sells.At a time when we are no longer seeing year-on-year reductions in the number of people being killed or seriously injured on our roads, it seems clear that something radical needs to be done to get drivers’ focus back on to the driving task itself –\u0026nbspand to challenge the perception that getting from A to B is a good opportunity to indulge in catching up on a bit of C.Gemma\u0026nbspBriggs is a senior lecturer in psychology at the Open University.

This\u0026nbspprevents light being reflected off them, meaning\u0026nbspthey are invisible to potential prey, according to the latest research.\u0026nbsp“They spend most of their time sitting around with their jaws open, waiting for something to come by,” said lead researcher Audrey Velasco-Hogan, a PhD student at the University of California San Diego.\u0026nbsp“Their teeth are always exposed, so it’s important that they are transparent so they don’t reflect or scatter any bioluminescent light from the environment.”Despite measuring just 15 centimetres in length, deep-sea dragonfish (Aristostomias scintillans) are apex predators and feed on fish that are up to half their size. They are so voracious that they even eat each other.\u0026nbspnanocrystals (Audrey Velasco)If their teeth were visible, prey would immediately shy away, researchers say.Scientists analysed the nanostructure of the teeth by using electron microscopy, which is a technique used to obtain high-resolution images of biological specimens.\u0026nbspThey discovered that like humans, dragonfish have an outer enamel-like layer and an inner dentin later.The outer layer was covered in grain-sized nanocrystals arranged to prevent\u0026nbsplight being scattered or reflected off the surface of the teeth, according to the paper published in the journal Matter.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Weird \u0026amp Wonderful: life in the deep sea Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Hidden Ocean 2005 Expedition: NOAA Office of Ocean ExplorationLarva of a European lobsterSixgill shark on Santa Rosa Reef, south of GuamHidden Ocean 2005 Expedition: NOAA Office of Ocean ExplorationLarva of a European lobsterSixgill shark on Santa Rosa Reef, south of GuamThe inner\u0026nbsplayer is also\u0026nbspstructured in a different way, and does not have microscopic channels called dentin tubes which normally give teeth their ivory colour.

From the mid-19th century, iron mining fundamentally altered Western Cumbria and the Furness peninsular, making a significant contribution to the national economy. However, site clearances following industrial decline in the second half of the 20th century, has left few surviving remains of the industry. Florence Mine is believed to have been the last iron mine to close in Europe and was last worked in 2007. Hematite iron ore from the mine is used for the pigment Egremont Red, still found in some lipsticks today.234 University of York, Campus West designed landscape. Heslington, YorkThe University of York Campus West designed landscape was laid out from 1963-1980 It is a high-quality post-war university landscape that fulfils the architects’ masterplan vision of creating a town in miniature with a pedestrianised environment. One of the key features of the landscape is the lake, which has two small islands, a courtyard pool and a fountain which form a central focal point at the heart of the campus. Offering bursts of green against the surrounding concrete structures are the lake features, reed beds and lily pads, which were introduced to improve water purity. The landscape is relatively unaltered since it was laid out and the design successfully integrates the new landscape with the historic Heslington Hall gardens. It was designed by distinguished mid-20th century architects Andrew Derbyshire and Maurice Lee of RMJM with Frank Clark, the co-founders of the Garden History Society (now The Garden Trust).334 University of York, Campus West designed landscape.

It is here that they made 17 gallon galvanised iron containers, designed for transporting milk by rail. The company was heavily associated with George Barnham, who invented the containers and went on to become chair of the British Dairy Farmers Association, Mayor of Hampstead and High Sheriff of Middlesex and was knighted in 1904.Travellers on the East Coast Main Line north of York typically pass the former Otterington Railway Station at over 100 miles per hour. This station building with its signal box was built by the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) in 1932 as a replacement for the Victorian station that had been cleared away to allow the expansion of the line to four tracks. 634 University of York, Central Hall. Heslington, YorkThe University of York was one of seven new universities founded in England between 1958 and 1961. Central Hall is the centrepiece of the University’s western campus and has a striking and bold design. The exceptionally detailed development plan behind the campus was heralded as the beginning of contemporary university planning in Britain. The building is a concrete structure with a suspended mild steel tubular roof clad in aluminium, with the upper floors, where the auditorium is located, cantilevered out on the lake sides. It continues a historic tradition established by late 19th century and early 20th century ‘red brick’ universities in featuring a great hall for special events.734 Pedestrian Subway, Vestibule, Terrace and Stairs beneath Crystal Palace Parade. South LondonThe Crystal Palace subway, vestibule, terrace and stairs provide an elaborate pedestrian passageway, with finely-crafted Byzantine-style vaulting in red and cream brick and chequered floors in alternating stone. The structure dates from 1865 and was built to link a new train station directly to the entrance of the Crystal Palace. Designed by highly-accomplished architect Charles Barry Junior, the quality of construction is excellent. It is an architecturally imaginative solution to the problem of transporting visitors beneath Crystal Palace Parade and providing a dramatic introduction to the palace itself. 834 Pedestrian Subway, Vestibule, Terrace and Stairs beneath Crystal Palace Parade.

It dates to around the 1940s and was built by Harry and Ethel Parry-Jones in memory of their son, David, a lieutenant in the 1st Battalion of The Rifle Brigade who died at the age of 20 on 3 August 1944 during the Battle of Normandy. Local materials were used including Purbeck stone and thatch which complements the bus shelter’s surroundings. Despite its vulnerability as a piece of street furniture, the bus shelter has not been significantly altered since it was first built. It demonstrates that even modest and functional structures can form eloquent and valuable memorials for their local communities.Although modest in scale, the Assembly Rooms building has great presence with its bright, red brick exterior. This charming community hall boasts an exuberant design with its late-19th century, Jacobean Revival style, terracotta tiles and stone detailing.

Pendeen, CornwallThe parish of Pendeen in Cornwall was established in 1846, and its first vicar, Reverend Robert Aitken, was tasked to provide a church for the community. Aitken was renowned for his unusual preaching style and this was deemed to be well-suited to pull people away from the dominance of Methodism in the county’s mining communities. Aitken took it upon himself to design the church, the neighbouring vicarage and school, using local materials. Many of the fixtures and fittings were also made by local craftspeople, and Aitken donated his own collection of 16th century and 17th century Flemish and German glass roundels to enhance the windows. 1334 St John the Baptist Church, boundary walls, vicarage and school.

Sir Walter John Tapper, a notable architect with many listed buildings to his name, was commissioned by Uppingham School to follow the tradition of public schools and universities investing in cricket pavilions.Sir Walter John Tapper, a notable architect with many listed buildings to his name, was commissioned by Uppingham School to follow the tradition of public schools and universities investing in cricket pavilions.The Cock Sign stands at a prominent location at the junction of Sutton High Street and Carshalton Road. It dates to around 1907 and originates from a pub called The Cock which was located at a junction known as The Cock Cross Roads and owned by ‘Gentleman Jackson’ (1769-1845), a celebrated English boxer who won the title ‘Champion of England.’  The Cock Sign stands at a prominent location at the junction of Sutton High Street and Carshalton Road.

Traditionally, in Northern England, Iron Age and Romano-British native settlements take a variety of forms, with enclosures being defined by a bank and a ditch. Higher status enclosures, however, were formed of stone and have now been reduced to stony earthworks, as at East Mellwaters. The site is adjacent to other prehistoric settlement remains, which are thought to represent a succession of settlement sites established over the centuries. Architects Michael and Patty Hopkins built the house as a family home in 1975-1976, which also served as their office until the early 1980s. The couple designed and constructed the house as a study in making use of the maximum, flexible space of the site and were influenced by the Eames Case Study House of 1949. The house is notable for its energy efficiency, which includes the low thermal demands of the house, sparing use of materials and Venetian blinds. The highly elegant and economic lightweight steel frame and glass building made in the High-Tech tradition, is particularly eye-catching amongst the Victorian mansions typical of Hampstead and the Regency villas that make Downshire Hill distinctive from the rest of the village. The house won an RIBA award in 1977 and a Civic Trust Award in 1979. The couple jointly won the RIBA Gold Medal in 1994 and Michael Hopkins went on to receive a knighthood for his achievements in 1995.The former office of the Wiltshire and Gloucestershire Standard. The Wiltshire and Gloucestershire Standard was founded in Malmesbury in 1837 and its production moved to Cirencester in 1840. It has continued to bring local news to the people of the two counties ever since. In 1904 the paper’s owner, George Henry Harmer, who had worked his way up through the firm from reporter to proprietor, sought to unite the printing and publishing arms of the paper on the same site for the first time, and commissioned local architect VA Lawson to design a new publishing office on a narrow site in Dyer Street, retaining the existing printing sheds to the rear. The resulting three-storey building has an imposing presence in a street of otherwise modest Cotswold buildings. It is in an Arts and Crafts style, taller than its neighbours, with jetties which project the elaborate timber-framed upper floors out over the street.In 1934, Rolls Royce leased two hangars at the Hucknall airfield, which was established in 1917, and created a testing programme there for aero engines and equipment. The building is largely intact and features many surviving fixtures dating back to the mid-20th century, including an engine-testing control panel, observation windows, wing spar mount assembly, roller doors, pierced metal sheet lining, as well as fittings and support for a de-tuner.  The site saw many world-leading developments such as the Merlin Engine, which was tested, developed and adapted for the American Mustang fighter aircraft there. The world’s first flight of a commercial jet aircraft flew from Hucknall to the Paris Air show in the late 1940s, using Frank Whittle’s jet engine which had been developed on site.

Newcastle on Clun, ShropshireThe lych gate to the east of Church of St John the Evangelist in Newcastle on Clun dates from 1880 and forms a picturesque entrance to St John’s churchyard. The design follows the Arts and Crafts traditions, bringing together joinery, ironmongery and slate work and is inspired by medieval predecessors. The roof mimics that of the lych gate claimed to be the oldest in the country, at the Church of St George in Beckenham, Kent, originally constructed in the 13th century. Within the timber-framed passageway of the lych gate is a revolving gate, which is an unusual feature and one of only a handful in existence in England. ‘Lych’ derives from the Anglo-Saxon or German word for corpse, and is named after the structure’s primary function of storing the coffin before burial. Lych gates also serve as a meeting point and shelter for funeral parties before they are met by the priest.The fishing industry in Newlyn on the south coast of Cornwall expanded in the 1880s, resulting in the construction of a new harbour and two piers. In the early 20th century, the south pier was extended to give better protection to the harbour and a tidal observatory was built at its north end. The observatory was one of three constructed at the request of Ordnance Survey to establish Mean Sea Level.The former lifeboat house, built in 1884, was designed by CH Cooke and represents the crucial role played by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) in saving lives at sea since the 19th century. Its wide gabled structure and ornamental treatment, made up of fish-scale tiling, decorative moulded brick, and a beautifully incorporated bay window, create a finely detailed and strikingly composed building.2634 Cattle Trough and Drinking Fountain. Spaniards Road, HampsteadCattle troughs were once commonplace in Britain, with the politan Drinking Fountain and Cattle Trough Association (MDFCTA) responsible for over 1000 of them. Around 500 of these were located in London, however a large number have now been lost. The trough in Spaniards Road was believed to have been erected in 1916, making it a particularly late example of its type. Although the pump and spout mechanism are missing, the cattle trough is an important reminder that horse-drawn transport was commonplace in the early 20th century, despite the increasing use of motorised transport. In providing free drinking water for horses, charities like the MDFCTA also played an important role in raising standards in animal welfare.This early 17th century gatehouse to the former Caynton Manor is a remarkable survival, previously undiscovered. Originally a formal gateway to a wealthy country house, it has been used for agricultural purposes since the 18th century. While very little is known about the house which the gatehouse served, the quality of the gatehouse signifies a substantial building of high status. It is a well-proportioned building with a red sandstone base, a tiled roof and good quality detailing, characteristic of this building type at the time it was built, around 1635. Of particular interest is the carved detailing around the archways and the elaborate plasterwork in the principal rooms inside the gatehouse. This listing means that it can now be assessed for inclusion on Historic England’s Heritage at Risk Register, which would enable Historic England to offer specialist technical advice to help secure its future.This early 17th century gatehouse to the former Caynton Manor is a remarkable survival, previously undiscovered.

Chipping Camden, Gloucestershire The garden at Kingcombe complements Grade II listed Kingcombe House. It is an increasingly rare survival of an Arts and Crafts garden laid out in the 1930s. The pre-war garden is well-preserved and is an impressive and thoughtful design which includes Italian influences in the terraced garden including Italian steps to ide it from the more functional parts of the garden and to provide a vertical link from the top of the terraces to the meadow beyond the garden. Intact gardens dating from the 1930s are rare in England. It was designed initially by Sir Geoffrey Jellicoe and Russell Page with Sir Gordon Russell between 1927 and 1936 with later additions by Sir Gordon Russell from the 1940s through to the 1970s. During the Second World War and the austerity years that followed, few private houses were built so commissions for new gardens were few and far between.3034 Garden at Kingcombe.

Cappleside Barn in Ribblesdale, North Yorkshire was built in 1714. It is a large barn with a remarkable ornamental roof structure with carefully shaped timbers that also include carved motifs such as ‘daisy-wheels’. At first, Historic England thought that these roof timbers had been reused from a high-status medieval house, but dendrochronology has shown that the timbers came from trees felled shortly before the construction of the barn.

Florence Mine in West Cumbria is one of the best-surviving mining sites of any type nationally and is the best-surviving example of an iron mining pit head in England: it retains a full suite of buildings complete with nearly all of its machinery and equipment. From the mid-19th century, iron mining fundamentally altered Western Cumbria and the Furness peninsular, making a significant contribution to the national economy. However, site clearances following industrial decline in the second half of the 20th century, has left few surviving remains of the industry. Florence Mine is believed to have been the last iron mine to close in Europe and was last worked in 2007. Hematite iron ore from the mine is used for the pigment Egremont Red, still found in some lipsticks today.234 University of York, Campus West designed landscape. Heslington, YorkThe University of York Campus West designed landscape was laid out from 1963-1980 It is a high-quality post-war university landscape that fulfils the architects’ masterplan vision of creating a town in miniature with a pedestrianised environment. One of the key features of the landscape is the lake, which has two small islands, a courtyard pool and a fountain which form a central focal point at the heart of the campus. Offering bursts of green against the surrounding concrete structures are the lake features, reed beds and lily pads, which were introduced to improve water purity. The landscape is relatively unaltered since it was laid out and the design successfully integrates the new landscape with the historic Heslington Hall gardens. It was designed by distinguished mid-20th century architects Andrew Derbyshire and Maurice Lee of RMJM with Frank Clark, the co-founders of the Garden History Society (now The Garden Trust).334 University of York, Campus West designed landscape.

It is here that they made 17 gallon galvanised iron containers, designed for transporting milk by rail. The company was heavily associated with George Barnham, who invented the containers and went on to become chair of the British Dairy Farmers Association, Mayor of Hampstead and High Sheriff of Middlesex and was knighted in 1904.Travellers on the East Coast Main Line north of York typically pass the former Otterington Railway Station at over 100 miles per hour. This station building with its signal box was built by the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) in 1932 as a replacement for the Victorian station that had been cleared away to allow the expansion of the line to four tracks. 634 University of York, Central Hall. Heslington, YorkThe University of York was one of seven new universities founded in England between 1958 and 1961. Central Hall is the centrepiece of the University’s western campus and has a striking and bold design. The exceptionally detailed development plan behind the campus was heralded as the beginning of contemporary university planning in Britain. The building is a concrete structure with a suspended mild steel tubular roof clad in aluminium, with the upper floors, where the auditorium is located, cantilevered out on the lake sides. It continues a historic tradition established by late 19th century and early 20th century ‘red brick’ universities in featuring a great hall for special events.734 Pedestrian Subway, Vestibule, Terrace and Stairs beneath Crystal Palace Parade. South LondonThe Crystal Palace subway, vestibule, terrace and stairs provide an elaborate pedestrian passageway, with finely-crafted Byzantine-style vaulting in red and cream brick and chequered floors in alternating stone. The structure dates from 1865 and was built to link a new train station directly to the entrance of the Crystal Palace. Designed by highly-accomplished architect Charles Barry Junior, the quality of construction is excellent. It is an architecturally imaginative solution to the problem of transporting visitors beneath Crystal Palace Parade and providing a dramatic introduction to the palace itself. 834 Pedestrian Subway, Vestibule, Terrace and Stairs beneath Crystal Palace Parade.

Cappleside Barn in Ribblesdale, North Yorkshire was built in 1714. It is a large barn with a remarkable ornamental roof structure with carefully shaped timbers that also include carved motifs such as ‘daisy-wheels’. At first, Historic England thought that these roof timbers had been reused from a high-status medieval house, but dendrochronology has shown that the timbers came from trees felled shortly before the construction of the barn.

But the scheme was brought to an end in March and, while a new system was expected to be rolled out, officials confirmed new installations would be expected to give their unused clean power to energy companies for free.The opposition argued that data showed the scrapping of home panel subsidies from April caused new solar power capacity to fall from 79MW in March to only 5MW last month,  reports.In response, David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister, said: “There are already about 400,000 jobs in low-carbon businesses and their supply chains throughout the UK, with scope for much more low-carbon growth to support up to two million jobs in the future.\u0026nbsp“We have now received advice from the independent committee on climate change about how to time and to legislate for our transition to a completely decarbonised economy, and we will be bringing forward later this year our decisions on how and when we will be taking that action.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There are too many vacancies and with the retirement of many judges looming,\u0026nbspwe must act now before we see a serious impact on our courts and tribunals.“Judges are in a unique position and once they join the bench are not permitted to return to practice. Without the best legal minds in these seats, everyone that uses our courts will suffer, as will our international reputation.”Gauke (Reuters)The move is a response to a Senior Salaries Review Body (SSRB), which recommended of a 32 per cent permanent salary increase for High Court judges and 22 per cent hike for Circuit and Upper Tribunal judges covered by the new 2015 pension scheme.\u0026nbspThe Ministry of Justice said the review identified “clear evidence of significant and growing recruitment and retention problems among the judiciary, particularly at senior levels”.\u0026nbspIt found that, by joining the judiciary from private legal practice, some new judges took a pay cut of up to two-thirds. \u0026nbspIn a joint statement, the Lord Chief Justice and Senior President of Tribunals\u0026nbspsaid the pay increase would have “a significant effect on addressing critical shortages in the judiciary”.They said that judges “do their utmost” to ensure cases are dealt with both promptly but are concerned “that there is an urgent need to recruit enough judges to tackle the workload in a sustainable way”.\u0026nbsp“Judges are conscious that they are well paid compared to most in the public sector,” Lord Burnett and Sir Ernest Ryder added.“They are continually finding ways to make the administration of justice more efficient both through the modernisation programme being run by HMCTS and more widely.\u0026nbsp“We are pleased that the government are taking action to address the serious difficulties faced in recruiting to the judiciary.”Ministry of Justice\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It felt cruel and humiliating. It’s 2019 – you can’t have people doing that to you. It’s just wrong.”Mr Byrne said he had arrived at Dublin airport at 6.45pm, leaving plenty of time to tell staff from OCS – the company that operates the lift for disabled passengers – that he required assistance to get on his flight at 8.50pm.He said there had been “a slight delay of around five minutes” getting the lift ready to take him on board before he was told the pilot was refusing to take him on board.After being denied his place on the plane, he had to wait over two-and-a-half hours to board the next one leaving for Birmingham.This government is failing disabled children and their familiesMr Byrne is paraplegic, meaning that he has an impairment in motor or sensory function of the lower extremities. Mr Byrne said long hours of chair sitting can increase the risk of pressure sores.“The next flight was delayed until 11.30pm, so I didn’t finally get back home to Nottingham until 2.30am,” he said. “The whole journey from Dublin city centre took around nine hours. I could have gone to America in that time.”He added: “I haven’t had a good explanation. The pilot must have seen me waiting on the lift. It takes five minutes to lift me on.”“I’ve been all over the world to represent Team GB and haven’t had anything like this happen before. I certainly want to get apology. More than anything else, I want to make sure it doesn’t happen to anyone else.”Mr Byrne said he had received an email from Ryanair saying the company was now investigating.A\u0026nbspRyanair\u0026nbspspokesperson told The Independent: “While we regret any inconvenience caused, special assistance services at Dublin Airport are operated by OCS – at great expense to the airlines.”A spokesperson for OCS said the company had no comment to make.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Theresa May said she wouldn’t stand down until we had left the EU, and David Cameron said he wouldn’t publish his memoir. Both those events are now going to take place while we are still an EU member, but Adam Hills, presenter of The Last Leg, is still growing his beard and, as far as I know, Jake Berry, the local government minister, is still not drinking.\u0026nbspAnd Liz Truss, the chief secretary to the Treasury, confirmed today that the end of austerity, too, has been postponed until after the Brexit crisis has been resolved. As we report today, she told a House of Lords committee that the public spending review promised for this autumn is now “unlikely to happen”.\u0026nbspTheresa May said at the Conservative Party conference in October (the one where she danced onto the stage): “A decade after the financial crash, people need to know that the austerity it led to is over.”The trouble with relaxing a squeeze on public spending is that it takes a long time for the public to feel it. The Labour government struggled to convince people that things did actually “get better” after it turned on the spending taps in 1999 – having raised expectations in the 1997 election, it kept to stringent Tory spending plans for two years and even after that it took longer than expected for the benefits to be felt in wards and classrooms.\u0026nbspTory turmoil will slam brakes on pledge to end austerity, admits TrussNow the Conservatives seem to have repeated that mistake. The prime minister announced the end of austerity before the new money had started to flow. She has made eye-catching promises of vast extra spending on the NHS, outbidding the Leave campaign’s £350m a week on the side of the bus by promising an extra £394m a week by 2023. But most of this money is some way into the future, and now the spending review, which would have set out spending plans for all departments over the next three years, has been postponed.\u0026nbspThat means that\u0026nbspmost departments face an immediate future in which budgets will only just keep up with inflation. This is better than the year-on-year cuts in real spending (except in the protected budgets for health, defence and aid)\u0026nbspduring the coalition government.\u0026nbspBut Philip Hammond, the chancellor, was forced to announce an emergency top-up to the Home Office’s policing budget in his spring statement in March, and there are still large cuts in the social security budget pencilled in to be made as universal credit is extended.\u0026nbspOf course, the delay to this autumn’s spending review is not directly the result of the postponement of Brexit. It is the change of prime minister – or, as Truss put it, the “goings-on within the Conservative Party” – that means the review has been put off. The new prime minister, expected to take office in the week beginning 22 July, will want to reset the government’s spending priorities.\u0026nbspWhoever it is, they will want to reannounce the “end of austerity”. But it may be several years before most of the British people will feel it.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There are still people who believe there is another way through this – I don’t see it.“Jeremy Corbyn is the leader of the Labour party and he makes the final call of course.”Asked if she wanted her leader to “come round”, Ms Chapman replied: “I would say that.”The comments came as the Labour-run Welsh Government officially shifted its position, in order to campaign to remain in the EU.Jeremy Miles, the Brexit minister, told the Senedd in Cardiff there was no prospect for its previous proposals for leaving with a deal that involved staying in the single market and customs union.“We sought to reconcile the result of the 2016 referendum with the least damaging kind of Brexit but that effort has now reached the end of the road,” Mr Miles said.“Faced by this sort of binary choice, we as a government must recognise these realities and change course.”The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Brexit worried him.“I can’t help feeling that it would be an awful shame if what we’ve gone to so much trouble to do, to collect the European big nations together, to break it all up now would be a

challenged the invocation of wartime patriotism by the Leave camp, pointing out that it was Sir Winston Churchill who called for the creation of a “European family” to prevent another descent into bloodshed.Churchill’s words helped inspire the creation of the Common Market, which evolved into the European Union with “one main purpose - to create lasting peace by entwining our economies and societies together on a continent once ravaged by war,” they said.“Nato does not keep the peace in Europe – it keeps peace for Europe. It is the EU that keeps peace in Europe, because when you trade, you do not fight.“As former members of the armed forces and veterans of more recent conflicts, we have served alongside soldiers from other European nations, supporting each other while under fire or facing danger.Trump and Brexit are inseparable now – and it will only get worseNigel Farage makes final drive to win Brexit Party\u0027s first MPEven without Brexit delays, austerity’s effects will be felt for yearsCorbyn must commit to referendum \u0027now\u0027, says Brexit spokeswoman“We have learnt that war stinks, that peace is the natural goal for civilisation, and that Europeans are our brothers in arms.“But that peace and friendship is now threatened by Brexit.\u0026nbsp Peace in Europe is not something that should be taken for granted.“We should be proud to lead in Europe, proud that our friends respect us and can rely on us.

Thirteen nations, including British, Irish, French and Dutch, also Belgians, Poles and Czechs - from all branches of the services - were part of that liberation coalition.“As Europeans, we were stronger together then and should be stronger together now.”He added: “What has happened since 2016 is very disturbing, and it’s clear that the military aspects of Brexit weren’t thought about properly.“Politicians trying to force us out of the EU without going back to the people are cowards, not leaders.

Asked if the Labour leader should announce a shift in policy straight away, she\u0026nbsptold the BBC: “I think so – I think it should be now.”Nigel Farage makes final drive to win Brexit Party’s first MPEven without Brexit delays, austerity’s effects will be felt for yearsCorbyn must commit to referendum ‘now’, says Brexit spokeswoman‘Existential threat’ to Tories if they don’t deliver Brexit- JohnsonThe party is braced to lose the Peterborough constituency to Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party in a by-election on Thursday, which is expected to see Liberal Democrats benefit from Remain\u0026nbspswitchers frustrated by\u0026nbspthe lack of clarity in Mr Corbyn’s stance.Despite calls from senior shadow cabinet members, including deputy leader Tom Watson, to throw the party’s weight behind a second referendum on any Brexit deal, Mr Corbyn has stuck to the policy of supporting a people’s vote only if Labour cannot obtain its preferred EU withdrawal outcome or a general election. And he has kept the party’s campaign focus\u0026nbspon issues like austerity, health and public services rather than Europe.Applying polling responses from more than 15,000 voters over the past month to inidual constituencies, data analysis company Focaldata found that Labour would be the biggest party in the new parliament, but might lose more than 40 per cent of its 2017 support.According to the figures, Jeremy Corbyn’s party would be left well short of a majority and forced to rely on some sort of deal with Remain-backing Liberal Democrats and nationalist parties to form a government, making a Final Say poll all but inevitable.Focaldata’s analysis for Best for Britain and the Hope Not Hate campaign found that 42 per cent of those who backed Labour in 2017 would desert the party in a new general election, with the vast bulk (30 per cent) going to Remain-backing parties like the Lib Dems, 2 per cent to the Scottish National Party or Plaid Cymru and 10 per cent to the Brexit Party.Tories would lose more than half of the voters who backed Theresa May in the last general election, with 37 per cent going to Farage’s party, 8 per cent to the Lib Dems and 2 per cent each to Labour and the Greens.\u0026nbspLabour would take 24.8 per cent of the vote, ahead of the Brexit Party on 22.9 per cent, with the Tories trailing in third with 21.7 and Lib Dems on 17.6.On these figures, Mr Corbyn could find himself at the head of a 251-strong Labour contingent in the Commons, as the largest single party but far from the 326 MPs needed for an absolute majority.With the Brexit Party taking 135 seats and Tories 132 under these calculations, Lib Dems on 53 and the SNP enjoying a near clean-sweep of 55 out of 59 constituencies north of the border, Mr Corbyn may be forced to seek an anti-Brexit alliance of some form to have any hope of governing.According to the analysis, prominent\u0026nbspTories like defence secretary Penny Mordaunt, work and pensions secretary, Amber Rudd, and communities secretary, James Brokenshire, could all lose their seats, while leadership favourite Boris Johnson’s Uxbridge and Ruislip would become a marginal.Best for Britain chief operating officer Naomi Smith said: “The consequences of Labour’s ambivalent policy towards a Final Say on Brexit looks set to hurt them further. They’re expected to lose almost half of their 2017 vote share, according to our analysis.“The Labour leadership now needs to pick a side, and with them losing three times as many votes to Remain parties as they are to the Brexit Party, it is obvious which position they should take if they want to be in government.”Farage says the Brexit Party could ‘stun everybody’ in a general electionThe chief executive of Hope Not Hate, Nick Lowles, said: “This poll reveals a quite shocking surge in a hardline right-wing Brexit Party, led by a isive and dangerous politician in Nigel Farage.“We are onto very, very dangerous ground and every mainstream party needs to think very carefully about how to avoid these results coming to pass.”Mr Lowles said Labour was “bleeding votes” to parties which have taken a clear anti-Brexit stance.“Labour will lose seats in areas that voted Leave if they continue to lose the support of Labour Remain voters,” he said. “It’s counter-intuitive but it’s the reality.“The evidence is clear – from this poll, and the recent election results – if Labour wants to win a majority at the next election, it needs to move to keep its Remain voters on board.”Focaldata collected vote intention data from 15,231 national poll respondents between 17 and 30 May, using a technique called MRP to estimate opinion in each UK constituency.\u0026nbspBest for Britain\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The company is the largest supermarket chain in the world by revenues.Created with Sketch.The Democrat challengers to Trump in 2020 Show all 22Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The Vermont senator has announced that he will be running again in 2020 after losing out to Hilary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic primaries.

Retailers Target Corp and Costco also pay higher rates than Walmart.Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon said Walmart had raised wages in the United States by 50 per cent in the past four years and continued to increase wages on a market-by-market basis to hire and retain talent.“We are not perfect, but together we are learning, we are listening and changing,” he said.Walmart has said it pays an average of $17.50 an hour to its hourly employees, including benefits.The proposal presented by Mr Sanders was unlikely to pass the Walton family owns a majority of shares and the retailer had asked shareholders to vote against it.Mr Sanders said Mr McMillon, the chief executive, was “making a thousand times more than the average Walmart employee”. He said the ratio of Mr\u0026nbsp​McMillon’s $23.6m pay package last year compared to that of the median associate was 1,076 to 1.“Walmart is the largest private employer in America and is owned by the Walton family, the wealthiest family in the United States, worth approximately $175bn,” Mr Sanders said.\u0026nbspBernie Sanders demands Walmart ‘give workers a seat on the board’Joe Biden’s lead shrinks to zero against Bernie Sanders in IowaBernie Sanders unveils 2020 election plan to reform public educationBernie Sanders’ views should disqualify him from running for presidentBernie Sanders and AOC propose credit card interest rate caps“And yet, despite the incredible wealth of its owners, Walmart pays many of its employees starvation wages.”Last year, Mr Sanders introduced legislation intended to tax big companies the full amount of welfare claimed by their workers because of the low-wages they received.Titled the Stop Bad Employers by Zeroing Out Subsidies (Stop BEZOS) Act, Mr Sanders took direct aim at companies such as Amazon and its owner Jeff Bezos.

Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.21. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.20. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.422 Avengers: Age of Ultron19. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.18. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.17. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 722 s of the Galaxy Vol 216. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.15. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.14. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1022 Ant-Man and the Wasp13. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2122 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.22. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.21. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.20. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.422 Avengers: Age of Ultron19. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.18. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.17.

It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.’s Peter Bradshaw also gave the film two stars, writing that it “offers glimpses of intrigue before regressing into a dull CGI-fest”.“The most interesting aspect of this film is McAvoy’s Xavier,” Bradshaw’s review says. “He is more opaque, more worldly, more secretive – and drinking more heavily. For the first time, we realise that he is not the idealist that we might have imagined. Raven is increasingly angry at Xavier’s recklessness and egotism, risking his pupils’ lives for his own glory – maybe as a result of being too close to the Washington political establishment.”Variety’s review was slightly more positive, with more praise for James McAvoy’s performance that is “driven by a compelling ambiguity”.\u0026nbsp“His Professor X is vain, controlling, and PR-hungry, not to mention a grand deceiver — all the things Jennifer Lawrence’s Raven accuses him of being,” the reviewer comments. “Yet what he says in his own defence is true as well: He’s desperate to protect the status of the X-Men, to not let them slip into being stigmatized, once more, by the world at large. What happened to Jean as a child was cruel, but maybe it was necessary. McAvoy, with his gleam of cunning, plays to both sides of our sympathies, and so does Turner, who gets us to embrace Jean as a superhero, in part, because she’s a destroyer. The pleasure of Dark Phoenix” is watching her emerge from the wreckage.”Digital Spy’s Ian Sandwell said: “In hindsight, Dark Phoenix\u0027s delay from November 2018 hasn\u0027t helped. With it repositioned as the \u0027culmination\u0027 of the X-Men series, it suffers in comparison to Avengers: Endgame and one key third-act beat is a carbon copy of a Captain Marvel moment.New X-Men film Dark Phoenix has nothing fresh to say – reviewNew trailer unveiled for X-Men: Dark Phoenix”It leaves the movie in a tricky position of being a well-made but overly familiar entry in a crowded superhero field. Combine that with the mixed build-up to Dark Phoenix\u0027s release, and the movie just doesn\u0027t do enough, unfortunately.“The Hollywood Reporter also compared the film unfavourably to the Avengers franchise, writing: ”Compared to the conclusions of other major franchises – the most recent being Avengers: Endgame – this one seems distinctly minor-league.\u0026nbsp“The men who have anchored most of the X-Men outings are just spinning their wheels here, and while Jean\u0027s central dilemma is certainly dramatic enough, and is most closely entwined with the actions of two other women, what should have registered as genuinely powerful instead plays out in a pretty low-key way. In no way does this feel like a fulsome, satisfying destination to a journey that started two decades ago and logged about 30 hours in the telling.“”There\u0027s no memorable soundtrack, no thrilling action sequences, not even a detectable sense of humour,” wrote Mashable’s Angie Han. “Dark Phoenix isn\u0027t especially ugly or upsetting, but it\u0027s no pleasure to sit through, either. It\u0027s just there, robotically going through the motions of recounting a story, without stopping to consider why it\u0027s bothering in the first place.“Created with Sketch.A complete list of every Marvel movie coming out Show all 17Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A decade of the MCU comes to a climax with the first of a two-part finale to everything that\u0027s come so far.

While it has always banned hate content in general, the site has allowed some specific kinds of harmful videos – such as those promoting Nazi ideology or claiming 911 did not happen – to continue being hosted on the site.Those videos, as well as other kinds of supremacist content, will now be officially banned.Today, we\u0027re taking another step in our hate speech policy by specifically prohibiting videos alleging that a group is superior in order to justify discrimination, segregation or exclusion based on qualities like age, gender, race, caste, religion, sexual orientation or veteran status, it wrote in a blog post.That is expected to lead to the removal of thousands of accounts as it goes into place, though that could take some time. We will begin enforcing this updated policy today however, it will take time for our systems to fully ramp up and we’ll be gradually expanding coverage over the next several months, its announcement read.Created with Sketch.Youtube\u0027s top 15 most subscribed channels in 2019 Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The YouTube channel homepage for Indian record label T-Series, which overtook controversial Swedish vlogger PewDiePie in 2019PewDiePie has been the most popular YouTuber since 20135-Minute Crafts, which offers quick and quirky DIY tips to viewers, didn\u0027t even feature in the top 15 YouTube channels in July 2018Brazilian music video producer and director KondZilla began his career after buying a camera with life insurance money left to him after his mother died when he was 18Sony Entertainment Televesion (SET) launched in 1995 and has recently seen huge growth of its Hindi-language YouTube channelCanadian musician Justin Bieber held the number-two spot in 2018 before T-Series took over World Wrestling Entertainment has managed to gain a huge following on YouTube by sharing clips of fights and interviews with its starsThis YouTube channel specialises in 3D animation videos of nursery rhymes, as well as its own original songs.

It will also encourage more authoritative videos to try and discourage people from being tricked by those stories.It has already trialled the system to do this in the US, and said it has found success. It will bring it to more countries by the end of the year, it said, as well as tuning the algorithm so that it is more efficient and can spot more content, it said.YouTube says it will not remove videos filled with anti-gay insultsIt also said it would work harder to stop YouTube users promoting harmful content from receiving ad money. Channels that repeatedly brush up\u0026nbspagainst its hate speech policies will be suspended from the company\u0027s partner programme.The openness of YouTube’s platform has helped creativity and access to information thrive, its blog post concluded.\u0026nbspIt’s our responsibility to protect that, and prevent our platform from being used to incite hatred, harassment, discrimination and violence.We are committed to taking the steps needed to live up to this responsibility today, tomorrow and in the years to come.The change comes on the same day as the company said it would not remove videos in which one of its stars attacked another user over his sexuality, using a series of anti-gay slurs. Strangely, the company now explicitly\u0026nbspbans videos that encourage\u0026nbspdiscrimination or segregation based on sexuality, but made no reference to that high-profile case in its blog post, and did not say that it would change its position.YouTube has been repeatedly criticised for its relatively lax approach towards various kinds of harmful content, including those on the far-right. That criticism became even more prominent in the wake of the Christchurch shooting, when it and other video sites failed to quickly remove videos of the mass murder.As such, the site has been repeatedly accused of not only permitting but also encouraging extremism, by playing host to often violent and niche accounts.But right-wing channels also make up a significant part of YouTube\u0027s channels and their viewers. Earlier this year, Bloomberg reported that far-right videos were one of the site\u0027s most popular categories.The decision also comes amid increasing scrutiny from conservative politicians about whether YouTube has a bias against right-wing creators. As with Twitter and Facebook, the company has been criticised for undermining free speech and being unfair towards its conservative users, despite the fact there is no evidence of those accounts being discriminated against.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But who will be her successor As soon as Theresa May left the podium outside Downing Street, focus turned towards the rest of the Tory party.Jeremy Hunt and Dominic Raab were first out of the blocks to replace May.Sajid Javid and Michael Gove also jostled for position while Boris Johnson broke his silence about his plans.Jacob Rees-Mogg revealed he wont run for the leadership because he wont get enough support to win and Amber Rudd ruled herself out too.Other contenders vying for the job include former Leader of the House of Commons Andrea Leadsom plus Health Secretary Matt Hancock, Housing Minister Kit Malthouse and Brexit Minister James Cleverly .They span the whole of the Brexit spectrum, including Eurosceptic hardliner Esther McVey and Rory Stewart, who is against No Deal.On June , Sam Gyimah became the th candidate to enter the Tory leadership race - promising a second referendum where Brexit could be stopped.May claimed she had done all she could to take Britain out of the EU with a deal, saying: Ever since I first stepped through the door behind me as Prime Minister, I have striven to make the United Kingdom a country that works not just for a privileged few, but for everyone. And to honour the result of the EU referendum.If you give people a choice you have a duty to implement what they decide. I have done my best to do that.Sadly I have not been able to do so. I tried three times - I believe it was right to persevere even when the odds against success seemed high.Her voice cracking, she attempted to defend her legacy and insisted she has helped to fix Britains burning injustices.The PM confessed she now had no chance of ever getting her Brexit deal through Parliament.But she urged MPs to come together and deliver on the referendum, saying: Le depends on compromise.May survived a vote of no confidence in December , but repeated thwarted attempts to pass her Brexit deal have left her without authority. Here are what the bookies are saying on June , .These are the odds on who will be the next PM according to Ladbrokes:Former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson is still a hugely popular figure among Tory grassroots and the general public.Boris quit as Foreign Secretary on July , , in a blow to Mays Government.He walked out just hours after she lost Brexit Secretary David Davis over her Chequers plan to keep close ties to Brussels.He called on May to stop dithering and tell the EU that Britain will not accept the controversial backstop arrangement designed to avoid a hard border in Ireland.He rejected warnings about the impact of a No Deal Brexit, insisting: Whatever the doomsters may say ... there will be no shortage of Mars bars, we will still have potable drinking water in Britain. The planes will fly, the ferries will ply.He has said he would of course stand in the Conservative leadership contest to replace Theresa May.The Environment Secretary has achieved a remarkable turnaround since kning Boris Johnson during the  leadership contest.His support among party members dropped through the floor and it seemed his chances were gone for ever.But Mr Gove, who led the Leave campaign in the EU referendum, has rebranded himself as an ecowarrior as Environment Secretary.He has also thrown his full support behind Theresa Mays Brexit plan, winning him friends among MPsnot the party faithful.He claimed May blundered by not having key Labour figures on her Brexit talks team.The Environment Secretary said the PM made a mistake by not asking Gisela Stuart to join at the beginning.He also said No Deal must be kept on the table.The former Brexit Secretary quit the cabinet in protest over Theresa Mays soft orce deal with the EU.Raab has insisted No Deal wouldnt be chaotic for Britain and said the short-term risks were manageable.He has blasted those who want to extend Article  or a second referendum.He said: If theres an attempt to reverse the referendum, stop Brexit altogether I think that would cut across not only the democratic mandate, the biggest in history we had.Though an unlikely candidate at the time, Brexit campaigner Leadsom reached the final two of the  leadership contest.She withdrew over ill-judged remarks about Theresa May not being a mother.Leadsom resigned as Leader of the House on May , ,  with reports claiming May begged her not to go.Mr Hunt was the longest-serving Health Secretary in British history before replacing Boris as Foreign Secretary.He left the Department of Health after securing a £bn funding increase for the NHS, but was hated by junior doctors after changing their contracts so they wouldnt receive extra pay for the many shts they work - previously classied as unsociable hours.Mr Hunt is known to have leadership aspirations and now says he backs Brexit despite campaigning for Remain during the referendum.Just hours after Mrs May resigned, he put his name into the hat to be in the running to replace her.Prisons Minister Rory Stewart MP put himself forward to replace May as Prime Minister on April , .Mr Stewart told the Spectator: “Dficult periods need dferent types of people.One of the reasons why I would be tempted towards this job is that we desperately need to rebuild ourselves internationally after Brexit. I am one of the only people in Parliament who is a genuine specialist.”Mr Stewart studied at Oxford and tutored Princes William and Harry in his spare time.On June , Trade Secretary Liam Fox threw his support behind Hunt in a surprise move.The Home Secretary ended up backing Remain during the EU referendum but is popular among the Tory parliamentary party.Mr Javid was appointed Home Secretary in the wake of the Windrush scandal and the resignation of Amber Rudd.A known Eurosceptic, some of his statements and his backing for a harder Brexit have been taken as signs he is pitching for the leadership.The MP for Bromsgrove in Worcestershire is a former managing director from Deutsche Bank.On May , Javid announced his bid to run for PM.Another female Brexiteer to watch out for is Penny Mordaunt.On May , , she was promoted to Defence Secretary after Gavin Williamson was sacked, which is fitting as she is a Navy reservist.Previously the former Splash! contestant ran the Department for International Development.The Health Secretary tried to break the ice in a crunch Cabinet meeting in May by turning up with a packet of waffles.Hes already raked in £, in donations from digital tech entrepreneurs, The Sun revealed on May .And hes won admirers for his positive and optimistic brand of conservatism and his track record of getting things done.Cleverly is the MP for Braintree and became Brexit Minister on April , .He became the eleventh Tory to declare for the leadership race on May .He is a Brexiteer and has said he wants to see Brexit delivered.Cleverly backed Mays Brexit deal saying it allows us to take back control of our borders and our laws, stop sending those vast sums of money to the EU, and to make our own trade deals across the world.However on June , he dropped out of the race after admitting it was highly unlikely he would win Tory MPs support.Jeremy Corbyn still has strong odds on becoming the nations next Prime Minister, despite it being inevitable that the next PM will be a Tory.The Labour leader has made calls for a General Election but despite Mays resignation there will not be one - yet.The Labour leader has had to fight constant opposition from his own MPs including a leadership contest after just a year.But the party swung behind him after a much stronger than expected  General Election when Labour picked up  seats and Mrs May lost her majority.Although the fabled youthquake of support from younger voters did not happen,Corbyn finally agreed to consider a second referendum in February  — just weeks before the UKs scheduled departure date.Ms McVey has said that the next PM must believe in Brexit.The Tory leadership candidate has backed a No Deal Brexit.On May  she said that Britain should immediately end Brexit talks and go all out for a No Deal Brexit.Mark Harper, , was the th Tory to declare his candidacy for the partys leadership.After graduating from Oxford in PPE he became a chartered accountant before becoming an MP for the Forest of Dean in .He has served as a junior minister in the Cabinet Office before becoming an Immigration Minister and then the Minister for Disabled People.Harper then held the position of Government Chief Whip between May  and July  under David Cameron.He hasnt served under Theresa Mays administration and has positioned himself as offering fresh thinking for both the party and the approach to Brexit.Harper told the Daily : We’ve seen basically the same faces saying the same things that they’ve been saying for the last three years.A number of them have tried to position themselves as fresh faces but I’m afraid they’ve sat around the cabinet table sharing the responsibility with the Prime Minister.During the EU referendum campaign in  he backed remain.Priti Patel is the MP for Witham in Essex who backed Leave.She has said MPs are flailing around making a complete hash of this simple instruction to exit the EU.Sam Gyimah resigned as Science Minister in November  in protest at the PMs Brexit deal.He was elected to Parliament as Tory MP for East Surrey in .He has been married to Dr Nicky Black since , and they have a son and a daughter.He supported remaining in the European Union in the EU referendum.Mr Gyimah said he would give the people another choice, three years after Britain voted to Leave.Ms Rudd has managed to stay in favour with Mrs May, taking the buck for the Windrush Scandal and stepping down as Home Secretary — before ing to the cabinet within months and becoming Work and Pensions chief.The -year-old Hastings MP has voiced support for the PM and for her botched Brexit deal, but insiders think shes savvy enough to manoeuvre a bid to the top when shes ready.But that move doesnt appear to be yet as shes ruled herself out of the contest.Mercer became a well-known face in politics when he appeared on Channel s Stand Up to Cancer show Hunted with Kay Burley.Hes the MP for Plymouth Moor View and a former Army captain who was stood up for veterans rights.Housing Minister Kit Malthouse declared his bid for PM in an article for The Sun.He claims that Brits dont want any of the Cabinet-level Tory candidates to succeed Mrs May and that they want someone new.Leave campaigner Mr Malthouse is the author of the lauded Malthouse Compromise plan for Brexit to break Parliament’s deadlock.His idea to replace the hated Irish backstop with alternative arrangements over a longer three year period is the only solution yet to have won a Commons majority in six months of Parliamentary warfare.The -year-old Brexiteer revealed he has already won the support of a number of Tory MPs across the spectrum of the Conservative Party.David Davis quit as Brexit Secretary on July , , with a devastating letter warning Mrs May her proposal would leave the UK in a weak negotiating position with Brussels.He has since launched a series of attacks on Mrs Mays strategy, and led a Tory rebellion to ditch the Chequers plan.He called on Cabinet ministers to rise up and kill off the plans.Furious Tories then demanded Mr Davis be installed as interim leader to save true Brexit.Cameron was PM before Theresa May but resigned after the Brexit referendum, which saw Leave come out on top.The Remainer has kept a low profile since stepping down in .Speaking to the BBC on January , , Cameron said: Obviously I regret that we lost that referendum, I deeply regret that - I was leading the campaign to stay in the European Union.He is set to release his memoirs before the Tory Conference ."},{"url":null,"title":"get all our great stories with the suns newsletters","story":"Soyoure after the news that always drives the conversation of the nation, the showbiz scoops that will shock you, all the goings-on in football from the clubs to the players to the fans, look no further. to our newsletters today by clicking here now. Key Features:Sun  -

But the family does not get the support it needs.Thousands of kind-hearted Sun readers have already signed Vickey’s letter to Chancellor Philip Hammond demanding he properly funds services — such as respite and overnight support — for parents with disabled children.We hope more of you will show your backing by signing the letter today, because the Kowal family are not an isolated case.Mums and dads up and down the country feel unable to look after their disabled children adequately because they are so exhausted — and they are frustrated at being let down by a system that is meant to help them.When we surveyed parents, just four per cent said they felt they had the support to safely care for their child.More than half have been treated by a GP for depression, anxiety or stress.Ollies grandad Dave helps out when he can, but the family are far from an isolated case - they need your helpIndependent Provider of Special Education Advice- for specialist legal adviceNewle - a charity that provides help with equipmentGOV.UK - to understand your childs entitlementsNational Autistic Society And a huge  per cent of children have gone without therapies, such as physio and speech and language help, meant to improve their lives.This lack of support starts right from diagnosis — with parents being left alone to come to terms with devastating news.They are then left to care for children with complex needs — often through the night — for months or years without any help or respite.This care is often emotional and stressful, and sometimes physical and back-breaking, too.At my charity, Contact — which works with families of disabled children — we hear all the time from those who have to fight for even the most basic provision.Disabled children and their families are desperately struggling because of a lack of support.We want the Government to reinstate the £m of funding it has cut from early intervention services - such as respite care and vital equipment.It is time for the Government to Give It Back.The number of disabled children in the UK has risen to nearly  million over the past  years - up by a third.But funding and support has been cut.Families with some of the most vulnerable children in the country are struggling to cope.That’s why we’re working with the Disabled Children’s Partnership to help them.Together we can make a real dference and hugely improve the lives of disabled children and their families.We want you to share your stories, email us on giveitback@the-sunPlease sign Ollie’s letter to put pressure on the Government to act now.These families are morally — and legally — entitled to help from local authorities, but it is just not forthcoming.It does not need to be like this. All the families want is a little amount of support to enable them to care safely for their child at home.They want a chance to go shopping, a moment to catch up on sleep or have a bath, or time to spend with their other children.This is not about pity or sympathy for disabled children.The families we work with cherish every day spent with their children, who bring real joy and have so much to offer. Instead, we are calling on the Government to help tackle the problem of the lack of support they are given.I have worked in the field of disability for  years, so I know that services have never been perfect.But cuts to budgets, combined with a  per cent increase in the number of children classed as disabled over the past decade, means we have reached a critical point — one where we need to decide what kind of country we want to be.We are talking about some of the most vulnerable children in society, and also children who have the potential to contribute a lot.This is not a campaign based purely on emotion, compassion or wanting to do the right thing, although those are all important.There is a hard-headed economic case here, too. Without putting funding back into services for disabled children, we can guarantee the taxpayer will be faced with a bigger bill in the long-term.That is because when families break down, children can end up in care or needing expensive crisis intervention from local councils or the NHS.Our families are amazing. When the chips are down, people can be remarkable.But most do not want to be amazing, or superhuman — they want an ordinary le.As Sun readers, you can give families up and down the country a real shot at that.Sign Vickey’s letter using this link, and ask which of our potential leaders will be first to agree to Give It Back.Amanda Batten is chair of the Disabled Children’s Partnership, a coalition of  leading charities, and CEO of Contact.Jane Harris, Director of External Affairs at the National Autistic SocietyWe want as many people as possible to sign the open letter calling on the Government to give back the millions that have been cut from support for disabled children.

Legislation in Australia has also led to thousands more having the jab, she said.She added that although “many parents wrongly believe the rhetoric that vaccines are harmful, unnatural and an infringement of civil liberties”, a no jab, no school rule would give parents freedom of choice, while protecting other youngsters from infection.Health secretary Matt Hancock has said that he is “particularly worried” about fake posts on social media and last month refused to rule out mandatory jabs.But other doctors argue that making the jab mandatory could erode trust in the NHS and turn parents against vaccination.While the infectious condition often clears up in under two weeks, it can sometimes lead to le-threatening complications.Public Health England has confirmed the UK has seen a rise in cases in , with  confirmed cases of measles so far this year, compared to just  for the whole of .Health experts have said it is part of a rise in cases across Europe.The illness is highly contagious and is easily spread from person to person.Viruses can be expelled when an infected person coughs or sneezing.These can then be inhaled by someone who comes into contact with droplets, which may remain in the air or settle on a surface.Spending just  minutes with someone who has measles can lead to the disease spreading.What are the symptoms Approximately  days after the illness is contracted, signs become noticeable.The NHS outlines the initial symptoms of measles…A few days after these flu-like symptoms manest, a rash often begins to appear.Distinctive red-brown blotches spring up on the body, typically beginning at the upper neck and spreading downwards.Severe complications can occur, including miscarriage in pregnant women, brain swelling and the risk of death from pneumonia.Dr David Elliman, of London’s Great Ormond Street Hospital, told the BMJ that the UK should concentrate on making it easier for children to get immunised.This could be by putting on vaccination sessions at family-friendly times and giving the jab to kids in AE.He said: “Only when these components are in place should we consider mandatory vaccination.”The MMR jab is free for adults and kids on the NHS.Its important to have two doses to have full cover against measles, mumps and rubella.

She had that very self-satisfied expression on her face.Then to stop the interviewer, Piers Morgan, asking her dficult questions, she started gabbling idiocies at  words per second. Like a maling Chatty Cathy doll. It was hilarious. Jabber The Hutt.She made no sense whatsoever. She appeared deranged.Thornberry is the best Labour has to offer. She is easily the most persuasive and talented member of Magic Grandpa’s frontbench. Yes, sure, that isn’t saying much. But here she was utterly lost.And you could see, as she wittered on, the end in sight for a great political party. One I was proud to be a member of for  years. A party which was once great, but now makes no sense whatsoever. A party suffused with hypocrisy.Thornberry was trying to explain why Jeremy Corbyn and the party were so hostile to Donald Trump. And she had no answer. How could she, when Corbyn is happy to call terrorists his friends — but has no time for the democratically elected leader of the free world When Corbyn and his cronies offer support for Socialist catastrophes such as Venezuela. Or totalitarian dictatorships such as Cuba, where trade unionists and homosexuals are imprisoned.Under Corbyn Labour has become a party of educationally challenged, far-left, perpetual adolescents, hostile not only to all of Britain’s allies but to Britain itself. It no longer represents the working class it was set up to protect. If it represents anyone at all it is the affluent, virtue-signalling, metropolitan middle class. And even they are drting away from Labour, appalled by its rank anti-Semitism.This genuinely could be the end of Labour. Despite the worst Government in living memory, it still struggles to hold a lead in the polls. In the Euro elections it was beaten out of sight by the Lib Dems and lost ten seats. Unheard of for the official opposition party! It’s only a matter of time before the Greens overtake Labour.Labour dumped the working class because it thought it could rely on the host of tribes in the UK, some of whom consider themselves victims. Gays, transgender people, Muslims, feminists, black and ethnic minorities.But the trouble is, those supposed “victims” do not agree with each other, or wish to be portrayed as victims.Some radical feminists don’t like the transgender activists, some Muslims don’t have much time for the gays or the feminists. So the whole thing has fallen apart. And it has fallen apart because it is based on a fallacy.Some Labour MPs have already deserted the party to join the hilarious Change UK.They would have been better off joining the Lib Dems. Other decent Labour MPs — Kate Hoey, Frank Field, Caroline Flint — soldier on in the hope that Magic Grandpa will one day be gone. They’ve been hoping that for four years, but there’s no sign of it happening. The truth is, the party is lost to them.Many commentators have suggested that Brexit may see the end of the Tory Party.So it might. But more surely, it will see the end of the Labour Party. It is ideologically bankrupt. It has outlived its useful purpose.THE Brexit Party looks set to win today’s important by-election in Peterborough.People are rightly furious that the liberal establishment and the major parties have effectively thwarted the people’s will. They want to teach Labour and the Conservatives a lesson.I voted for Nigel Farage’s party in the Euro elections – but I wouldn’t dream of doing so in Peterborough.They have no policies, other than Brexit. And their candidate is making stuff up on the hoof. Champagne for everyone! This is utterly dishonest.The truth Nigel and Co are not telling voters is that the Brexit Party is deeply hostile to the working class.Farage has talked about privatising the NHS. He has no time for nationalising our energy companies, or decreasing the ide between rich and poor in our country.OK, I’m biased – as you can see from the above photo. Butyou are a Leave voter but care about social equality too, there’s only one candidate to vote for in Peterborough – Patrick O’Flynn of the SDP.CONGRATS to Peter Crouch and Abbey Clancy on the birth of their baby boy.Crouchie joked the kid would be called Divock Samrat, after the Liverpool striker Origi and his favourite curry house.Abbey’s not having it, though.So here’s a thought – what about Roderick  Nobody calls their kids Roderick any more.Actually, nobody ever did, apart from my mum and dad. And I was lucky, it was almost Sebastian.THE Conservative Party is dying on its feet. But there are still plenty of munchkins who fancy being its boss.There were a dozen candidates until Tuesday, when one bloke I’ve never heard of pulled out.Several more people nobody has heard of fancy a go. Boris Johnson is favourite, of course – but the Tories are weird people and rarely,ever, choose the front runner.If they’re sensible they’ll go for someone who is actually conservative – someone like Esther McVey. Or Priti Patelshe chucks her hat in the ring.C’mon Priti, everybody  seems to be having a go.LOUIS Farrakhan is a foul piece of work.A vile Muslim rabble rouser from the United States and deeply anti-semitic. He has described Judaism as a “gutter religion”.He has called Jewish people “bloodsuckers”. And he described Adolf Hitler as being a “great man.”So who would defend a piece of crap like this  Who would say of him: “Mr Farrakhan is not anti-Semitic and does not preach a message of racial hatred and antagonism” Step right up – Sadiq Khan, London’s mayor, and the man who has spent the last couple of years flinging insults at Donald Trump.You know where you are with the Labour Party, don’t you Always available to support Jew-haters or anyone who despises our culture and way of le.Always available to be contemptuous of our friends and allies.DID you see the face of that woman protesting about Donald Trump’s visit She is called Siobhan and screamed “Nazi!” at a bloke who was supporting the US President.It was a face contorted with hatred, full of rage and spite. Just because someone disagreed with her. Everyone who disagrees with her is a Nazi. Only she is right.Siobhan has since apologised, kind of. But it cuts no ice with me. Nor was I surprised she worked in the NHS. It’s always nurses and teachers – the public sector – who are out on these fatuous demos, week in, week out.They’re the only people who have time to go on them.THOROUGHLY enjoyed Sky and HBO’s series Chernobyl.It was a great reminder of the sheer grimness, ineptitude and brutality of the old Soviet Union.As we now know, the reactor at Chernobyl had a flawed design.

But the boss of the company staging the show has sacked her.David Hutchinson, a virtue- signalling idiot who can only tolerate opinions which concur with his own, said he was “disgusted” by Widdecombe’s comments.Well sure, maybe.

Successive governments have taken it to mean rents or purchase costs which are lower than in the open market.But paying rents of, say, % of the market level is still far beyond the means of many who need a home.At a time of national concern about levels of poverty and inequality, our Commission wanted to find out how peoples housing costs are fuelling the situation.We have looked at the scale of the problem and redefined measures of affordability, to take into account the impact it has on peoples lives, looking at what people can pay for housing without risking financial and personal issues.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Can Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party win this core Middle Britain seat Dficult, but it would be a heck of a result and could do to those insects in Westminster what a dose of Sarson’s does to the winged pests that erupt from house walls on hot days.EvenFarage does not pull off a cup upset in Peterborough, Westminster is starting to get jumpy. About time, too! Theresa May quits the Tory leadership tomorrow and the race to succeed her has begun with almost as many runners as the Grand National.Quite a few of them will end up in the glue factory.Prince Charles’s pro-EU pal Rory Stewart, the little-known International Development Secretary, has made a wonderful fool of himself by standing for the job. Stewart has filmed selfie videos presenting himself as man-of-the-masses, in places such as, er, genteel Kew Gardens.Deluded commentators in the Westminster village have praised his social-media “outreach”. It’s the political elite’s echo chamber at work again.On Tuesday evening Stewart stood on a box at Speaker’s Corner in London’s Hyde Park, to “speak to the people”. What a gumby. The only bystanders at Speaker’s Corner these days are tourists, ice-cream vendors and a few winos.If Stewart really wants to meet the people to see what they think of his plan to soften Brexit to the point of non-existence, he should haul himself off to somewhere like Asda in Walsall, in the West Midlands.Brummies would soon let him know exactly what they thought of his proposal to ignore the  referendum’s .million Leave voters.Meanwhile, the Health Secretary, Matt Hancock , polished his credentials to be Tory leader by releasing a video of himself playing office cricket with a few of his civil servants. I had to watch this stunt twice just to make sure it wasn’t a spoof from Armando Iannucci, one of the sharp comic brains behind Alan Partridge.Not that Hancock is the silliest of the bunch. Sam Gyimah, an obscure former junior minister, was last night persisting with his leadership campaign even though he did not have the declared support of a single MP .This was almost pathetic in the proper sense of the word — ie enough to make you feel sad for the bloke. But in the end I’m afraid my heart remained unmoved. Gyimah simply looked a prat.Labour’s comrades are at each other’s throats, the Lib Dems have their own leadership contestand the Change UK brigade, just a few weeks after their creation, are disintegrating like one of strongman Geoff Capes’s deckchairs. More than half of them quit, leaving a rump that will be led by spluttering Anna Soubry, as shouty as a Jack Russell snapping at a postie’s ankles.All this was happening while Hurricane Trump blew into town and gave half-pint London Mayor Sadiq Khan a few home truths. The President also showed Jeremy Corbyn to be two-faced, revealing that Corbyn — who happily joined a rally where Trump was slandered as a fascist — had begged him for a one-to-one meeting. The crawler.Looking at this turmoil, you might think: “That’s it, I’m emigrating to strong, stable Venezuela.” Don’t book your ticket to Caracas just yet.Call me a crazy optimist, but I think the mayhem in our politics is healthy — a sign that it’s finally sinking into Westminster’s blockheads that they need to start reflecting and stop blocking public opinion.Theresa May first. The PM’s departure was so often predicted that it is hard to believe she and husband Philip are finally emptying their smalls drawers at No.But after her tearful announcement two weeks ago in Downing Street, there is no way back for Madam Glumbucket. A nation mourns  Don’t let’s put it that strongly but nor should we gloat.Allow her a decent adieu. She occupied high office with dignity and seriousness and was not tacky, like some recent PMs. There was no Carole Caplin or Lord Levy in her coterie, thank goodness.If that was an example of politicians learning from their predecessors’ mistakes, might the same be happening with the EU crisis  Tory and Labour MPs have been terried by the rise of Farage’s Brexit Party.Peterborough was a swing seat won by Labour in  by now-disgraced Fiona Onasanya, jailed after trying to cheat a motoring offence.Whatever the result, the Peterborough campaign showed that neither of the two main parties can take Middle Britain for granted.That has made northern Labour MPs wary of seeking a second referendum. And it has caused a big change in the Tory leadership election campaign.Front-runner Boris Johnson and his main rivals Michael Gove, Jeremy Hunt, Dominic Raab and Sajid Javid are all being much more ballsy about a No Deal Brexit.The three Remain candidates — Hancock, Stewart and Gyimah — are trailing badly. It is hard to say who will win but , as likely, it is Boris, Gove or Raab, the next PM should be much more in tune with public opinion.Meanwhile, the determinedly anti-Brexit Tory MP Phillip Lee looks doomed after a row with his activists in Bracknell. The people are revolting!With an opinion poll having now suggested that the Brexit Party may have a national lead, MPs on both sides of the Commons are finally clocking the possibility that they could lose their seats.Ouch.

Thats Satans role.Pope Francis pointed out that Italian bishops followed the example of French bishops in the Catholic Church.The French have modied the prayer to do not let me fall into temptation, because it is me who falls, not the Lord who tempts me to then see how I fall, he said.But German bishops have decided to stick with the traditional wording.The Lords Prayer originates in Matthew :-.The key verse in question is , which, in the NIV translation, reads: And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.It is a translation from the Latin Vulgate, which was translated from ancient Greek by Saint Jerome in the late fourth century.Some Christians have vented fury over the signicant change to the centuries-old prayer.One person wrote on Twitter: “You don’t change the Lord’s Prayer, only the Lord can do that.”Albert Mohler, president of The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, said the changes are “deeply problematic”.Mr Mohler told the Seattle Times: “I was shocked and appalled.“This is the Lord’s Prayer. It is not, and has never been, the Pope’s prayer, and we have the very words of Jesus in the New Testament.“It is those very words that the pope proposes to change.

It’s been like that since series one.It’s just that this year’s contestants forced them to be even more credulous, gushing and moronic than usual.Particularly the magicians, who were all doing iations on the same trick, with such little stagecraft, that one of last year’s rejects, Marc Spelmann, was deemed best of the bunch by virtue of putting on his X mask and saying nothing.It didn’t end there, however.Critical faculties also had to be suspended for a procession of try-hard comedians, pub singers, sob stories, village fete dancers and that Haunting thing which had Amanda Holden gasping, panting, yelping “F***” and Simon claiming: “It sounded like being next door to you on honeymoon.”Though probably not the fortnight inside Les Dennis’s static caravan in Rhyl.It wasn’t all bad, naturally.Someone almost held a tune, I’m sure, and there was a bit more tension to Jonathan Goodwin’s “Blindfold chick- en with crossbow”than there was about the Gomonov bird, who kept ducking out of the way almost every time her mate threw a kne.But what BGT really needs in such circumstances are dingbats like Gonzo, the fat Japanese tambourine frenzy, and Guy First, the Israeli bloke who can hand-fart the opening verse and chorus of We Will Rock You.He was born to be on this show, in fact, which makes what Alesha Dixon did during his semi-final appearance even more of a sackable offence.

EU-loving Independent candidate Dick Rodgersapos bike stood feet away, festooned with a big EU flag and flags of all  member states. His sign read: “Common good. Remain in the EU. Please tell me why .% voted to leave.” A woman reading his sign said: “Remain in the EU  You must be bloody joking.” Mr Rodgers told the Mirror: “Lots of people take my leaflets, especially young people and minority ethnic people – not so much older people, but that accords with the national statistics and demographic.  “Iaposm very keen on what I say – the EU is a good idea, making a constructive spirit in Europe.” When his bike toppled over in the wind, an opponent from the Brexit Party gamely helped him right it. The Renew Party was stationed nearby, and one activist, struggling to handout his leaflets, apparently recycled his T-shirt from the Newport West by-election in April. The back read: “New party, new hope, Newport.” Labouraposs low-key red gazebo was hidden under four trees in the quieter Bridge Street, opposite the Town Hall and Mountain Warehouse. One wag quipped the position was apt because the party had a “mountain to climb” to retain the seat. Its stall had signs saying “For the many not the few” and “Your NHS safe with Lisa Forbes”. The candidate faced calls to quit the kne-edge race earlier this week after a new anti-Semitism row. Ms Forbes apologised for “liking” a post that said Theresa May had a “Zionist slave masters agenda” She said she was sorry for “wholeheartedly for not calling out these posts”. Labour activist Liz Bartley insisted the campaign was “going very well”.  She said: “The Brexit Party hasnapost got a manesto or any policies. “This election is about Peterborough, itaposs not about Brexit. “Itaposs about whataposs going on with our schools, our police, our social services, our health service.” Ten yards away was the purple and yellow UKIP gazebo with its banner: “UKIP for the nation.” A passer-by yelled: “Good morning, fascists and racists, how are you ” Candidate John Whitby blamed the Brexit Party for his likely defeat.  Denying he was “bitter”, he admitted: “We got a group here at the last minute which has rather taken the wind out of our sails.” The only sign of the Lib Dems in town by lunchtime was four youngsters in yellow rosettes scuttling along the edge of the square, not attempting to engage would-be voters. Busker Martin Plant, playing Fields of Gold and with about £. in his case, attached a Brexit Party flag to his guitar. Martin, , who ed to his native Leicester from Spain in the aftermath of the  referendum, said: “They are the only ones bringing our country back. “Iaposve never voted, apart from Neil Kinnock when I was . “I didnapost believe in democracy until it went away.”  Fteen candidates are bidding to succeed Onasanya. But bookies believe the battle is a two-horse race. The Brexit Party is   to win, Labour  , Lib Dems   and Tories  . One source said the Conservatives, whose candidate is Paul Bristow, had effectively “given up”. They were nowhere to be seen today. And there was little love for the Tories – or Labour – among voters. Louisa Berry, , a photographer, said: “Iaposm voting for the Brexit Party. “Everyone  seems to be messing things up and the Government needs a shock – this is the way to get the message across.  “I voted Remain in  but the country had its say, the vast majority voted to leave and we need to get on with it. “We canapost keep having votes until they get the answer they want.” Louisa voted Labour “until Jeremy Corbyn ”, adding: “I donapost like him, I think heaposs an idiot. “Heaposs very much along the lines of Trump in the fact heaposs got everything twisted. “I donapost like him as a person, I donapost think he would be good for this country. “He flip-flops on Brexit.” Gordon Richardson turned his back on the Tories and will vote for the Brexit Party.  The retired engineer, , said: “Itaposs the last chance weaposve got to get England back. “The Conservative Party havenapost done anything like what the people asked for. “Mrs May – and this sounds rather harsh – should have been tried for treason.” Looking ahead to the Tory leadership race, he added: “This by-election is a benchmark. “If the Brexit Party can get into Peterborough we will show Boris Johnson this is what the people of England really want.” Ivor Henson, a retired foundry moulder, will also back Nigel Farageaposs party, saying: “Itaposs time for a change. “Iaposve always voted Labour but the Brexit situation has put everything off. “Iaposve lived in this town since I was born – Iaposm  – but itaposs gone to the dogs. “The last Labour MP went to jail! “Labour hasnapost done anything, they just argue among themselves. They havenapost come up with an alternative.” He added: “I feel sorry for Theresa May, she worked bloody hard.” His we Shirley, a retired machinist who was also a lelong Labour voter, will also back the Brexit Party. “I want to leave the EU,” she said. “I hate the size of Jeremy Corbyn. Itaposs Nigel we are all for.” However, Remain-supporter David Richings, , a retired local government clerk, plans to vote either Lib Dem or Labour.  He said: “I voted for Fiona last time just to get rid ofStewart Jackson, a smarmy Brexiteer. “I didnapost vote in , I didnapost think there should be a referendum. “Iaposm dubious of Labour because Iaposm not sureLabour is a party of Remain. “I would describe myself as a Labour voter but they ought to get rid of Jeremy Corbyn and be a Remain party.” When the result is announced early on Friday, the Brexit Party could be sending its first MP to Westminster, piling fresh pressure on Labour and the Tories.

With Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May in Portsmouth for the D-Day commemoration the dubious honour of PMQs was handed to David Lidington and Rebecca Long-Bailey. For reasons best known to Labour Kremlinologists Ms Long-Bailey was the understudy for the usual understudy Emily Thornberry The shadow Business Secretary is viewed by some of Corbyn’s team as the preferred successor should the Labour leader ever decide to step down. So this step up was an opportunity to gauge whether she is a potential leader in waiting or a victim of over promotion.  If there were any nerves, she concealed them well. This was competent performance that made you forget it was her debut. Lidington had some fun in his first response at Ms Thornberry’s “internal exile” after falling foul of the “dear leader” but for the rest of the exchanges it was Ms Long-Bailey who set the pace. Understandably, she played it slightly safe by sticking to her areas of expertise, climate change and industrial policy, but her questions were sharp and detailed. She also showed the confidence to apparently re-write Labour’s policy on the hoof by declaring her party would not be reopening coal mines for energy use.  Scoring points off the unflappable Lidington is not easy. He has the manner of a vicar but one who, like Angela Rayner today, is prepared to wear bovver boots. Yet Long-Bailey made him commit a couple of unforced errors and neatly picked him up when he failed to answer her question on what the Government was doing for the steel workers. In her final question she combined an attack on the Conservatives’ failure on renewable energy with a big sell for her party’s green industrial strategy. There was fluency here that is often lacking when her boss is at the despatch box. Perhaps he should allow the understudies to take on the star role more often.

The father of three, who was adopted when he was six weeks old, has now connected with seven biological siblings. David said: “It’s been really emotional finding them all but the connection between us is incredible already.” David, , was brought up as an only child in Australia but discovered his mum and dad were not his real parents when he was . After years of wondering who was, he decided to do an online search of his birth name Nicholas Hartgen two weeks ago.  That brought up the Linkedin profile of recruitment consultant nephew Craig Hartgen, .That linked David to his Facebook profile where he saw his biological brother Gary’s page.

Or, maybe you think of a majestic king sitting at the Round Table with his knights. Alternatively, perhaps you envision a warrior king fighting the invading Anglo-Saxons. Whatever comes to your mind first, it must be acknowledged that there are many dferent theories about who King Arthur really was. In fact, many scholars believe that he wasnapost even a king at all, but was merely a military commander. Given that he was supposed to have lived during the sixth century, in the early Dark Ages, there are almost no contemporary records that help us to ascertain the truth behind the legend. However, there is an abundance of later evidence that researchers try to use, such as genealogies and king lists, poetry, chronicles, biographies of ious religious figures, local traditions, and records of land grants.    Although this material cannot be completely trusted, due to having been written hundreds of years after the fact, by comparing these ious dferent sources from dferent times and places, it is possible to arrive at some likely conclusions. Letaposs have a look at some key questions regarding the legendary king, and see what the available evidence can tell us. Did Arthur really exist   This question has been debated for hundreds of years. While there are some scholars who believe that Arthur was simply a mythical figure who was transformed into a aposhistoricalapos king in later records, many scholars believe that there was a real inidual behind the legends. Some evidence of this includes the intriguing fact that the name aposArthurapos gained sudden popularity in the time period after King Arthur was supposed to have lived. For example, there is a record of a king of south west Wales named Arthur in the late-sixth or early-seventh century.    Similarly, also in the late-sixth century, there was Artuir the son of Aedan, a Scottish prince. In the records, we also find an Arthur son of Bicoir in the early-seventh century. These are just some of the examples of royal iniduals named Arthur in this time period. The fact that the name aposArthurapos, which was hardlyever used before this period, suddenly starts being used across Britain in the late-sixth and early-seventh centuries could well be evidence that there was a very prominent inidual with that name in the first half of the sixth century, as the legends claim. Where did Arthur live  When it comes to pinpointing the real Arthur, working out where he lived is a vital detail to address. There appears to be a great deal of conflicting evidence concerning this, but the evidence is more consistent that it first appears. For example, Arthur is iously shown to be active in southern Scotland, the north of England, Cornwall, and even Brittany. But this need not be dismissed as conflicting, inaccurate information. The earliest definite record concerning Arthur shows that he was allied with aposthe kings of Britainapos, and many later sources indicate that Arthuraposs allied kings included those from Scotland, Cornwall, Brittany, and other places. It is no surprise that we find evidence of Arthuraposs presence in the territories of his allied kings.    On the other hand, the evidence concerning Arthuraposs base of operations is fairly consistent. Many records state that one of Arthuraposs main courts was Caerleon in south east Wales. And in the earliest Welsh records, he is clearly shown to be ruling a place called aposCelliwigapos in a region called aposKerniwapos. While this is commonly believed to be Callington in Cornwall, there are other locations in Britain - particularly in Wales - which match both those names. Signicantly, there is a location named Celliwig within a previously extant region called Cernyw near Caerleon in Wales, which would harmonise those two pieces of evidence. Another record, known as the Le of St Cadoc, places Arthur in this part of the country as a youthful king, likewise indicating that this was his home region. Who was Arthur  In , historian Thomas Carte made the suggestion that the real figure behind King Arthur was a certain historical king known as Athrwys son of Meurig. Scholarship has come a long way since then, and although that theory gained a great deal of popularity during the following century, it eventually fell into obscurity.  Now, the current consensus is that Athrwys lived in the seventh century, and therefore could not be Arthur, who lived  years earlier. However, there is a good deal of evidence that the historical Athrwys was actually an exact contemporary of the legendary King Arthur. For example, there is a record of a land grant being made by Athrwys in the company of several disciples of a man named Dubricius, who lived from the second half of the fth century to the first half of the sixth. If this record is accurate, then Athrwys must have been a king of the sixth century, not the seventh. Additionally, the aforementioned Le of St Cadoc tells us that the titular Cadoc, who was born in the early-sixth century, was the great-great-grandson of a king named Tewdrig. This same Tewdrig was the grandfather of Athrwys. If Cadoc was born in the early-sixth century, perhaps in the year , and yet he was two generations further down the family line than Athrwys was, Athrwys cannot possibly have lived in the seventh century. He must have lived firmly in the sixth century, just like the legendary Arthur. This is just some of the evidence that Athrwys truly was a contemporary of Arthur. The name aposAthrwysapos appears as the name of a few other iniduals, but it is iously spelt aposAthrwysapos, aposArthwysapos, and aposArthrwysapos. It is likely that these are just oral or scribal errors for aposArthurusapos, one of the Latin forms of the name aposArthurapos.  What did Arthur do  The earliest evidence about Arthur shows that he fought against the invading Anglo-Saxons in Britain. That much is clear. He was said to have fought twelve battles against them at nine dferent locations, with the last being the famous Battle of Badon. This battle is known to be historical, for it is mentioned by the contemporary writer Gildas . He was also said to have fought a civil war against his nephew Mordred, though whether this really took place or not is disputed. Did Arthur go to Europe  In addition to his wars in Britain, there are also legends of him waging war in Europe. According to these legends, he killed the ruler of France and took over that country, seizing it from the Romans. A few years later, he is said to have engaged in an all-out war against the Romans. They allegedly allied themselves with many other European nations, while Arthur had his own allies. This was a huge affair which, after a long and bloody battle, resulted in a victory for Arthuraposs side. But did this really happen  While the records of Europe in this era are not totally complete, scholars are extremely confident that no such conquest really took place in the sixth century. So, is that portion of the legend completely fictional, or perhaps have the lives of two dferent warriors been combined into one  In my recently-released book, I explain how there was an earlier inidual who really did invade Europe from Britain and battle against the Romans, and he did so in a way which strikingly resembles Arthuraposs legendary activities. Each and every episode in the legendary conquest can be pinned down to a specic event in this historical campaign.To find out about the details of this explanation, and to discover who the secondary aposArthurapos figure really was, check out my book here .

Norovirus is a stomach bug that causes vomiting and diarrhoea, with other possible symptoms including nausea, fever, a headache, and aching arms and legs, the NHS says. Also known as the winter vomiting bug, it can be very unpleasant, but it usually goes away in about two days. The symptoms usually start within one to two days of being infected. It can be spread very easily from close contact with someone with norovirus, touching infected surfaces or objects and then touching your mouth, or eating food that has been prepared or handled by someone with the illness. The best way to stop it from spreading is washing your hands frequently with soap and water. Alcohol hand gels do not kill norovirus.   “Things were so bad that I saw staff occasionally spooning out food to people and handling the glasses, as well as asking peoplethey had washed their hands and using tissues to open toilet doors. All the pools were also closed off. “But this clearly wasn’t enough, and I noticed that food was not served hot enough and it was left uncovered for periods of time. “I booked the cruise a few months ago and I was really looking forward to it, but it was completely ruined because I was so unwell and couldn’t enjoy my time on or off the ship.  “This is not something you expect when you go on holiday it was meant to be a memorable break, but now I will remember it for all the wrong reasons.” The Stewarts and Linda have instructed law firm Irwin Mitchell to investigate their claims and allegations of a norovirus outbreak on board the ship just a month after it launched. A spokesman from TUI said: We are very sorry to hear of these customersapos experiences on Explorer . As this is now a legal matter, it would be inappropriate to comment further. Weaposd like to reassure customers that we regularly audit all of our cruise ships in respect of health and safety, including hygiene. The Explorer  under went a major refit and launched in April at a gala ceremony in Malaga headed by X-Factor winners Rak-Su.

Dressed in red jumpsuits, -year-old Harry Read and -year-old John Hutton performed tandem jumps with the British Parachute Regimentaposs freefall display team, the Red Devils, yesterday. Against a pinkish evening sky blanketed in dark clouds, the parachuters left swirling crimson smoke trails as one carried a giant Union Jack. Both veterans landed safely and looked up as the sky was filled with dozens of domed, khaki chutes, now as then. Read was just -years old and Hutton, known to his friends as Jock, was still a teenager when they leapt out of their transport aircraft under cover of dark with the British th Airborne Division in the early hours of June , .    It was a dferent world then. It was a world that requires young men like myself to be prepared to die for a civilisation that was worth living in, Read said. So there was a very heavy necessity for young men like me to put my le on the line. My le wasnapost on the line today,aposapos he added, describing the jump as thoroughly enjoyable. They were among more than , soldiers who were tasked with protecting the Allied left flank from counter-attack as the biggest seaborne invasion in history landed ashore and advanced inland.    Earlier, some  British and French paratroopers re-enacted the D-Day airdrops near the Norman town of Sannerville in honor of the airborne assaults  years ago. Representing the US airborne forces, American veteran Tom Rice parachuted, too, in nearby Carentan, France. It went perfect, perfect jump, the -year-old D-Day veteran said. I feel great. Iaposd go up and do it all again.    The commemorations brought together the greatest number of Douglas C- Dakota aircraft since the Second World War, flying the same route as they did  years ago. The drop zone for the events in Sannerville was one of four used by the ision on D-Day. Just past midnight that night, the thParachute Battalion landed in the very same fields, then codenamed Drop Zone aposKapos.    Their objective: destroy three German-held bridges to cut off nearby reinforcements from responding to the Allied invasion, then set up a defensive barrier in nearby woods. But bad visibility and missed drops meant the battalion was scattered across a wide area and faced a perilous trek to the rendezvous point through ground dominated by a German tank ision. They maintained their defensive front for  days.

The old soldier was one of , courageous young men who stormed the Normandy beaches or parachuted into France,  years ago today, in a bid to crush Adolf Hitler’s forces of evil that gripped Europe. When they set off across the Channel on June  , the Queen was Princess Margaret – who at  was the same age as many of those brave men heading to the unknown. And yesterday she stood at ­Portsmouth Harbour from where most of the seaborne forces set sail to pay tribute to the thousands who ­sacriced their lives and others who pushed on to secure victory.With world leaders including Theresa May , Donald Trump, Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron by her side, the Queen told the dwindling number of veterans: “When I attended the th ­anniversary of D-Day, some thought it might be the last such event. But the wartime ­generation, my ­generation, is resilient, and I am delighted to be with you in Portsmouth today.   “Seventy-five years ago, hundreds of thousands of young soldiers, sailors and airmen left these shores in the cause of freedom. “In a broadcast to the nation at that time, my father, King George VI, said: ‘What is demanded from us all is something more than courage and endurance. We need a revival of spirit, a new unconquerable resolve.’ “That is exactly what those brave men brought to the battle, as the fate of the world depended on their success. Many of them would neverand the heroism, courage and sacrice of those who lost their lives will never be forgotten. “It is with humility and pleasure, on behalf of the entire country, indeed the whole free world, that I say to you all, thank you.” The ceremony honoured the biggest combined land, air and sea invasion in history.

There were around , casualties, of whom just , were able to be confirmed as dead.    More than  veterans, aged between  and , were yesterday seen struggling to contain their emotions as stories of their bravery and of fallen comrades were recounted. The event began at .am as the Queen and Prince Charles took their seats in the royal box. Mr Trump and we Melania sat to their left and Mrs May to their right. Along with French President Macron, German Chancellor Merkel, Canadian PM Justin Trudeau, and Australia’s PM Scott Morrison, they watched a guard of honour formed of military personnel which marched on to the stage.Tory leadership contenders Jeremy Hunt and Sajid Javid were at the ­ceremony as was Jeremy Corbyn .Prince Philip, , did not attend as he has stepped back from public ­engagements after retiring last year. Performers provided a retelling of the Second World War up to D-Day, ­Operation Overlord, and the liberation of Europe. Actress Celia Imrie narrated the event on Southsea Common.  She introduced an extract from Winston Churchill’s inspirational “We Shall Fight on the Beaches” speech. Mr Trump read from a prayer US President Franklin D Roosevelt wrote for his troops on the eve of D-Day that spoke of freeing “a suffering humanity”. Mrs May read the words of Captain Norman Skinner, , of the Royal Army Service Corps, in a letter to his we Gladys, written on June   – three days before he died on Sword beach, with the note still in his pocket. He told her he would rather be with her and their children Janey and Anne. But Norman added defiantly: “I have not yet had any wish at all to back down from the job we have to do.” But it was not all solemn. There was foot-tapping as well as the years were rolled back with boogie-woogie music. Soldiers danced. And there wasn’t a dry eye on the common when Sheridan Smith, with a s-style hairstyle, belted out Vera Lynn’s classic wartime hit We’ll Meet Again. The finale was a flypast of British and US military aircraft, finishing with the Red Arrows. Mr Trump said goodbye to the Queen as his three-day state visit to Britain ended and reportedly told her she was a “great, great woman”.

He recalled how the horror of what was coming dawned on him when he was given live ammo, saying: “I thought, ‘Oh my God – I was not brought up to go kill people’.” But American Eugene Deibler, a Sergeant in the st Airborne Infantry Regiment who parachuted in behind Utah, said: “I don’t regret it. I went from a boy to a man that day.” There were also tributes to the female agents of the Special Operations Executive, French Resistance fighters and D-Day’s technical geniuses. But the voices of lost servicemen and women brought to le again through readings resonated strongest. Most of the  veterans present were those travelling on the Royal British Legion cruise, which will go on to Normandy for official events today. The ceremony ended with a gun salute from HMS St Albans in the Solent, a flypast of  military aircraft, then a finale by the Red Arrows.  Veterans were then treated to lunch and a lucky group of six got to chat with the Queen, Prince Charles, President Trump and First Lady Melania. The Queen met former Royal Marine Jack Smith, , a landing craft coxswain in the first wave during D-Day. When he told the Queen how bad things were, she replied: “You don’t have to tell me – I’m from the same generation!” Jack said later: “It was a thrill meeting the Queen. It means an awful lot to be here, the day respects everybody who took part in D-Day.” Joan Berfield, , from Buckinghamshire, was a Wren coder on a submarine in Aden, in the Middle East, when news of D-Day came through. She said: “It was fantastic. President Trump speaks quietly. He said ‘May I ask how old you are’ and my carer Lorraine said ‘She will be  on Friday’. He said ‘Happy Birthday’ and his we shook hands with me.” As the veterans ed to the MV Boudicca, locals waving flags cheered them. They took to the deck with RBL flags of their own for an incredible send-off from Portsmouth.Prime Minister Theresa May , Defence Secretary Penny Mordaunt and First Sea Lord Sir Philip Jones waved from aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth as ratings lined the decks, waving their caps.At pm, the ship paused off the Isle of Wight at “Piccadilly Circus”, where the D-Day flotilla gathered on June , . And RBL national president Lt Gen James Bashall led a moment of reflection before the ­charity’s band played Sunset.

Hundreds of pupils at the newly named Holmleigh Park High School in Gloucestershire, were reportedly punished with detention just one day into the rebrand. Along with a new name, and new unorm added to the list of changes, there has been a shake up in what the school expects from its pupils.The trust has said that they will be making changes in a bid to pull the school out of special measures after they consulted with the Department for Education, reports Gloucestershire Live .But furious parents branded the staff actions as scandalous. Mother Charlotte Clutterbuck,  from Linden, has a son at the school who took his PE kit on the wrong weekaposs timetable. She said: “My son was given a detention for not taking his PE unorm as he thought it was week B.“But apparently it was week A but this information was not put in their Facebook notice page or website.“My father went to pick him up yesterday and was notied he had a detention and yet I received no text notication about this.    “They are handing detentions out for petty things from trousers having pockets to one student wearing a coat as it was raining yesterday and getting a detention for that. “The rules were supposed to be rolled out in September not June when the school year is near an end. As a result of what happened Ms Clutterbuck said she decided that she was going to keep her son off school for the day. She added: “I kept my child off today from school because of this. It is absolutely disgusting with the attitudes, they should give  hoursapos notice and not hand out detentions like this for petty things. “I am sending my son tomorrow to school but I have stated thathe gets another detention for something petty I have told him to walk out at home time andthey donapost let him leave I will personally go in there and take him out physically. “I am looking to take my son out of the school and into another one.” One Facebook comment on the Holmleigh Park High School page stated that: “...apparently [there] were + excluded and + detentions. “Certainly did look like that. Teachers shouting everywhere.” A father of a pupil at the school has described the situation as ‘scandalous’. John Whalley,  from Tuffley said: “I have a son that goes to the school and he is in year . He heard from a teacher that they are spending £, on rebranding and they get cobby about a £ calculator. “It is scandalous that so many have been sent home and had detentions. They are persecuting the poorer kids. They canapost go out and buy the unorm and calculators. It is no fault of theirs.    “The school is making ill judged decisions and they only sent the letter out a fortnight ago about the changes happening now. “Donapost get me wrong, some kids get into scrapes and bother but this school will not let anything go it seems.” One pupil feels very disheartened that she got her irst detention after starting at the academy. Pupil Francesca Bowkett, , said: “A lot of the pupils are annoyed and angry at the new rules. “Some of it is unnecessary, for exampleyou were to turn around and you did not have to, you would be sent to isolation. This means thatyou went to isolation in the fourth period one day then you would be expected to stay in isolation till the fourth period the next day. “I feel that these new rules are putting all of the children down, even the ones that work hard. “I feel that some of the rules are what is needed, such as those for behaviour and problems with that, but to get a detention for having a  degrees protractor instead of having a  degrees protractor is too much. “Personally I think they need to start calling out the kids out that are naughty and be strict with them. The acting up kids should be put in isolation. “The unorm inspections are not necessary. I do not see how a unorm will improve GCSE results.” Francesca’s mother could not believe quite what had happened at the school.  Donna Bowkett,  from Robinswood said: “To be honest I thought that anything would be better than Beaufort Academy. “They are now running it like a military school. “Francesca’s shoe broke on her way out the door for school and I told her to quickly nip and get her black ankle boots on that would be under her trousers. They did an inspection at the school in the morning and told her that they were not acceptable. “I then got a text later to say that she was going to be in detention. “In the meantime they offered her a pair of size three slip on shoes when she is a size one. Francesca did say that she went over and tripped on the stairs as well, but she was given the choice of that or go home. “The prospectus reads that the changes to school unorm come out in September and of course a lot of the pupils turned up to school today in the old unorm. Communication is not very good.” The school has issued this comment in response to the claims. Chief Executive of the Greenshaw Learning Trust William Smith said: The Greenshaw Learning Trust has high standards and expectations for all of our schools and their students. “Since Holmleigh Park High School joined the Trust on  June , we have introduced a new behaviour policy to ensure that all our students are consistently provided with disruption free lessons. “We have proven experience in transforming schools and believe the key to success is to create a supportive and inclusive learning environment for all students.  “We will continue to support the school on its journey of improvement to give every young person at Holmleigh Park High School the opportunity to fulfil their potential now and in the future.

Painter and decorator Kevin Dooley, , who was deemed fit to work by the Department of Work and Pensions , texted his daughter “I love you” before hanging himself. His daughter, Leanne Dooley, , found him hanging in his bedroom just days before Christmas last year and he died three days later in hospital. She told Wakefield coroneraposs court how she was certain his death was caused by his benefit woes. In a read statement, Leanne said: “I am of the firm belief the issues regarding my fatheraposs fitness to work and the subsequent stopping of his benefits had a very detrimental effect which resulted in worsening anxiety and depression and ultimately caused him to take his own le.” Department for Work and Pensionsassessors had written to Mr Dooley requesting a consultation in July last year and he was then declared fit to work. The decision was taken despite Mr Dooley suffering breathing problems caused by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and doctors telling him he was too sick toto his job.    Mr Dooley lodged an appeal following the decision by assessors at Leeds Centre for Health and Disability Assessments, run on behalf of the DWP, but it was rejected. His employment support allowance was then stopped in November. His mental health suffered as a result and Mr Dooley feared he would be without money and may have to apply for universal credit, the inquest heard. His daughter planned to help him take his case to a tribunal. During the -minute inquest, a court heard Mr Dooley, from Leeds, West Yorks., had suffered from anxiety and depression since  and received the DWP letter in July . Mum-f-two, Leanne, , a pharmacy healthcare assistant, added: “At the time I tried to convince him not to worry. “Following an assessment, he was deemed fit for work and he appealed the decision but it was upheld. “The only option available to him was to take it to a tribunal. My fatheraposs payments stopped in November, he then had to apply for universal credit. He was extremely worried about not having money. “I visited my father on December , he was very quiet and worried. He was worried about his benefits having been stopped. “I had to leave him to go Christmas shopping and to pick my children up. I received a text from him saying love you. I knew straight away there was something wrong.” He was found hanging in an upstairs bedroom by Leanne who performed CPR before calling an ambulance. A decision was taken to turn off his le support machine and Mr Dooley died from a hypoxic brain injury due to asphyxiation secondary to hanging at Leeds General Infirmary on December th last year.    Doctor Caroline Abbott GP said: “He attended the surgery on August , , and was in a state of panic about his DWP medical in four days time. “It would appear Kevinaposs mental health was severely and adversely affected after the DWP told him he was fit to work, this affected his housing benefit.” Area coroner Jonathan Leach recorded a conclusion of suicide. He said: “It is apparent from Miss Dooleyaposs statement that issues regarding his fitness to work and stopping his benefits had a very detrimental effect on him and ultimately caused him to take his own le. “Kevin didnapost leave a note or any indication as to why he would take his own le so we donapost knowthat was the case.” Speaking previously about her dadaposs death, Leanne said he had been informed the £ a week and housing benefit entitlement he received would be cut. She said at the time he had three inhalers and “all kinds of medications” and would black out during coughing fits. “The assessor said he was fit to work because he told them he could walk to the shop sometimes and occasionally minded his grandkids,” she said. “But most days he was so ill he couldn’t get out of bed. No employer would give him a job because he wasn’t physically able to hold one down. “You only have to look at the news to see this is happening to many people. They are being deemed fit to work and killing themselves. It’s an absolute disgrace.” The DWP have been approached for comment.

It said Bits should expect sunny spells and showers, which will be heaviest over central and southwestern parts of the UK - with possible thunder.

Self-employed Julie Frug, , and hairstylist Sarah Kralowski, , from Illinois and Michigan, USA, were both married when they met at a hair salon in . The pair shared a lot in common and Sarah offered support when Julie had just discovered her husbandaposs affair. In , Julie caught her husband cheating again and months later, Sarah found that her own husband was also having an affair.    The pair decided theyaposd be better off with a orce. Julieaposs orce was finalised in January  while Sarah was officially orced in October same year. Julie was trying to find a way to donate her  wedding dress but because it was a -year-old dress, the only option was a company which repurposed the material to bury stillborn babies in. Julie was not content with that being her dressapos lasting memory, so she told Sarah thatshe wished to sell her Vera Wang gown, sheaposd better do so fast.    Sarah couldnapost bear to part with her stunning wedding dress as it was too important to her.One evening, Julie and Sarah were discussing what to do with their wedding dresses and were inspired to create an Instagram page where they post photos of themselves wearing their beloved wedding dresses while sitting at home, in the garden or larking about in public.Julie said: I married my husband in April , while Sarah married hers in May . I was looking for a new hair stylist and the universe put me in Sarahaposs chair as sheaposd had a cancellation that day and we connected very quickly.    My wedding dress was a sample dress which cost about £, and Sarahaposs dress was a Vera Wang dream dress. Julie and Sarah have created positive memories by wearing their wedding dresses around the house in each otheraposs company. They even ventured out the house to a local park recently where they took pictures of themselves laughing on the slide. Wearing their wedding dresses is light-hearted fun, but the pair also hope to convey the message that men and women shouldnapost feel ashamed of being orced, nor should they feel any shame for their marriage not working out.    Too many people let the fear of being orced impact their lives, so thereaposs a veil of shame or a feeling of failure that comes with orce, said Sarah. Creating new memories with the dresses has helped us both mentally as we canapost put them on without giggling. We rarely think about the first time we wore those dresses because now we laugh at the silly things weaposve done in them. We have found a lot of happiness after going through hell by finding humour doing funny things in our old wedding dresses, and hope we inspire others with our posts.

The force was so strong that it ripped her small intestines from her body before anyone had a chance to pull her away. A decade on, now , she still doesn’t have small or large intestines or a gallbladder - and her stomach is an open wound that needs to be dressed daily and constantly leaks.    Salma, who lives in Pittsburgh with her mum and two younger brothers, still chews food at home so she gets the taste of her mum’s home cooking. But she has to discretely wrap her chewed mouthfuls in tissue and throw them away in a plastic bag at her feet. The teenager would give anything to eat properly again.    Salma told Barcroft TV: I am not the kid who goes, ‘Oh my God, ice-cream.’ I love savoury stuff, I like meat, I like seafood. I donapost technically need to eat but yet somehow I get the sensation that Iaposm hungry. Maybe itaposs a brain thing, maybe itaposs a mind thing. I have no idea. It would be awesome to swallow the food again.”  Small for her age, Salma relies on a TPN, total parental nutrition bag, hooked up to her body to get the required nutrients. Itaposs basically a bag full of fluids with all the nutrition you need, such as calcium, sodium, glucose, all the vitamins and everything you need, she explains. I’m hooked up to that for  hours a day. When it first gets hooked up, itaposs about  to  pounds. Iaposm about four foot three, so Iaposm very small. The reason I donapost absorb food is because I donapost have the intestines at all. So thereaposs nowhere for it to goI eat anything.While on holiday with her family in Alexandria, a then five-year-old Salma wanted to play in the baby pool while her pregnant mother kept an eye on her older brother in the adult pool. Her mum Dena Ghaly remembers: She went one time and she came back, she went another one it is very close I can see her it is just the third time she went and she didn’t come back. Salma had sat on the pool’s suction valve and the force was so strong that it ripped her small intestines from her body, before anyone had a chance to pull her away. The youngster told: “I was just swimming all of a sudden, I just sat on it by accident. I know the leguard tried to pull me out and he couldnapost because the suction was so much.  My dad tried to pull me out. And then I know a couple people finally were able to get me out, and when I was taken out, it was so traumatic. Wearing a red swimsuit, at first Dena assumed her daughter’s small intestines were her torn swimming costume.  I found someone carrying her and all her intestines came out from her body, I couldn’t believe that it was intestine I thought at the beginning it was her swimming suit.  Salma added: It was horrible. But the good thing is it was so bad that I basically blacked out after a little while. Given just weeks to live, Salma’s parents travelled with their young family to Pennsylvania, USA for le-saving surgery. Salma was then on a waiting list for a transplant and after a year and a half of waiting - as well as fundraising for the , surgery - she had the operation her family believed would be the start of the rest of her le. Instead the small intestines transplant rejected and after six months it had to be removed along with Salma’s large intestines and gallbladder. Her stomach also had to remain open. She said: My stomach was open so bad, we could literally see my insides. Itaposs healing slowly. But now itaposs not getting healed anymore. It’s filled with tissue, so thankfully you canapost really see insides or anything, but itaposs leaking  seven.  The stomach wound needs to be dressed constantly and limits Salma’s mobility. She home schools, uses a wheelchair to get around and makes regular hospital visits. Dena said: Everything is a cost. Every admission, every visit, every clinic. Her labs is like  every week, her TPN - one dose is like . Because Salma’s family lives in the USA on a visitor’s visa due to her medical condition, she is not eligible for public assistance and no insurance company will cover her. For the same reason Dena, a qualied doctor in her home country, cannot work in the US. Doctors have advised that  Salma were to have a transplant again she would need to have five organs replaced: her small intestines, large intestines, liver, stomach, and pancreas. But there is no guarantee it would be successful and the estimated cost of the five-organ transplant is  million. But that’s not stopping Salma from giving it everything she’s got. The chatty teen has raised , already on her Gofundme page.She now also has , followers on her ’Slay With Salma’ makeup tutorial Facebook page, though she uses this as much for a form of escapism as publicising her condition.Dena said: She still smiles, she’s still [a] fighter, she still challenges with her situation. She’s doing very good things with her condition.To support Salma’s Gofundme, click here."},{"url":null,"title":"artificial drinking stations key saving","story":"NewsArticial drinking stations are key to saving koalas from extinctionEXCLUSIVE: Experts warn koalas could be extinct in New South Wales as early as ShareCommentsByNada Farhoud:,  JUN NewsArticial drinking stations are key to saving koalas from extinction \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailArticial drinking stations are key to saving koalas from extinction.

They can’t compensate by eating more leaves because of the toxins inside.    Research from the University of Sydney says that drinking stations can throw the species a leline. Field work in Gunnedah, NSW, where a quarter of the koala population died in a  heatwave, showed that  water stations were used  times in  months. Dr Valentina Mella, said: “Our results show koalas will regularly use these stations to supplement their needs.” The stations could prove a useful way to support other leaf-eating animals such as possums and gliders.

Pipe Major Trevor Macey-Lillie, of th Regiment Royal Artillery , performed Highland Laddie as crowds gathered on the beach below him and lined the promenade, applauding his performance. The piper began the lament at .am local timeon the remaining Mulberry Harbour in the town called Port Winston, signalling the minute the invasion began and the moment the first British soldier landed on Gold beach in Nazi-occupied France. D-Day was the largest amphibious invasion in military history and a major turning point for the Allies in the Second World War.  In one of her final official engagements as Conservative leader, Theresa May attended an inauguration ceremony for a memorial to commemorate more than , members of the British armed forces who died in Normandy in summer .     The British Normandy Memorial, funded by the Normandy Memorial Trust, is being built on a hillside in Ver-sur-Mer, overlooking Gold Beach, one of the key sites for British troops during the Normandy Landings. A sculpture created by David Williams-Ellis was unveiled marking the beginning of construction for the memorial depicting three British soldiers storming the beaches. Expected to be completed within a year, it will record the names of , members of the British armed forces who died in the D-Day landings and Battle of Normandy. Mrs May and French President Emmanuel Macron laid wreaths at the foundation stone of the monument.        Seven British D-Day veterans were accompanied by four children, including Sir Winston Churchillaposs great-great grandson John Churchill, to lay flowers in front of the sculpture. Addressing the audience, French President Emmanuel Macron said: I am honoured to stand alongside Theresa May today to launch construction work for the British memorial at Ver-sur-Mer. The British people have long dreamt of this memorial. He added: This is where,  years ago, on June , , almost , British soldiers landed in France to free the country from Nazi control.      This is where young men, many of whom had never set foot on French soil, landed at dawn under German fire, risking their lives while fighting their way up the beach, which was littered with obstacles and mines. He added: It is time to remedy the fact that no memorial pays tribute to the United Kingdomaposs contribution to the Battle of Normandy. He said the monument would also be a symbol of the ties binding France and the UK. He said: Nothing will break them. Nothing can ever break ties that have been bound in bloodshed and shared values. The debates taking place today cannot affect the strength of our joint history and our shared future.  President Macron assured Mrs May of his friendship, adding: Leaders may come and go but their achievements remain. The force of our friendship will outlast current events. Speaking at the inauguration service, Mrs Theresa May said: Itaposs incredibly moving to be here today, looking out over the beaches where one of the greatest battles for freedom this world has ever known took place. And it is truly humbling to do so with the men who were there that day. Itaposs an honour for all of us to share this moment with you.  She added: Standing here as the waves wash quietly onto the shore below us, it is almost impossible to grasp the raw courage it must have taken that day to leap from the landing craft and into the surf despite the fury of battle... If one day can be said to have determined the fate of generations to come in France, in Britain, in Europe and the world, that day was June , . Paying tribute to those who made the ultimate sacrice, she said: They laid down their lives so that we might have a better le and build a better world. The ceremony concluded with a piped lament from Trooper Kurtis Rankin of The Royal Dragoon Guards, and Mrs May and Mr Macron then spoke to the veterans. After the memorial inauguration, Mrs May will join veterans and the Prince of Wales at a cathedral service in Bayeux.  The city, close to the northern French coast, was the first major place to be liberated, after the Allied forces invasion. Following the service, veterans will parade from the cathedral to the Commonwealth War Graves cemetery. Dignitaries will be invited to lay memorial wreaths and the last post will be played at the site where more than , war dead are buried. Some  plus veterans are in the town of Arromanches for a series of events. Veterans will descend on the town square as part of a parade with Tobias Ellwood, the minister for Defence People and Veterans, and chief of Ministry of Defence general staff Mark Carleton-Smith will be among crowds before a Red Arrows flypast and a firework display.  In the UK, a service of remembrance and wreath laying takes place at the National Memorial Arboretum in Alrewas, Staffordshire. In Portsmouth - a day after a national service attended by the Queen, Mrs May, US President Donald Trump and other world leaders - a veteranaposs parade will take place before a memorial service at the cityaposs D-Day Stone. And in London, Prince Harry will attend Founderaposs Day at the Royal Hospital Cha where he will see the Cha Pensioners and six veterans from the Normandy Landings. Earlier, serving soldiers paid tribute to the heroic efforts of their Second World War brothers in arms at a ceremony marking the first key battle of D-Day. Shortly after midnight on June , , soldiers landed next to bridges over the river and canal at Benouville.  Capturing the two bridges, codenamed Ham and Jam, was a key part of the D-Day operation, as it hampered movement of enemy troops and enable the Allied forces to press forward from the beaches. Dropping on French soil minutes into D-Day, parachutists and gliders from the Oxford and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry and the Glider Pilot Regiment joined the Royal Engineers, who were towed across the Channel in -men Horsa gliders, pulled by bombers, before gliding to their small landing area with pinpoint accuracy from , feet. The bridges were captured after a battle lasting under  minutes in which two soldiers were killed and  wounded, including Herbert Denham aposDenapos Brotheridge, who led the troops across and was the first British soldier killed in action in the Normandy campaign. When mission commander Major John Howard transmitted the Ham and Jam code to signal their success it marked the first British objective to be achieved on D-Day.  Three-quarters of a century on,  soldiers from their successor units The Rles and the Army Air Corps gathered at the bridge. The Rles held a ceremony at the Pegasus Bridge memorial to mark the moment the gliders landed, with a speech from Major Howardaposs daughter Penny. French politician Christophe Blanchet told the crowd: This bridge was to allow the liberation of France, and with it the rest of Europe. A recording of Major Howardaposs speech from a ceremony at the site  years ago was played before the Band and Bugles of The Rles led their troops across the bridge. Rleman Peter Ramsden, of the Rles nd Battalion, spoke of his pride in following in the footsteps of D-Day heroes.  The -year-old from Durham, and currently stationed in Lisburn, Northern Ireland, said: Itaposs a massive honour to march across Pegasus Bridge. As one of our regimentaposs most prestigious battle honours, it means a lot not only to the regiment but to the lads in the regiment as well. The officers and soldiers joined Arlette Gondree at for a Champagne toast at the cafe she owns next to the bridge, Cafe Gondree, in a tradition held since D-Day. The cafe, where she lived with her family, was the first home in France to be liberated by the British and Ms Gondreeaposs father dug up champagne he had hidden in the garden from the Nazi occupiers, to toast the British troops who freed them. Ms Gondree said: There were  Germans in the village, fortunately they never found daddyaposs hoard.  But when the British soldiers dug out their trenches, my father asked them to dig it up. Thus the reason why the tradition of the Champagne is tied to the Gondree name, to this simple house, and this is what I do tonight to thank them all and to remember what they went through. The great grandson of wartime prime minister Winston Churchill, Randolph Churchill, has paid tribute to those who took part in the D-Day landings. Itaposs remarkable to think that  years ago the heroes that gave us our freedom were coming up these shores, he told ITVaposs Good Morning Britain. With the veterans here today - and itaposs wonderful to see so many - itaposs wonderful we can honour them and their comrades that didnapost come back. They really did give their today so we can have a better tomorrow. On Wednesday, two British D-Day veterans, both in their s, parachuted into Normandy as commemorative events were held on both sides of the Channel. Dressed in red jumpsuits, -year-old Harry Read and -year-old John Hutton performed tandem jumps with the British Parachute Regimentaposs freefall display team, the Red Devils.

Climbers ing from the ,ft mountain say its slopes are littered with human excrement, used oxygen bottles, torn tents, ropes, broken ladders, cans and plastic wrappers. The rubbish, along with the bodies of some of the  people who have died over the years on Everestaposs slopes, are buried under the snow during winter, but become visible when it melts in summer. A clean-up team of  sherpa climbers collected five tonnes of litter in April and May from dferent camps sites above the base camp and another six tonnes from the areas below, said Dandu Raj Ghimire, director general of the Department of Tourism.Unfortunately, some garbage collected in bags at the South Col could not be brought down due to bad weather , Ghimire said in a statement on Wednesday.   Everest was first conquered by New Zealander Sir Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay in  and about , people have since reached the summit. South Col, on the Southeast Ridge route pioneered by Hillary and Tenzing, is located at some , metres , and it is the site of the final camp from where climbers begin their summit attempts. Cleaning campaign coordinator Nim Dorjee Sherpa, head of the village where Mount Everest is located, told Reuters two bodies were collected from the treacherous Khumbu Icefall and two from camp three site at the Western Cwm.    They were exposed from the snow when the sherpas picked up and brought them down, he said. None of the four bodies have been identied and it was not known when they died. Nine mountaineers died on the Nepali side of Everest in May while two perished on the Tibetan side, making it the deadliest climbing season since . Climbers ing from Everest have talked of crowding and delays on the Nepali side just below the summit in the death zone, so-called because at that altitude the lack of oxygen can be fatal.    However climbers and guides have blamed a host of factors for the deaths. Ghimire, of the Department of Tourism, said the deaths were not because of congestion but due to bad weather and short summit windows. Nepal this year issued  permits to Everest, costing , each, an important source of income for the cash-strapped nation.

What a lovely morning.To all who sent cards for my th, including the community council, the Wednesday Club, the Inveraray Highland Games , my warmest thanks. And many thanks to those who helped me up after my fall and in particular Stuart Campbell of Brambles who took me to the surgery, whose very kind people cleaned me up and sent me on my way to my party half an hour later.And a mention to Take the Floor too on Radio Scotland on Saturday night. Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 13","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWe could be wrong, but the confusion over Minard war memorial seems to be nothing a sit-down over a cup of tea couldn#t fix.It#s a pity the community missed out on the centenary fund, but there are general UK funds available for war memorials.

An implementation plan was produced in December  to cover the years -. Who in Argyll and Bute is responsible for this plan  How many of the outcomes have been achieved As someone who has been involved with autism personally and professionally for many years, I find it extremely disappointing there seems to be an inability by those in authority to get organised enough to address the issues and provide services for autistic people and their families.There is no need for further drafts and consultations.Someone in the authority needs to take responsibility for the existing strategy and implementation plan and get on with it.Maureen Mackintosh, Ardrishaig.Sir,Scotland’s small building firms had a strong start to , in contrast to the UK construction small and medium sized enterprisesector, according to the Federation of Master BuildersScotland.The FMB State of Trade Survey for the first quarter of , the only quarterly assessment of the UK-wide SME construction sector, showed SME workloads declined for the first time in six years.In Scotland, however, there was a jump of  per cent compared with the previous quarter. Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll. This includes extra funding for the Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund, more funding for infrastructure and an increase in roads winter maintenance resources across Argyll.As ever, my fellow Conservatives and I will continue to fight non stop to make sure our rural constituency is not sidelined by this unceasingly urban and separatism-obsessed over centralising Scottish Government.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and Islands ward.Sir,I photographed this unusual visitor to Kilduskland Road, Ardrishaig, on April .

The weather was a challenge in itself due to the bitter cold, but the young people rose to the challenge and coped admirably.The climax of the weekend was the presentation of six Gold Chief Scout Awards to group members who have been working hard for four years to gain the highest achievement possible for a Scout. All six Scouts who gained the award have now started their careers in the Explorer section of the group.In late March members of the Scout and Explorer section joined with the Heart of Argyll Wildle Organisation to undertake an Earth Hour Camp.

There will also be opportunities for farming and we must ensure that we make the most of these opportunities to build a forward-looking, progressive and resilient sector that benefits farmers and consumers throughout the UK.We would like to invite all UK MEPs on to farms in their local areas to discuss a range of priority issues and to answer any questions that they might have. We are also inviting them to meet with us in person in Brussels and with our permanent staff in our Brussels office, the British Agriculture Bureau.Andrew McCornickMinette BattersJohn Daviesand Ivor Ferguson "},{"url":null,"title":"rubbish weather but another win for veteran john","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowVeteran sailor John Corson has been at every Scottish Series event since it began in .It is ten years since the -year-oldsailor from East Kilbride won the overall Scottish Series trophy as a mere stripling of  # but as we spoke he was quietly waiting to see whether the  trophy was his once again.Mr Corson was a policeman until he was , and bought a boat a couple of years later.

construction work to restore an elderly womanrsquos home damaged by recent floods.And the group will also take time to hike up Mount Mulanje to reach the highest peak in Malawi.After planning the expedition last summer, the group has need to raise over pound each for the project.Denis Robson, Graham Little, Thea Panter, John Little and Sophie Wilson will team up with five Malawian leaders to host the pilot programme.Through the Rotary Young Leadersprogramme, the Scottish Borders group was able to link up with the Rotary Club of Limbe, to plan the project.Travelling to Zomba, in Malawi, the objective is to develop leadership skills for both the --year olds taking part and the young Borderers involved.Innerleithens Denis Robson, the group leader, has been involved in making connections with the Zomba district for many years.Denis told us: ldquoOur focus is on creating a sustainable model for educating people to become young leaders.ldquoRYLA is a worldwide programme offered by the Rotary to improve the leadership skills of young men and women.ldquoWe are delighted to be taking part in the pilot RYLA Malawi programme and hope to encourage the local rotary clubs to adopt the model in future years and make it sustainable.ldquoWe have an amazing set of Border Exploration Group leaders and graduates who will be able to help share their skills and confidence to the Malawian youths.ldquoAnd I hope they develop a great international understanding that they can have throughout their lives.As part of the development project, the group will work with local skilled people to rebuild a storm damaged home in Liwonde.Malawi often is hit by extreme weather conditions and the recent Cyclone Idai was no exception.Additionally, the programme will include a Climate Mitigation project on the Zomba plateau.Working alongside the Forestry Department the team will prepare a site to plant  trees in October.And educate the community living in the forest to preserve the highly valued resource.It is hoped that these daily activities, together with evening workshops, will develop skills in teamwork, collaboration, problem solving, critical thinking, communication and leadership.A self- assessment questionnaire will be completed before and after the event covering self-confidence, communication skills, practical and leadership ability and general happiness.A presentation to parents s will be given by the young Malawians on the final day explaining what benefit the camp has had for them and how they can apply the experience for the benefit of the community.President-Elect Bernard at the Rotary Club of Limbe:ldquoThe RYLA-Malawi Program will offer an opportunity for Malawian youth to nurture and grow their leadership skills and potential, through boot camp interaction with their Scottish counterparts.Although the team from Scotland will pay their own travel costs, they are still fundraising to meet the expenses of running the RYLA development camp.Sponsorship is needed to cover the cost of all food, accommodation, transport and building materials for the construction projects.For one Malawian youth to attend the camp it costs pound, and the volunteering group hopes to seek sponsors for all .Denis added: ldquoWe are seeking sponsors for the  Malawian youths at pound each.ldquoAnd I would like to thank the Rotary clubs of

By this time all ranks of the Battalion had been briefed on maps with bogus name and map references - but everyone was fully in the lsquopicturersquo as to the plan for the invasion of the continent . The time in A was spent testing weapons and lsquoteeingrsquo up all the last details for the lsquobig dayrsquo.In the early morning of June , the Battalion embussed in TCVs and moved to the final Assembly area at Victoria Barracks, Plymouth. At am we were informed that owing to bad weather the operation had been postponed  hours.On June  we again moved to Victoria Barracks and at  hours started embarking on LSIs , although there was a fairly heavy sea running. The Battalion was on board by .. We sat at anchor until . when we set sail for the big adventure for which most of us had been waiting four years. It was an amazing sight, all around as far as the eye could see, there were ships of all shapes and sizes bobbing up and down on the water with their ensigns flying bravely in the summer breeze. As we passed the flag ship, with our Divisional Commander, Major-General Rennie and Admiral Vian on board, all ranks turned out on deck and saluted while the pipers played our Regimental march ldquoBlue Bonnets orsquoer the Border.The sea journey was one of the worst we had experienced, there was a heavy swell running and most of the Battalion felt very ill. After midnight maps were issued and from these, we saw we were scheduled to lsquotouch downrsquo at Lion-Sur-Mer about three miles west of Ouistreham.About . on June  we could see faintly the coast of Normandy on the horizon, all around us were battleships, cruisers and destroyers firing at the enemy, while overhead there was a continual stream of bombers and fighters. As we drew nearer the shore, we could see LCAs, DUKWs, etc ferrying stores from larger ships to shore.At . we were ordered to lsquostand byrsquo to disembark. Each man carried his normal equipment and personal weapon plus to extra bandoliers of ammunition, two -hour ration packs and an airborne bicycle. We had expected a wet landing but when we touched down, dead on time at ., we stepped off the LCI on to the shore. The Navy had certainly put up a terric show and now it was up to us.It took only a few minutes for the Battalion to disembark and then we moved off to our Assembly area north of Hermanville-Sur-Mer , this move was carried out without incident except for a few heavy shells from the coastal guns at Le Havre.At . the Battalion were ordered to move to St Aubin drsquoArquenay and ordered to lsquodig inrsquo. At . we witnessed what must be one of the most spectacular sights of the war - the landing of the Reserve Brigade of the th Airborne Division. It was certainly heartening for us, as up to then we had the feeling that we were all alone on the continent. Several prisoners were brought in during the night.Early on June  we prepared to attack the village of Gazelle. We moved on bicycles through Periers-Sur-le-Dan preparatory to the attack. At midday patrols reported Gazelle clear of the enemy and led by lsquoCrsquo Companythe Battalion moved through Gazelle to the woods north of Le Mesnil.We stayed until the morning of the th when we were relieved by the S Lancs while the Royal Ulster Rlesattacked Cambes Wood.

A large formation of Allied bombers raided Caen in the early evening.On July  the Battalion again moved forward, this time to the area of Lebissey. There was some enemy mortar and artillery fire, but few casualties were suffered.On July  in conjunction with the RUR and Canadians, the Battalion attacked Caen. The Battalion was ordered to attack from the West with the RUR on our right. The Battalion moved to the Forming Up Pointon the outskirts of Caen. We were continually shelled from the Eastern side of the River Orne. It was a very unpleasant approach march to the FUP as the ground was completely open and overlooked from the high ground on the far side of the river. Led by lsquoCrsquo and lsquoDrsquo Coys the Battalion advanced into Caen and proceeded to winkle out the enemy. This proved a very slow job, the town had been heavily bombed and the roads crated or blocked by rubble, giving ideal cover from snipers and Spandau posts. By early evening all companies had reached their objectives, patrols established on the canal, and contact established with the RUR. The civilians gave everyone a terric welcome and produced wine, fruit and bouquets of flowers.On July  the Battalion continued to lsquomop uprsquo the town.

This was the worst approach march the Battalion had ever experienced. It was a hot summerrsquos day and having to follow the same route as an armoured Div and we were completely overlooked by the enemy.

Coverdale took over command of the Battalion. Casualties in the Battalion in this action were  officers and  other Ranks. To make things more unpleasant we had  hours solid rain. Enemy shelling and mortaring continued but our own guns had moved up and they did some very good counter battery shoots.On July , two enemy Stretcher Bearersapproached lsquoBrsquo Coy position and asked that they and ourselves should bury our dead who were lying in lsquoNo manrsquos landrsquo. A party of SBs under our Padre, Capt Wilson, went out and did this job. As in Cambes Wood some very good patrolling was done, and several prisoners were taken mostly from  Fusilier Battalion and  Panzer Grenadiers.On July , Lt. Col. J.F.M.

Yoursquore meant to be the adults here.\"We parents sent our boys down for an experience and a good time, with great expense might I add, for it to get cut short in shocking and disgusting circumstances.And one online comment accused the chairman of ldquoblaming the kids.It said: ldquoPlease elaborate more on behaviour of some of [the] coaches etc instead of trying to blame the kids. Flamingo Land told me they have never thrown anybody out of the site as a group.ldquoA blocked toilet, while admittedly not great behaviour, would not get  kids thrown out of the resort. You all know the truth. Please be big enough to accept responsibility.ldquoTrying to blame -year-old boys is shameful. To be thrown off a resort is not the result of a few teenagers and you guys are well aware of it.However, there were also comments of support, with one person saying: ldquoI donrsquot think they are putting all on the blame on the kids. Theyrsquove apologised, thatrsquos all they can do.\"My son came home and all he could talk about was what a brilliant time he had, and I thank the coaches for allowing him to have that experience.Ferhan Ashiq, member of Prestonpans Community Council and current sponsor of the  team, said: ldquoPreston Athletic Youth FC are a fantastic team who work really hard every week to be the best they can be.ldquoI am saddened to hear that the adults who had accompanied the children acted irresponsibly and tarnished the good name of the club. They should have been setting an example for the children and not engaging in altercations.Chairman Alan Morgan told the Courier: ldquoThis is a club internal matter and will be managed by the club committee.ldquoThere are ongoing discussions with all parties involved."},{"url":null,"title":"new-name-for-merged-prestonpans-school-is-revealed","story":"The school is a merger of the current Prestonpans Primary and Prestonpans Infant Schools, and the new name was chosen by children, parents and staff.An East Lothian Council spokesperson said: ldquoPreston Tower is a familiar landmark in the town and a historical piece of architecture, with parts dating back to the th century.ldquoRespondents felt the tower and its situation within the town, halfway between the two school buildings, linked lsquothe old with the newrsquo and was a fitting representation of the schoolrsquos development.Suggestions for the new name were collected over a four-week consultation period from February to March.A transition group has been formed to consult with the wider school community on a logo and unorm arrangements.

He goes to bed with his T rex, plays with dinosaurs constantly and knows even the complicated names of lesser-known dinosaurs.However, we have tried very consciously to allow our kids to be who they are and resist the gender stereotyping that defines what a girl should be and what a boy should be.But here was my youngest daughter, at the age of five, clearly articulating the ision between girlsrsquo and boysrsquo toys.Her list was in line with the way toys are still marketed. Often there are two versions of the same thing, one for girls and one for boys.Even some story books are defined in this way, with images and colours which are used to reinforce the gender identity of the object evengender is not specically mentioned.Donrsquot get me wrong, I have no problem that my son loves dinosaurs.But I do have a problem with marketing directed at my children to force them into a narrow definition of what toys they should like based on a patriarchal version of gender.In truth, itrsquos not so much the toys themselves but the emotions and ways of being that are deliberately connected to them.Itrsquos the idea that boysrsquo stuff promotes bravery, toughness, being fierce and adventurous, while girlsrsquo stuff promotes cuteness, romance, beauty and love.It is changing and itrsquos much better than it used to be because there is so much more awareness and debate about this issue. Gender neutral marketing is more common now, mainly as a result of public pressure.But as the conversation with my daughter shows, we still have a way to go.But does it really matter  Is it just a politically correct obsession that is making a mountain from a molehill ldquoBoys will be boys, after all, and ldquogirls are all sugar and spice, and all things nice.It really matters, of course, and I think it matters just as much for my son as my daughters, perhaps even more so.That may be controversial, but I believe that as gender stereotyping is being challenged, it is often more dficult for boys to free themselves from the traditional definition of male identity than it is for a girl.I say this as a father of four girlsand one boy.Perhaps part of the reason for this is the fact that being male is still in many ways the privileged gender, and so there is an understandable focus on removing the restrictive definition of female roles which limit opportunities for women.But the struggle for gender equality has to be a two-way processit is to be ultimately successful.We must also unshackle our boys from the narrow definition of what it is to be male, a definition which still remains powerfully entrenched in our mindsets and the way society works.I personally suffered from this when at school. I was ldquosoft, sensitive, a daydreamer. I was often made to feel I was not a proper boy. There was no space for me to realise that the lsquoladdishrsquo way of being male was not the only way.Irsquom not advocating taking the dinosaurs away from my son and forcing him to play with a unicorn or Barbie doll. Even I loved dinosaurs when I was young. But it does mean allowing him, and yes encouraging him, to explore sides to his nature that society would still label as feminine: nurture, co-operation, make-up, dresses, dancing, looking after dolls and toys, and feeling vulnerable and being allowed to express it.The best way to encourage boys to express this part of who they are is through role modelling by other men, especially in the early years of childhood when a childrsquos brain is forming, and the childrsquos view of how the world works is being created.This includes how to treat others on a personal level.So nurture and care by male family members can be a crucial part of this. But one gender inequality we rarely hear about is the fact that men make up only two per cent of early years childcare workers. And this is an inequality not just for adults, but for our children.It conveys the message to young children that caring and nurture is not a manrsquos job or a male quality. So we grow up believing this is lsquonaturalrsquo.And this idea is so entrenched that there have even been examples of parents complaining that a man is working in a nursery!Looking after children is as much a manrsquos job as it is a womanrsquos. Or it should be, and seen to be. But itrsquos not just about work, or even childcare or parenthood. Itrsquos about ways of being and understanding that there are hundreds of ways to be a man or woman and we all have the right to make our own path.Thatrsquos why itrsquos important from the beginning to show that therersquos no such thing as boysrsquo toys or girlsrsquo toys: there are childrenrsquos toys.Or perhaps more accurately, to show the emotions and qualities traditionally associated with them are not gender specic.As always, children teach us. When we got home, Lewis put his T rex to bed. ldquoHersquos tired, he said, ldquoand hersquos a nice T rex.This was my lesson from my son: a T rex can be nice.He summed up the issue as only a child can."},{"url":null,"title":"looking-back-25-years-since-east-lothians-independence","story":"Twenty-five years ago this week, the Courier proclaimed the news with the headline: ldquoItrsquos independence for East Lothian.This week, East Lothian Council chief executive Angela Leitch said: ldquoThe Local GovernmentAct of  saw the abolishment of the two-tier Region and District Councils to be replaced with  unitary authorities across Scotland.\"I believe this has greatly benefited East Lothian communities, as responsibility for major services including education and social work were decentralised from Edinburgh and instead became the focus of political decisions at a more localised level.\"Over the years, our politicians have ensured ongoing investment in all of our towns and villages, providing facilities for local people, developing our infrastructure and continually working to improve the services we deliver. This has been recognised in a iety of inspection reports that have confirmed that East Lothian Council is a high performing council and has an ethos which recognises the importance of working closely with its residents and communities.\"Our elected members all live within the county, understand local issues and can ably represent the views of communities.\"Previously, some political decisions about our county were approved by people who had no real knowledge of East Lothian.\"Local government reorganisation has improved both local democracy and the ability of local people to hold the council accountable for the decisions it takes.Here, we take a look back at how we reported the news that the county had secured its place as a stand-alone local authority in the upcoming local government reorganisation:East Lothian has won the battle for independence.In a dramatic about face, Scottish Secretary Ian Lang has given in to the majority wishes of the population and decided it can stand on its own two feet.From , the district will once again become master of its own house as an all-purpose local authority.It means East Lothian councillors will be responsible for running a full range of services ndash from education and social work to rubbish collection and recreation.The Local Government Bill which will end the -year lespan of Scotlandrsquos network of region, district and island authorities is currently going through its final stages in Parliament.And earlier this week, Mr Lang ndash supported by local Labour MP John Home Robertson ndash tabled an amendment to give East Lothian the go-it-alone status it wanted.It was the high point in a hard-fought campaign by angry locals which began last year when the Government announced its original intention to lump East Lothian in with Berwickshire.But their success in fighting off that idea was not the end of the battle ndash they still had to persuade Mr Lang and his local government minister Allan Stewart that East Lothian was NOT too small to become an authority in its own right.They had also to force them to give up alternative plans to create an East Lothian-Midlothian-West Lothian authority ndash and more recently a proposal to merge East and Midlothian.As councillors and senior staff celebrated the announcement with champagne, [district] council chairman George Wanless smiled and said: ldquoWe are absolutely delighted with the outcome.He said it was dficult to say what eventually changed the minds of ministers.ldquoBut I have no doubt that the campaign the district council fought had a lot to do with it.He added: ldquoIf I was being charitable, I would say it was a case where the Scottish Office actually listened to the people for a change...It was, however, a ldquogreat decision for the people of East Lothian, who had supported the campaign from the start.ldquoI would like to thank all those who came out on the streets and took part in demonstrations in the early days of the campaign ndash and all those who wrote to Ian Lang in support of the idea that East Lothian should be an all purpose authority.Councillor Wanless totally rejected the previously-held Government view that East Lothian was too small to stand on its own.ldquoWe currently have a population of something like , and growing.ldquoBy the year  we could have at least , and my colleagues and I along with our officials are confident we can handle all the services that the new council will be responsible for.And he insisted: ldquoWe will do so in the same economic and efficient way the electorate have been accustomed to over the years.MP John Home Robertson said the White Paper to reform local government could have been the ldquodeath knell for East Lothian.ldquoBut people all over East Lothian fought back in a massive local campaign and we have won a magnicent victory.He paid tribute to Councillor Wanless and others who took part in the campaign, saying: ldquoWe have shown that public pressure can move even this Government.ldquoHowever, we are not out of the woods yet.ldquoLocal government is all about providing important services to local communities and we must continue to fight to ensure that East Lothian is properly provided with the funds it requires through revenue support grants.The councilrsquos Conservative group leader, the Rev Dr David Whiteford, said: ldquoI am very pleased that the Scottish Office ministers have listened to the electorate.ldquoThe view of the electors all along has been consistent ndash that East Lothian could and should be an all-purpose authority.ldquoI believe East Lothian has the capacity and potential to become an authority on its own and its staff are well capable of serving very well the needs of all the people.He added: ldquoI am very pleased that that message has now been accepted by the Scottish Ministers and that they have departed almost entirely from their original plan.ldquoLarge is not always beautul and I think we can do better on our own.He believed the transition to a stand-alone East Lothian council would be fairly simple.ldquoThe staff structures are already on the ground and all you really need to do is build on that.ldquoI do not anticipate a great deal of dficulty.ldquoIt is a challenge.ldquoIt is something that we should think through.ldquoWe have a new council coming into being and we should try to run it in a new style way.ldquoI hope councillors will concentrate on the needs of East Lothian people and will try and make that their main concern.Said SNP councillor George Thomson: ldquoEast

at nearby sports pitches ended.ldquoIt was all very upsetting, he said.ldquoWe didnrsquot really know what was going on.

My daughter had her walker with her instead of her chair and was already struggling at how far she had had to travel there was no way they could ask her to walk another fair distance to the buses.ldquoIt was after what felt like ages, and I had kicked up a bit of a fuss, they finally let the buses come down to us to collect us.

Trees emit chemicals too, and darken the land, thus absorbing heat. But letrsquos not quibble. The Committee on Climate Changewhich inspired last weekrsquos landmark target, is in no doubt that mass reforestation ndash and wersquore talking billions of trees ndash will be one of the major methods of scrubbing CO from the atmosphere.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeScotland is well placed to deliver on this at least. Those barren hills and glens used to be under a dense covering of foliage. The forests were cleared for agriculture and charcoal in the south, and latterly for sheep and deer in the north. So mass forestation is only restoring the ecological default in Scotland.Nice to know, too, that Scotland, on paper at least, is leading the way on meeting climate change targets, having reduced emissions by a creditable % since . This is better than the UK as a whole, which is itself a world-leader in climate control. Scotlandrsquos abundant renewable energy is going to play a major role in transforming the UK economy.Transport is one of the main areas yet to be decarbonised, and every watt of that green energy is needed to make the switch from petrol and diesel in the next decade. Itrsquos long overdue. The internal combustion engine is th-century technology, horribly complex, unreliable and inefficient. Future generations will be astonished that we allowed our city streets to remain sewers of toxic chemicals.Mind you, the Scottish Government needs to put its foot on the environmental accelerator pedal. It is three years since I wrote a series of articles on electric cars after being allowed to drive some of them around Scotland. There were precious few charging points back then, and therersquos scarcely any more now. Yet, the electrication of transport should be a relatively simple exercise.Every petrol station should be a charging station, every supermarket car park, every school and hospital. Wherever cars congregate, in fact. The good news is that no-one who tries a modern electric car will want to drive anything , because they are faster, cheaper, safer and more reliable.Of course, manufacturing any car uses prodigious amounts of energy too, requires many costly materials and produces toxic waste. Electric cars arenrsquot a solution to climate change, but electrication of transport must be, especially micro-transportation. Every city in Europe seem to be turning to those electric scooters ndash except in the UK where they are illegal. Half of the bicycles sold in Germany now are electric. People are turning naturally to more energy-efficient transport so why not give them a push :Climate clock is ticking and now is time for politicians to fightThe CCC report was rather benign on flying. Yoursquoll be pleased to know that itrsquos not being phased out. This is probably because reducing aviation requires international agreement. However, cuts in air passenger duty seem dficult to justy. The Scottish Government wants APD cut by % to attract more business and tourists to Scotland. But Nicola Sturgeon is going to have to bite the environmental bullet here. The optics are wrong. It looks too much like a middle-class subsidy, even though many working-class people swear by Ryanair.Then therersquos the nuclear conundrum. Scotlandrsquos nuclear power stations account for % of electricity generation ndash a large proportion of our nominally clean energy. But they are old and unreliable and in need of replacement. However, nuclear power stations are regardedas a safety issue following Fukushima. They are also ruinously expensive and damage the environment by producing toxic waste which needs to be stored for thousands of years.The nuclear industry leapt upon last weekrsquos CCC report as a vindication of nuclear as part of the de-carbon equation. Big money is going into painting the atom green. But the prospect of the Scottish Government commissioning a new nuclear plant, given the explosive cost of Hinkley Point C, Englandrsquos first new nuclear power station in decades, seem remote. Renewable energy is much cheaper, joule for joule,it can be brought to grid fast enough. We are in a race against time to seeTorness and Hunterston can be made redundant before they fall apart.There are other issues too. Homes need to be insulated, gas boilers are going to have to go. Wersquore told to keep our home thermostats at  degrees, when most of us donrsquot have them. Itrsquos all expected to cost -% of GDP. But what was remarkable about last weekrsquos much-anticipated report was how doable it all appeared. By comparison with the apocalyptic forecasts of the climate Cassandras, like -year-old school striker Greta Thunberg, the CCC sounded like a walk in the environmental park. Nicola Sturgeon insists that cutting carbon will improve our health and wellbeing and the quality of le. Wersquoll all be happier, cleaner and probably working less in our new habitable planet.I hope shersquos right. There was an air of wishful thinking about last weekrsquos pronouncements. But therersquos nothing wrong with accentuating the positive. The problem with the more alarmist forecasts of Extinction Rebellion, who want net zero by , is that they induce not willingness to change, but a sense of futility and public apathy. If addressing climate change is going to involve banning travel, eating no meat, digging for vegan victory and plunging the economy into a biblical recession, as we close down whole sectors of industry, then people will not buy into it. The Yellow Vest movement was ignited by an environmental tax.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeIt may well be that the climate change targets are still too conservative. According to the UNrsquos International Panel on Climate Change, CO emissions need to be cut faster to prevent the planet warming by more than .C ndash the new tipping point. But the Scottish and UK governments have consistently outperformed their targets since they started making them seriously over a decade ago. They can do so again.Much of climate hygiene is self-evident. The public are morally signed up to it, and while abandoning their petrol and diesel cars may seem a grim prospect now, in practice it is likely to be a liberation. Most cars spend their lives sitting near a pavement losing value through depreciation. With proper public transport and urban alternatives, everyone wins.Vested interests are always a block on progress, but there is now a remarkable consensus, from the CBI to the GMB, BP to the NFU, the BMA to BMW. Addressing climate change need not take us back to a pre-industrial world of squalor, disease and hardship.

These could play a role in removing more carbon from the atmosphere and slowing down climate change. Or they could add to the problem.Jim Densham, Senior Climate Policy Officer with RSPB Scotland, said: ldquoWe need urgent action to protect nature in Scotland.ldquoOur natural world is in crisis with over half of our species vanishing from our skies, lochs, rivers, towns and countryside, and to tackle the climate crisis we must achieve net-zero carbon emissions by . So, protecting the spaces that are beneficial for both species, wildle and store carbon is a clear no brainer.The RSPB said its project began by mapping all of the best places for nature in the UK the priority habitats for our wildle and plant le. It said it then applied carbon data for each habitat, including the top soil layer.It said: ldquoAnalysing the plants and just cm of topsoil on these areas revealed how much carbon is locked up in the land and vegetation. This led to the staggering discovery that these areas of the UK hold carbon equivalent to over two billion tonnes of carbon dioxide and that two thirds of this carbon is in Scotlandrsquos nature-rich areas.Mr Densham said: ldquoThere is a real opportunity to use these maps to protect the things that are important to us all.

The opening pages of Evelyn Waughrsquos The Ordeal of Gilbert Pinfold merely confirmed that view, although in recent years Irsquove had to acknowledge that private education has improved considerably since I last dipped into an inkwell.Yet the most important message to take from Plominrsquos work is not that any school will serve its educational purpose. Rather, it is that responsibility for a childrsquos intellectual capabilities lies with parents, not teachers. Home is where the future lies. For years now, teachers, be they state sector or private, have increasingly been expected to take on the roles of nanny and counsellor, nutritionist, health advisor and social worker, not to mention become expert in conflict resolution. All this as well as their bread and butter task as educator.When a child does not excel, parents demand to know why. The blame for poor results or under-performance is too often laid at the teacherrsquos door, when mum and dad should instead be looking into a mirror. This is not to say that every teacher is above reproach. But it is to suggest that on balance, parents should ask not what school can do for their child but what they can do for their child ndash and have already done, through no virtue or neglect on their part.Money aside, on the question of state v private education, there now seems a simple distinction. Private institutions offer a one-stop shop, in which extracurricular activities are gathered under a single umbrella. In contrast, many pupils at ordinary schools are like popcorn in a microwave, bouncing from one out-of-hours ersion to another, be it football or ballet, violin or swimming lessons, Rainbow Club or Scouts.Thanks to these myriad options, the distinctiveness of fee-paying schools is being whittled away. In addition, children at after-class events are mingling with a far wider group than could be found in private establishments. As a result, the private sector is in more danger of appearing narrow and restrictive than elitist.That, of course, is a separate discussion. For the moment, Plominrsquos results should simply help calm the angst that blights so many parentsrsquo lives. If nothing , they offer a reason to relax a little, and allow nature to run its course."},{"url":null,"title":"Rosemary Goring  Parenting is key when it comes to quality of education","story":"In a talk at Hay-on-Wye book festival, Robert Plomin, professor of behavioural genetics at Kingrsquos College London, explained that the results of  years of studying identical twins ndash outlined in his book Blueprint: How DNA Makes Us Who We Are ndash showed that places like Eton ldquodonrsquot add anything to a pupilrsquos educational achievement.

The opening pages of Evelyn Waughrsquos The Ordeal of Gilbert Pinfold merely confirmed that view, although in recent years Irsquove had to acknowledge that private education has improved considerably since I last dipped into an inkwell.Yet the most important message to take from Plominrsquos work is not that any school will serve its educational purpose. Rather, it is that responsibility for a childrsquos intellectual capabilities lies with parents, not teachers. Home is where the future lies. For years now, teachers, be they state sector or private, have increasingly been expected to take on the roles of nanny and counsellor, nutritionist, health advisor and social worker, not to mention become expert in conflict resolution. All this as well as their bread and butter task as educator.When a child does not excel, parents demand to know why. The blame for poor results or under-performance is too often laid at the teacherrsquos door, when mum and dad should instead be looking into a mirror. This is not to say that every teacher is above reproach. But it is to suggest that on balance, parents should ask not what school can do for their child but what they can do for their child ndash and have already done, through no virtue or neglect on their part.Money aside, on the question of state v private education, there now seems a simple distinction. Private institutions offer a one-stop shop, in which extracurricular activities are gathered under a single umbrella. In contrast, many pupils at ordinary schools are like popcorn in a microwave, bouncing from one out-of-hours ersion to another, be it football or ballet, violin or swimming lessons, Rainbow Club or Scouts.Thanks to these myriad options, the distinctiveness of fee-paying schools is being whittled away. In addition, children at after-class events are mingling with a far wider group than could be found in private establishments. As a result, the private sector is in more danger of appearing narrow and restrictive than elitist.That, of course, is a separate discussion. For the moment, Plominrsquos results should simply help calm the angst that blights so many parentsrsquo lives. If nothing , they offer a reason to relax a little, and allow nature to run its course."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-the-snp-is-not-nationalist-in-its-worldview","story":"The most troubling aspect of politics today is the rise of nationalism in so many parts of the world.

In India, Narendra Modi and his BJP have just been re-elected overwhelmingly, helped by their flirtation with Hindutva, Hindu nationalism, and by his high-risk, contrived military confrontation with Pakistan. And Vladimir Putin has always traded on Russian nationalism to maintain support.Closer to home, we have seen a marked rise in English nationalism as the Brexit debate has progressed. Not all Brexiters are nationalists, but an alarming number certainly are. As Michel Barnier has commented, therersquos a nostalgic longing for the days when the UK was the dominant world power and to be born into a prosperous, white British family was to win the lottery on Day One.

Thatrsquos something that took me a while to get my head around, given the partyrsquos name perhaps it would have been betterit had been called the Scottish Peoplersquos Party or somesuch. The SNP is an internationalist party it recognises that Scotland is a small country on the periphery of Europe, with world-class universities, a skilled workforce and a strong reputation.

They also seek to move to an approach that supports prevention through robust and independent monitoring.However the Greens said he was ldquocajoling rather than compelling the industry to clean up its act.The move followed the Scottish Environment Protection Agencythis week publishing a new regulatory framework for the finfish aquaculture sector.It includes tighter limits on waste produced by fish farms, including faeces, uneaten food, and chemicals to treat lice and other diseases.There is also improved monitoring, and a sht to siting farms away from sensitive areas in future.Mr Ewing said a review of salmon farms by Holyroodrsquos environment committee had concluded the status quo was ldquonot an option and new legislation was required.He said this would take effect in , forcing farms to be more transparent and responsive to sea lice infestations.He said farms would be required to file a weekly sea lice number with the governmentrsquos fish health inspectorate one week in arrears.The trigger thresholds for reporting and intervening on sea lice problems would also be lowered in stages.Currently a farm-wide average of three adult female lice per fish for reporting and eight for intervention, the triggers will be cut to two and eight respectively, then two and four after another year, unless there is compelling evidence to the contrary.Mr Ewing said he was ldquoextremely concerned about the decline in wild Atlantic salmon, and aquaculture was one of  key factors involved.He said sea lice were ldquoubiquitous in the marine environment and have the potential to impact on wild and farmed fish, but improved compliance with voluntary codes and investment in new technology saw lice levels fall last year to their lowest annual average since .Scottish salmon farms directly employ  people and contribute poundm a year to the economy, while supporting a further , jobs and adding another poundm.Tory MSP Sir Edward Mountain, who owns half an poundm fishing beat on the Spey, was sceptical that the ldquovery poor enforcement in the sector would improve.Mr Ewing said the changes involved ldquoan aspect of independent audit and insisted the government took enforcement seriously.The Scottish Greens said the siting of existing salmon farms should be reviewed as well as the location of future farms to assess their impact on the environment.MSP Mark Ruskell said: ldquoPeople are rightly upset and angry after shocking revelations of the appalling conditions in many of our salmon farms and there are real fears that the industryrsquos plans to double annual production will cause needless suffering to millions of fish.Labour MSP Claudia Beamish said: ldquoThe Cabinet Secretary must ensure that any plans for the closed containment of fish will be fully tested against animal welfare standards.ldquoSEPArsquos sht to encouraging applications for larger scale fish farms in deeper waters may simply disperse fish faeces and medicine more widely in the marine environment, pushing it further out of sight and out of mind.ldquoScotlandrsquos coastal communities need a strong aquaculture sector and it is important that the SNP government listen to concerns to get secure its sustainable future for years to come.Julie Hesketh-Laird, Chief Executive of the Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation, said the sector had been leading for some time led on greater transparency and the speedier publication of data.ldquoThe SSPO has been voluntarily publishing lice data since  and since  reporting has been on a farm by farm basis.

But itrsquos very challenging for us to find out much about it because of its remote location and the small numbers that remain.ldquoWe do know that like other bumblebees it has suffered greatly in many areas because of changes in natural landscape and how we use the land.Holidaymakers and locals in northern Scotland are now being urged to look out for one of the UKrsquos rarest bumblebees to help save the species from extinction.The Bumblebee Conservation Trust is asking people to search for the Great Yellow bumblebee to create a picture of where it can still be found.The trust is now asking people to look in  specic grid references ndash each measuring xkm ndash at sites ranging from Tiree, the Uists, Harris and Lewis, across Sutherland and Caithness on the mainland, to Orkney and Shetland between June and September.The trustrsquos Great Big Great Yellow Bumblebee Hunt, which begins on Saturday, features  grid squares where the Great Yellow used to live, but which have not been checked in recent years.Anyone able to visit these sites is asked to record all the bumblebees they find, whether Great Yellows or not.If they think they have found a Great Yellow bumblebee, they are asked to take photographs to help experts confirm identication.The Great Yellow is a large bumblebee entirely covered with golden-yellow hairs ndash apart from a black band across the thorax between the wing bases.Good places to look are areas of flower-rich grassland, particularly those with clover, thistles, vetches and knapweed, which the Great Yellow loves ndash ideally when it is sunny and warm, and not too windy.The  BeeWalk findings revealed relatively common garden bumblebees which normally thrive during spring were hardest hit by the severe winter conditions.Numbers of Early bumblebees ndash noticeable for their slightly red-shaded tails and typically seen in gardens from early April ndash suffered their worst year since , when weeks of almost constant rain impacted on numbers.Othercommon species including the Garden, Buff-tailed, Heath and the White-tailed bumblebee all decreased in numbers.However, conservation work to support some of the rarest bumblebees appears to be working, with rare species found in England and Wales showing improvements thanks to projects to create and conserve habitats.BeeWalkers are encouraged to stroll the same fixed route once a month until October, counting the bumblebees they see and identying them according to species and caste ndash queen, worker, male ndash where possible.Mr Smith added: ldquoPeople often confuse bumblebees with honey bees.ldquoA good way to think of them is that bumblebees are fat, cheery and buzzy, while honey bees are slimmer, they donrsquot have much hair and they can be a bit angrier.ldquoBumblebees get up earlier in the morning ndash they originated in the Himalayas and spread around the world, so they prefer a cooler temperature.ldquoThey also have smelly feet ndash when they drink from a flower they mark it with scent from their feet to tell others not to bother, that theyrsquove already cleaned it out.ldquoAnd the females do all the work. The males tend to hang around the nest, drunk on nectar."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-john-swinneys-talks-pledge-rings-hollow","story":"Given that such \"active dialogue\" will be conducted with pupils and parents in highly deprived communities, many of whom will be struggling with the privations of Universal Credit, will be based on the educational experience and expectations of that demographic, and will be subject to budget constraints, resources and teacher shortage, one comes to the conclusion that what Mr Swinney is actually saying is, that in the present circumstances, they \"should be satisfied\" that theyre getting an education at all.Bearing in mind \"more socially advantaged parents\" Edinburgh University, Cristina Ianelli \"were better placed to ensure their children made the best decisions over what subjects to take\", whose expectations are equally based on experience, the reality of closing \"the attainment gap\" is made plain. What is described as \"flexibility over curriculum choices\"leads to what Mr Swinney cheerfully describes as a \"iety of models\", the outcome of which is surely a reinforcement of,not increasing, the already established attainment gap.May I congratulate Mr Swinney on this exercise in social engineering by the school gates and in the certain knowledge that, in the not too distant future, Scotland too, will be able to describe areas of the country as \"not having a university tradition\", as a justiable excuse for the dearth of social mobility.Maureen McGarry-OHanlon, Balloch.YOU carry a report of an exhibition of Ancient Egyptian artefacts currently touring Scotland . I am surprised that the SNP has not banned this most unwelcome rival for the fascinated devotion of young people who will visit it and, horror of horrors, possibly become so enamoured of Egyptology as to wish to dedicate their careers to it. After all, STEMsubjects are all the rage these days and those bright intellects among the secondary school population whose interests, temperament and professional aspirations could be triggered to pursue a very dferentdiscipline like Egyptology are seemingly to be quashed and indoctrinated into more economically productive fields. And not just Ancient Egypt, but the vast, wider ancient world with its perennial lure of countless specialisms like Roman Britain, Pompeii, Linear B, Flavian epic, Ciceronian rhetoric, Aristotelian philosophy, Assyriology, Semitic philology and Biblical criticism.The present controversy over contraction of subject options is well documented. What hope is there, then, for a potential distinguished Egyptologist, such as those nurtured in th century Scottish schools, when the necessary foundation of linguistic expertise in French, German, Latin and Greekis nowhere on offer  Not a single Scottish university boasts a venerable department of Egyptology such as is found in Liverpool, Birmingham, London, Oxford and Cambridge. Furthermore, such foreign language courses as are offered in schoolsare not just threatened by paucity of patrons but are ludicrous dumb-downs of the rigorous syllabuses required for Highers a generation ago.Mr. Swinney may trumpet his well-rehearsed responses to criticism of his impoverished Curriculum for Excellence and its basic, six-subject provision at National . But the real truth was expertly captured and pointedly portrayed bySteven Camley , who comically illustrated the Education Secretarys \"expanded choice\" to include \"History Rewritten\".So children: be very wary of any stirring urge to explore the wonders of Egyptology. Your political masters have no taste for such waste of intellectual energy. As a field of les work, consider it taboo.Stuart Mitchell, Glasgow G.IN response to Andrew Denholms front-page articleas Vice-Chair of Upstart Scotland, one of the charitable organisations involved in the campaign to bring to the publics attention our opposition to testing five-year-olds, I would like to stress that this campaign was never motivated by antipathy to any political party.The only reason that Upstart became involved was to highlight the inappropriateness of assessing our youngest pupils in this way and how detrimental it could be to the benefits of the pupils wellbeing and engagement with learning that a play-based approach is having for this age group. We are a relatively new organisation who are delighted by the spread of outdoor nurseries and the number of schools who are implementing play. Time and time again, we hear that the children are happy and want to come to school. Headteachers are advising others to \"be brave and go for it\" as they take the plunge and follow the advice of Curriculum for Excellence.Upstart Scotland was cheered when our Parliament voted against this assessment after a very knowledgeable debate from some of the participants but sadly disappointed that Mr Swinney chose to ignore this vote. Glasgow City Council has now voted to support its headteachersthey choose not to participate. Upstart Scotland is awaiting the results of Mr Swinneys independent evidence-led review of the tests for P which were due at the end of May. Why have they not been published We would rather be campaigning for a protected kindergarten stage for our younger pupils. I am asking our Government to let us do this.If anyone is interested in discussing the testing debate further from an informed viewpoint, Upstart is happy that they have been chosen as the pilot for a non-confrontational  where the discussion can continue with evidence being offered from both sides until the th June . Please sign on at Spraph.Kate Johnston, Edinburgh.ANYONE contemplating coming to Scotland, upon reading The Herald todaywould be having serious reservations. There were a number of headlines which are bad news not only for the SNP Government politically, but also for the people who live here and are reliant upon its public services. Let us consider health , justice , and education .All of this adverse publicity, which was measured and to the point, does little for the image of Scotland as a place to live in.

Private James Jim Glennie landed at Sword Beach on D-Day with the st Highland Division of the Gordon Highlanders. Prior to setting sail on the MV Boudicca to Bayeux with Poppyscotland today, he posed for a stunning portrait to highlight his own personal story of that fafetful day,  years ago.Jim, who still volunteers as a greeter at the Gordon Highlanders Museum in Aberdeen, has the following poignant words printed on the wall in the building: “Every soldier had a spade that was part your pack. They say your rle is your best friend but I replied that my shovel is my best friend.” As for his time as a POW, Jim said: “The overriding thing I remember from being a prisoner of war was the lack of food. “We had to steal potato skins from the guards’ bin. It amazes me now when I am out for dinner with my family and they order potato skins!”This young man was shot, wounded and captured not long after D-Day and spent the rest of the war in POW camp Stalag b.

Prior to setting sail on the MV Boudicca to Bayeux with Poppyscotland today, he posed for a stunning portrait to highlight his own personal story of that fafetful day,  years ago.Charles said: “We were the first Allied vessels to arrive, before the D-Day landings. We got some cover from the American warships firing over our heads towards the German placements. The noise was deafening. “After it started, the shelling went on day and night and we never got any sleep. That said, I suppose it didn’t help that I didn’t have a real bed and had to sleep on a seat! “I later heard that  men were killed on Omaha Beach that morning, so I do feel lucky that I was one of the ones that came home. Charles remembers the shelling going on day and night and not getting any sleep. He later heard that  men were killed on Omaha Beach that morning. He said: I do feel lucky that I was one of the ones that came home.“During the operation, a minesweeper the same as ours was hit and sank in five minutes.” After the war, Charles ed to a quieter le as a fisherman.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Ready for the fight...a D-Day landing craft reaches the beaches in Normandy on June , .\"  D-Day: a timeline of the fight for liberationviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"John McOwan served in the Royal Electrical and Mechanical engineers attached to the th Army on D-Day.

For those who survived the onslaught at Normandy, it’s a day that has lived long in their memories.And in this, the th anniversary year of the landings, some  of the survivors – most now in their s – are making a poignant pilgrimage to the beaches on which they served.Poppyscotland, Legion Scotland and the Royal British Legion have chartered the cruise ship MV Boudicca to take them to Bayeux in style – exactly  years to the day since the infamous landings.After setting sail from Dover on Sunday, the veterans took centre stage at national commemorative events in Portsmouth on Wednesday before retracing their famous journey across the Channel today .Fresh-faced...Denis Gregson and his fellow crewmen spent more than three months at Gold Beach, helping to build its mulberry harbour.Among those on board are six Scottish veterans who, prior to their departure, posed for stunning portraits to highlight their remarkable stories – taken on a Graflex Super D large format film camera made in the USA in the s.Dr Claire Armstrong, chief executive of Legion Scotland, said: “The remarkable stories of these six Scottish veterans provide us with an important reminder of both the bravery and tragedy which surrounds that day. “It will be an honour and a privilege to host these incredible gentlemen and to recognise the immense contribution of an entire generation.”Prior to their departure, we met one of the veterans, Denis Gregson, at his home in Airdrie.\" title\"In , Denis was honoured with Frances highest medal of distinction, the Legion dHonneur, in recognition of his service on

But once he and his crew helped to create a mulberry harbour – to facilitate the rapid offloading of cargo onto Gold Beach – they ed home.He was later posted to Kiel, a submarine base in Germany which was guarded until the war ended.He then escorted a German destroyer to Rosyth and by Christmas , Denis was back home in Leeds.Demobbed in August , he married Doreen in July  and became a cooper, moving to Airdrie where he has lived for more than half a century.Denis was honoured with France’s highest medal of distinction, the Legion d’Honneur, in  in recognition of his service on D-Day.

According to these three parties, the new power supply system — known as #cold ironing# — will reduce the overnight carbon footprint from the vessel’s diesel generators and engines. It is believed that this will lower the ferry#s fuel consumption by at least  tonnes a year and resulting in a signicant reduction in carbon dioxide. It is also hoped that this will make a contribution towards further reducing nitrogen oxides, sulphur oxides and noise.According to the organisations behind these plans, it will be £, cheaper to service MV Hamnavoe each year, as a result of the project. £, of funding was secured for the scheme from the European Regional Development Fund in August last year, with additional funding coming from OIC#s Miscellaneous Piers and Harbours fund and HITRANS.The scheme is expected to fully pay for itself in three years’ time through efficiencies and cost savings.Organisations behind the project say that other benefits will include the installation of an electric bus charger at the ferry terminal to open up opportunities for an electric vehicle to be used on the Stromness to Kirkwall route. There are also plans for the installation of electric vehicle charging points, as well as  electric bicycles for use by members of the public.For the full story, pick up a copy of The Orcadian, this Thursday.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Anyone can get involved with this citizen science initiative to save a species. Because this iconic insect’s last havens are in some of the country’s most far-flung corners, we don’t have enough volunteers to find and record its whereabouts. “So we’re asking people holidaying in the north-west Highlands and islands this year, as well as those living in these beautul places, to help.”The great yellow is a large bumblebee. It is entirely covered with golden-yellow hairs, apart from a black band across the thorax between the wings.The charity is asking people to record what they see and to take photographsthey think they have found a great yellow. This will help experts confirm identication.Good places to search for specimens are areas of flower-rich grassland, particularly those with clover, thistles, vetches and knapweed – ideally when the weather is sunny, warm and not too windy.The great yellow bumblebee is a late emerging bumblebee. Queens are usually seen from mid-June, when they will feed on nectar and begin to search for a suitable nest site.They will use old mouse nests, rabbit burrows and other holes under grass tussocks as nest sites. The Great Big Great Yellow Bumblebee Hunt begins this Saturday and features  grid squares where the species has been known to live, but which have not been checked in recent years. Anyone who wants to take part in the project should visit the Bumblebee Conservation Trust website for instructions – www.bumblebeeconservation.org – and a map of the search areas.The UK’s bumblebee populations have crashed during the past century, with two species having gone extinct. Loss of habitat – including at least  per cent of wild flower meadows – is the biggest threat to the survival of these important pollinators. Climate change, disease and pesticides may also be major threats.

Having been extracted in the lab, the DNA has been sequenced and compared against known species, creating a near-definitive list of everything that lives in the loch for the first time.The results of the study were supposed to be published in January, but cataloguing the extensive range of micro-organisms and bacteria has taken longer than expected.The team has found around  dferent species of fish and up to , species of bacteria, some of which will have been deposited in Loch Ness by animals using connecting rivers.Prof Gemmell said he hoped to announce the full findings of the study at a press conference in Scotland next month.“Is there anything deeply mysterious  Hmm. It depends what you believe,” he said. “Is there anything startling  There are a few things that are a bit surprising.“What we’ll have achieved is what we set out to do, which is document the bioersity of Loch Ness in June  in some level of detail.“We’ve tested each one of the main monster hypotheses and three of them we can probably say aren’t right and one of them might be.”Although Prof Gemmell would not confirm which hypothesis might be right, the two main theories about the monster is it is a long-necked plesiosaur that somehow survived the period when dinosaurs became extinct, or it is a sturgeon or giant catfish.Prof Gemmell admitted that part of the reason for the delay in publishing the results was due to a series of failed attempts to film a television documentary.Negotiations with a series of production companies ended without a deal.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"workload demands force scots teachers to work six days a week","story":"More than half of full-time teachers are working at least an extra day more each week than their contracted hours, because of the extent of their workload.A survey by the Educational Institute of Scotland found that . per cent of teachers reported working an extra eight hours or more every week, which was having a negative impact on their families and their health.The figures were released by the teaching union ahead of its annual general meeting in Perth today with the stress of workload expected to feature heavily in debates.EIS general secretary Larry Flanagan said: “Teachers across Scotland have serious concerns about the excessive workload demands that are being placed upon them.“These concerns are common across all levels of school, at all grades of post and in all parts of the country. Teachers are working many additional hours over and above their contractual commitments, with serious impact on their family le and on their mental and physical wellbeing.”More than , teachers took part in the survey, which also found that . per cent of part-time teachers work at least five extra hours a week. Another  per cent of teachers said there was not enough time built into current working hours to take acount of the work required for assessments - with  per cent reporting no time at all factored in for this work.Mr Flanagan said the EIS welcomed commitments to reduce workload written into the new agreement with the government on teachers’ pay - which recently saw them win a  per cent pay increase, staggered over three years. But he said the results of the recent survey served “as a stark warning of the need to lighten the excessive workload burden”.Liberal Democrat education spokesman Tavish Scott said it was “no surprise” so many teachers were working extra hours. He said: “Teachers routinely go well over and above what is required, but that doesn’t make this situation right and it shouldn’t simply be accepted.”The conference will seeteachers discuss demands to reduce classroom time to as low as . hours a week which would allow staff to spend more time marking and preparing for lessons within the working day, reducing the amount of time they spend doing this at home in the evenings and at weekends. Another motion also proposes that the EIS should campaign to reduce class sizes to a maximum of .The Scottish Government has said that the recent agreement with the EIS would see it “work collaboratively to tackle critical issues facing the profession including workload and teacher empowerment” and that a “range of actions” would “reduce teacher workload”.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"west lothian cat owner catches incredible moment tiny mouse fends off cat named tom","story":"A photographer captured a real-le Tom and Jerry battle as a tiny rodent survives an epic encounter against its feline tormentor - called Tom.The extraordinary pictures, taken by Gordon McBrearty, , show his pet tabby Tom toying with the tiny mouse in his garden.The pair faced a y  minute standoff as the intrepid mouse squared up to the tabby in an unbelievable face-off.The curious cat seemed to forget the pair are supposed to be sworn enemies as she sat back and watched the mouse stand on its hind legs to clean its whiskers.At one point the mouse even appears to jump up and down in a bid to scare the cat away.During the set-to Tom, a two-year-old female, picked up the feisty rodent in its jaws before dropping it - as the relieved creature escaped and ran off.Gordon, from Uphall, West Lothian, watched the brave standoff from his kitchen window and couldnt believe it when the mouse survived the encounter.He said: \"It was in the morning I was in the kitchen and looked out and could see the mouse was still alive.\"I photographed it over a period of ten to  minutes.\"The mouse escaped into a woodpile then my we saw the mouse again, hiding under a plant pot.\"We heard a magpie making a hell of a racket, it mustve been wanting a piece of the action.\"\"Tom would walk over to me almost showing off and as the mouse tried to run away, she would run over and jump on it.\"Every now and again the wee mouse would sit up on its hind legs and clean its whiskers.\"Its the type of thing a lot of people see but rarely photograph.\"With the light it worked incredibly well.\"For all the latest Scottish news, sport and features click here, or head to our Facebook, Twitter and Instagram pages.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with  women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday. issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

Fishermen will always need a market for their landings and remote farmers and crofters know Europe tries to look after them even though nationally agribusiness seeks to pocket too much subsidy. Overall a victory for hope not hate. Lest we forget what international solidarity and cooperation sounds like:Love it.

Schiller was surely making a typically Enlightenment-era appeal for people everywhere to enjoy brotherhood or solidarity, irrespective of the irrational isions imposed on us, saying that joy in this reunites us. He knew it was chance that saw us on one side or another of any nationalist driven war, and wanted to emphasise the need for healing and togetherness.It’s a concept of course that also is captured by Robert Burns ten years after Schiller in: For a’ that and a’ that, or Trotz alledem und alledem, as it also became in . The final lines guaranteed translation into many other language too:Shall brithers be for a# thatSchiller would also have recognised the romantic sensibilities which informed Shetland’s Up-Helly Aa, or unserer feuer-trunken Faschingsdeinstag, ob du wilst. I think these lines from the closing verse of The Galley Song capture Schiller’s intention perfectly:O’er stre the curtain drawHappy to see Europe inspiring Shetland still!#Schiller was surely making a typically Enlightenment-era appeal for people everywhere to enjoy brotherhood or solidarity, irrespective of the irrational isions imposed on us#Unless of course they#re English eh Peter. You want to separate scotland from the rest of the UK yet come out with the PC BS above. just who are you trying to kid I wondered when the anti- English racist rhetoric would raise its ugly head on here.

Napoleonic Wars were certainly consequential in the rationale behind the companies formation. Particularly the Peninsular war.It wasn’t of course ever a one way street. Garve, a contemporary of Schiller and Goethe, did a great to broadcast the gains of the Scottish Enlightenment by translating and accrediting the works of Smith, Hume, Ferguson, Hutcheson, Reid and others, to the extent that Goethe himself, though perhaps before his heyday, said there was nowhere in Europe that could hold a candle to what was happening in Scotland. It would be unreasonable to suggest Burns did not become familiar with the thoughts of Kant, Rousseau, Locke, and other European philosophers, directly or indirectly, in the salons of Edinburgh. It would similarly be a nonsense to suggest that Haldane had no exposure to all this. His inspiration cannot be orced from the earlier flourishing of inspirational ideas of brotherhood and equal worth that happily live on yet. Shetland, after the Napoleonic era, seems to have been quite a radical place to a degree, as the later broken-promise legal challenges possibly demonstrate. There was also a legal challenge related to a whale grounding in Sandwick which seemed fairly radical in intent. The underpinning ideas don’t appear to respect the random lines drawn on maps that seem to dominate some people’s thinking.Some lines are more equal than others eh Peter The modern Labour movement of course grew out of the earlier Liberals, with many older ideas and values broadly held in common. Opening the debate, crossbencher, Lord Lisvane saw a problem where Scotland and Northern Ireland, as two of four parts of the United Kingdom, backed Remain, yet could be dragged out of Europe against their will. He identied #a sort of imperial condescension from the centre—from Westminster and Whitehall# and sought #a devolution settlement properly owned by its participants# that would #include something perhaps missing from the present arrangements: the R word—respect.#Most Scots voted to continue their solidarity with Europe, whilst a signicantminority of English and Welsh voters would apparently risk sacricing their older union with Scotland in order to Leave. Schilleradvocated seeking broadminded and warmhearted company. Should the UK falter, will it be those who sought to continue to enjoy the benefits of the wider degree of solidarity who are really to blame I am so sorry, Peter Hamilton, Schiller died two hundred years ago. Have you someone a little more contemporary to bore us with  Tony Benn had some creative thoughts about Europe, as did Jack Jones. They were real socialists and Democrats, not pretentious windbags. Now carry on spouting, Liebe Rosa, will be most impressed. # made me realise how cushioned from the worst excesses of Tory Lib-Dem austerity we are in Scotland: free prescriptions, no bedroom tax and – of vital important to many state benefit recipients – universal credit payment choices, to name but three.

Students have learnt about the aquacultures along the tidal zones of Skye and food practices that can support them.During the summer, three graduates of the course have been awarded a Climavore apprenticeship in restaurants across Skye and Raasay # Edinbane Lodge, Raasay House, and Scorrybreac Restaurant. Working in close collaboration with the chefs and kitchen teams, the apprentices will develop, prepare and serve Climavore dishes to support and develop alternative aquacultures that promote cleaner usage of the tidal zone.The programme will be launched with a celebratory meal on Saturday st June at the oyster table in Portree. Prepared in partnership with the pupils, diners will be treated to a lunch of scallop ceviche, oysters, seaweed soup and carrageen panna cotta, washed down with a Harris Gin and sea buckthorn cocktail.Events on Sunday nd June will include a walk to a rare native Skye oyster habitat, which will be followed by a screening of the recently-released film #Artishal# at the Aros Centre in Portree. Produced by Patagonia, #Artishal# is a film about people, rivers, and the fight for the future of wild fish and the environment that supports them. The film screening will be followed by a discussion led by environmentalist Corin Smith.Alon Schwabe of Cooking Sections explained why he believed this project was so vital. He said: #All across the Scottish isles, the United Kingdom and across the planet we are witnessing a tremendous loss of bioersity and extensive pollution of our air, land, and waterways. In the UK and all around the world, the environments we leave to future generations are in a fragile state.#Climavore questions how we eat as humans changes climate and develops programmes to provide tools to young residents of Skye to transform food practices, ecologies and environments to become better places for humans, plants and animals living along the tidal zone.#Atlas Arts producer Shona Cameron added: #Working with the students and teachers at Portree High School over the last year has been an exciting development for this project. The students have shown real enthusiasm to learn about the local ingredients and engage in conversations that question sustainability.#It has been brilliant to see restaurants across the islands continue to show enthusiasm towards the aims of Climavore and demonstrate a willingness to take on apprentices, working with them to bring Climavore dishes to their menus. It is our vision to expand the apprenticeships to more students and restaurants across the whole academic year, starting in September .#If you would like to attend these events or wish further information, you can visit atlasarts.org.uk, email shona@atlasarts.org.uk or phone  ."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/KEEP-TO-THE-LEFT-1-Copy.jpg","title":"tech giants urged to join keep left road","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineTech giants are being urged to provide an additional safety feature to stop foreign motorists from driving on the wrong side of the road.Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch MSP Kate Forbes has written to leading satellite navigation firms such as Apple and Google Maps to highlight the concern.Because some sat navs and smartphones give users a reminder of the speed limit, she hopes that a similar notice can be given so that tourists stay on the left-hand side.Ms. Forbes is supporting the #Keep Left# campaign, which was launched after Skye woman Sharon Anslow was injured in a collision with a tourist#s car last year.Ms Forbes said: #Nobody intentionally drives on the wrong side of the road, but clearly we#ve got to do more to remind visitors to drive on the left.#Having contacted all the car hire companies to raise awareness of this issue, I#ve started looking at other points of contact with tourists.#I#m sure that many will be using a navigation device, whether a GPS, SatNav, Google or Apple maps.#Already, these devices usually remind drivers not to touch it whilst driving and to keep to the speed limit.#I have contacted the tech companies to askthey could develop them further to remind drivers to drive on the left.#This could be done either verbally whilst driving or a warning sign before the start of a journey.

In  its final report included “proposed actions” for Ministers to adopt or pursue in order to lessen theeffects of households having to spend more than  per cent of their incomes onheat and light.Housing minister Kevin Stewart told the Free Press thetask force’s report and recommendations have “helped inform the development ofthe Fuel Poverty Bill and draft strategy”, alongside other signicantstakeholder engagement, including the first ever Islands Communities ImpactAssessment.He added: “Scotland is one of the few countries in theworld to define fuel poverty and set a goal towards eradicating it.

New definitions of both fuel poverty and extreme fuel poverty arecurrently being worked on.She added: “Our proposals in the Fuel Poverty Billwill align fuel poverty more closely with low income.

The late Peter McCambridge won his Distinguished Conduct Medal on the Longest Day - but he had, in fact, dropped into Normandy in the late evening of June , .Anyone who has seen the film of The Longest Day will remember the scenes featuring Richard Todd and the Glider troops of the Oxs and Bucks Light Infantry attacking Pegasus Bridge.Mr. McCambridge, then an NCO with the thParachute Btn. of the th Airborne Division, was fighting only yards from this famous action in the nearby village of Le Port.In later years, Peter McCambridge was a familiar figure in Ballymena. He lived at Wilson Crescent and was a keen walker. Few,any, would have known that the tall, bespectacled figure who went about his civilian le so quietly and modestly was one of the heroes of D-Day.This is what his citation recorded about the action:-  Unit : B Company, th Parachute Battalion. Service No. : . Awards : Distinguished Conduct Medal‘This NCO was one of the parachute troops who landed behind the German lines in Normandy on the night th th June . During the fighting for Beacutenouville bridge on the th June, McCambridges platoon was responsible for holding the village of Le Port. At one period his section became detached from the platoon and the fighting, which went on for  hours almost without pause, was particularly fierce. McCambridge noticed that one house dominated the scene of the fighting. By skilful use of a smoke grenade and displaying the greatest dash he got his section across a road swept by Machine Gun fire and into the house. He used anti-tank grenades to smash open the garden gate and the door of the house. Once inside the house he was completely cut off from the rest of his company, who actually had withdrawn slightly, but he was in a dominating position and became the target for the enemy who greatly outnumbered his section and were surrounding him. So well did he dispose his men however and so splendid was his leadership that he held this isolated house until the seaborne troops eventually entered the village from the other end, several hours later. At times the enemy were close enough to try and beat down the door by beating it with their rle butts - McCambridge dealt with such attacks by having grenades dropped on them from the upper windows. There is no doubt that the holding of this dominating house seriously weakened the enemy attacks and greatly assisted the battalion to carry out its job of holding the bridge. On the th June at Bois de Bavent during a company attack Sgt McCambridge, together with another NCO, saved the le of his platoon commander, who had been wounded and whose phosphorus bomb was burning in his pouch. Between them they extracted the burning bomb and dragged the officer to cover despite heavy and accurate mortar and Machine Gun fire.McCambridge has shown himself throughout the three weeks continuous fighting to be a truly magnicent NCO. He is calm, cheerful and always reliable.

Both league officials made excellent speeches during which they brought the best wishes of their respective organisations and paid generous compliments to Dromore on reaching their th anniversary.AuctionA highlight of the evening was the auction of sporting memorabilia. Hospitality tickets for a Northern Ireland game, signed shirts from Ulster Rugby and Linfield FC, and signed footballs from Rangers FC and Manchester United, all sold for very respectable sums.However, a titanic bidding war took place over a signed Liverpool FC football and the atmosphere in the room was electric as the figure kept getting higher and higher.When the auctioneer, Mr Fullerton, eventually brought the hammer down and declared ‘sold’, it was Amateurs committee member and local businessman Darren McCauley who became the new owner of the prized football.He might have paid an eye-watering amount, but being a lelong Liverpool fan and a great Dromore clubman, Mr McCauley was delighted with his purchase – and with Liverpool having won the Champions League final at the weekend, it now looks like a clever investment.With the formalities over, it was time for the band to take to the stage, and five-piece Klass proved a big hit, packing the dancefloor until the finish.AwardsThe final act of the   season came on Saturday, May  with a charity match between current players and a team of Amateurs “legends”.An entertaining game was played in a friendly but competitive spirit at the Community Centre.The youthful legs of the current players proved too much for the wise old heads of the legends. However, a clever tactical decision to play the last  minutes with  players on the pitch helped the old boys finish the game with a respectable - defeat.It was wonderful to see so many former players come along, pull the boots on and attempt to relive past glories. Special mention goes to Malcolm Hanna, who celebrated his th birthday with a sterling display in midfield.A total of £ was raised for Diabetes UK, with the costs of the day kindly sponsored by Trevor Tate and Son Transport Ltd.Afterwards, the Amateurs held their end-of-season awards presentation in the clubrooms.Chairman Russell Ward expressed his sincere thanks to the coaching staff, players and committee for all their efforts throughout the season.First team player-manager Graeme Davis was praised for guiding the Amateurs to their highest place league finish in many years.Dromore ended the season in fth positionin the Intermediate B Division of the Mid Ulster Football League.Their record was as follows: P W D L Pts .Graeme can be proud of this achievement in his debut season in charge.

Although there were many ups and downs over the year, the team stuck together and there was a great spirit in the changing room, right up until the last game.The award winners for both teams was dominated by young players – an encouraging sign for the future.The first teams gongs were a family affair, with the Reain brothers, Josh and Matthew, iding up the trophies between them. These two fantastic athletes will be the backbone of the first team for many years to come.Young player of the year was Matthew Briggs, who moved up from youth football and played the entire season in the first team - a tremendous achievement.In the seconds, top goalscorer Jonathan Rodgers only joined midway through the season but he is a great attacking player and is such an exciting prospect. And -year-old Nathan Thompson capped a wonderful season by taking home both the manager’s and players’ player of the year trophies. Nathan is a quiet young man – but on the pitch he makes his presence felt, and is a model defender who rarely makes a mistake.Clubman of the year was the popular Christopher Tate – a committee member and first team coach, Christopher puts his heart and soul into the club.Dromore Amateurs will hold their AGM in the clubrooms on Monday, June  at pm.

It was really satisfying, there were no TVs, no gaming machines, managing there was all about conversation.”Gerry spoke of how the initial spark of the Jawbox brand came about due to his “wee bit of entrepreneurial spirit” – the ‘spirit’ being his drink of choice.“In all the years I’ve worked in bars the only spirit I’ve ever liked was gin. I had the idea of producing my own gin, bringing out my own brand. If it didn’t work I was more than happy to stay on as a barman, I would’ve always regretted never giving it a go.”Gerry said the process took over two and a half years from the concept to getting the name registered.“I did come close to giving up but all the right people came together, the absolute best of the best, with Echlinville distiller Shane Branf, his head distiller Graham Miller and packaging and branding coming from Drinksology. Everything started to move dead fast.”The launch night of Jawbox took place in late February  – “a night of one of the worst storms, so I wasn’t hopeful people were going to turn up” – at the Linehall Library, with a little help from the then Lord Mayor Arder Carson.“I didn’t want to launch Jawbox in a bar, every other bar would’ve gone ‘Well, why didn’t you launch it in my bar ’ I wanted something ‘old Belfast’ and at the start Linenhall [Library] told me that didn’t really do launches as such. I loved the setting and told them I had the Lord Mayor on board – I just had to ask him,” he laughed.“I then went over to City Hall and said ‘Any chance of speaking to the Lord Mayor ’ The staff were brilliant and Arder came over and fair play as he likes a brandy.“The next day, when it was being rolled out, I think almost every bar in Belfast took it.”In the event, over  people turned up to support Gerry that night – “one of their own”Jawbox is now served in bars across Ireland, has its own mural in Kelly’s Cellars, is the go-to spirit at Belfast International Airport, is served across the water as well as its signature label displayed in over , retail outlets in England, Wales and Scotland.Recently awarded Supplier of the Year at the Institute of Hospitality Awards at Titanic Belfast, Gerry was one of five artisan suppliers chosen to showcase his product at a reception for Prince Charles and Camilla at the Grand Central on Wednesday.“The name comes from my granny, Maisie, Maisie Cunningham, who would always say to us ‘In my day we all stood round the jawbox and did our washing,’ as not everyone had the pleasure or the luxury of having their own shared washing area. Everything would have been washed in a big Belfast sink, clothes, dishes, the baby –everything was washed in it. People shared their stories, told their tales, it was their jaws going round the box. I always say to people to this very day, when they have parties, where do people go  The kitchen. Everybody stands around the sink.”It’s evident just how much pride and enthusiasm Gerry has for the product that has grown at a speed he never foresaw just three years ago.“The award for Supplier of the Year meant an amazing amount to me, it was my fth time being shortlisted, twice for Jawbox, always the bridesmaid, never the bride. It was fantastic.”The -year-old says the power to promote Jawbox via social media is “amazing”.“There are places Jawbox is appearing that I would never know. Philip Schofield posted a bottle to his Snapchat, everybody was ringing me saying ‘did you see it  Did you see it ’”Having grown up in C­onway Street and later Lenadoon, Gerry has his base just off Queen’s University Belfast. “Where will the next three years take Jawbox ” I ask him. He replies: “The States.”“You only get one chance in America. It’s a matter of making sure we have the right importer, distributor. Sean Muldoon and Jack McCarty from the Dead Rabbit are out there who are going to be so supportive. I used to work with Sean in the Northern Whig. “Just two weeks ago Jawbox was used as the reception drink for the Irish Film Festival in Australia, we launched in Sweden.”Inbetween “surprising” those who take part in weekly ‘Gin Jaunts’ every Saturday afternoon as part of the extremely popular Taste and Tour experience, Gerry hosts Jawbox gin evenings at ious hotels were he shares his passion with others keen to hear how Jawbox was born.“I was really surprised to see how many young people turn up to these events. I nearly dropped when someone asked me to sign a bottle recently.“What I set out to do from the start was build a legacy, make the product authentic, that’s why my signature is on the bottle. I knew from the start that the quality of this product had to be better than anything  out there.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"loughinisland journalists re united with seized belongings","story":"TWO journalists who had materials seized by police after their documentary into the Loughinisland massacre have collected their belongings from the police.Trevor Birney and Barry McCaffrey were arrested in August  over the suspected theft of confidential files, shortly after the release of their documentary ‘No Stone Unturned’.On Tuesday, both men collected their possessions from Castlereagh police station which included laptops, hard drives, mobile phones, notepads and millions of digital files.On Monday, Durham Constabulary dropped their investigation after a judicial review last week ruled the search warrants linked to the raids on the two journalists’ homes would be quashed.Both men were released from police bail.Sinn Féin MLA Gerry Kelly called on Durham Police and the PSNI to apologise to the journalists and the victims of the Loughinisland Massacre. “This is a victory for freedom of the press.“Durham Police has done the right thing dropping the case against Trevor Birney and Barry McCaffrey.“This case should never have been pursued in the first place.“The two journalists should be thanked for doing their job and providing a service to society by shining a light on state collusion in the Loughinisland massacre.“They exposed British State involvement in one of the most notorious atrocities of the conflict. “The police response was to arrest the journalists rather than pursue those responsible for the massacre and cover up.“Freedom of the press is a fundamental principle in any democracy. “The Chief Constables of Durham Police and the PSNI should apologise to Barry McCaffrey and Trevor Birney as well as their journalistic colleagues and the Loughinisland families.“Durham Constabulary’s Chief Constable Mike Barton said: “Following the outcome of last week’s judicial review, a decision has now been taken not to progress the investigation into those two iniduals and both will be immediately released from police bail.“We are in the process of concluding what has been a highly complex investigation, with some final lines of inquiry still to be assessed. These lines of inquiry do not include the journalists, Mr Birney or Mr McCaffrey, as suspects in the investigation.“At all times, my officers have acted in good faith, within the law and followed due process. The warrant application was originally submitted to and approved by a county court judge. We do, however, accept and respect the decision of the High Court last week.“We plan to produce a final report to the Chief Constable of the PSNI outlining all of our findings.”In response PSNI Chief Constable George Hamilton said: “In , PSNI became aware of an alleged theft and or unlawful leaking of sensitive documents relating to the Loughinisland investigation from the Office of the Police Ombudsman. To ensure independence and address any conflict of interest I asked Durham Constabulary to conduct the investigation.“I am grateful to Durham Constabulary and to Chief Constable Mike Barton for the work they have conducted on our behalf in this sensitive investigation. I have always accepted the autonomy of Chief Constable Barton’s inquiry and I fully concur with his decision not to progress the investigation into the two journalists Mr Birney and Mr McCaffrey.“Throughout the period of this investigation, the horror of what happened in Loughinisland has never been far from any of our thoughts. The perpetrators of that crime have never been brought to justice and that is a matter of huge regret for policing.“The police investigation into who murdered the six innocent men in the Heights Bar in  remains open but progress is dependent on new information. There are people out there who know what happened. I would appeal to them to come forward and make a statement that will help us finally bring justice to the families of the victims.“I am aware that the investigation over the last year has caused concern for families who have already suffered so much. That is something none of us would ever have wished to do.“However, as a police service, the suspected theft or unlawful leaking of any sensitive documents containing information that may endanger le is a serious matter which we are statutorily obliged to investigate.“Recognising the sensitivities, we asked an independent Police Service to conduct the investigation. The clarity provided by last week’s hearing has now brought a signicant part of that investigation to a conclusion.“I await the final report from Durham on this complex investigation.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/PIPS-families.png","title":"pips families provide helping hand to each other","story":"NORTH Belfast suicide prevention charity PIPS has been to the forefront over the years in providing support to iniduals who are considering or who have at some point considered ending their own lives.PIPS also provide support to families and friends who have been touched by suicide, with their family group the driving force behind such support.PIPS Family Group Meeting takes place every Wednesday night from pm to pm in Tesco at Cityside.The group is currently made up of seven members, all women who have lost a family relative to suicide.Two such members are Patricia Perry, who lost her son Johnin , andAnne McKenna, wholost her son Broguein .Patricia explained how she involved in the group.“My son died  years ago. PIPS came to the house for the wake and I got talking to them,” she said.“They offered me the chance to come for some therapy sessions and to get involved in the family group. I went and thought at the time it was all too much. It just wasn’t for me.“A few years later I thought about it and went back. I met the other members and we have been best friends ever since.“The thing is we know exactly how each other feels. You can’t explain it to anyone  how it feels to lose a child.“There is one woman in the group who lost three sons and another who has lost two.”Anne joined the group six years ago when her son Brogue died.“For me, the group provides great friendship for me and I enjoy coming every week,” she explained.“When it is my son’s birthday or the anniversary of his death, sometimes I don’t feel like leaving the house but I would never miss a group meeting on a Wednesday night.“Really, without this group I don’t think I would be doing as well as I am today.“Every week, I look forward to a Wednesday night to come along and meet with people I now class as my friends.”As well as exchanging their own personal stories of heartbreak and loss, PIPS Family Group is much more than sharing their loss.Every year, members save up to fund a four-day holiday abroad with previous destinations including Amsterdam, Malta and Portugal. They also have regular days out, shopping trips and an annual Christmas dinner.“I think the social aspect of the group is very important,” added Patricia. It is not all miserable and we all enjoy our holidays and day trips to just get away from it all. We have all become really good friends.“We work closely with New Lodge Arts doing things like arts and crafts and doing social things with them really gives us all a bit of a lt.“Losing a loved one is dferent for each person. I understand the group might not be for everyone.“We all just sit and chat. We can talk openly about our loved ones we have lost and it helps us remember the good and happy times.”Due to renovation work at PIPS Antrim Road offices, the family group recently got good news of a room available in Tesco in Cityside, Yorkgate, where their weekly meetings will be held for the foreseeable future.Despite the success of the group, Patricia would like to see a similar group set up for men so that men can talk to each other about the subject.“The suicide rate in North Belfast is terrible. It is an epidemic,” she said.“We badly need a similar group like ourselves, but for men so that they can too talk to each other.“We have welcomed men before but some felt it just was not the setting for them.“I wish a man out there would do something. Men need to be talking.“As for our group, it is great to have this new room in Tesco. It is a good size and a lovely room.”PIPS Family Group are open to welcome new members.

Mr Javid continued: \"In my departmentat the moment Ive got border force and weve done work for months on what an alternative to that arrangement could look like and whats missing is that good will. \"What I would do is make a grand gesture to Ireland that we would cover all their costs - the upfront costs, the running costs - of a new digitised border. \"I think it could be done in a couple of years but I think we could cover their costs.\""},{"url":null,"title":"huge rise in number of british nationals applying to become irish after brexit referendum","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsEU Elections Top  CompaniesNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Jaguar Land Rover, owned by India’s Tata Motors, is also cutting jobs in a bid to reduce costs. Earlier this year the company said it plans to cut , jobs, most of which are expected to be in the UK.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  – Why is this happening Each company has expressed ying reasons for closing factories or cutting back, although the UK car industry as a whole is facing challenges on several fronts and is not alone.Electrication of the motor industry, along with the rapid rise of new technologies, is forcing many manufacturers to change their business strategies and look for places to source new, more complex components and build cars as cheaply as they can.The “signicant challenges of electrication” was the reason given by Honda for deciding to shut its Swindon factory in two years’ time.Consumers are also turning away from diesel vehicles in droves following concerns over pollution, with production down more than a fth last year.These changes are against a backdrop of uncertainty over Brexit and how that might impact production at UK plants. Manufacturers have warned that a no-deal Brexit could hit complex cross-border supply chains, making it less profitable to make cars in Britain.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Industry electrication is a major contributing factor – What is happening in other countries According to an analysis by Bloomberg at least , job cuts were announced by players in the global car industry from China to Canada between November and May.After enjoying a decade of growth, manufacturers are steeling themselves for a downturn with some fearing it will be “signicant”.Falling sales, a pivot towards electric and self-driving vehicles and a trade war between the US and China have been blamed."},{"url":null,"title":"thermal images show off nighttime activity among london zoo animals","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsEU Elections Top  CompaniesNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Based on a five acre site at Kennedyrsquos Lake, the retreat has been visited by disabled groups who abide by the ethos of lsquofishing for funrsquo.No lead weights or barbs are allowed. Once a fish is caught and photographed it is released back into the lake.Robert explains that with the help of his close aide and fellow veteran, Nigel Cree, who is a director of Letrsquos Do Veterans Support, the net has been widened and that an invitation is being extended to anyone within the local community who wants to try out fishing.While battling to overcome his disability, Robert discovered there was little or no help for disabled veterans available in his community.Facing an interminable series of bad news on his journey to recovery he viewed the opportunity to be given a role in the British Limbless Ex-Servicemenrsquos Association as his saving grace.Robert said: ldquoWhen I got involved I saw people much worse off than myself. Some veterans had catastrophic injuries. I began to gain qualications in helping other people in the same situation as me. This helped me with my own recovery and give me a focus.ldquoMy house is down by the lake. One evening I was sitting observing how peaceful it was and it got me thinking about how I could put the lake to good use. In hindsight, the idea saved me from myself.ldquoI got a small team involved and before we knew it we had been successful in attracting funding to construct a car park, create fishing stands and a foot bridge, stock the lake with indigenous course fish and install an eco-toilet with disabled access.ldquoThere was no stopping half way through and the gamble has paid off with a successful opening and an encouraging demand for bookings growing each day.Robert describes himself as ldquonot being a lsquotea and biscuits man and doesnrsquot like to stand on ceremony.He continued: ldquoI have been helped by a devoted team of helpers and I would like to pay tribute to each of them and I dedicate this achievement to them and the three other veterans I started with who gave me great encouragement.ldquoIrsquod also like to thank Alpha Concrete, Hamilton Brothers and Cunningham Stone who were exceptional in their work with memorial plaques which have been erected.Robert said he hopes to provide fishing workshops in the near future and to get more people using the retreat.He added: ldquoA lot of time and money has been invested and when strangers visit we would ask them to adhere to the rules.

They represented the district so well at Irish level and again at world level in Abu Dhabi, bringing home medals.Mr Murnin also referred to the success of the inaugural Be Active Cup involving soccer teams from opposite sides of the council area. He instigated the tournament and hopes his successors will continue with it.He continued: ldquoDuring my year we had the opportunity to salute Dermot Curran, one of our long standing councillors mdash in fact the longest serving in Northern Ireland mdash with whom we enjoyed a fantastic night.ldquoIt was also a pleasure to lead our St Patrickrsquos Day parade in my home area which was really special for me. We then had the Innovation Nation event, bringing many young people from our schools together to see the exciting advances in the business opportunities that are presented to them going forward.Mr Murnin said he was also involved in helping fundraise for brave Bessbrook girl Ellen Treanor and six-year Alfie Pentony from Newry who will both travel to the US for pioneering health treatment.Sadly for the former chairman, rain intervened last August and the annual Festival of Flight international air show in Newcastle was cancelled.On a serious note, he told those in the chamber that a great responsibility comes with being a councillor.ldquoAs you strive to make this district the number one place to do business and set up a home, itrsquos worth remembering that those across the council chamber are not necessarily the enemy mdash you all must work together for the betterment of our district, he said.ldquoDuring my recent visit to New York, I was able to see how investors view the world and it was interesting to see where they see opportunities and risks, in particular.ldquoOne of those was climate risk and the importance of it, with businesses looking at it from an investors point of view. As a district, this is something that we need to take seriously, and not necessarily just rising sea levels.Mr Murnin believes that increased rainfall is going to make a dramatic dference to the way buildings and roads are designed, also highlighting the need to look at alternative energy forms.He added: ldquoBuilding for the future and how a modern city should look like will also be important. One thing that struck me looking out from the observation tower at the One World Center in New York was that the city is surprisingly green as so many of the buildings have roof top gardens and trees.

Out of the  people I asked, only one felt they were being represented at Stormont.ldquoI have decided to speak out and am working with others on my campaign. Rather than talk about doing something, I am going down this road because I believe that action is stronger than words.Mr Morgan says he is attempting to ascertainthere is consensus among the people of Northern Ireland for political change and politicians who want to work together for everyonersquos benefit.ldquoI am throwing my idea out there for people to stop what they are doing on June  between pm and .pm to show their frustration at what is currently happening, he explained. ldquoPolitical stagnation and climate change are crucial issues that we must do something about.ldquoI hope that people in every town, village and hamlet across this district and throughout Northern Ireland, including post-primary school students and those who attend further education colleges and universities, will take part.Mr Morgan said he wants residents and those who work in shops and offices to demonstrate that they want change.ldquoJune  is an opportunity for people to demand change, equal rights and equality. Together we can make this happen. I want people to select a venue in their own area and meet there in silence for just a short period to send out a clear message that they have had enough and are demanding change, he continued.ldquoI am particularly keen to see students taking part as they are the future. We need to listen to what they have to say, particularly with regard to the future of local politics and the planet. We have not had a government in this country for two years which is disgraceful. I believe that our MLAs have effectively disqualied themselves from public office.He argued Northern Ireland, which was once a world leader in many fields, particularly engineering, needed a system of government which was not run along ldquoorange and green lines.He continued: ldquoWe want our country to be a world leader again, this time in agreeing political solutions and addressing the issue of climate change. I believe that we need a system of government which is based on non-party politics.ldquoParty politics across the globe has failed and in all my  years I have never had a government that represented me or indeed one that I had respect for. This has to end. We need a government for everyone which comprises independent members bringing their own particular strengths to the table.ldquoThere is no point calling for change and standing back. We have to make this happen with human rights and equality for everyone, regardless of their religion, political view, sexual preferences or colour of their skin. We need government by the people for the people.He added: ldquoI hope people will grasp the opportunity they are being offered on June .

Those that are successful are provided with financial support for one year only.It is a system that the chairwoman of the Bishopscourtrsquos playgroup is keen to see changed.Mrs Patricia Curran, who revealed that Tiny Toons recently missed out on Pathway funding by a narrow margin, said playgroups did a ldquomagnicent job, particularly in rural area where working parents rely heavily upon them.She said playgroups look after children at the most critical time in their development and need to be provided with financial certainty.A number of playgroups across the district revealed recently that they were organising additional fundraising activities to generate income and were appealing for donations of everyday essentials including toilet paper, wipes, photocopying paper and even bin bags.Mrs Curran revealed that Tiny Toons only found out about the strategic support fund by chance and while pleased the cash will pay staff wages over the summer, fresh funding applications will have to be made at the start of next year to cover costs.ldquoWhile we narrowly missed out on Pathway funding, we have secured other support from a fund which we knew nothing about, she continued.ldquoThe money we have secured will keep us ticking over. We are not saying everything is hunky dory as a result of this particular finance. We have money to pay for  childrenrsquos places from next September which is good. The money secured under the strategic support fund will pay our staff over July and August.Mrs Curran said that had the playgroup not been made aware of the strategic fund it would have been a ldquovery dferent story.ldquoWhile securing funding comes as a relief, it does not provide us with any degree of certainty. We will have to make a fresh application for Pathway funding at the start of next year and go through this process all over again, as we and others do every year, she continued.Mrs Curran said Tiny Toons and other playgroups across the district were operating in a ldquochallenging financial climate.ldquoThe provision of ring-fenced funding is vital for us, she declared. ldquoWhile things are fine for now, we know that come the New Year we will have to start filling in funding application forms again.ldquoRing-fenced funding for a two or three-year period would provide certainty and help playgroups operate in a climate where there would not be a cloud hanging over them.ldquoThe funding issue affects all those in the education sector and I read recently that one headmaster warned that his school could be forced to only open four days a week as it did not have enough money.Mrs Curran said that while strategic support funding has provided Tiny Toons with short term relief, guaranteed ring-fenced financial support would provide certainly and allow future planning.She added: ldquoGiven the current funding model, there is always uncertainty hanging over us. We are voluntary workers and we should not have this pressure on our heads. That said,we did not do this work, who  is going to do it ldquoNot many people want to do voluntary work any more because of the pressure involved. We in Bishopscourt were worried about paying our staff and have been provided with some relief. We are also grateful to our parents for their continued support and loyalty.The Bishopscourt playgroup will be taking part in a sponsored bag pack at the Asda supermarket in Downpatrick this Saturday between am and pm.

If you havenrsquot been to Meelmore Lodge lately, then go check it out. A signicant amount of investment has been done there and therersquos great parking facilities and easy access to the Ulster Way under the shadow of Meelmore .Therersquos accommodation there, including pods and plenty of camping spaces - great for a night out. The race exited the campsite with the organisers issuing strict instructions for runners not to cross walls or fences, except through an open gate where a marshal would be there to direct them.Wet tops were the order of the day, for while it was mild and dry, but there were a few ominous grey clouds around and once up near to , feet the climate conditions can be much more challenging.By the way, one of the race directorsdecided it would be wise to recce the course earlier in the week.So on Monday evening meeting at the above-mentioned stunning Meelmore Lodge, he gathered with a few so-called running mates. They set off, quickly deciding to start the race on the green paddock below the lodge .The decision to start there had far-reaching consequences for just adjacent to the chosen start location, come Thursday at pm, a camping couple decided to cook dinner on a makesht stove - they must have been planning a quiet romantic evening with stunning views and just as they had sat down, Frank Morgan, the perennial starterwith his flags and tape followed soon after by hundreds of runners and spectators gathering beside them - no need for them to put on the TV, they had all the live entertainment they needed.Back to Monday evening and the lsquocourse recce crewrsquo followed the Trassey river, crossing it before the hard climb up Slievenaglough, then following the green shoot up to the first check point at its summit.Then it was the technical descent down and up to the summit of lesser-known Lukersquos Mountain and from there making their way home.Mountain leader and rescue stalwart, Ian McCracken fell not once, but twice going over on his ankle badly mdash thankfully, no need for the mountain rescue as the lsquoProphetrsquo was there to guide him home safely mdash poor Ian, after all the winter preparation there would be no Thursday evening race for him.As the runners milled around , Pete Grant, who was surprisingly wearing his club vest for a change, must have had a category win on his mind, as he moaned and groaned about the long, sharp start, delaying the time before he could get his shoes properly mucky.Later on, however, that would be the least of his worries as for some reason he decided to leave his car keys somewhere out on the open mountain at a grid reference that to the present time only God knows.As Frankrsquos whistle was blown at ::the  runners charged off up the track and onto the open mountain.The route, mostly on sheep paths, took them directly onto the craggy summit of Slievenaglough that is part of the Mourne Wall route - a mountain that meant something on Thursday evening rather than just being an anonymous part of the route from the Harersquos Gap to Commedagh.Positively, pretty much everyone successfully reached the cut-off point of  minutes for the first mile that included around  feet of climbing.Newcastle ACrsquos Seamy Lynch had established a comfortable lead early in the race, clear of his club mate Mark Stephens with Newry ACrsquos Esther Dickson also comfortable in the womanrsquos race, ahead of Karen Wilton from Lisburn and Mourne runner Sarah Graham.It should have been plain sailing for everyone, but as often happens, the low cloud rolled in onto the ridge between Slievenaglough and Lukersquos and the summit of Lukersquos disappeared from view. We are still not sure that everyone made it there, but what is certain is that everyone made it back.Legal counsel Higgins lives le in the fast lane, balancing defending the indefensible in one court room or another with le on the farm and a Viking love nest in Tullybrannigan.If therersquos controversy in a sport not known for its controversy, Higgins perhaps will not be too far away - gamekeeper turned poacher  On the way home he chose his own line and clearly there had been some pillow talk, for she did too - slightly dferent, but both probably crossed the moral line, but probably not far enough to be eligible for a criminal conviction.His talk of bringing his finely honed orienteering skills to the table was not convincing the lsquoBroken Wing Commanderrsquo, but despite his protests supported strongly by the lsquoHenrsquo, the directors have no appetite for years in court ending in the European Court of Justice, no doubt, so the results stand.A fine run from Ballydrain junior Jared Martin to come home in third - a big star for the future  Many of the runners remarked this was the best HD course in years and it was great to freshen the series up with a new route - food for thought for the organisers for  Many thanks to all at Meelmore Lodge for the use of their facilities in this beautul location, the marshals, time keepers and people behind the scenes who keep the series running smoothly each week.Thanks also to the Avoca Hotel  Spa on their excellent food and beverages, by order of Jack OrsquoHare.Tomorrow night sees theto Millstone with full body cover required.

We’re all friendly now.“Even when I met them and the cameras weren’t on we got on really well. Bobby constantly had me in stitches. He could have his own show.“We’re from Dungannon. Lynda is Omagh direction, Audrey I think she’s up by Clogher.NI athlete Erin McConnell happy to rise before am to achieve Olympic dream\"  \"  Reported On This Day  Years Ago : Entry rules for the Downpatrick races are listed Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“The way it’s filmed it might seem that we live closer together.”Ruth said she had some dficulties with the cameras to begin with but soon found her feet: “When it was being filmed they said, ‘pretend we’re not here’. At the start I was accidentally looking into the lens. After a while, after the second or third time, you do forget the cameras are there.” Ruth explained how she got involved with the programme which was filmed at the start of last summer: “They went to my friend’s salon and they were giving out flyers trying to find someone who comes from a farming background and is also into the beauty and all. Helen said about me and passed on my details. They contacted me and I said I’d be interested, it sounds like great craic.”Ruth revealed that it wasn’t technically her TV debut: “When I was in primary school I was in school choir of the year, but that was in a choir and I’m a blur.”In one scene, Ruth who is a member of a gun club takes two of her friends shooting: “Hollie had shot once before, Helen had never shot in her le. We just sort of thought we’d go for the craic. That’s the sort of thing that we did for the show. It’s not like reality shows were they make drama for the sake of it.”Ruth described herself as “a part time farmer, part time beautician and a full time mum”. She said: “Maisie is two this week. She’s not in the show but I do talk about her.“I have a boyfriend, we’re not married or engaged. We’ve been going out for three and half years and we’ve been friends since we were .”During her early days as beautician she needed someone to practice on. Cue her dad John: “When I was training as a beautician I had to practice eyebrow waxing. I got my kit and asked dad would he let me practice. I think I got one strip pulled off and he stopped me. He said he’d been in enough accidents on the farm but that was by the far the worst. He ended up with one bushy eyebrow and one normal one.”She added: “My oldest brother John is a full time farmer. He’s won’t be on the show, he’s a bit shy. He works on the farm with my dad and my dad’s friend Billy.“My mumhelps out on the farm before her own job as a classroom assistant in a special needs school.”Ruth appears in the show alongside her brother Neil. As a duo they’re used to being in the limelight together.She said: “Neil’s a country singer. We used to sing together. We were a two-piece band then I went to Australia for a year and he went out on his own.“He started to make it really well on his own so I left him to it. I started a new job as a beautician and helped my dad out on the farm.”So has she got the bitten by the TV bug “It’s was really good craic,” she said. “If there was a second series and they asked me to be in it, I’d definitely say yes. I suppose they’re waiting to see how the first series goes.”She added: “The first night the trailer was on TV quite a lot of people videoed it and sent it to me on Snapchat. A lot of people have taken an interest.”try catch  TrendingPolice searching for missing N.I. man Ryan Smyth find bodyTT : Ian Hutchinson escapes serious injury following high-speed crash in qualyingIncreasing concern for N.I. teen who has vanishedSinger Malachi Cush lsquostablersquo in RVH following road collisionN.I. child reported missing is found safe and well*,:after,:before .teaser-essential,.u-clearfix .teaser-essential:after,.teaser-essential:before,.u-clearfix:after,.u-clearfix:before .teaser-essential:after,.u-clearfix:after .teaser-essential__link-primary .teaser-matrix__image, .teaser-matrix img, .teaser-matrix--native-ad img -moz-transform: rotate-ms-transform: rotate-o-transform: rotatetransform: rotatedisplay: blockwidth: %height: %overflow: hiddenobject-fit: coverobject-position: center@font-face src: url format, url format, url formatfont-weight: font-style: normal@font-face src: url format, url format, url formatfont-weight: font-style: normal.slab-matrix__title .slab-matrix__title span .teaser-matrix__readers, .slab-matrix__tabs li .teaser-matrix__heading, .teaser-matrix__category-link, .teaser-matrix__sponsor-link, .teaser-matrix__sponsor-text .slab--wowbrand  .slab__inner  .slab__block @media .slab__inner  .slab__block @media .slab__inner  .slab__block @media .slab__inner  .slab__block @media .slab__inner @media .slab__inner .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title @media@media@media@media.slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title:hover,.slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title span:nth-of-type:hover .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title span:nth-of-type:hover .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title span:first-child .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title span:nth-of-type @media .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title span:nth-of-type .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title .logo .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title a,.inews-link-mobile a .inews-link-mobile a .inews-link-mobile @media@media.slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title a:after,.inews-link-mobile a:after .slab-matrix .slab-matrix .slab__block @media@media.slab-matrix .slab__block:nth-child, .slab-related .slab__block:nth-child @media.slab-matrix .slab__block:nth-child, .slab-related .slab__block:nth-child @media.slab-matrix .slab__block:nth-child, .slab-related .slab__block:nth-child @media.slab-matrix .slab__block:nth-child, .slab-related .slab__block:nth-child .slab-matrix__tabs .slab-matrix__tabs li .slab-matrix__tabs li.is-current .slab-matrix__title @media.slab-matrix__title span .slab-matrix.tabbed, .tabbed.slab-related .slab-matrix.tabbed .slab__block, .tabbed.slab-related .slab__block .slab-matrix.tabbed .slab__block .slab-matrix__title, .tabbed.slab-related .slab__block .slab-matrix__title .slab-matrix.tabbed .slab__block:nth-child, .tabbed.slab-related .slab__block:nth-child .slab-matrix-link .teaser-matrix, .teaser-matrix--native-ad @media@media@media@media.teaser-matrix:hover .teaser-matrix__image, .teaser-matrix--native-ad:hover .teaser-matrix__image, .teaser-matrix:hover img, .teaser-matrix--native-ad:hover img .teaser-matrix__image-container .teaser-matrix__image-container:before .teaser-matrix__image-container  img .teaser-matrix__image, .teaser-matrix img, .teaser-matrix--native-ad imgcontrastfilter: saturate contrast-moz-filter: saturate contrastopacity: .teaser-matrix__text-container .teaser-matrix__heading .teaser-matrix__heading:hover .teaser-matrix__meta-container @media.teaser-matrix__category-link .teaser-matrix__category-link--relative .teaser-matrix__category-link--relative.popular .teaser-matrix__readers .teaser-matrix__readers:after .teaser-matrix__readers svg .teaser-matrix__readers svg path .teaser-matrix__readers.up svg fill: #CFC.teaser-matrix__readers.up svg path .teaser-matrix__readers.down svg .teaser-matrix__readers.down svg path animation: half-fade s ease-out infinite.teaser-matrix__readers  span @media span @media span .teaser-matrix__sponsor-link .teaser-matrix__sponsor-text .teaser-matrix__link-primary .teaser-matrix.is-ie-fit .teaser-matrix__image, .is-ie-fit.teaser-matrix--native-ad .teaser-matrix__image .teaser-matrix.is-ie-fit .teaser-matrix__image-container, .is-ie-fit.teaser-matrix--native-ad .teaser-matrix__image-containercontrastfilter: saturate contrast-moz-filter: saturate contrastopacity: .teaser-matrix.is-ie-fit:hover  .teaser-matrix__image-container, .is-ie-fit.teaser-matrix--native-ad:hover  .teaser-matrix__image-container .ie .teaser-matrix__image-container .teaser-matrix--native-ad__meta-container .teaser-matrix, .teaser-matrix--native-ad .teaser-matrix__image-container .teaser-matrix__text-container background: -webkit-linear-gradient.teaser-matrix__heading @media@media@media.teaser-matrix__category-link .teaser-matrix__readers .teaser-matrix__sponsor-link .teaser-matrix__sponsor-link:hover .teaser-matrix__sponsor-text @media screen and .dy_unit .dy-editorial-wow__items + .dy_wow_widget_header .st .st The EssentialsVisit inewsVisit inews        v.. -

The PSNI will not make such a decision in isolation.”Asked what advice police could give to motorists faced with long delays for an appointment, the PSNI said: “Keep checking the online booking portal for cancellations. Carry your appointment letter with you.”Council told to reveal secret Master Plan document Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Mr Cousens said: “If not quickly resolved, lawful drivers could be unfairly penalised for an issue outside of their control.“It’s not just the private motorist at risk either, as delivery vans are being caught up in the backlog. As the majority of freight is moved by road, inaction could dent the Northern Irish economy.“In previous periods of delay, Stormont has allowed exemptions to affected vehicles while the backlog is cleared. We hope that this can be repeated again while a long-term solution is sought.”Almost , more tests than normal were made in the first three months of this year.The Department of Infrastructure has said additional staff are being recruited and “urgent consideration” is being given to the possibility of opening testing centres on Sundays for a limited period of time in order to address the current

Christians are increasingly being asked major questions about their core identity and loyalty.”He gave the example of changes to the abortion law and asked those in the assembly who would regard themselves as broadly unionist in their thinkingthey would vote based on the democratic process, the constitutional position of Northern Ireland or their own view on the rights of the unborn child.“That is just one of many new questions on the radar,” he said.Rev Hamilton expressed his appreciation of the press and media: “Contrary to what many appear to think, they are absolutely not out to get us.“They have a rigorous professional job to do, and given the still very signicant role of the church in our society ... it is quite proper for the media to challenge us not only about what we are doing, but about how we do it. That is important and necessary for a healthy society and for a healthy church as well.”In closing he told the moderator: “There is a huge opportunity for you, and those who will follow you in the chair, to use the many opportunities that come to you, to help make a Biblical and Christian voice heard loud and clear on these and other issues – such as sectarianism, paramilitarism, immigration policy, agricultural policy, overseas aid to name but a few more.”Presbyterian Church rejects motion to ‘restore relationship’ with mother church in Scotland Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingIncreasing concern for N.I. teen who has vanishedSinger Malachi Cush lsquostablersquo in RVH following road collisionMOT delays: PSNI in talks about relaxing rules for affected driversN.I. child reported missing is found safe and wellTwo men rushed to hospital after serious two vehicle smash -

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This argument was discounted by the planning committee.“As it is new information it is clear the initial granting of planning permission must be set aside. I have written to the NI Public Ombudsmanto look into how this planning decision was taken in the first place given information that was denied councillors and the public as well as the fact the land is zoned for sport and recreation not education.”Man banned from driving for a year Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article

They toss, turn, and grade the shellfish according to size, before ing them to the seabed. Across the Lough we can see the Cooley Peninsula and Co Louth. In the Brexit border debate, this is ground zero.Growing oysters takes three years, says Darren Cunningham, owner of Killowen Shellfish, and he exports stock every week. “It leaves on a Friday evening at around pm, and % is exported to France. It goes through Dublin and Rosslare to the top oyster buyer in Europe. The oysters are in purication tanks in France by Sunday evening. That’s how quick it is.” Carlingford Oysters then travel to restaurants in Paris and other European capitals. How is business  “Very good,” Darren says. “We sold nearly  tonnes of oyster last year. Two tonnes went to China and the rest to France.” Is there much competition  “Not for us. We’re the talk at the minute. We have the best stuff.”Darren and his team work next to Ballyedmond Estate, the family home of the late Edward Haughey, founder of Norbrook, one of the world’s leading veterinary pharmaceutical companies. If you travel further up the lough – past Warrenpoint, home to Northern Ireland’s second largest port – you will reach Newry, where Norbrook is based.Killowen Shellfish and Norbrook, which generated an operating profit of £.m in the year to August , are very dferent businesses, yet both speak the common language of exports. There are around , VAT registered businesses in the greater Newry area and many of them are accustomed to criss-crossing the border.“We have a number of major global players based here in Newry who supply goods across the world,” Colm Shannon, chief executive of Newry Chamber of Commerce and Trade says.He name-checks MJM Marine, a leader in the global marine industry, which employs  people in three offices across Europe. “Equally, we have a number of smaller companies who are involved in north-south trade. That’s usually the first step into the export market.”Exports are the essence of business for Re-Gen Waste, a Newry firm established in  by five siblings. Re-Gen began by recycling paper, cardboard, tin and plastics, before graduating to municipal waste and black bin waste. The family developed their own purpose-built facility in Newry, creating a business that generates millions. Its work is spread across Northern Ireland, the Republic and rest of the UK.According to John Doherty, a director at the business, Re-Gen “exports hundreds of tonnes across the border every day. We’re the fourth largest recycler in the Republic.” Its recycled products are exported to almost  countries around the globe. Re-Gen is not alone. Other successful Newry exporters include FM Environmental Group, which has offices in Malta and the Middle East. In , Newry’s BM Steel landed new business, in a deal worth £m, in the Netherlands and Great Britain. Around Noon, a producer of high-quality sandwiches, employs  people and has made acquisitions in Dublin and London. Newry-based construction firm mac-group is another all-island operation. In , it completed a £m refurbishment of River House, a -storey building in Belfast. Simultaneously, it was working the new Barclays headquarters in Dublin. “We employ over  people, across four dferent offices,” Brendan Moley, group interiors managing director at mac-group says. “The Newry office has  full time people. A lot of those staff members support projects in Dublin, London and Birmingham. There’s a lot of commuting back and forth across the border. We are trading in cross border services on a daily basis, but we’re also heavily involved in products and goods.”Although GB is Northern Ireland’s biggest external market, businesses in the Newry region are accustomed to cross border trade due to their geographical location. “We’ve always looked at Newry as being half way between Belfast and Dublin,” Brendan says. “You can get to Dublin Airport in  minutes from here. The talent available within the Newry market, in terms of some of staff, skill-set and knowledge, is extremely beneficial as well.”Some businesses fear that a hard border, in the event of a ‘no deal’ Brexit, will cause delays. According to Darren Cunningham, only a few hundred lorries crossed the border every day in . That number is around , today. “A minute delay can knock everyone back hours,” he says. “My oysters can’t hold their breath forever. They’re a living creature. They only have a certain amount of time. The quicker they get to France, the better condition they’re in.”Re-Gen operates its own transport department. “Currently we send a lorry to Dublin twice in a day to collect materials,” John Doherty says. “If there is a delay at the border, you are likely require a second lorry. The cost of taking everything from the Republic to the north doubles.”Technology, such as unmanned border posts equipped with cameras, would be unlikely to solve the problem, suggests Brendan. “Any type of border control will impact business. Being from the border area myself, knowing how many crossings there are, I think it would be absolutely impossible to police it in any sensible way.”Newry businesses fear they will face mountains of costly paperwork post-Brexit. There may also be compliance issues, such as food traceability dficulties for food producers like Killowen Shellfish, construction product regulations for mac-group, or paper work for Re-Gen’s haulage drivers, whose Certicates of Professional Competencemay not be to be recognised in a post-Brexit EU. The Government has suggested imposing zero tarfs on goods from the EU in the event of no deal. Newry businesses believe this would put them at a competitive disadvantage. “The business community has expressed concerns that Northern Ireland will become a back door into the UK market for goods coming from the EU,” Colm Shannon says. “History tells you when you have iation of tarfs on the border, that’s an opportunity for smuggling.”Staff recruitment is another concern at Re-Gen, which has a -strong workforce. “We’re already finding it dficult to recruit staff,” John says. “Often, the people we’re hiring are seasonal and foreign workers. It’s the same for the agricultural industry, hotels...”But what about the arguments that a managed no-deal could be good for business  Firms would still have access to EU markets under WTO rules. Furthermore, the UK might strike lucrative trade deals in the years to come. Businesses around Newry are not buying this. Certainly not Norbrook, which has “an integrated supply chain, with a global supply base, which relies on frictionless trade,” according to Liam Nagle, the company boss.Uncertainty reigns for export businesses in the Newry area. “The chaotic nature in which this has been managed has restricted companies like ourselves from planning for the future,” Brendan Moley says. “It’s one  dawn after another.”Darren Cunningham, looking across the water to where Co Louth is starting to feel very far away, says: “A lot of people are in complete disbelief and don’t think it’s going to happen. I can’t get my head around it at all. That’s the truth.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/jannine_1.jpg","title":"my day jannine waddell","story":"Posted on Friday  May  by Ulster Business Name: Jannine Waddell MBE Position: Managing director at Waddell Media .amMy alarm goes off and I instantly check the weatherand have a quick look at emails that have come in overnight.

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
