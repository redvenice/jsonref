The global lockdown has given birth to new cliches: wildlife cautiously exploring unpeopled streets iconic monuments devoid of tourists, save for the occasional solitary inidual escaping their confinement.This commission asked photographers to move beyond the obvious and present a series of images that respond to the issues confronting us, to begin to plot a route to a new future and to new ways of thinking about the world.June 2020 marks the fifth anniversary of my move to Istanbul. In my hectic global life, I have finally been grounded in my favourite city. The past few months have given me a chance to explore Istanbul more intimately than in all my years of living here. I set out to portray the city in crisis and confinement, but what I found was a erse social fabric where pockets of hope and human resilience prevail.As a tribute to the multiple layers of Istanbul’s unique cultural identity, I have collected stories from “non-essential workers”, whose lives have been derailed by the pandemic. As they spoke to me, they related not just their fears, but also their hopes about the future and ways of trying to adapt to a new reality. From street vendors to magicians, barbers to dancers, hammam scrubbers to imams, each expressed dignity in the face of hardship and a unique way of resisting and overcoming their daily stresses. In his memoire Istanbul: Memories and the City, Orhan Pamuk wrote: “If I see my city as beautiful and bewitching, then my life must be so too.” As I explored the various parts of this vast megalopolis and connected with its inhabitants in their own microcosms, their moods and feelings imprinted on mine. In this process, I began to embrace the city as my own in a way that I haven’t done before.I meet the illusionist on board Le Vapeur Magique, an 1828 steamship, where he performed for tourist parties and corporate dinners before the pandemic. On the lower deck we enter a small theatre with a stage framed by the black velvet curtain. Empty chairs stand in semi-circles, the lights are dim. Özgür, in a magician’s dark brown frock coat with a white frilly collar, shows me his card tricks first. He waves a hand and the top card changes suit. He picks up a small table by the tablecloth and it flies, he pulls out a wallet and sets it on fire.“My first audience was my family.” Özgür taught himself magic when he was six years old by watching other magicians on TV. “I am a freelancer. If the phone rings I work, if it does not, I don’t work. I was scared of the pandemic, of the impact.” Since Covid-19 paralysed his professional life, Özgür has shifted focus to broadcasting his magic on YouTube. He spent a few days designing a set for an online performance, uploaded the promo, and two days later received a phone call from a woman who booked him to perform at her son’s birthday party via Zoom. This was Özgür’s first gig in two months of quarantine.A techno track plays continuously in a cosy ground-floor apartment in Cihangir where two honey-bear cats – Roket and Tatar – saunter, shedding their luxurious fur. On top of a wooden shelf filled with LPs stands a new mixer, which Yunan bought when the Covid-19 crisis led to the cancellation of all her gigs. Yunan recalls her last gig on 14 March . “It was in this tiny cosy restaurant and pre-club space, Markus Tavern. I play long sets there regularly, anything that inspires me. As I walked there, I was questioning everything. Like why am I going to DJ in the middle of the pandemic? Is it going to be my last gig for who knows how long? Everything had started already, the flights were cancelled two to three days later. But still it was a lovely night with beautiful people and great vibes.” Now in her mid-30s, Yunan is comfortable with solitude. Social distancing has not changed much of her daily routine, but she misses the performance. “Being in a DJ booth for me is like meditation. I don’t think about anything else. Even when I am super nervous or excited, it just goes away. When people don’t dance, it makes me feel like I am stuck in a little can, the shape is cylindrical, so in order to get out, I play the invincible track. A secret weapon that will get the crowd going.” Yunan dismisses the thought of never working as a DJ again. “It’s not possible. Music has always been there and people will need their rituals.”“I buy objects because I like them. I enjoy my solitude and I don’t need to fill any void by buying stuff.” Nevzat’s store is layer upon layer of objects he has collected in his last 10 years as an antiques dealer. On most afternoons, Nevzat, a reticent man in his 50s, chain-smokes in an armchair at the back of his store where he is barely visible behind a labyrinth of shelves. A well dressed couple walk inside the store and with a haughty air inquire after a wooden chest. “It’s not for sale,” Nevzat answers cooly. They eye a few other items and leave the store. “If I believe in the customer, I sell them things. I bring down the price or even give it away. I am like a grumpy old bookseller who would only sell to someone worthy of adopting his orphaned books.” Nevzad buys objects with a mindset of a collector, following a chosen theme of “tradable” ideas. “Objects can tell history. For example, I am now collecting things about the intelligence service and I would like to find a photograph of Mata Hari. I know she stayed in Istanbul at Pera Palace. I would love to get a photo of the world’s greatest spy when she was here.” Nevzad shrugs when I ask him which objects he would collect to tell the story of the current pandemic. “Maybe I will collect masks. But it’s not interesting to me right now, because we are in the middle of it. We are living through it. Maybe in 20 years I will have a better perspective.”Nevzad takes us around the corner to a spacious three-tier studio warehouse filled with a dizzying amount of objects he has bought in bulk and now rents out as props and set designs for cinema. I feel as though I walked into a parallel universe of Istanbul, each section representing a slice of life gone forever.. Nevzad’s slender frame in the dim light of the studio is dwarfed by the volume of his collection. I can’t help wonder if he feels the ephemeral weight of memories attached to each object. Do they whisper to him, I ask. Nevzad smiles: “It doesn’t bother me. I’ve been enjoying the quiet days of the quarantine. I am happy to be away from the people.”“I prefer to be addressed as ‘they’.” Ceytengri opens the door wearing silver eyeshadow in the shape of dragon wings and glossy black lipstick in bold contour. This elaborate makeup session took them three hours of perfecting. In a living room shrouded in afternoon sun, they are having trouble slipping into a narrow silky Chinoiserie tube dress, which has a stubborn side zipper. The curtains, velvety and heavy like in a theatre, match the dress – burgundy red. The room’s furniture is a brighter tone of crimson red. Ceytengri sits down to touch up the eye lines at a vanity table with scattered makeup. They pull on a tall black boot – “Oh, I really miss wearing heels!” – they say.Ceytengri lip-synchs to mostly western music, but their performance is often riddled with social commentary. “For me it’s not just going on stage and doing a dance routine. It has to tell a story. For example I wear niqabs a lot during my shows. My grandma used to scare me as a kid not to approach women in niqabs because they will get me under their folds and steal me away. Niqabi women have been oppressed for a long time here in Turkey. But today Islamists are heading the state, so they are celebrated more than ever. So I like poking fun at them. I believe women should be able to wear what they want. Drag is about playing with the boundaries of reality and acknowledging that everyone has a different view of the world around them.Hazal, Gullu and Binnaz, informal garbage recyclersSerkan, a municipal garbage collector apologises for the smell of his uniform when he meets us in Yeni Çamlica, a small Roma community of informal recyclers in the Anatolian suburbs of Istanbul. He jumps off his garbage truck and walks home to put on a change of clothes. As we wait for him to return, a local municipality van pulls over and people in orange uniforms unload metal tiffin containers with hot food ready for distribution. Serkan leads us down the street lined with small homes. He introduces us to a teenage girl, Hazal, her mother, Gullu, and Binnaz, Gullu’s mother-in-law.Binnaz and Gullu have been collecting garbage for decades, but in the past month of quarantine, the buyers have closed down the shops, so the unsold trash has accumulated. Stacks of cardboard, plastic and paper lay idle on the hood of a weathered green pickup truck parked at the entrance to their home. “This is from the 20 days of trash collection. My husband is dead. My son is in jail for a crime he did not commit. So we do all the work ourselves,” says Binnaz. “Because of the curfew, it’s forbidden for us to collect garbage, but we still did it. We have too many children and grandchildren to feed.” A man approaches the group carrying plastic bags full of groceries: cartons of milk and juice, flour, oil and bread, which he passes to the women. “We survive with these handouts. Municipality helps too.” On a good month before the pandemic, Binnaz would earn about 1,000 Turkish lira (£116) collecting and reselling paper, metal and plastic. “It’s so boring to stay at home. We miss our freedom. We want to work and be out on the streets.” “My family has lived here for more than 40 years,” says Özgür, pointing to a small street with a web of laundry lines connecting buildings, just off the well-known Tarlabaşi boulevard. Tarlabaşi has succumbed to the growing pains of a drawn-out gentrification project. “My ancestors lived here. I was born and grew up here. We are losing something, like a neighbourhood, a family bond, seeing it gone makes me upset.” For the past two months of the pandemic, Özgür mostly stayed at home. A father of two, he was able to support his family with balloon sales in the past, but as part of government lockdown measures, people under 20, Özgür’s main client base, were ordered to stay indoors. “When I sell my balloons now I ask the customers to disinfect them before they give it to the child. I warn them because the virus is so tiny it can be anywhere.” Dressed in jeans and a hoodie, Reyhan picks us up from a busy square in Istanbul’s densely populated Gaziosmanpaşa district. Reyhan leads us to a quieter part of the neighbourhood, to her daughter’s home in a cottage where Reyhan moved during the quarantine.\u0026nbspA baby sleeps in a crib in the back room, while in the front room the daughter’s framed wedding photograph in a pink puffy dress is the centrepiece on the wall above the couch. Reyhan changes into her traditional Roma skirt and flower bezel, an attire she usually wears while teaching dance. The transformation is striking, not just her body and posture, but her face, too, becomes radiant.A dance instructor for more than two decades, Reyhan still remembers her first student – Elizabeth, an American oriental dancer who came to Turkey to study Roma dance. “She came to my home everyday. We both cried when she went back to America. But she told all her dancer friends about me. She said she found the most amazing Roma dancer in Turkey. That’s how the word spread. Back then there was no social media. Just from ear to ear.”\u0026nbspA vast majority of Reyhan’s students are foreign women who visit Turkey for a few weeks to study dance with her.She often gives lessons in her own home, but since the pandemic hit, Reyhan could not bear the thought of staying alone and moved in with her daughter’s family. She is sceptical about online classes she does not own a laptop and the phone screen is too small to demonstrate the dance moves. The pandemic has so far paralysed her professional life. “Social distancing is hard to keep while teaching dance. When I teach, I have to fix their body poses. Sometimes I see she has a problem, can’t do a move, so I hold her hand. She gets my energy and she understands the move. I let her hold my belly to understand how I move it, so she can see the difference. How can I do it through the screen? I can’t put the camera on my belly!”Behzat Şahin, owner of Cibalikapi meyhaneBehzat comes to his restaurant to check on Cimbiz the cat several times a week. . “We left him in charge here,” jokes Behzat as he surveys the empty room with chairs placed upside down on tables. His traditional Turkish meyhane – Cibalikapi – overlooks the Golden Horn and is known for its erse menu of mezes. The walls on the top floor are adorned with maps of old Istanbul and whimsical drawings of cats. He launched the original Cibalikapi meyhane in Balat 20 years ago, attributing the choice of location to its historic origins. “In Ottoman and Byzantine eras this was an important cosmopolitan port. Greeks, Armenians, Jews lived here and ran businesses. The meyhane back then were small seaside tavernas serving only wine to passing sailors, a patriarchal space. The role of women was solely to serve and entertain. Since the formation of the Turkish Republic, women began to join men  on more equal terms. This was when meyhane started evolving from a bar to an eatery.”Hülya Aslan’s tastefully furnished apartment in Bomonti looks over a noisy highway. Hülya enters the living room wearing a pistachio-coloured blazer with rolled-up sleeves over a white T-shirt. Her headscarf is tied around her neck in an elegant vintage style, resembling Audrey Hepburn’s. Hülya’s cousin is in the room with us, observing the shoot. When Hülya sits on the couch to pose, her trouser leg lifts up. “Pull it down, please,” her cousin intervenes, “You don’t want to be lynched again on social media for showing too much ankle.” With more than half a million followers on Instagram, Hülya has been a trendsetter in modest fashion since she first appeared on the pages of Ala, a conservative fashion magazine known in Turkey as the Vogue for the veiled. She later became its editor. “Ten years ago, there were very few fashion choices for them. They would wear short-sleeved shirts over long-sleeved shirts or trousers under skirts and dresses. No fashion labels produced clothes for them. So I thought, wait, we can do something, produce longer blazers, make the pants looser, headscarves should match the outfits, clothes should be made of natural materials with soft textures, because conservative women or veiled women have the right to be comfortable too.” • Prix Pictet was founded in 2008\u0026nbspby the Geneva-based Pictet Group, with the mandate to use photography to move beyond cliche and deliver powerful messages about sustainability to a global audience.

The department store chain has given its stores a coronavirus makeover and customers will next week find new shopping rules apply – including not trying on clothes and escalator etiquette involving an eight-step gap.The employee-owned retailer, along with other big high-street names such as Marks \u0026amp Spencer and Primark, will enter a brave new world on Monday when the relaxation of government restrictions in England provides the first real glimpse of shopper appetite to return to the high street proper. Department stores, bookshops, electrical outlets and toy retailers will be among the businesses opening when non-essential shops welcome back customers after an enforced three-month shutdown.Bérangère Michel, who oversees customer service at the John Lewis Partnership, which owns the John Lewis stores and the Waitrose supermarket business, says it has taken a month to get its store in Kingston upon Thames, south-west London – one of two opening on Monday, the other is Poole, Dorset – safe for the public to shop in. “It’s a complex thing to open a department store – and we know what it takes to run a socially distanced store because we have been running Waitrose for 12 weeks,” she explains.The store spread over three floors looks subtly different. The brightly lit atrium still smells of the expensive scented candles on display but the shop floor is punctuated with reminders of the health crisis, from the stickers on the ground to signs by the escalators advising shoppers to “keep eight steps between you and the next customer”. Initially only 270 shoppers will be allowed into the cavernous store at once – less than half of the store’s usual capacity.There are other changes too. If you are in the market to buy a new sofa or bed you will have to use a disposable hygiene cover before making yourself comfortable. Similarly if a pair of shoes catches your eye, you will need to wait for a spot on the socially distanced banquettes and wear disposable popsocks before trying them on.“Customers will need to need to get used to some of the new ways of shopping,” advises Michel, who says customers are encouraged to use the hand sanitiser dotted around its store every 20 minutes if they want to touch things safely. “We aren’t encouraging customers to try on fashion: if you want to buy a dress and don’t know if you are a size 12 or 14, then buy both and return one if you need to.”After missing out on 12 weeks of trading, including a glorious sun-soaked May – which would have meant a rush on summer dresses, shorts and sandals – next week’s reprieve is thin gruel for department stores and fashion retailers which are the backbone of our shopping centres.Richard Lim, who runs the consultancy firm Retail Economics, said: “The big thing is no one really knows how consumers are going to react. I think they will continue to prioritise spending on the things they need, but they are also desperate to get out so … there might be an initial bump in footfall.”The other issue, Lim suggests, is whether consumer expectations of the high street will marry up with the reality as queues, one-way systems and physical distancing wardens threaten to squeeze the fun out of shopping – potentially sending them back online. “There might just be a gap between what people expect and what it actually is like,” he says.Michel says customers have been writing to her asking when their local John Lewis will reopen and is optimistic that there will be a section of the public eager to shop for pleasure again. “I think people just want a normal life,” she says. “However, we are also conscious that some of our customers either might not feel safe or still are not allowed to leave their home yet.”With countries emerging from lockdown at different speeds and no clear pattern of recovery emerging, retailers are taking a step into the unknown. But Michel adds: “You can only control what you can control. This is a reawakening of the high street and British communities and isn’t just about shopping.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aab64174d8d7869dab7c7e84dd3a68ee38155c28/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=941844682a621b6db90fd7b3b8ccd8a7","title":"oxford black professors cecil rhodes british empire","story":"The city is strewn with tributes to the great of the British empire. The devastation they wreaked is routinely forgottenThe toppling of Edward Colston certainly made for a dramatic scene. The frantic energy of large crowds cheering while the statue plunged into the river in Bristol signalled the release of pent-up tension accumulated during a pandemic and widespread anti-racism protests.Within 48 hours, Oxford was seized by the same zeal. More than 1,000 people gathered on the city’s high street to call for the removal of the statue commemorating the notorious Victorian imperialist Cecil John Rhodes. It was a coordinated, peaceful and impassioned protest about the statue and about structural racism in Britain.\u0026nbspWhen it was my turn to address the crowd, I introduced myself as one of about seven black professors (official statistics are not available) at the University of Oxford, to simultaneous cheer and shock. I proceeded to say that I am an angry black man, fully aware of the ugly stereotype that accompanies this image – hot-blooded, impervious to reason and unworthy of serious engagement – particularly when talking about matters of racial injustice.But how could I not be angry? Like many other black people in the UK and around the world, I witnessed the brutal torture and killing of George Floyd with outrage and revulsion. Outrage and revulsion at the long legacy of structural and institutional racism that has killed, exploited, subjugated and silenced so many black people in the United States, in Britain and in former white-settler colonies.It is this same outrage at institutional racism that ignited the Rhodes Must Fall (RMF) campaign in South Africa in early 2015. That protest rapidly became transnational, announcing itself in Oxford by asking uncomfortable questions about my university’s past.A former imperial training ground, Oxford is strewn with tributes to the great men of the British empire, who have portraits, busts, engravings, statues and even buildings dedicated to their memory. In contrast, the histories of conquest, famine and dispossession that these men left in their wake are routinely forgotten.RMF drew attention to this iconography as part of a varied agenda that included two additional aims: reforming the Eurocentric curriculums that dominate the university’s teaching and addressing the underrepresentation and inadequate welfare provision for black and minority-ethnic staff and students at Oxford. However, it did not take long before all focused on the removal of the Rhodes statue at Oriel College.\u0026nbspI was a PhD student in Oxford at that time as well as a founding member of our chapter of RMF. As a Zimbabwean, it was difficult for me to view Rhodes simply as a man with odious views compared with our contemporary standards, as if it were his words alone and not his actions that were under scrutiny.Rhodes’ statue, then, is no mere physical artefact. It is imbued with a noxious history. Its presence at Oriel College reframes Rhodes’ conquest as munificence to the university and fails to recognise the exploitation of African labour from which his estate was built. It belongs in a museum, where it can be properly historicised. More importantly, in 2015 and now, the calls for the removal of such statues open up discussions about how we talk about the dynamics of race and racism, inclusion and exclusion, and being and belonging in Britain.\u0026nbspInitial responses to RMF were hostile, infantilising and casually racist. The Conservative politician and Oriel College alumnus Daniel Hannan disparaged RMF as “cretinous”, dismissed its demands as “facile”, and said that students in the movement were “too dim” to be at university. Disappointingly, the otherwise astute and justly celebrated Cambridge professor, Mary Beard, argued that RMF is “a dangerous attempt to erase the past” and suggested that minority students should be empowered to look at the statue “with a cheery and self-confident sense of un-batterability”.Will Hutton, the principal of Hertford College at Oxford, reminded RMF students that were it not for the legacies of the British empire, South Africa would descend into “unaccountable despotism” as embodied by then president, Jacob Zuma. Revealingly, apart from a tokenistic nod to Nelson Mandela, Hutton made no acknowledgment of Africans shaping their own political destiny, and seemingly held no conception of Africans as historical agents. As for the upper echelons of Oxford University’s leadership, the chancellor Lord Patten said that students unable to embrace Rhodes “should think about being educated elsewhere”.\u0026nbspBehind the spectacle of toppling a statue, RMF gained significant traction in the university’s student and faculty body, owing to the hard, behind-the-scenes work of a great many student activists. It is a bitter irony then that, for all the exaltation of peaceful protest and deliberative democracy, Oriel College refused to remove the statue as it risked losing £100m in donor gifts from wealthy alumni.Four years later, we have an opportunity to engage in a more mature and honest conversation about race in Britain. The removal of the Rhodes statue would be a powerful gesture of public accountability and it would allow a good-faith discussion about institutional racism in my university as a small part of much broader demands for racial justice and equality in British society.Numerous writers – the likes of Reni Eddo-Lodge, Afua Hirsch, Akala, Emma Dabiri, David Olusoga and Kehinde Andrews – have already done much hard work in articulating and contextualising the black experience in Britain. Anti-racist activists are channelling years of anger and pain into coordinated protests about Britain’s past and present. When the righteous fury and indignation over the present moment begins to simmer down, the messy work of challenging racism in all its structural, institutional and interpersonal guises must continue. But, this time, it will have a greater critical mass.\u0026nbsp• Simukai Chigudu is associate professor of African politics at the University of Oxford"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/758eca8a0b1c865b900c76b16d8d2f9733606500/0_371_6139_3685/master/6139.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e8f629e6b3e7c29ab952031fbe55ff74","title":"windrush generation justioce","story":"Anthony Bryan’s ordeal was about to be dramatised in a BBC drama, Sitting in Limbo. Then the phone rangJust as trailers for the BBC’s Windrush drama Sitting in Limbo were released at the start of this month, Anthony Bryan, who was wrongly imprisoned for five weeks after mistakenly being classified as an illegal immigrant, and whose story is dramatised in the film, received an interim offer of compensation from the Home Office. It was two and a half years after officials first realised they had made an error, and more than two years since the then prime minister, Theresa May first apologised for the Home Office’s mistakes. The compensation letter came exactly a week before the film was due to go out on television, and the timing of its arrival made him very thoughtful.A few days before Sitting in Limbo was broadcast, emails and calls started coming from the private office of the home secretary, Priti Patel, asking if Bryan would join a video call with her just an hour before the film went out. The home secretary is “actively thinking” about “giving a voice” to the Windrush generation, one email read, “and feels it vitally important to hear directly from affected members of the community, such as Mr Bryan”.Bryan felt sceptical about the timing of this invitation, and declined. Meanwhile Home Office staff were pestering the film’s makers to let them have an early preview – without success.These are standard Home Office damage-limitation manoeuvres, without any effective action to address the underlying problem. (And none of the other 30 Windrush claimants being supported by the North Kensington Law Centre, which has been helping Bryan, received compensation offers this month or had invitations to have phone calls with the home secretary, staff there told me.)Clearly the unfolding Black Lives Matter protests and the focus on Britain’s own difficulties with racism are making ministers particularly anxious to be seen to be doing the right thing on Windrush. They will be uneasily aware that not enough has been done to put things right. This is not a centuries-old problem that can be shrugged off as history, but the direct consequence of hostile environment measures that remain a central part of government policy.Of course, giving people a voice and listening is great, but much careful listening has already been done, and those affected by the scandal have for months been saying that now is the time to move on to action. A forensic 275-page analysis of what went wrong, based on detailed interviews with hundreds of those affected, was submitted to the Home Office in March. One of the key recommendations made by its author, Wendy Williams, was a call for a full review of the government’s “hostile environment” measures.But none of the policies that caused the Windrush scandal have been repealed, and Patel has made no commitment to reverse them. She tweeted new apologies as the programme was broadcast, lamenting the “unimaginable suffering endured by the Windrush generation”, but seems to have shown little interest in looking again at the structure of immigration legislation, which continues to cause so much suffering to thousands of people living entirely legally in the UK. In this regard, her stance echoes that of Nick Timothy, May’s former special adviser, and one of the key architects of the hostile environment, who last week breezily asserted that it was a “sensible” policy. He added that he was “certainly never warned” that there was a cohort of people who might get trapped in its embrace because they were unable to prove that they were living in the UK legally.Both of these points are highly questionable. After all the life-shattering problems the policies have caused, “sensible” seems a peculiar word to have chosen. They deliberately made life impossible for tens of thousands of people without documentation, introducing workplace immigration checks, and eligibility checks for healthcare, bank accounts, pensions, driving licences, rental contracts and benefits. It was the hostile environment that caused Bryan to get the sack from his job as a decorator, and saw him formally categorised as an illegal resident (despite having lived in London since arriving as an eight-year-old in 1965), arrested, detained and booked on a flight back to Jamaica, a country he hadn’t visited in more than 50 years.The hostile environment policies introduced new levels of spite into society the government set up the National Allegations Database, designed to make it easier for people to make tip-offs about immigration offenders to the Home Office.But it’s not even clear that these “sensible” measures have succeeded in their stated goal of addressing illegal immigration, as a handful of reports from the National Audit Office, the Borders and Immigration Inspectorate and the Home Affairs select committee concluded. What is clear is that large numbers of people who came to the UK legally, but who struggle to prove their status, are still being denied healthcare, formal employment and stable housing the policies institutionalise cruelty and drive people underground.Timothy’s assertion that he was never warned is contradicted by so much evidence that it feels disingenuous. His own department’s impact assessments warned that these policies could hurt people who had been in the UK for decades, but who had no documentation. Every migration and race organisation united to warn that racially discriminatory consequences would follow. A Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants lawyer remembers a junior immigration minister rolling his eyes at her warnings when she gave evidence in parliament. They were warned they just didn’t want to listen, she says. Timothy’s comments matter because the government continues to cling on to these cruel policies in spite of their damaging impact on so many, including thousands of the key workers who have been supporting Britain throughout the pandemic. The hostile environment also gave us the NHS surcharge in 2015, which, until a sudden U-turn last month, required doctors and care workers to pay for the right to access the care they were providing, and which they were already paying for through taxation. It has also increased visa charges so exponentially that families are pushed into destitution as they try to pay recurring immigration costs. Many are forced into illegality because they cannot afford the exorbitant cost of regularising their status.The Home Office has spent two years in a legal battle over whether the rent to right policy – which requires landlords to check on tenants’ immigration status – is racially discriminatory. The high court said it was the court of appeal agreed it could be, but ruled that the scheme was nevertheless “justified” a new appeal is under way. In her review into what caused Windrush, Williams makes it clear that officials should be actively educating themselves. The department’s failings on Windrush demonstrate an “institutional ignorance and thoughtlessness towards the issue of race and the history of the Windrush generation” that is “consistent with some elements of the definition of institutional racism”, she concluded. The scandal was able to happen, she added “because of the public’s and officials’ poor understanding of Britain’s colonial history … and the history of black Britons”.Two years ago, the then home secretary, Sajid Javid, promised to review the immigration system to ensure it was working in a compassionate, fair and humane way we are still waiting for that review. Only 60 people have received Windrush compensation payments – which is why last-minute invitations to video chats with the home secretary do not feel welcome.• Amelia Gentleman is a  reporter.

I didn’t realise how much I had missed the sight of small persons exploding through the gate at home time until a handful returned this week. One more baby step, perhaps, towards normality.But the truth is, children’s lives are not really back to normal and will not be for some time. Talk to parents, and the stories come spilling out: of angry children, sad children, bewildered children, who have only just got used to lockdown and are now thrown off balance all over again by emerging from it. This week I spoke to the mother of a seven-year-old who burst into tears at the idea of going back to school, because she was terrified of getting coronavirus and dying, and another whose toddler is so unsettled by returning to his old nursery after three months off that he won’t sleep in his cot.Children are sticklers for routine, and like to know what’s coming, but we can no longer tell them with any certainty. It’s stressful enough for grown adults, so every parent will wonder about the psychological impact of growing up under this shadow. Will the millions of children born or raised in a pandemic shake off their strangely disjointed early lives when it’s over, or will there be longer lasting effects for the Covid-19 kids?The cross-party House of Commons petitions committee has been trying, in a fascinating set of hearings on family life in lockdown, to shed some light on that curiously under-examined question. The Maternal Mental Health Alliance’s Alain Gregoire testified to a huge increase in mental health problems among new mothers, which should sadly have been predictable. Imagine the loneliness of maternity leave with no grandparents swooping in to take the baby for a bit, no cafes to hang out in, no playgroups for finding others in the same boat and clinging to them. He would, he said, also “anticipate greater difficulties among young children who in the near future will be attending nurseries” after months of parents having to manage children with emotional or behavioural problems at home, without expert help from school or nursery.Over half of adoptive parents surveyed by Adoption UK, meanwhile, reported greater anxiety, distress and challenging behaviour among their children, whose traumatic early lives can make them unusually sensitive to change. But while ministers are now finally making plans to help children catch up academically, the government has said little about coping with the emotional and behavioural aftershocks of the pandemic, even as mental health professionals are bracing themselves for a tsunami of post-pandemic referrals.It’s obvious from the unemployment figures that child poverty will soar without some major intervention we know too that the gap between rich and poor children’s attainment will widen while schools are closed, thanks to studies on how disadvantaged children slide backwards even during the long summer holidays.But it’s harder to gauge the impact on children’s mental health, which was more fragile than anyone would have liked even before the pandemic. The work is starting – the Nuffield Foundation has launched a research project on the changing face of early childhood in a pandemic, the children’s commissioner, Anne Longfield, is on the case, and several academic studies are underway – but there are precious few precedents for children in developed countries losing this big a chunk of their lives down a black hole.There will of course be lucky families, brought closer by the intimacy of lockdown. It has transformed the landscape of fatherhood, giving new dads who can work from home far more time to bond with their babies. Several friends with teenagers confess to a bittersweet nostalgia for lockdown, which has bought time with restless offspring they wouldn’t otherwise have had. Denied the company of their friends, even surly 15-year-olds may eventually be bored enough to talk to their parents, although the days of hanging out as a family are ending now as teens seize on the easing of lockdown to reclaim more freedom than the rules would strictly allow.But while one lost summer feels like a tragedy to teenagers, it may turn out to have been more critical for toddlers, now missing out on an entire developmental stage’s worth of learning to share, play and listen with other toddlers, which is half the battle in getting ready for school. For other children too small to understand exactly what’s happening but old enough to have soaked up their parents’ anxiety and grief, there will be consequences. By all means get the schools back, as soon as safely possible. But don’t imagine that will be anything like enough."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6202afaeebfaf58a09eb56b6712cf984641dd419/143_680_994_596/master/994.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1293aec71f3e76edd88d17f9fd6fbeb8","title":"sarah squirm funniest things","story":"The New Yorker comedian, illustrator and gross-out merchant on the things that make her laughI’ve never seen her live, but I remember watching a Joan Rivers standup special for the first time and literally thinking she was magic.Jackass’s “Poo-Cano” in which Dave England paints his butt to blend in to a diorama of a scenic countryside, and then starts explosively shitting upwards into the air, creating, famously, a “Poop Volcano”.

With the summer holidays rapidly approaching, we are calling on the government to urgently start a conversation with local authorities and schools to provide clarity on what exactly it is proposing to help children to catch up on any schoolwork they may have missed out on during lockdown.”Local authorities maintain more than half of England’s state primary schools, and retain important safeguarding roles, making them potentially important partners in extra summer activities.Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union (NEU), said: “We have not had any briefings from the Department for Education about the catch-up plan – we suspect that a lot of civil servants are running around madly at the moment trying desperately to stitch something together that sounds feasible.“The problem is of the government’s own making Boris Johnson and Gavin Williamson relied on the false hope that social distancing would be relaxed by now, so that primary schools could then reopen to all children. This was always unrealistic.”The NEU has published its own recovery plan calling for councils to offer summer holiday clubs for children and young people, with those eligible for free school meals funded by the government.School leaders say that with only a few weeks remaining until the end of the school year, there are logistical difficulties in vetting staff and arranging sites for any summer schools to take place.Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “It’s quite a big ask to do that in a short space of time. There will be some examples of schools where various activities have taken place over the summer, but there won’t be a tradition of catch-up classes in the summer holidays.”Barton warned that a major difficulty will be in ensuring that it benefits pupils who need it most: “The risk with anything in the summer is that the children who come to those are perhaps those who least need those activities.”Emma Knights, chief executive of the National Governance Association (NGA), which represents school governors, said it has been asking the DfE about the provision of summer activity programmes for several weeks.“As well as targeted catch-up tuition, NGA is in support of a broader programme of summer activities which would be run by local authorities, charities, youth services and a range of other providers, but this needs to be properly funded by the government.“We recognise that finding the staff and resources to organise and deliver these activities, and within the Covid-19 guidance, may not be practical in the short time remaining before the summer holidays. Time is of the essence,” Knights said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/935c15a6be288719aee1466ca2d443248a6fb029/136_0_5705_3424/master/5705.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=04dfedb7fa7c4116072f0c2885526a01","title":"climate worst case scenarios clouds scientists global heating","story":"Modelling suggests climate is considerably more sensitive to carbon emissions than thoughtWorst-case global heating scenarios may need to be revised upwards in light of a better understanding of the role of clouds, scientists have said.Recent modelling data suggests the climate is considerably more sensitive to carbon emissions than previously believed, and experts said the projections had the potential to be “incredibly alarming”, though they stressed further research would be needed to validate the new numbers.Modelling results from more than 20 institutions are being compiled for the sixth assessment by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which is due to be released next year.“That is a very deep concern,” Johan Rockström, the director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, said. “Climate sensitivity is the holy grail of climate science. It is the prime indicator of climate risk. For 40 years, it has been around 3C. Now, we are suddenly starting to see big climate models on the best supercomputers showing things could be worse than we thought.”Worst-case projections in excess of 5C have been generated by several of the world’s leading climate research bodies, including the UK Met Office’s Hadley Centre and the EU’s Community Earth System Model.Timothy Palmer, a professor in climate physics at Oxford University and a member of the Met Office’s advisory board, said the high figure initially made scientists nervous. “It was way outside previous estimates. People asked whether there was a bug in the code,” he said. “But it boiled down to relatively small changes in the way clouds are represented in the models.”The role of clouds is one of the most uncertain areas in climate science because they are hard to measure and, depending on altitude, droplet temperature and other factors, can play either a warming or a cooling role. For decades, this has been the focus of fierce academic disputes.Previous IPCC reports tended to assume that clouds would have a neutral impact because the warming and cooling feedbacks would cancel each other out. But in the past year and a half, a body of evidence has been growing showing that the net effect will be warming. This is based on finer resolution computer models and advanced cloud microphysics.“Clouds will determine humanity’s fate – whether climate is an existential threat or an inconvenience that we will learn to live with,” said Palmer. “Most recent models suggest clouds will make matters worse.”In a recent paper in the journal Nature, Palmer explains how the new Hadley Centre model that produced the 5+C figure on climate sensitivity was tested by assessing its accuracy in forecasting short-term weather. This testing technique had exposed flaws in previous models, but in the latest case, the results reinforced the estimates. “The results are not reassuring – they support the estimates,” he wrote. He is calling for other models to be tested in a similar way.The IPCC is expected to include the 5+C climate sensitivity figure in its next report on the range of possible outcomes. Scientists caution that this is a work in progress and that doubts remain because such a high figure does not fit with historical records.Catherine Senior, head of understanding climate change at the Met Office Hadley Centre, said more studies and more data were needed to fully understand the role of clouds and aerosols.“This figure has the potential to be incredibly alarming if it is right,” she said. “But as a scientist, my first response is: why has the model done that? We are still in the stage of evaluating the processes driving the different response.”While acknowledging the continued uncertainty, Rockström said climate models might still be underestimating the problem because they did not fully take into account tipping points in the biosphere.“The more we learn, the more fragile the Earth system seems to be and the faster we need to move,” he said. “It gives even stronger argument to step out of this Covid-19 crisis and move full speed towards decarbonising the economy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38850b6b7c05f5cf36293e5656f8566f0be36995/0_400_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=6000\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=622311e85ce185ce352d3acc327e3ab7 6000w","title":"gone with the wind hollywood racism","story":"The temporary removal of the Oscar-winning drama is renewing a conversation about the film industry’s murky past and its effect on society at largeThere is a scene in 1974’s underground blaxploitation-era film The Spook Who Sat by the Door where a group of black militants comically mock the ubiquity of Gone With the Wind-like imagery that is so embedded within American culture. As the others laugh out loud at the performative racism essential to this historical representation, the film’s main character, Freeman, expounds on the larger meaning of such things: “You have just played out the American Dream. And now we’re going to turn it into a nightmare.”The nightmare that Freeman spoke about is upon us. As the streets pulsate with protest following the killing of George Floyd and numerous other acts of police violence and racial hostility, those restless souls, having been cooped up due to Covid-19 in recent months, have found their voice. Demands for structural and institutional change abound. Corporations, professional sports leagues, brands, and other business and cultural entities have been issuing statements left and right, while others have taken actions that may have been unimaginable in previous times.One of those actions involves HBO temporarily pulling Gone With the Wind from its recently launched HBO Max lineup. With a statement which articulates that the film’s “depictions are certainly counter to WarnerMedia’s values” HBO said the civil war epic is not gone forever but that it will return with new material added for the purpose of providing context and addressing the film’s historical shortcomings.For years now activists have been attempting to cancel the Confederate flag and eliminate other monuments to the fallen Confederacy, along with removing the names of former slave owners and white supremacists that continue to adorn buildings on various school and college campuses, among numerous other attempts to destroy the legacy of the slaveholding south that was supposed to have died with the end of the civil war. We can now add films celebratory of this defeated legacy like Gone With the Wind to the list as well.Of course there will be those who cry foul, who suggest that this is nothing more than politically correct censorship. Once again though such voices will simply be doing what James Brown once described as, “talkin’ loud and sayin’ nothing”. Removing those things that honor and celebrate racists is not erasing history. Instead this is holding history accountable, while providing necessary context.The south supposedly lost the civil war. There is an overused cliche which suggests that the winners write history. Is this true? If it is, then why do all these relics of the losing side still circulate in this society so many years after the civil war ended? The point is, films like Gone With the Wind should have been held accountable a long time ago. Further, Hollywood’s role in disseminating such demeaning, dehumanized, stereotypical images can no longer be ignored.Gone With the Wind is a descendant of DW Griffith’s The Birth of a Nation from 1915, the foundation that American cinema is built upon, a film that screened at the White House, prompting President Woodrow Wilson to declare it “history written in lightning”. It was celebrated for its technological mastery of visual storytelling, yet its narrative is nothing more than racist propaganda. The heroes of the film are the Ku Klux Klan who ride in at the appropriate climactic moment to save the day. The Birth of a Nation is at the root, so if racism is at the root, the fruit that emerges from this tainted root can only be the fruit of racism.Further, American cinema helped to spread the fictional “lost cause” narrative that has attempted to rewrite history while transforming the terrorism of slavery into something much less real, though much more palatable to certain white audiences. The idea of a “lost cause” originally emerged in the period after Reconstruction. An overt attempt to erase the savage brutality of slavery during the age of Jim Crow white supremacy, a revisionist history began to emerge which suggested that though the south had lost the civil war, the fight itself had been a noble cause that was predicated on an attempt to preserve a cherished way of life. That “way of life” might also be known as slavery.One can see the resonance of the ahistorical propaganda of films like The Birth of a Nation and Gone With the Wind in the current popularity of a more contemporary version of the lost cause narrative as represented by 2011’s The Help, a film that became the most watched title on Netflix as the recent backdrop of street protests dominated the news. Viola Davis, who received a best actress nomination for her role in The Help, stated in 2018 that she regretted doing the film, while Bryce Dallas Howard, who appears as the cartoonish racist villain in The Help, responded to the film’s renewed popularity by describing it as “a fictional story told through the perspective of a white character” which was “created by predominantly white storytellers”. While The Help is not Gone With the Wind, it is another in a long line of more recent films where the trope of the white savior is celebrated, while the black characters on screen are used as racial props so as to bolster themes of benevolence, generosity and overall white goodness.Long before Viola Davis’s Oscar nomination in The Help, though, Hattie McDaniel would be the first black actor in Hollywood to be nominated and win in 1940 for her role as the dutiful servant Mammy in Gone With the Wind. McDaniel was not allowed to attend the film’s 1939 premiere in Atlanta because of her race. And though she would make history at the 1940 Oscars ceremony at the Ambassador hotel in Los Angeles she was forced to sit in a segregated “colored section” separate from the white actors in an area created specifically for her during the evening’s event. McDaniel’s role in the film was such a fundamentally stereotypical representation of white society’s desired way to see black women that her character’s name, Mammy, came to be descriptive of that particularly pervasive stereotype. The sassy, cantankerous, asexual Mammy was a caricature of black womanhood and McDaniel was made to endure the implications of this caricature in the racist treatment she received on and off screen.As we reconsider so many things in this moment of reflection on the debilitating legacy of white supremacy, movies cannot escape our critical focus. Many mistakenly assume that because numerous actors and other creative figures in Hollywood are vocally liberal that Hollywood itself is liberal by default. This is not now, nor has it ever been the case. There are liberal people in Hollywood for sure, but Hollywood itself is far from liberal. The history of Hollywood is filled with examples of racism, perhaps none more lethal than consistent toxic stereotypes like Mammy and others that have polluted the minds of those who accept Hollywood fiction as historical fact.It was also The Birth of a Nation that introduced the image of the violent, threatening black male beast and the menacing black thug. This was a caricature that would appear for decades throughout numerous movies – like Clint Eastwood’s Dirty Harry franchise, for instance – and on television – pick your favorite cop show. The black thug was not the protagonist and in many cases he may not have even had a name. Yet the sheer volume of these beast-like images over time created the impression that black masculinity and violence were inherently linked and this needed to be put in check. In these instances, the black man is often represented as an out of control animal intent on wreaking havoc. Meanwhile the LAPD, in collaboration with Hollywood, had a hand in shaping its own image and the overall image of cops in the larger culture by assisting in the production of a television show like Dragnet, the blueprint for future cop shows. Many of the ideas that society holds about heroic cops came from fictional media representations like this. In real life, though, figures such as Rodney King, Michael Brown and numerous others have often been described in a beast-like manner whenever a police officer explained why it was necessary to brutally beat, shoot or choke to death another unarmed black man. The legacy of this brand of Hollywood racism can also be heard in statements about “super predators” as well as quotes like “when the looting starts, the shooting starts”. In a time when the washing of one’s hands has taken on added significance, it is Hollywood’s hands that are dirty.With all of this in mind, when we consider the role that streaming plays in the contemporary media landscape, perhaps it is time for a ratings system when it comes to older movies such as Gone With the Wind? What if a movie like this granted an “O” rating – “O” for offensive – when the film in question is steeped in the kind of racism that Gone With the Wind projects? “O” seems appropriate only because the “R” that could signify “racist” is already taken. This way no one could say that the film had been banned, but anyone who chose to watch it would at least potentially have to contemplate what it means to consume such inherently racist material.That said, these older images from Hollywood’s past do represent an actual history. And this is a history that should not be suppressed. Yes, America’s business is “all out in the street”, as they say, currently exposed for the world to see. There is value in people seeing just how overtly racist Hollywood was at one time so as to understand what that means both then and now. Attempting to erase the past is never a good thing. On the other hand, hiding behind weak arguments about how the film can be enjoyed without indulging the racism of its time is especially disingenuous. Films like Gone With the Wind – and to be clear there are decades of racist films maybe not as popular but which have also contributed to America’s especially problematic depiction of black people – need not be banned, but these images do not need to be elevated either. To watch Gone With the Wind without this knowledge is to miss the necessary context that is needed to properly understand the film’s reprehensible role in furthering racism far beyond 1940. To add important information about the racial legacy of this and other films is a step in the right direction."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83c9c057c2a32f471026a7db1f79d3f9965c420b/0_2554_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c5e0471d734e1fd6511880b6e7c00f5","title":"fishnchips and 99s yotam ottolenghi recipes for a british summer","story":"Three clever plays on British summer recipes: a cucumber sandwich reinvented as a salad, a funky version of fish‘n’chips, and a homemade 99 ice-creamI sat down to define a British summer, and here’s what came to mind. It means long daylight hours and a breezy cheer. It means a house full of open windows and a bottle of Pimm’s. It means that one pair of linen trousers and those open-toe shoes. And it most definitely means outdoor dining, come what may. A British summer is what’s on the agenda for most of us here in the UK, and perhaps those rays of sunshine coming our way allude to a very British summer full of hope.\u0026nbspThis variation on the classic is a massive departure from tradition, but I think it works pretty well: the sweet potato replaces regular potatoes, the fish crust features buckwheat and is gluten-free, and the mayo is actually toum, a fiery Arabic whipped garlic sauce. Swap the toum for some mayonnaise or yoghurt, if you prefer, but it does make the dish super-special. You’ll end up with a little more of it than you need, so keep the excess in a sealed jar in the fridge, to smear on grilled meat or vegetables.For the fish4 cod fillets, boneless and skinless (560g)700ml sunflower oil, for deep frying55g cornflour55g rice flour50g buckwheat flour\u0026nbsp2 tbsp black and white sesame seeds, toasted185ml sparkling waterFor the chips1 red chilli, cut into thin slices, seeds and all (10g net weight)2 tbsp apple cider vinegarSalt and black pepper3 sweet potatoes (650g), unpeeled, cut lengthways into 4 wedges (or 6, if they’re on the large side)75ml olive oil10g chives, finely chopped (about 3¼ tbsp)For the toum90g garlic cloves (eg, about 2 whole heads), cloves separated and peeled3½ tbsp lemon juice230ml sunflower oil, or another neutral oil1 tbsp ice-cold waterHeat the oven to 240C (220C fan)465Fgas 9. Put the chillies, vinegar and a tiny pinch of salt in a small bowl and leave to pickle while you get on with everything else.Bring a small saucepan of water to a boil on a medium-high heat, add half the peeled garlic cloves and blanch for 45 seconds – you don’t want them to soften, just to take off their “garlicky” edge. Drain, run under cold water to stop them cooking further, then pat dry and set aside. Use a small, sharp knife to cut the remaining unblanched garlic in half lengthways, and remove the white inner cores. Put both the blanched and unblanched garlic in a food processor, add a quarter-teaspoon of salt and two and a half tablespoons of lemon juice, then blitz, for about two or three minutes, until very smooth and aerated stop a couple of times to scrape down the bowl. With the motor running, very slowly drizzle in a third of the sunflower oil, followed by a tablespoon of ice-cold water. Repeat with another third of sunflower oil, then add the remaining tablespoon of lemon juice and, finally, the last of the sunflower oil. You should be left with a white, fluffy and homogenised mixture. Set aside (or refrigerate if you’re making the toum ahead of time).Put the sweet potatoes on a large oven tray lined with baking paper, add two tablespoons of olive oil, half a teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper, and toss to coat. Roast for 25 minutes, or until softened and nicely coloured.While the potatoes are roasting, make the fish. Pat dry the cod fillets and season them with half a teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper. Pour the sunflower oil into a large, high-sided, nonstick saute pan on a medium-high heat and, while it’s heating up, make the batter.In a large bowl, whisk the flours, sesame seeds and three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt, then slowly whisk in the sparkling water until you have a thick, smooth and pourable batter.Drop a little bit of batter into the oil to test it’s hot enough: it should immediately start to sizzle and take on a bit of colour. Dip one cod fillet in the batter until nicely coated, then drop it straight into the hot oil, then repeat with a second fillet. Fry for seven minutes, turning halfway, until lightly golden and cooked through, then transfer to a tray lined with absorbent paper and repeat with the remaining two fillets.In a small bowl, mix the chives, remaining three tablespoons of oil and a small pinch of salt.When ready to serve, arrange the fish on a large platter. Arrange the potato wedges to one side, spoon all but a tablespoon of the chive oil over the potatoes, and follow with the chilli and its liquid. Transfer the toum to a bowl, spoon over the last tablespoon of chive oil and nestle on the platter as well. Serve warm.This is a play on a traditional cucumber sandwich, but in salad form, incorporating its three key components: cucumber, bread and butter.

Fertile soil is disappearing up to 100 times faster than it should be, largely due to farming methods such as excessive ploughing and the use of synthetic fertilisers.Regenerative agriculture is a type of farming that aims to reverse this process, and rebuild soil fertility. Without good soil, the nutrition of our food drops, as does the surrounding bioersity, causing further environmental damage.Regenerative farms are few and far between, however, and need our support. We can help reduce soil loss while eating conventional produce by ersifying the foods we eat, especially by eating more perennial crops, including tree fruits, asparagus, rhubarb and berries, which grow back year after year, building soil health.Berries may be a perennial harvest, but they also perish very quickly. Keep them fresh by rinsing in a cup of water mixed with three tablespoons of vinegar, dry well and transfer to a container on top of a cloth. Even if your fruit does soften, though, don’t waste it: it’s still perfect for compote, crumble or pudding.This is an all-time summer favourite of mine and so quick to make. I like to experiment with different seasonal fillings, using up whatever fruits I have available. Right now, berries are plentiful, but later in the summer, when apricots and peaches are in season, I like to add them, too. Summer pudding is best made the day before you want to eat it, so the bread has time to soak up the juices and set. As a wholefood chef, I use wholemeal sourdough to line the pudding basin, which works surprisingly well, adding both flavour and nutrition. To create a good seal, I recommend removing the crusts from the bread, but rather than throwing them away or looking for another use for them, I turn them through the berries, which has the added benefit of bulking out the filling. You’ll need a one-litre pudding basin for this.6 slices stale bread500g mixed summer fruits (eg, raspberries, redcurrants, strawberries, blackberries …)50g honey½ lemon juicedClotted cream, to serveCut the crusts from the bread and cut them into small cubes. Put the berries, bread crusts, lemon juice, 50ml water and honey into a small pan, bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for two minutes.Lay one slice of bread in the base of a one-litre pudding basin, then run four more up the sides, overlapping them and press the joins firmly together, to seal – a dab of water will help. Fill the basin with the fruits, then cover with the final slice of bread, sealing it against the “walls”. Put a small plate and heavy weight on top, and refrigerate overnight.The next day, carefully turn the pudding out on to a plate and serve with plenty of cream."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16204996571abe5f3b0e2cb28631a8aaedb3bf95/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1cb6ceeaa596139cb2d304f1a50e2482","title":"favourite european championship euro 2020","story":"Whether it’s the first you remember, the first you attended or the tournament your team won, we want to hear about itWhat a weekend of football we had in store.

He was tall and strong, had preternatural balance and was lethal in the air. Dundalk should sign him immediately, said Malone. The player’s name was Jimmy Hasty.Another board member piped up. He had heard of Hasty, heard something fanciful – that the fellow had only one arm. Malone conceded this was true. Hasty had only one arm. But Dundalk should sign him, he said.The board did not often say no to its ebullient chairman but did so this time. We are not, Malone was told, in the business of freaks. Malone then revealed he had in fact already signed the player with a personal cheque. Jimmy Hasty was coming to Dundalk.Sixty years later the reverberations still ripple for Hasty’s family and for Dundalk, where the story of the one-armed striker is told and retold as something wondrous, something verging on fairytale. “The board weren’t happy but Jim Malone believed in Jimmy,” recalls John Murphy, 82, who captained the team in the early 60s. “We didn’t know what to expect.” Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https:audio.guim20200519-55307-gnl.fsof.200520.jf.MUGala1993.mp3 Malone badgered the board into fielding Hasty and on 20 November 1960 he made his debut in a home match at Oriel Park against Cork Celtic. Curiosity swelled the attendance. It seemed as if half of Dundalk turned up to watch.Hasty played a blinder. “He scored once and brought gasps of astonishment at his football skills,” notes the club’s official record. “His ability to ghost past defenders was greeted with disbelief. Nor was he just a scorer – he was the general of every attack, holding the ball until executing perfect passes to his colleagues.”Malone’s faith was vindicated, says Murphy. “Jimmy had brilliant balance and could score with both feet a brilliant header of the ball he had everything you’d want.”So began the reign of one of football’s most remarkable and overlooked players, a man who defied biology, inspired teammates, electrified spectators and touched sporting history – and then, one cold morning in Belfast, fell victim to a different, malignant arc of history.Hasty was born in 1936 in Sailortown, a multicultural dockland in north Belfast, a decade before that other prodigy, George Best, was born in east Belfast. He grew up playing on cinder pitches – possibly a key to his toughness – and aged 14 got a job at a mill. On his first day a machine snagged his left arm. It had to be amputated.The mill’s loss was football’s gain because Hasty learned to play again, first in junior leagues and then for Newry Town in Northern Ireland’s B ision. Malone, on a scouting mission, signed him on the spot. The contract vaulted Hasty 15 miles south of the border to Dundalk, a once-formidable force in the League of Ireland.Teammates marvelled at their new 6ft 1in striker. “It’s not easy to be a footballer with an arm missing, you use your arms an awful lot in running, movement, balance,” says Francie Callan, 85, who partnered Hasty up front. “But somehow you wouldn’t know he had only one arm.” Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https:audio.guim20200609-44994-gnl.fsof.20200610.ms.klein_p2.mp3 Opponents at first hesitated to tackle him but that changed after Hasty scored a flurry of goals in his first 10 games. One secret to his aerial dominance: grounding defenders with his stump. “He could lean on you with that stump so you couldn’t get off the ground, and the ref could be looking and see only a sleeve dangling,” recalls Murphy.Goals flowed, Dundalk moved up the table and the crowds swelled. “Everyone wanted to see the one-armed bandit,” says Murphy. “It was like the circus coming to town. He took the League of Ireland by the cobblers.”As a child Paddy Malone, son of the late chairman and himself a club stalwart, says he and other boys played football with an arm tucked in a sweater, the sleeve flapping, to emulate their hero. “We never considered that Jimmy Hasty had a disability, we just considered that he was a great player.”Hasty was affable and gregarious, happy to sign autographs and socialise with teammates. He was handsome, dapper and widely credited with “success with the ladies”.When Callan, the other striker, was grieving the death of a child to cot death he saw a sensitive side to his teammate. “Jimmy sent me a letter, a wonderful letter so full of love and feeling. I’ll never forget it.” Callan later passed the letter to another grieving parent who also found consolation in Hasty’s words.Though often sidelined through injury, Hasty scored 103 goals over six seasons. In 1963 Dundalk won the league, ending a 30-year wait. “He filled every ground in the League of Ireland. Attempts to mark him out of the game were doomed to failure – he could create goals and space for others,” records the club’s official history.Perhaps the only other one-armed player to surpass Hasty’s exploits was Héctor Castro, who played and scored for Uruguay in the 1930 World Cup final.Glory in Ireland did not lead to England, though there was a rumour Nottingham Forest considered buying Hasty. The transfer market was in its infancy and the missing arm deterred interest, says Des Casey, a Dundalk club administrator who later became vice-president of Uefa. “He was perceived to be severely handicapped.” Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https:audio.guim20200526-45122-gnl.FSOF.27052020.Polio_R128.mp3 The league title win yielded a European Cup tie against Zurich. Dundalk were overawed in the home leg, played in Dublin, and lost 3-0. They flew to Zurich for the second leg so deflated and depleted by injuries the joke was they should have gone to Lourdes.They almost got a miracle. Hasty set up a goal for Dermot Cross, scored a second goal himself and almost bagged a third with a shot against the crossbar from 15 yards. Dundalk ended up winning 2-1, so Zurich went through 4-2 on aggregate, but it was the first time an Irish team had won a match in Europe.Hasty grabbed other honours, such as sharing the League of Ireland top scorer of the year award, before retiring in the late 1960s.The Troubles were erupting around him in Belfast but he made a new life: married his childhood sweetheart, Margaret, had two sons, Paul and Martin, and got a job at a bookmakers.Just before 8am on 11 October 1974, Hasty – then aged 39 – was walking his usual route to work, down Brougham Street. A car stopped. A gunman got out and opened fire, hitting Hasty three times in the stomach. Witnesses said he staggered across the street and collapsed.It was a sectarian murder attributed to the Protestant Action Group, a cover name for the Ulster Volunteer Force. No one was ever charged. Lost Lives, a catalogue of people killed in the Troubles, lists Hasty as victim 1,205.“It was to spread fear to the Catholic community by shooting a well-known character,” says Paul Hasty, who was two years old when he lost his father. “It was a message that everyone’s a target. I think they knew what they were doing.”The murder devastated and impoverished the Hasty family. In Dundalk people wept. “It was the only time I saw my father cry,” says Paddy Malone. Fans packed in for a testimonial match to raise funds for the family, many paying well above the £3 entry fee, adds Malone, who helped man the turnstiles.If the killers are still alive Paul Hasty, now 48, wishes they would come forward for the sake of his mother, who is 81. “Just to say why. I’d like her to have some peace.”Jimmy Hasty did not die alone. A passerby, George Larmour, cradled him on the pavement and tried to comfort him as life ebbed away. In awful synchronicity, the IRA murdered Larmour’s brother John exactly 14 years later, on 11 October 1988. An off-duty policeman and amateur footballer, John was manning the counter at George’s ice cream shop. The gunman asked about flavours before shooting him four times.Hasty’s exploits faded into legend, the stuff of old men’s anecdotes, dusty match reports and grainy team portraits. If RTE ever had television footage, it was long scrubbed.Then, in 2015, Paul McClean, researching a documentary about Hasty for BBC Radio Ulster, received an email from Zurich. Clips from the 1963 game had been used in a Swiss TV news report – and survived. “There was Jimmy, and they flippin’ battered Zurich,” says McClean. “Seeing how Jimmy moved, everything came true.”Paul Hasty got to experience what he had thought impossible – watch his dad play football. “You knew it wasn’t a fairytale or made up,” he says. “It was fantastic. Like a hundred Christmases at once.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5c96740975a4b656f06e6b7c38b7728c05188d1/0_0_2953_1772/master/2953.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7dfec227751e3f8ba4acf754ad52b327","title":"fifa urges action against inequality qatar 2022 world cup","story":"The building of World Cup venues has, by some estimates, cost thousands of lives. Should we be sitting in these arenas watching football? Or tipping them into the harbour?If you want to be picky, you could say Raheem Sterling chose an ill-targeted metaphor in his statement this week on racial prejudice and the need for a step-change in football’s power structures.Comparing the spread of racism to the spread of Covid-19 is probably not the best way to change those minds most in need of changing. Let’s face it, a global Venn diagram of virus-deniers and bigotry-sceptics is likely to feature a fairly dense overlap, a concentration of people who don’t really think either of these things exist. You hear that? He just said racism is fake too! We’re home free!In the meantime it is interesting the current protests have centred on visible symbols of oppression, and specifically on statues. There has already been some pushback against this from those who find themselves suddenly eager students of 18th century naval merchant culture. But there is good sense in looking at these things again.Most obviously, statues of the ruling classes are made to be pulled down. Is there anything more tedious than being asked to marvel at the majesty of some tinpot local bigwig? How long is it necessary to keep on venerating someone anyway? For ever? Just for a while? When, oh frowning and austere pre-industrial entrepreneurs, will you be done with us?As for the idea pulling down a statue that celebrates a slave trader represents the beginning of the end of history, a first step towards tearing down Dickens and Churchill well, at some point you have to show a little faith, grow some rust-resistant copper-alloy balls, and say, yes, some things are simply bad. We can cope with this. The centre will hold.They are significant, these visible marks. Enslavement, the idea one person is simply a chattel, a lesser form of human, has been legislated away. It would, in my opinion, be illogical to suggest people who are alive now should personally apologise for its existence hundreds of years ago. But it is important to understand racial prejudice is a muscle memory of that same principle, an echo that will often go unheard to the naked ear, but is instead scaled back into everyday interactions, decisions, life chances. Getting rid of words, images and, yes, statues that spread that resonance well, that just seems as if it is basic good sense.With this in mind it is good football is talking about power, prejudice and representation, most notably in the form of Gianni Infantino, who has voiced Fifa’s support for an end to abuse and oppression. Football is the dominant popular culture, an arena that should, as Sterling says, be offering up its own plinths, its lighted windows, its platforms of power as something exemplary and uncorrupted.At which point it may just be a good moment to talk about the next World Cup. At a time when every executive office of footballing power is imploring us to consider society’s inequities, how does Qatar 2022 look these days?There isn’t much point in dressing this up now. Football is two years away from a tournament that is, among other things, a showcase for the glorious productivity of the Kafala system of labour. These working practices have been called a form of modern-day slavery by the International Trade Union Confederation, in conditions across the region that are at times “little more than prisons for workers” according to Amnesty International.Those gleaming, splendiferous World Cup venues, those repositories of sound and light, are also tributes to the efficiency of a bonded labour force of Bangladeshis, Nepalese, Indians and other migrant people employed to implement this vast global projection of power. Official figures suggest otherwise, but a counter-commentary of those who monitor the situation suggests there have been thousands of deaths along the way. Should we be sitting in these arenas watching football? Or tipping them into the harbour?It is worth noting Qatar introduced laws last year to diminish and, it is claimed, abolish the Kafala system, under which foreign workers are essentially tied to their employer, unable to seek another job in the country and often too dependent to leave. These new laws have been described as superficial. Only this week Amnesty revealed migrant workers had gone unpaid by a private Qatari company for up to seven months while building Al Bayt Stadium, unable to leave the job, unable to leave the country.This is not intended as a piece of whataboutery or a comparison with the scars and the significance of actual, forced, seagoing, murderous European slavery. This is not some ghastly race to find the greater horror. It is simply to point to the oddity of football’s apparent powerlessnesses as it asks itself what it can possibly do about oppression and prejudice as it speaks fine words – cheers, Gianni – about the imbalance of power. All the while preparing to shoot off en masse and bask in these glorious migrant-built structures, disposable monuments to a four-week show of power.What am I expecting to happen here? Instant cultural reforms? Everyone shakes hands and joins the TUC? Ruling elites to issue a tearful Instagram apology (“this has been a powerful personal journey”)? The best outcome is slow reform which, it seems, is already happening.I guess I am simply agreeing with Sterling when he says there are structural issues that need to be torn down, while also pointing out that he, as a footballer, is stuck right in the middle of this, a passenger in football’s own exploitative networks.As for those boarded-up statues, they are at least doing their job. They’re making us think about the past and also the present. Welcome, britches-clad men of destiny, welcome splendid new lighted bowls of Fifa, to the idea of the unintended signifier. We will look on you and marvel.

Not only does it open up a huge potential customer base – half the world’s population is now on social media – it also gives companies the perfect opportunity to build and retain loyalty among existing customers.Like all aspects of technology, social media is constantly evolving. So while a small business may have set up a Facebook or a Twitter account a few years back and thought that was a case of “job done”, new social media platforms such as TiKTok have been developed since then, while Instagram and YouTube have become vital parts of a holistic social media ecosystem.\u0026nbspBeyond the platforms themselves, trends have also changed in terms of what users want, how they interact with brands and what’s important to them. Customers have now become fans, emotional ties to brands are a thing and thought-leadership can make you an influencer. Content is still king, and shareability is vital.\u0026nbspBut as well as all this modern stuff – the basics are still important too.\u0026nbsp“On the high street you wouldn’t have a shopfront with a broken window, peeling paint, rubbish everywhere and goods randomly thrown on displays, and expect to thrive,” says PR and social media expert Mike Crutchley.As someone who helps businesses improve and overhaul their social media strategies, he says first impressions count.\u0026nbsp“Social media channels must be up to date with everything from posts to contact details and opening hours,” he says. “High-quality images and videos, as well as good grammar and spelling are as vital as creating engaging posts.”The tools that allow businesses to make this happen have never been more accessible, and there is now an opportunity to try some of them out free of charge. Customers of the website builder GoDaddy are currently receiving a complimentary 90-day premium subscription to the mobile app Over, which gives them access to simple templates for creating sleek and effective social media content.Sometimes the things that work best on social media are the simplest. You can have all the metrics and dashboards in the world, but if people don’t engage and share your original posts then you’re missing a huge potential source of customers.\u0026nbspWhen Dutch-born Londoner Annemarie Plas saw people in countries throughout Europe clapping for their healthcare workers she was inspired to help set up something similar in her adopted home, and so created clapforourcarers with GoDaddy.Scaling up quickly could well have proved a challenge, but with the astute use of social media things have gone from strength to strength.\u0026nbsp“I just put together a small image and posted it on my socials such as Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter, and sent it to all my UK friends by WhatsApp, I also made a small website and an Insta page,” says Plas.\u0026nbspHer efforts to spread the word were given a huge boost when her campaign was picked up by influencers such as the Beckhams and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, who shared it to their followers.\u0026nbspThe first clap happened on Thursday 26 March at 8pm and became a weekly event, being covered by the national media and circulated widely on social media too, right up to the final clap on 28 May.Although Plas has a background working for media agencies, she had neither the time nor staff support that other organisations might be able to draw upon. So she decided to keep things simple and made shareability a big part of her strategy.\u0026nbsp“I understood the importance of having simple and engaging messaging. I used a hashtag and made the image easy to share on any social channels.”Her simple and consistent messaging has resulted in the #clapforourcarers hashtag being shared more than 139,000 times on Instagram alone.\u0026nbsp“Some influencers get a bad reputation,” says Masha Zvereva, founder of Coding Blonde. She set up her blog back in 2015, when she was trying to learn some coding skills to make her more employable. She originally registered it with GoDaddy, which she then also used as a hosting provider.Through that blog, as well as Instagram and YouTube, Zvereva has amassed a loyal following and is now regarded as an influencer in the field of women in tech, entrepreneurship and personal growth.\u0026nbsp“Influencers can be perceived as fake, superficial, salesy etc, but what people don’t see is the hard work that goes behind being able to make a living off of this business model and growing your business,” she says.Quality content is paramount according to Zvereva. Whether you’re filming a video for YouTube or writing a thought leadership piece, it has to add value beyond simply advertising your skills to the wider world.\u0026nbsp“Anyone can become an influencer if they want to, but I’d recommend approaching it from the standpoint of adding value to an audience,” she says.\u0026nbsp“What’s the purpose behind your blog? How will you be impacting people’s lives and who is your target audience? And finally, why should it be you?”Many people might still associate social media in a business context purely with selling, but its importance when it comes to building a brand can’t be overstated.\u0026nbspThis is something Zaffrin and Brian O’Sullivan, co-founders of the vegan skincare company Five Dot Botanics set out to do well before their company launched.Establishing it on Instagram even before they had products to sell, they were able to develop a loyal audience.\u0026nbsp“Social media has allowed small brands like mine to build a brand. Historically it would not have been possible to launch a beauty brand without millions of pounds to acquire customers through marketing,” says Zaffrin.\u0026nbspBefore setting up those social channels though, their first move was to register a domain name and get a URL through GoDaddy. Then it was time to get the ball rolling with social media.\u0026nbspThe stories the O’Sullivans shared weren’t all about success, but about the challenges they were facing. This honesty helped create a situation where people were rooting for them. The couple were also able to get 600 people signed up to their newsletter email list so there was already an eager customer base waiting for when the products were ready.Once the social channels were up and running, the O’Sullivans set up an internet landing page using GoDaddy’s services – and they were in business.Social continues to be at the heart of their marketing. As well as using Instagram for brand-building, Zaffrin posts to Pinterest and Facebook, although she says the latter works best for business if you’re willing to put money behind it – paying for targeted ads, for example. Otherwise the other platforms can be effective without budget, simply by skilful use. Zaffrin uses LinkedIn to raise her business profile and publish articles, and is curious about TikTok, saying it is “one to watch”.\u0026nbsp“Our audience are our fans,” she says. “They root for our success, and our customers on social tell us every day what they think and what they want. We are constantly listening to them, whether they’re letting us know how they are using our products or coming up with ideas for new ones.”GoDaddy launched the #OpenWeStand initiative offering a number of free tools, widgets, resources and blogposts at OpenWeStand.org to help small businesses keep their digital doors open while their physical doors are closed. Over 50 companies have joined the cause, including Slack, Salesforce, PayPal, and more"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e9d011bed88817ae68ef5e2d7e02acb6907d7c1/245_219_4438_2664/master/4438.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5da37e78cc102673b9ba7140bd16f285","title":"blind date esther luke","story":"Esther, 32, doctor, and Luke, 30, civil servant, meet onlineWhat were you hoping for?My usual Lycra-clad type or someone different enough to make it interesting.First impressions?His bold shirt and lovely, confident smile. What did you talk about?Everything.

The traditional makeup artist’s safety net of working on makeup counters to supplement their freelance income (Bedassie works at MAC), is severely compromised. During lockdown, and even as some stores reopen, brands such as Bobbi Brown and Space NK have redeployed as many counter consultants as possible to offer live online consultations from home. But the opportunities for in-store artistry are, for now, on hold, as tester products are removed to reduce the spread of infection and in-store makeovers shelved to protect customers and staff. Measures like this mean that, for now at least, makeup artists have essentially been decommissioned. “That poses quite a serious threat to my livelihood,” says Bedassie, who seems less concerned for her safety than her ability to pay the rent.Even before brands began struggling to stay afloat, few industry patrons had invested meaningfully in the future. MAC Cosmetics is the exception. Overseen by Charlotte Baraks, its artist relations team works with 55 British makeup colleges and many more fashion colleges, supplying student kits, trade discounts, talks, masterclasses, backstage work opportunities and other training. For Baraks, this relationship is fundamental to the brand’s vision. “We aim to serve the student makeup artist at grassroots level, with the intention of building lifelong, loyal fans of the brand. We go into colleges, try to spot those who are doing something interesting and stick with them for the long haul.”Baraks and Terry Barber, MAC’s director of makeup artistry, are the first to point out that this is a two-way street. Student fashion has an energy, freedom and rebelliousness that is in the DNA of the brand, says Barber: “If you don’t listen to students, you might as well cancel British fashion and beauty, as far as I’m concerned.”But not everyone makes it to the runway and many graduates will fear there won’t be a place left for them in an industry in crisis. So it’s heartening to discover that contrary to my – and their – worst fears, consumers are more engaged in beauty than ever it’s what they buy that is shifting. Sara Cohen, of Space NK, says the appetite for newness remains insatiable: Charlotte Tilbury makeup launches, and new self-tan from both Tan Luxe and Amanda Harrington have all flown, despite people not going out under lockdown. “Makeup has seen the same year-on-year increase as skincare,” she says. Few would have seen that coming.This meditative quality has also been a vital coping mechanism for beauty students facing an uncertain future. For Solent University graduate Helena Lambert, that has meant experimenting with more natural makeup: “We’ve seen so many flawless, polished looks on social media. I wanted to create the more lived-in look you get at the end of a long day. Now is a good time to get to know our faces again – not just those looking out from our phone screens.”Another Solent graduate, Hannah Gumbley, a big fan of Leigh Bowery and the Club Kids movement of the 1980s and 90s, has gone in a\u0026nbspdifferent direction and tells me she has spent her days experimenting. “For one Zoom call with university, I might wear a fully conceptualised monochromatic look, then a few hours later I’ll\u0026nbspbe in my pyjamas and testing out sheet masks.” For now, beauty isn’t just a career but an escape. “I\u0026nbspam worried about the industry and money, and whatever comes next,” she admits. “But I\u0026nbspalso think this is an opportunity to rethink everything, rejuvenate and experiment. When I pick up an eyeliner and start drawing, I can still get lost and forget it all.” This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Is this the end of lavish shows and packed front rows?It was on the morning of 18 March, when Glastonbury was confirmed cancelled, that Sarah Gresty, BA course leader in fashion at Central Saint Martins (CSM), realised that the class of 2020 would be a graduating year unlike any other. “That was when we thought: OK, this is only heading one way. After that, everything happened really fast. That evening many of the international students started getting sent home, and were literally grabbing their things from the studios and heading to the airport.” Within days, all students were told that there would be no final show. “It was traumatic,” says Gresty. “For many of them, that show is a moment they had been dreaming about since they were children.”I have spent the last week talking to class of 2020 graduates from all over the country, and a word I have heard time and again is “heartbreaking”. They made it all the way to the final year of fashion college, only to find themselves in the right place at the wrong time, with college paused before the show that was meant to launch them into the world. A final-year fashion show, after all, is a night like no other – think prom meets Absolutely Fabulous meets Frieze.But there are other words I have heard a lot, too. Change. Opportunity. Sustainability. Reset. “I am proud to be part of the first generation of post-pandemic graduates,” CSM student Viktorija Kozorezova tells me from her bedroom, where she is producing the wearable sculptures she had been planning to produce in the college metal workshop, but out of DIY filling foam instead. Maisie Crome, from Kingston School of Art, has spotted craft and homemade projects “all over Instagram, the TV news, everywhere. I\u0026nbspspecialise in knitwear and I chime on about handmade, about UK-made, so I’m really excited to be part of that movement.” “I know for a fact,” says Hannah Eleri Russell of the University for the Creative Arts Epsom, “that this time has made me look at clothes in my wardrobe in a different way. Given the level of overproduction, I hope this is a chance to consider caring for our clothes better and to learn new ways to mend and make pieces.”Fashion has been taken apart at the seams by the coronavirus crisis – and the class of 2020 could be the ones to redesign and remake it. Graduate-level jobs in the industry often mean a move to an atelier in Paris, Milan or New York. But the globalised supply chains on which mass fashion depends in order to serve customers with the speed and low prices they now expect have been severed, and a question mark hangs over whether they can ever be safely resurrected. Thousands of independent designer labels whose survival depends on the sale of clothes that have been sitting behind shuttered shop doors since March look set to go bust. The British Fashion Council has warned that without substantial support, half the country’s industry could be wiped out.At a meta level, there is a sense of a spell having been broken. The carousel of seasonal fashion trends broke down just as the springsummer ride was getting started, throwing everyone off, to stumble indoors to their homes and comfy clothes. There is no guarantee that consumers will automatically dance to the beat of trends again. Sale-of-the-century discounts are likely this summer as retailers rush to shift stock – but will anyone want an expensive keepsake of a season they spent indoors and anxious? How do we try on clothes safely? What happens to fashion week, now that squishing hundreds of people from all over the world on to packed benches so they can take pictures on their phones seems, well, loopy? And – biggest of all, this – how will this unexpected quarantine of shopping impact on consumer demand? Have we kicked our fashion habit? And what will that mean for a\u0026nbspgeneration hoping to make a living creating clothes?“Fashion will survive. Creativity will always find its way, I’m not worried about that,” says Jefferson Hack, co-founder and CEO of Dazed Media. Fashion, after all, was one of the first industries to repurpose itself, with designers pivoting to the production of masks and gowns for frontline workers. “What I am concerned about is the bad deal that young people get in this country. Long before coronavirus, the younger generation were being hung out to dry economically and politically. The generation Dazed is for have inherited a messed-up environment and an insecure economy. We need to build a new fashion system that is ethical and equal, and empowers young\u0026nbsppeople.”Many students tell me of jobs that had been advertised disappearing from recruitment websites. Some who planned to begin postgraduate courses in the autumn have deferred, waiting to see how the chips fall, while others who hoped to find employment are opting for further study. Many are wrestling with emotional fallout alongside the logistical issues. “I always felt left out by traditional educational methods,” says Thomas Robert, a fashion promotion student at Manchester politan University (MMU). “High school was tough and so was college. University has been the making of me as a person, and I feel deflated that I will not get to celebrate this amazing milestone in my life.” Another MMU student, Deanna Barber, says: “I know this won’t last for ever, but it feels like my goals have got much further away. A lot of uncertainty – about income, happiness, sense of achievement – has entered my life.”That uncertainty is felt right up to the top of the fashion food chain. “I\u0026nbspfeel very strongly that when we come out at the other end, people’s values are really going to have shifted,” Anna Wintour said recently. “It is an opportunity for all of us to look at our industry… and really think about the waste and the amount of money and consumption and excess that we’ve all – and I obviously include myself in this – that we’ve all indulged in. We really need to rethink what this industry stands for.”Fashion, after all, should be about change. “Positives can and will come out of this,” says Emma Hope Allwood, head of fashion at Dazed Digital. “We have been given what we never had before: time and distance to work out what we want our industry to look like. This crisis has made the waste and the excess more visible.”The ingenuity required to complete studies during lockdown has prompted students to think outside fashion’s ribbon-tied box. One student, no longer able to source the buttons she wanted, went beachcombing for shells and used those instead. Another, who had planned to shoot her collection on a model friend in the city where she studied, found herself isolating in the country with her parents and had to switch to using her mother. Seeing the clothes on her mum unexpectedly made them look even stronger, she says.When fashion students and established designers are canvassed about the future of fashion, a remarkable consensus emerges: almost everyone wants to ditch overproduction and waste. But almost everyone wants to save the fashion show.Fashion has become bloated. Collections are too big and too frequent. “We have too much product,” as Joseph Altuzarra put it bluntly to Vogue recently, and it is produced to a trend cycle that has become unintelligible. Coats now have to go on sale in July to shift them before the sundresses hit the shop floor in November. The internal workings of a schedule yoked to outmoded department-store logic has come unmoored from common sense. Giorgio Armani has announced that his next haute couture collection will be seasonless, with pieces for all climates, and denounced the churn of high-speed fashion as “criminal” and “absurd”. Designers Dries Van Noten and Marine Serre, and retailers Selfridges in the UK and Lane Crawford in Hong Kong and mainland China, are among the signatories of an open letter proposing a “reset” to the seasons. They want collections to be on sale for longer, with less emphasis on the “extra” seasons of resort and high summer. The late Azzedine Alaïa, who refused to conform to Paris fashion week schedules and showed his collections as and when he felt they were ready and appropriate, is being hailed as ahead of his time. “I’ll wait four years for Frank Ocean to make an album,” notes Dazed Digital’s Hope Allwood. “I can wait more than three months for a brand to do a show.”But the fashion show – for all its bad press as a gaudy totem of excess – still has a magic, one many designers want to rediscover in a new, more modern form. For the rest of 2020 at least, social distancing seems set to put paid to fashion weeks as we have known them. “It’s pretty clear that if the September shows do happen\u0026nbsp– and that’s a very big if at this point – they will be completely different,” says Imran Amed, founder and CEO of the Business of Fashion. “I look back to the shows in February, where we were all squeezed in like sardines, and that seems like another world. I don’t think fashion week will look the same this year – and then the question is, does that change become permanent?”The fashion show at its best can be an electric collective experience, immersive theatre at its best. But in the last decade, Hollywood-scale set-building and guests flown in from all over the world have contributed to a\u0026nbspspectacle of excess, pickled in champagne and reeking of carbon. There is\u0026nbspa strong desire to bring back the magic, without the circus. For many labels,\u0026nbspcost-cutting will be an economic necessity – and even for the luxury houses best placed to ride this out, there is the matter of tone. “The narrative\u0026nbspof fashion as a symbol of excess isn’t always warranted,” says Hope Allwood, “but in a post-pandemic world brands will not want to be seen to embody it.”This vintage of graduates are firmly generation Z, the first to have grown up fully digital native. They are perfectly poised to do what fashion designers have been attempting to do, but not quite pulling off, for the past two decades, and reinvent the fashion show as a digital-first event. “Until now, digital has always been peripheral to fashion week,” says Amed. “Digital has meant a show produced for a live audience and then broadcast. Or an Instagrammable moment – but that depends on a live audience who are there Instagramming it. This could be the moment when fashion week becomes, by necessity, created primarily for digital consumption.” Why stop at Instagram and YouTube: Fashion Week x Netflix, anyone?The crisis has, Amed points out, broken down outmoded fashion snobberies toward digital. With conferences and shows cancelled, many of the grandest names have found their way on to less polished forms of communication. Marc Jacobs loves a Zoom chat Olivier Rousteing, creative director of Balmain, is on TikTok. “There is an opportunity for young people here, because there are still so many brands who really have no idea when it comes to digital content. Now is the time for them to be working with the young trailblazers who understand how to create work that is fun and engaging. This is going to be a more marketable skill than ever before,” says\u0026nbspAmed.Many of this year’s graduates are ahead of this curve. Earlier this year, long before the logistical impact of the pandemic was being felt, Heriot-Watt University in Scotland had already decided to replace the traditional fashion show with a new, more sustainable format showing final work digitally through video, film and photography. At CSM, five of this year’s 109 graduates had opted for entirely virtual final collections before the crisis began to unfold. Scarlett Yang, a student who has been collaborating with brands on 3D animations and virtual reality showcases, tells me she now “has more offers of work than I had before”. Jessica Gray, 23, a matchesfashion scholar at CSM, says her final collection “represents the overwhelming effect of the screen interfering in our lives. If that wasn’t a premonition, I\u0026nbspdon’t know what is!”The crisis has accelerated a shift towards a more waste-conscious mindset. One student who had had his heart set on a beautiful silk that ended up shuttered in a locked-down Italian factory has made his final collection using a bedsheet donated by his parents instead. Another, with bracing can-do spirit, is embroidering on to loo roll. And while some internships in Paris and Milan have been cancelled, others are happening online. The savings on travel and accommodation not only make for a smaller carbon footprint, but opportunities that are more accessible to students with less financial support, as Gresty points out.The coming generation have the opportunity to make sustainability a core value. “Young people will emerge from this period wanting to buy for the future, to buy secondhand – just to make better choices, even if that’s buying something on Depop knowing you can flip it again later,” says Hope Allwood. “If your business doesn’t care about leaving the world in a better shape through your practice, you will make yourself irrelevant.”Today’s 20-year-olds, who have grown up with the climate emergency at the centre of their world view, see environmental impact as an essential part of thinking about fashion, rather than a notion at loggerheads with it. “I think the entire seasonal cycle should adapt itself to the climate crisis,” says Saskia Purr, a student at Nottingham Trent University. “Climate change is making our winters warmer and our summers longer.”It is becoming fashionable, in industry circles, to propose that the way forward for fashion is to turn the clock back. “You know what fashion should have done? We should have stuck to our guns,” says Bebe Moratti, founder of the Italian ethical luxury brand Redemption. The fashion system, he says, should step away from the mass-consumption gravy train. “People say you can’t go back to the old ways, but that’s exactly what the brands that have survived the longest have done. Look at Hermès. That is what the dynamic of fashion should be – an investment in something that’s beautifully made, something that you love, a transaction that supports the person that made it. So, is my business model crazy, to go back to a place where we cherish what we buy, where we cherish the workers, where we cherish the environment? No. It’s not crazy at all. It works.”“This crisis has made the nation less materialistic,” says Bournemouth student Ffion McCormick-Edwards. “We have stayed connected by talking about what we are looking forward to: things like a family barbecue, or a party with friends, or seeing our grandparents.”Despite the blow of missing out on graduation, “I wouldn’t say this term has been all loss,” says fashion knitwear student Rhiannon Davies. “My collection has become a lot more authentic to me, because doing it at home has cut off the many voices that I would find distracting at university. Facing myself – and my own company – is something I don’t usually do a lot of. I\u0026nbspalmost feel I’ve found myself in the process.”Still, the class of 2020 has been dealt a harsh blow. “I think the biggest loss is not the show itself, but the camaraderie around it,” says Gresty. “The last seven weeks before a show is sheer hard work, tears, panic, but also this amazing energy, supporting each other through the fatigue – and then coming together in celebration. Not having that is tough.” Despite the hardships of this term, she sees a bright future. “Students keep saying to me, ‘We’re so unlucky to be in this year – why us?’ and I say, ‘Are you joking? You are lucky. This is such a special year. This is the year that everyone will remember for ever.’”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f0aee713b949eac54ad2fb73387195e0cf3ae68/502_304_4469_2682/master/4469.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8df20352496eafbea4a0976d8950f590","title":"victoria beckham i guess it was a sign of insecurity wearing very tight clothes","story":"The designer answers questions on personal style, the Spice Girls and fashion after corona, put by Class of 2020 fashion graduates Victoria Beckham has an office in her Cotswolds house, where she spent lockdown, but when she answers the phone, that’s not where she is. “Um, no, Harper’s taken over my office. She’s trying to do all her schoolwork and, well, she’s kind of decided that’s her space now. So I’m downstairs… we’re all dotted around the house, me and David and the boys, trying to work, trying to get schoolwork done. There’s often someone holding a laptop up to a window, trying to get reception.” Whoever you are, 2020 has had its challenges.As a patron of Graduate fashion week, Beckham is on the line to answer questions sent in by fashion students from all over the country. “To be honest, I feel like I have so many more questions than I do answers, right now – like everyone else,” she says. Still, she is optimistic that this strangest of final terms will prove a valuable learning experience. “The generation coming into adulthood now will have experienced something that none of the rest of us have. I feel like this has taught all of us a lot about how to work together as teams, both in our home lives and professionally. This crisis will have expanded the horizons of all of us, in a way.” Harper has been required by her school to wear uniform at home, “which at first I thought was a bit strange, I wasn’t expecting it. But for her it helps, because it keeps her routine going.” For the rest of the family, sartorial standards have slipped a little. “I’d love to say my lockdown look has been all about a vintage kaftan, but that’s not the case. I still get up early and exercise every day, then I dress for work and for comfort. A pair of old jeans, a T-shirt or a jumper. I’m not quite at the elasticated waistband stage yet – I still want to feel good about myself. We’ve been going out on country walks every day, so the only shoes I wear are an old pair of trainers. It’s so nice just to do things with the family and not think too much about getting dressed. So, definitely no heels.”Beckham’s own lockdown got off to a shaky start. The planned furloughing of 30 staff at her label led to a backlash, and the decision was reviewed. Since then, working remotely with her design team, she has been trying to figure out what the next few seasons look like. “It’s not only about the clothes, or the design – it’s about the mood, what feels right. And all the practical issues – like, how do we shoot anything? I’ve also been trying to use this time to find inspiration for business strategy. A lot is going to change. I’ve been focusing not just on the collection coming up, but on what is the calendar going to look like? The concept of the fashion show needs to be rethought, but what does that mean? Will it be smaller presentations? Will it be digital? It’s impossible to know what the future will bring.”In the not-too-distant future, Beckham is looking forward to getting back into her London workspace. “I can’t wait to get the atelier up and running again. There is so much that you can do digitally now, but at a certain point you need to be able to put your hands on the clothes.” She might be ready to ditch the jeans and trainers soon, too. “I do miss getting dressed. A nice pub lunch with family and friends, a few glasses of wine. I’m really grateful for the family time, but I’m ready to be a little bit sociable now.”It sounds like a good moment to hand over to the students…No, not really. When I was in the Spice Girls there were stylists who dressed the group, but in my personal life I have never worked with a stylist. I used to wear lots of structured dresses with corsetry, and I do still have some of those dresses, but my personal style has become more relaxed. Looking back, I guess it was a sign of insecurity that I would always wear clothes that were very tight, very fitted.As the business took off and I got busier, my style changed, because I just can’t run around the studio doing everything in high heels. I’m juggling a lot: being a mum, being a wife, being in the studio every day. I remember one time at a show in New York where I wore a pair of masculine trousers and trainers, and everyone went crazy, “Oh my God, she’s wearing trainers!” My confidence has definitely grown as I’ve got older. I know what works on me, what looks good, what makes me feel confident and comfortable. I don’t feel I have anything to prove now in the way I dress.Alex Copeland, fashion marketing, University of East LondonMusic has always been such a huge part of me and who I am, and not just because of the Spice Girls. When I’m in the atelier, I love listening to whatever the team are into – it might be a new band I haven’t heard of that one of the team went to see the night before. A couple of seasons ago we went through a phase of listening to a lot of Led Zeppelin.Right now there’s always music on in the house, whether that’s me playing it or David or the kids. The new Justin Bieber album has been a bit of a lockdown family favourite. It depends who has taken control of the docking station. David is sitting outside right now, listening to 90s soul and R\u0026ampB.I don’t know. If you know, please tell me! This is what everyone is talking about. Will the presentation of collections be more digital? I’ve always been interested in the digital space we had an e-commerce site before we had a bricks-and-mortar store. I believe that people will be travelling less, which I hope will make the industry a more level playing field. It will be less about those crazily expensive shows that only the biggest brands can afford, and more about creativity. And the timetable is going to have to adjust, because doing so many collections each year seems like it’s going to feel outdated after this.It seemed obvious that it had to be Victoria Beckham. I knew there were preconceptions attached to my name, but that was a challenge I was prepared to take on. Honestly? There was never really any other option.I always want to better myself, so criticism is always useful. I started out with just 10 dresses in my first collection, and as the brand grew I learned so much from people who taught me the shape of what a proper fashion collection looks like. They showed me that a fashion brand isn’t just about what you put on the catwalk, it’s about price points, what the customer wants and when. I had a lot to learn when I started out, and I had to surround myself with people who knew about all that stuff.Lara Hammersley, fashion communication and promotion, Norwich University of the ArtsI’m always inspired by the 90s. The colour, the simple shapes. There probably isn’t a designer who isn’t inspired by that decade. For me, it’s not so much about the street fashion of the 90s, but Martin Margiela, and Jil Sander. Not just the collections, but the shows, the models, the music.Get as technologically savvy as you can, because that is going to be key. It’s also true that this is going to be a hard moment, economically. We are likely to be in a period of recession. So it will be important to think outside of the box in terms of how and where you can make a living. Everyone is going to have to work that little bit harder to succeed in their chosen field, while we all navigate coming out of this situation.I’m fortunate to have had the opportunity to travel extensively, and a lot of inspiration has come from places I’ve been. Moving forward, we won’t be travelling so much, I guess. But then I live in London, and where is more inspiring than London? The art is incredible. Tate Britain is a favourite place, which is why I was so thrilled when we did our show there a few seasons ago. When I was in New York, I used to love going to the Frick Collection – I think it would be hard to find an environment that was more beautiful for looking at art.Daniella James, fashion media and marketing, Plymouth College of ArtSometimes I can get a little bit overwhelmed. There’s just so much to do, with eyewear and beauty and everything else. I don’t ever want to get stuck in a rut, so sometimes it’s about finding inspiration in something that you find challenging, something that is a bit out of your comfort zone. Sometimes inspiration comes from looking at something that I wouldn’t necessarily wear, and thinking about how to get from that place to creating something I find beautiful. It’s a balance, because I don’t want the brand to be predictable – but it still has to be believably “me”.Enjoy the journey. I have. Also, go with your gut instinct. I always say I can handle mistakes that were made by me, but not mistakes that were made against my instinct. Trust that gut – it’s there for a reason.Kelsie March, fashion design, University of HertfordshireI wouldn’t call them knockbacks. I’m a glass-half-full kind of person. Everyone has challenges. The thing is to learn from them.Ravina Kazim, fashion, University for the Creative Arts, RochesterI love what I do now, because it is a true creative output for me. I love making women feel like the best version of themselves. I had a lot of fun with the Spice Girls, but I don’t miss those days and I don’t miss being on stage. That was then and this is now. Fashion is where I feel comfortable, and where I feel excited. I’m looking forward to the future in this industry, actually. I feel like we can all come out of this better, personally and professionally. • Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure the discussion remains on the topics raised by the article.

When she failed to back the prime minister’s chief adviser, she is understood to have been dropped from the press conference taking place later that day – though this has been denied by a government minister.May’s removal was first reported by the Independent, citing senior NHS sources, and has been confirmed separately by the .The scientific and medical experts who appear at the briefing alongside a politician were initially reluctant to get involved in the row surrounding Cummings, who, while in Durham, also made a 60-mile round-trip to a beauty spot, which he said was to test his eyesight ahead of a longer journey back to London.On 28 May, Boris Johnson tried to prevent the chief medical officer for England, Chris Whitty, and the chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, from answering questions on the subject, before Whitty said that neither he nor Vallance wished to comment on politics.However, on 30 May, England’s deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van-Tam, caused embarrassment for the government by saying, in response to a question about the alleged lockdown breach: “In my opinion the rules are clear and they have always been clear,” he said. “In my opinion they are for the benefit of all. In my opinion they apply to all.”A day later, another deputy chief medical officer for England, Jenny Harries, replied “Absolutely” when asked whether she agreed with Van-Tam. She added: “I thought his exposure of what he felt was exactly right,” she said. “We usually say exactly the same things because we think in public health terms, and I think that’s right. From my own perspective, I can assure you that on a matter of personal and professional integrity, I will always try to follow the rules, as I know he does.”The timing of May’s removal suggests that the government was wary of a senior medical adviser to the government implicitly criticising Cummings for a third day in a row as it desperately tried to move the news agenda away from his actions.Van-Tam has not appeared at a press conference since his comments on 30 May.The government’s advisers have generally been on-message at press conferences and supportive of Downing Street, although there have been ergences. Whitty and the UK’s other medical officers vetoed the government’s attempt to lower the coronavirus alert level from four to three. On Wednesday, Johnson said that it was premature to make judgements about what the government could have done better in its response to the coronavirus pandemic.However, Whitty said: “I think there is a long list, actually, of things that we need to look at very seriously. If I was to choose one, it would probably be looking at how we could ... speed up testing very early on in the epidemic. Many of the problems that we have had came because we were unable to actually work out exactly where we were.”An NHS spokesperson suggested the  contact the government, saying: “If someone doesn’t appear, it’s up to Downing Street.” They added that May was “out there saving lives”.On Friday, the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, played down reports, saying: “I don’t think it is true … I am absolutely sure she has been a regular contributor before and I am sure she will be back here again.”Downing Street has been approached for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae168aa2d4d63900399cc87124686b6b57ec80ec/0_289_5056_3034/master/5056.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d24cf12db63c558f51a3ffeb818169c4","title":"cricket lydia greenway they might seem like small things but it makes a big difference","story":"Finding equipment that fits correctly has always been a problem for Greenway so she used the time in lockdown to create an online cricket store for women and girlsLydia Greenway had big plans for this summer. Last September she was appointed head coach of the new Oval Invincibles women’s team in the Hundred, and right about now she was supposed to be busy getting the team ready for their first match on 24 July. That’s on top of her second job, running Cricket for Girls, the schools coaching programme she set up in 2017. Then lockdown started, the schools shut, and the Hundred was postponed. And while the rest of us settled down to books and boxsets, Greenway got to thinking about a project that had been in the back of her mind for a while, if only she could find time: an online cricket store for women and girls.Greenway had been reading Caroline Criado Perez’s book, Invisible Women, which lays out what Perez calls the “one-size-fits-men approach” to design, the way in which, for instance, the average smartphone has been built to be too big for a woman’s hand. It was a problem Greenway knew about from cricket, where girls often have to play in kit designed for boys, in pads that are too wide, with straps that are too long and with bats that are too big, a problem that, she decided, it was finally time to try to fix for good. So Greenway, who describes herself as “a real technophobe”, started teaching herself how to build a website.“There were times when I wanted to throw my computer across the room,” she says, “but it is still intact.” The site she built launched on 1 June. So in the space of a few weeks, Greenway had realised an idea she had when she started running Cricket for Girls, and saw for herself how the sport was changing at that level. Back when she started playing in the 1990s “there was really only one type of girl who played cricket and that was the girl who didn’t mind playing with the boys,” she explains. More often than not, the way into the game was through a male relative. In Greenway’s case, it was her dad. And that same male relative would then sort out the kit.“You got what you were given,” Greenway says. And since women’s kit was pretty hard to come by, it would most often be stuff designed for boys. These days, “there’s been quite a big shift in the types of girls playing the game, because the route into the game has become much more erse,” she says. “Now it’s part of the school curriculum we’re seeing more and more girls play cricket not because their dad, or their brother, or their uncle, introduced them to it, but because they played it at school. And then suddenly when they say to their parents: – who might have no knowledge of the game – ‘I want to get cricket equipment’, the parents think: ‘Well, where do we start?’”Back in 2018, an 11-year-old girl called Olivia Cotter made the news when she wrote a letter to Kookaburra complaining that she had been given a voucher for her birthday and wanted to spend it on some Kookaburra pads, like the ones Alyssa Healy wore. But she had to buy some labelled “boys”. “It made me a little bit sad that the size was just called ‘boys’,” Cotter wrote, “as so many girls are playing the game now too. I think you should consider changing the size name from ‘boys’ to ‘kids’.” In fact Kookaburra had already done that, the previous year, but Cotter’s local shop didn’t have the stock. In the end, they had Healy present her with an entirely new set of kit.Kookaburra are one of the three manufacturers Greenway is working with on this project, along with SM and Viking. “They didn’t need converting to support the women’s and girls’ game,” she says. “They were already doing it.” All three have put a lot of time and effort into developing their girls and women’s ranges. “They’ve been being really specific in the changes they’ve made,” Greenway explains. “The bats are lighter and have shorter, thinner handles, same for the pads. And straps aren’t as long because women and girls have thinner legs, so you don’t get that overhang, same for the gloves. They might seem like small things, but it makes a big difference.”These are all steps that take the game away from what it was, towards what it ought to be. Anyone who loves cricket knows what it feels like to buy your first proper kit, anyone who loves cricket can imagine how dispiriting it must be to find those little imperfections in it, telltale blemishes, which tell you it’s not for people like you. “I think about the girls we’ve been coaching, all the parents I’ve spoken to,” Greenway says, “and all they want to do is support their daughters and their pupils and make sure that they’ve got the right stuff, and that’s the biggest reason why I’ve done this. We want to be able to say to those people: ‘Right, this is what we’ve picked for you, you don’t have to sift through the boys’ and men’s stuff. This is just for you’.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aeeaef602b3186471fb1bf4e6a93a2369763ee41/190_179_3125_1876/master/3125.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1a54ea1f5c6f210bfa5420a306c290ca","title":"talking horses tabarrak last laugh king of comedy","story":"The Group Three Diomed Stakes is Saturday’s highlight on the track with Tabarrak the right type to test the favourite’s resolveThe Diomed Stakes, rerouted to Newbury from its traditional home at Epsom, is Saturday’s highlight and revolves around John Gosden’s King Of Comedy or, more precisely, what is between the four-year-old’s ears.He had several top-class runs to his credit at three and looked unlucky in the St James’s Palace Stakes. But his attitude deteriorated steadily as the season wore on and he appeared to throw in the towel in the QEII in October.He may have grown up for another winter – or he might be even more intractable. Odds of 9-4 look poor in the circumstances and a consistent performer like Tabarrak (3.35) could be the type to test the favourite’s resolve.Newbury 1.50 A small field but a strong race of its type and all five runners have a claim on the pick of their juvenile form. Likely favourite It’s Good To Laugh looks too short at around 2-1 and marginal preference at the prices is for Sir Mark Prescott’s Tell Me All at 5-1, a possible improver for today’s trip, as he is a son of Prescott’s 2006 French Oaks winner, Confidential Lady.Sandown Park 2.05 Another tight-knit field of three-year-olds. Surf Dancer has a similar profile to the probable favourite, Ascension, but disappointed on bottomless ground when last seen. Forgive him that and he has definite appeal at around 4-1.Newbury 2.25 Preening and Foxtrot Lady have run to a similar level at their best and either could be good enough here, but they are relatively exposed and the lightly raced Dancing Feet could be worth chancing at around 10-1.Sandown Park 2.40 Lazuli turns around quickly after putting up a career-best to finish second under top weight in a handicap at Newmarket last Saturday. That was his first start after a wind op and also after gelding and there should be further improvement to come here.Newbury 3.00 Cabaletta is an obvious favourite having beaten last week’s easy winner Frankly Darling on debut last season. That was on heavy ground, however, and there are some interesting opponents including David Simcock’s Oriental Mystique, a daughter of the trainer’s Group One winner Madame Chiang. She should come into her own over middle-distances this season.Sandown Park 3.15 Several have obvious potential to progress but Sir Michael Stoute has few peers with lightly raced older horses and Solid Stone, gelded over the winter, put up two big runs at this track last season off a similar mark to Saturday’s 94.Siskin, the 2-1 favourite, found his way out of a pocket two furlongs out to maintain his unbeaten record and give trainer Ger Lyons and rider Colin Keane their first Classic success in the Irish 2,000 Guineas at the Curragh on Friday.Keane appeared to have all sorts of problems as he was buried behind horses against the far rail when Lope Y Fernandez, the second-favourite, struck for home. Once Keane pulled out and found running room, though, Siskin quickened instantly to run him down and then beat the fast-finishing Vatican City by a length-and-three-quarters. The stewards looked at possible interference as Keane made his move but allowed the result to stand.“This means everything,” Lyons said. “To win a Guineas was always my number one and hopefully it’s the first of many. Full credit to Colin Keane, you don’t get a Guineas handed to you and they both stood up when it was needed. If there was a kink in that horse, then he wasn’t going to go through that gap.Vatican City, who finished with real purpose to take second place, was the main mover in the Derby market – 12-1 (from 20-1) with Betfair – following Friday’s race. The son of Galileo is a brother to the dual Guineas winner Gleneagles, out of a dam whose brother, the outstanding Giant’s Causeway, won at up to 10 furlongs.Joseph O’Brien’s Crossfirehurricane was a convincing winner of the Gallinule Stakes over 10 furlongs earlier on the card and promptly attracted quotes for the upcoming Classics, but seems unlikely to line up either at the Curragh or Epsom at this stage.Admiral Nelson, one of three juveniles from Aidan O’Brien’s yard in the Tally-Ho Stud Maiden, seems likely to run at Royal Ascot next week after beating his better-fancied stable companion Merchants Quay by a length. “He could be a Coventry horse,” O’Brien said. “He won’t be doing anything after this because it is so close.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d15b5f2b6120b86b76b60f9958533dc6335408e/0_129_2052_1231/master/2052.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ed515c4f87db053666760c6bc7e211f0","title":"shakespeares macbeth in pictures","story":"As the RSC’s production starring Christopher Eccleston is broadcast on BBC Four, take a look back at some of the most arresting stagings of the ‘Scottish play’"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f34dc2c38c0b88044a27e657902ee77a4d73d38e/0_36_1440_864/master/1440.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de8011fe7bdd92049c3151a4f632b2e4","title":"wetting yourself as an adult is the stuff of nightmares jenny eclair on bladder weakness","story":"The author and comedian lets loose on a wee problem many women are still too shy to talk about: accidental leakageThere are many reasons why you might wet yourself, but the best is laughter. I remember laughing so much at school that I frequently had to clutch my front bottom to stop the wee coming out. This was once triggered by the girl standing next to me farting very loudly during assembly – seriously, she let off as loudly as a trumpet at the precise moment we’d all finished singing a hymn. I still call this state of helpless incontinent hilarity “school assembly” laughter, and when I’m gigging, this is the Richter-scale level of laughter I’m after. I want to see every woman in the audience crossing her legs and clutching her front bottom.In real life, of course, wetting yourself as an adult is the stuff of nightmares, immediately you are the primary school pant wetter, the girl who had to borrow a pair of knickers from the lost property box, oh the shame of it.The fact is, losing control of your bladder can happen for all kinds of reasons, from simple timing issues, ie finding yourself locked out of the house and not being able to find your front door key, to suffering from various medical conditions that affect bladder control.For some reason, adult female incontinence still tends to be a taboo subject, although there probably isn’t a female comic who hasn’t gone through motherhood without making an “every time I cough, I wet my pants” stress-incontinence gag. A few years ago, during a Grumpy Old Women Live show, I performed some menopausal material about having a go on a kids’ trampoline: “Thirty seconds later, I’d pissed myself, broken both my ankles and one tit had escaped its moorings,” I joshed. And judging by the reaction of the audience, a great many of them had been there, done that and had to go home to change their underwear.In my experience, as long as we women are in control of the joke then we can laugh about it. It’s when other people (often younger and frequently male) take ownership of our physical frailties that it becomes embarrassing and somehow more shameful.For many women over 50, a little bit of leaking now and then is a fact of life – many of us haven’t got the toned pelvic floors we once had, thanks mostly to having big headed babies, and while some of us will never need to use pads, others feel safer with some protection, “just in case”.As a woman who has spent more than her fair share of time on the motorway sharing cars with other female performers, it has always surprised me how some women need to stop at a service station to use the loo every 20 minutes, while others manage a good five hundred miles without needing a wee.The fact is that all bladders are different, some resemble oversized leather footballs, while others, like my friend Nina’s (I’ve changed her name) are thimble sized and made from gossamer. Nina has never managed to make it to the interval of any show without climbing over everyone’s laps to get to the ladies.For a number of women, bladder training can be incredibly useful. A friend of mine swears blind that Princess Anne once informed her that “when one urinates, one must always sit for another 30 seconds after you think you’ve finished, as you inevitably haven’t, there’s usually a few drops more”. This is singly the best tip for anyone suffering from post-micturition dribble. Basically, slow down and give yourself time to do the job properly. Then “give your lettuce a good shake” as the old saying goes and remember to wipe from front to back, because we don’t want a yeast infection on top of everything else.Lord knows, women are born with complicated plumbing and as we get older some of our pipework can start to drip now and then, but you know what? Unless you’re wearing a gusset of galvanised steel, there’s no reason why anyone should know.Of course in the olden days women would rather die of shame than talk to anyone about bladder weakness, but one of the great things about being a 21st-century woman is that we know this kind of thing is common.So remember girls, incontinence is not a moral weakness, it’s not laziness, it’s a fact of life for millions, so whatever you do, keep laughing and don’t let a little bit of wee spoil your fun.As incontinence affects one in three women over 35, we should all be having more open conversations about this everyday condition that impacts women of all ages.

But in another about-turn, travellers on flights from the UK will not be accepted when the Mediterranean country reopens to tourism on Monday.Bowing to new advice from the EU, Athens announced on Friday that the suspension of air links with Britain, in effect since March, will continue to be enforced until 30 June.Greek officials told the  the decision was in line with the EU commission’s latest recommendation that travel restrictions at the bloc’s external borders be phased out gradually and in “a strictly coordinated” manner. UK passenger flights are expected to be reinstated from 1 July onwards.In a surprise move that appeared to be motivated by Athens’ announcement that international flights to the Greek capital and Thessaloniki could resume from 15 June, EU Commissioner for Home Affairs Ylva Johansson, said on Thursday the EU was now advising that travel restrictions on non-essential travel be prolonged until 30 June.The tourist-dependent country had previously declared that regular passenger flights to its two main airports could restart in a “bridge phase” from 15-30 June. International air links would resume nationwide on 1 July, three months after restrictions were imposed to prevent the spread of the novel virus. “These were EU recommendations, we had to go along with them,” said a senior government source.In an effort to contain the pandemic amid mounting concerns among Greek epidemiologists of the virus being imported, it was also announced that all passengers from Italy, Spain and the Netherlands would undergo tests upon arrival as the country prepares for foreign visitors for the first time since the Covid-19 lockdown in March. Until 30 June, tourists from Italy, Spain and the Netherlands will only be able to fly into Athens.A recent spike in confirmed coronavirus cases, described as “worrying” by infectious disease experts advising the government, has been attributed in part to travellers undergoing mandatory tests upon arrival.“Our goal is for Greece to remain a safe country looking forward to the tourism season,” said the health minister, Vassilis Kikilias.Greek authorities say arrivals who test positive will have to quarantine for 14 days at a designated hotel paid by the Greek state.With fewer than 190 coronavirus deaths among 11 million residents, the Mediterranean country is looking to market itself as a healthy holiday destination.Seasonal hotels are to reopen on 15 June, two weeks after all-year hotels returned to business. Hotel staff will be subject to regular tests, as will guests.On popular islands “Covid-19 rooms” have also been set aside to quarantine anyone testing positive for the virus, and each hotel has to have a contracted physician on call.In 2019, Greece posted a record year with over 34 million visitors, but operators say a realistic goal for this season is just a third of that number."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae37ea79881f23cba042770fe565471a084f7f79/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03ff872a2d591ea2968f7d71b728a7bb","title":"fannie lou hamer right to vote comic","story":"As people across the US protest, many are looking back at civil rights activists like Hamer, who resisted brutal violence and imprisonment for years, for inspiration As hundreds of thousands of people continue to protest against police brutality against black Americans in the country, many have turned to our original civil rights activists for inspiration.Fannie Lou Hamer fought for the right to vote in the 1960s, resisting brutal violence and imprisonment for years in Mississippi, where Jim Crow laws threatened the lives and franchise of African Americans well into the 20th century.

Voters stood in line to vote for upwards of four hours, saying they never received mail-in ballots requested weeks ago. Local officials, forced to consolidate polling locations because of Covid-19, were unable to manage the influx of voters and struggled to operate new voting equipment.\u0026nbspExperts worry that poll worker shortages, long lines and other delays in processing requests for absentee ballots will only get worse in November, when there will be more voters. Since March, voting advocates have been calling on states to prepare for an election like no other, and quickly implement plans that accommodate a surge in voters casting their ballots by mail for the first time as well as robust turnout at the polls.One estimate places the cost of upgrading vote-by-mail systems across the country at $4bn.“We’re just going to have a catastrophe in November,” said Michael McDonald, a professor at the University of Florida who studies elections. “We’ve already passed the point of catastrophic failure. It doesn’t get any better if we have two to three times the number of people who are trying to vote in these polling locations.”Not every primary in the Covid-19 era has been a disaster, and there has been strong turnout in many states as Americans have embraced voting by mail at unprecedented levels. But Georgia was far from the only place where there have been serious election problems.Voters in Nevada waited hours in line to vote in the state’s primary on Tuesday, even after the state moved to conduct its election largely by mail. Earlier this month, election officials in Pennsylvania and Washington DC struggled to meet the crush of requests for absentee ballots and voters in the nation’s capital waited hours to vote. Voters in Baltimore, Maryland, didn’t get ballots and faced long lines. In April, voters in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, waited hours to vote in the state’s primary as the city was forced to condense its usual 180 polling places into just five.\u0026nbspMost glaring, voting groups say, has been the disproportionate impact the election failures have had on communities of color. LaTosha Brown, a co-founder of Black Voters Matter, told Politico it took her three hours to vote in her majority African American precinct in Atlanta on Tuesday, but she saw no line at a polling place in a predominantly white area later in the day. State officials have launched an investigation into what went wrong in Fulton county, which includes Atlanta.“Black voters in particular appear especially hard-hit,” said Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, which has closely monitored the primaries. “In some parts of the country, it feels like officials are making reckless decisions that are a recipe for disaster.”\u0026nbspEven before Covid-19, there were concerns about mass disenfranchisement in November the pandemic has only exacerbated them. Donald Trump is already making repeated baseless accusations of voter fraud in what appears to be an effort to lay the foundation for contesting the legitimacy of the 2020 election.Activists were already deeply concerned about the mass closure of polling places and the Covid-19 pandemic has given election officials justification for doing so. More than 1,600 polling places in jurisdictions previously covered by the Voting Rights Act were closed between 2012 and 2018, according to a report by the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. That includes 214 polling places in Georgia.Democrats and voting rights groups are also pushing states across the country to extend the deadline by which absentee ballots need to arrive to be counted. Many states require the ballots to arrive by election night, a cutoff that could leave eligible voters disenfranchised. In Wisconsin, Democrats secured a court order requiring the state to count ballots as long as they were postmarked before election day and arrived within six days of the election.There is also growing concern about plummeting voter registration in recent months and an unprecedented Republican effort to monitor the polls and challenge the eligibility of voters who appear, something that could result in voter intimidation. The Republican National Committee, freed from a decades-old court order prohibiting them from such activity, is seeking to recruit up to 50,000 volunteers.The window for states to understand the problems from their primaries and implement solutions for November is rapidly closing. Recommended deadlines for purchasing necessary equipment and other measures are approaching and in some cases have already passed. Republicans in Congress have also scaled back funding to help states run elections, allocating just $400m so far, a small fraction of the billions experts say is needed. The Republican National Committee also plans to spend at least $20m to oppose efforts to expand vote by mail.“If no one, legislatorsadvocatesvoterselection officials, listens to what is being said it will be a debacle in November,” Tammy Patrick, who works on election administration at the Democracy Fund, said in an email. “The primaries have been the canary in the coalmine.”\u0026nbspBut other signs suggest states may move in the opposite direction. In Georgia, Brad Raffensperger, the state’s top election official, refused to acknowledge systemic problems in the way the election was run this week, instead blaming local election officials. In Iowa, Republicans are considering legislation that would prohibit the secretary of state, Paul Pate, from sending absentee ballot applications to all voters, something Pate, a Republican, did ahead of the state’s June primary when there was record turnout. Ohio Republicans are also considering legislation that would bar the state’s top election official from paying for postage on absentee ballot requests and the ballots themselves.“On the one hand, it’s very concerning,” said Amber McReynolds, CEO of the National Vote at Home Institute, which is advising election officials on how to prepare for November. “On the other, what I would say is that this is a wake-up call.”\u0026nbspStacey Abrams, the 2018 Democratic nominee in Georgia who put voting rights at the core of her campaign, said some states were better positioned for November “because those states have an intention of actually letting every person vote”.“It is not that we don’t know the answer. It is that the Republican party in particular has been resistant to solving the problem and that will put our elections in jeopardy,” she said."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Students would only be able to attend one or two days a week if rule not changed, says MinisterThe effects of climate change could damage, and possibly even destroy, our collective heritage"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Avian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to startFew, if any, of Ireland\u0026rsquos mammals have evolved the ability to eat venomous creaturesGolden kelp is notably bare of other sea life, so there are concerns over its possible impactLong-term objective is to see how wildflowers are responding to changes in weather patterns and climateTime to restore meadows once full of insects and nectar in summer and spires of seeds in winterA new report shows no let-up in the loss of wildlife in Northern Ireland"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4270808.1591280343!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"spotted flycatcher is less likely to be spotted with each passing year","story":"Last year it was the mistle thrush that grabbed me – my affectionate attention, that is. Each morning as I marched out to measure the rain, he was perched on the gable’s broadband aerial and facing the sea in a full-flow performance.I’d stand beneath him, carefully still, admiring the measured, forceful phrasing, the avian oratory. His song carries, by some accounts, a couple of kilometres. And at length, his final, territorial peroration concluded, we could both move on.This year there have been distractions, among them the compelling entry of a little bird whose song (“ a few thin hasty notes”, as my field guide allows) is quite lost beyond my double-glazed bedroom window.This looks out to a low-fringed glade of rough grass and shady trees, oak and alder intertwined. For the spotted flycatcher, Muscicapa striata, it is the perfect arena for the ceaseless, urgent practice of his name.Many birds catch insects in the air – our swallows are at it all the time – but none behaves quite like the flycatcher.He chooses a perch on a twig with a view – it can become a daily favourite – and makes repeated, looping forays to seize his prey. The energy involved is impressive: a flurry of wings in a ing take-off, an arrow-swift glide to snap up the target, an instant turn and flurry of wings to propel him back to his original parch.This manoeuvre, made over and over at different trajectories and distances and flashing in the sun, kept catching my eye as I lay reading in bed, the mammoth third volume from Hilary Mantel propped up on a beanbag. Distracted from Thomas Cromwell’s devious doings at Henry’s court, I gave way to tracking the flycatcher’s own, quite hypnotic, manoeuvres.Rare visitorIt was the first such visitor in many years, migrating from a humid zone of west Africa by way of northern Spain. As perhaps the last of the summer’s arrivals in Ireland, what chance had drawn it to this one wooded acre on a sheep-shorn coastal hillside?Here in a gloom-laden west, last summer offered few flying insects: even the midges lay low. The contrast this year, boosted by the sun, just about sustains the bird’s hard work, together with the swoops of the swallows. Despite its name, mere flies are mostly for chicks in the nest, somewhere in a shadowy crevice. But the energy for ceaseless interception demands meatier fare – butterflies, moths, craneflies, damselflies, even bees or wasps, their stings scraped off on the twig.To read about birds these days is to expect more tales of decline. The British Trust for Ornithology reports an 89 per cent reduction in spotted flycatchers between 1967 and 2010. Ibis, the international journal of avian science, has added “great conservation concern” about the species.In Ireland, a new survey of countryside birds suggests a continuing fall in breeding flycatchers, perhaps of a quarter over the past couple of decades, and notably in the east midlands. Theories include predation of nests, perhaps even by grey squirrels, but other migrants from the flycatcher’s winter habitats in Africa have suffered severe declines, so bigger answers may lie there, in climate change or deforestation.Measuring lossThe Countryside Bird Survey is important and readable. Co-ordinated by BirdWatch Ireland, it’s the product of thousands of hours of fieldwork, mainly by volunteers, but also by the National Parks and Wildlife Service, which publishes it online (npws.ie) as Irish Wildlife Manual 115. It tracks the fortunes of the common and widespread breeding birds between 1998 and 2016. That this now excludes the lapwing and curlew, from the difficulty of finding them, is a measure of their loss.The survey does correct a few popular notions about the loss of birds, not least my own casual belief that Ireland’s cuckoos shared in the UK’s long patterns of decline. “Perhaps surprisingly, in light of at least anecdotal evidence,” says the report, “the CBS shows a positive population trend of nearly 19 per cent.”On average, cuckoos have been recorded in 74 of the survey’s spread of 1km squares per year. These could certainly, this spring, have included our own hillside. One (or more?) cuckoos has been giving forth, almost non-stop through late May, to the weaker, counterpoint chorus from collared doves.One day I watched as a cuckoo, harried by a little mob of pipits, took refuge in the crest of the old Sitka spruce at our gate. She re-emerged from the dark canopy almost immediately and fled stage-left, still pursued by pipits. She may, of course, have met the mistle thrush’s mate, indignantly at home on the nest."},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: Laura HuttonLast week was the first since the start of March in which Dublin had fewer than 100 weekly cases of Covid-19 diagnosed, the Central Statistics Office has confirmed.In its fourth bulletin on Covid-19 insights, the CSO said there were 54 new cases in Co Dublin\u0026nbspin the week ending June 5th, down from a peak of 1,869 cases in the week ending March 27th.Elsewhere, positive trends in relation to new case growth continued in several largely rural counties.The deaths of a further three people diagnosed with Covid-19 were reported in the Republic on Friday.This brings the total number of fatalities in the country to 1,705.The National Public Health Emergency Team also recorded a further 13 confirmed cases of coronavirus, bringing the total number of cases in the country since the pandemic began to 25,250.One death was denotified by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre. The new totals reflect this.Cities continue to account for an outsized proportion of total Covid-19 infections, with 44 per cent of all cases occurring in urban areas which account for one-third of the population. Dublin continues to be worst affected in terms of deaths, with 11 in the last week. It is the only county to record more than five new deaths each week for the past four weeks.Clare, Leitrim, Longford, Tipperary, Wexford and Wicklow have all recorded fewer than 10 new cases for the fourth week in a row, while Donegal, Laois and Kerry recorded fewer than 10 new cases for the fifth week in a row.Almost 90 per cent of Covid-19 patients who required intensive care had an underlying condition.The CSO found that the median age of those admitted to Intensive Care Units (ICUs), 60, was in fact lower than the median age of those admitted to hospitals. The peak of admissions to ICU was in the week ending March 27th, when 94 new cases were admitted, the CSO said.However, the CSO data supports the wider experience that the virus proves most deadly for elderly people, with the median age of all deaths associated with Covid-19 coming in at 83.So far, 413 people have required treatment in ICUs. Of all those who were hospitalised, 62 per cent had an underlying condition, but 87 per cent of those in intensive care suffered from one. Men significantly outnumber women in terms of ICU admissions, accounting for 68 per cent of the total.Meanwhile, the Health Service Executive has spent an additional €400 million on Covid-19 related costs so far, and is projecting a possible €1.8 billion cost for treating the disease to the end of the year.The biggest drivers of cost are personal protective equipment (PPE) and testing and tracing, according to HSE chief executive Paul Reid.As a result of the extra spending, the cost base of next year’s HSE service plan will be significantly increased, he warned.Mr Reid said the cost of PPE, which is expected to be about €1 billion this year, had been driven by the massive premium that had to be paid for scarce equipment and the cost of supplying large volumes to the “HSE family” and beyond, to the wider healthcare system.Next year’s winter plan would be very different from this year’s, he said, and the HSE corporate plan would also have to be redesigned.Services need to be redesigned, sustainable models of primary care and the provision of elective care has to be addressed, Mr Reid said.Time-frames for plans would have to be “recalibrated” from existing 10-year s, and capacity will have to be built to cope with the “new reality” of post Covid-19 healthcare.“We’re winning so far but it’s a long game,” Mr Reid said of the performance of the health service, “but now we have to develop new plans within the HSE to deliver services in a different way”.Testing turnaroundThe turnaround time for testing has significantly improved, Mr Reid said. End-to-end turnaround from the time a person reports symptoms to a result is now a median of 1.8 days, down from two days the previous week.For tests processed in hospital labs, the turnaround time is 1.5 days in the community, the average time is 2.3 days.Some 86 per cent of tests are processed end-to-end within three days, just short of the 90 per cent target.Last week, 1,500 calls were made as part of the contact-tracing operation, and 255 close contacts were sent for testing. Of these, 14 tested positive, and 90 per cent of this group were asymptomatic.“Many thousands of lives” were saved through social distancing, lockdown measures, proper hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette, intensive care consultant Dr Catherine Motherway said.Despite starting with a low number of critical care beds by international standards, hospitals were able to treat all patients needing care and were at no point overwhelmed.The crude mortality rate of those who were admitted to intensive care was 20 per cent, which compares quite well internationally, she said. Ninety-nine per cent had underlying conditions.However, next winter will be “difficult” so it was vital to recruit critical care nurses and create new capacity, she said. Ultimately, critical care capacity needed to be doubled.There are currently 226 patients in hospital with confirmed or suspected Covid-19, including 32 in intensive care.Some 734 beds in hospitals are free, including 91 in intensive care, according to HSE chief operations officer Anne O’Connor.The future of the Citywest isolation facility, where just 16 patients are being cared for by 21 staff, was being considered in the context of the winter plan, she said.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4277638.1591974944!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"government considers making face masks a condition of travel on public transport","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar said he would prefer to rely on the willingness of Irish people to comply with guidelines on masks rather than to go into a situation where people were being ordered to comply. Photograph: Brian LawlessPA WireThe Government is exploring the possibility of making face masks compulsory on public transport.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said on Friday that work is being done to see if wearing masks can be “a condition of travel on public transport”.He said that achieving that was not entirely straightforward as there were public transport bylaws, health laws and other considerations.He said there were pluses and minuses to making the wearing of masks mandatory. He said they were not suitable for children under 13, or those with breathing difficulties, or for some with disabilities.He said the Government had given very strong advice they should be worn in places with restricted space and on public transport. He said he would prefer to rely on the willingness of Irish people to comply with guidelines rather than to go into a situation where people were being ordered to comply.“I really don’t want to be into a position where we are fining or prosecuting people for not wearing face masks.“We ask people to follow public health advice.“If you are on public transport wear a mask for face covering,” he said.The Cabinet is also considering partially lifting the 14-day quarantine period for people arriving into Ireland from countries where the coronavirus is under control on June 29th.Mr Varadkar has previously raised the prospect of opening up such air corridors or air bridges, which would effectively allow Irish people to go on foreign holidays to certain countries.It is understood the initial phase would only apply to European Union countries.While a decision was not expected to be taken by the Cabinet during its meeting on Friday, it is understood a memo to the meeting envisaged the quarantine period for such countries would be dropped when Phase 3 of the Covid-19 restrictions starts on June 29th.On Thursday, Mr Varadkar said Ireland might be almost fully open by the middle of July, rather than the middle of August. He told the Dáil the positivity rate in tests for coronavirus was less than 1 per cent, down from a peak of 20 per cent.Nursing home visitsEarlier on Friday, chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said people might be able to visit relatives in nursing homes from next week.Nursing homes have been given guidance and advice on allowing visitors and should be in a position to implement that advice from next week he told RTÉ radio’s Morning Ireland.The scale of deaths in care home settings in the Republic was at the lower end when compared with the experience of other European countries, he said, adding Ireland was being compared with countries that had not reported Covid-19 deaths as comprehensively.Dr Holohan also said the clarity of communication on the wearing of face coverings needed to be stepped up. A campaign was being unveiled to advise the public on the importance of wearing face coverings on public transport, in shops and in places where physical distancing was difficult to maintain.To date, there had been a very high level of compliance by the public, and the virus had been suppressed, but face coverings were just one measure on which there should be more focus, he said.There had been a decrease in the level of transmission with each person who was infected passing it on to fewer people, he added.If there was a resurgence of the virus, Dr Holohan said he would not propose restrictions like those introduced in March because comparisons could be made by looking at the experiences of other countries and the population’s behaviour. “We would know what specific measures to take.”As other countries had eased restrictions, there had been downward trends of rates of transmission across most European countries, he added.Earlier on Newstalk Breakfast, Dr Holohan had warned that people should not become complacent while wearing face masks.“One of things we do have concern about is that if people feel if they wear a mask, it’s a little bit like a hurling helmet – are you going to put yourself in more danger when you have a helmet on because you feel a little bit more invincible.”He said it was important people did not think like that. Face masks were an added measure on top of other measures that were important such as hand hygiene and physical distancing.Dr Holohan said that when he visited his local Dunnes Stores he wore a face mask. “I don’t particularly like doing it myself, if I’m very honest with you.”On the issue of working from home, Dr Holohan urged anyone who can work from home to continue to do so. “People shouldn’t drift back to work on the basis that they’re now coming back to the office because the risk of this has receded.Ireland has “almost zero” new cases of Covid-19 and all indicators of the disease are either stable or declining, three weeks into the easing of restrictions, public-health officials have said.Vowing to “go as low as we possibly can” towards eliminating the disease, Dr Holohan said he did not believe there were hidden clusters “out there”, separate from the small number of daily cases now being reported.The National Public Health Emergency Team will meet next Thursday to finalise advice to Government on the “rephasing” of the easing of restrictions.Its recommendations are expected to provide further clarity on a variety of issues, including a possible easing of the two-metre social-distancing rule, the reopening of hairdressers, rules around weddings and the reopening of the offshore islands.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"FF, FG and Greens close to reaching agreement on coalitionDecrease in assaults, threats to murder and harassment since March, figures showThe community taxi service is back on the city\u0026rsquos streets \u0026ndash but with reduced capacityNumber of water schemes at drought levels has increased from 27 to 30 despite recent rainFrustration mounts around final sign-off of programme for government\u0026rsquos exact textPrincipal responds as racist video made by girls from Our Lady\u0026rsquos Bower resurfacesDr Peter Boylan criticises \u0026lsquoshambles\u0026rsquo of plans to move to St Vincent\u0026rsquos under Nicky KearnsTeachers\u0026rsquo unions concerned at full-time return via \u0026lsquoclass bubble\u0026rsquo instead of social distancingWarning comes after news of Daniel Kinahan\u0026rsquos role in organising major boxing matchDolores Cahill promised to \u0026lsquodebunk\u0026rsquo pandemic in interview with alt-right activistFine Gael opposing Bill on the basis that it would contravene EU trade agreementsSector plans to reopen to visitors from Monday following closure since mid-MarchIncrease in hospital waiting list figures for May as a result of pandemicDepartment of Foreign Affairs travel documents not yet provided for two-month-oldMalahide 10-week pilot initiative aims to encourage social distancingRepublic reports three further deaths and 13 more cases as CSO releases regional dataCommission to report in October after pandemic blamed for \u0026lsquodeeply disappointing\u0026rsquo delayMale voice heard saying: \u0026ldquoYou f**k off and \u0026ldquoput a stop to it during evidenceStudy aims to harvest information on brain tumours from 9,000 Irish patients, many of whom are deadEamon Ronald Harrison (23) is wanted by Essex police to face 39 counts of manslaughterStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4277788.1591984114!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"athlone schools facing online accusations of racism","story":"“It was like there was a death in the family,” said Noel Casey, principal of Our Lady’s Bower secondary school, Athlone, speaking after a staff meeting held this week to discuss online accusations of racism in the all-girls school. “Everyone is absolutely devastated,” Casey, who has been a member of the school staff since 1983, told The : “It’s been my life. I’m seriously shocked.”The school closed its Facebook, Twitter and Instagram accounts because of negative material that was being posted, including comment directed at three identified students from the school.The wave of criticism began early last week and has been directed at both Our Lady’s Bower and Athlone Community College, a co-educational school just across the road from the all-girls school.Both schools apologised after a nine-month-old video appeared online showing three white students using racist language. A fourth girl, who recorded the video, also attends one of the schools.The eight-second video was recorded in September 2019, when the girls were beginning second year. In it a girl jumps from a stairs into a hallway and says: “When I say slave, you say n****r.”Another girl then jumps into view and says “slave” after which a third girl lands in the hallway and says, “n****r”. Then the girls collapse into giggles and the video ends.The video was shared among friends on Snapchat. According to Casey, when the girls were next in school, black students confronted them about it. “I believe it was discussed at the time, and there was a resolution, and they apologised.”However, the video resurfaced in recent weeks when the Black Lives Matter protests started, seemingly in response to the girls expressing support on social media for the Black Lives Matters movement.“Someone said, how can you, when you did this?” The girls’ Snapchat addresses were also published.One of those who saw the video was Valerie Oyiki (22), who graduated from Our Lady’s Bower in 2014 and has since completed a degree in University College Dublin. Oyiki did not want to be interviewed for this article.She posted the video on her Instagram account, and noted that in 2013 the school had used students in blackface for a production of the musical, Hairspray.Oyiki did not make any complaint about her own treatment while at Our Lady’s Bower. However a series of responses to her posting were received from current and former students of the Athlone schools, alleging racist attitudes. These allegations can now be read online.People were invited to send an email to the Athlone Community College principal, Eileen Donohoe, about the video. An email response in which she said she had visited the home of the school’s student concerned, was published online.“I want to assure you that the girl and her parents are truly upset for the hurt caused. I can assure you that no malice or racist slur was intended. The comments uttered were without meaning or thought. Please accept my sincerity in dealing with this matter and I trust you will accept the apology from the student in question and her parents.”ExpelledOyiki set up a petition on Change.org with the headline, “Expel racists in Athlone Community College and Our Lady’s Bower Athlone”. As of Friday afternoon the petition calling for the students involved to be expelled had more than 5,200 signatures.The board of management of Our Lady’s Bower issued a statement on Monday saying it had learned that three students “were involved in the creation of a highly offensive video, outside of school hours in 2019, in which students used racist terms”.It was extremely shocked by this “and expresses its regret at the upset that this video has caused to the school community and to the wider community”.The 2013 school musical “had very regrettably used blackface to enable the performance. This was wholly unacceptable”.An independent review is being established to ensure the school is “a safe and inclusive environment for all”.In a statement also issued on Monday, Athlone Community College expressed “sincere regret” for the genuine hurt and upset that had been caused.Former Our Lady’s Bower student Minahil Sarfraz (18), who came to Ireland from Pakistan as a refugee, told The  she had nothing but praise for the school.“When I first saw the coverage, I was taken aback. Our Lady’s Bower always felt like home to me. Mr Casey has always supported us, and always made me feel safe and encouraged my activism.”Sarfraz and another former student, Natasha Maimba, who came to Ireland as a refugee from Zimbabwe, lived in direct provision while attending the school. They came to public prominence through the media while still students, and were appointed by Unicef as ambassadors for child refugees. They are both now attending third-level.“In my own case,” Sarfraz said, “all I can say is that the Bower always felt safe. It didn’t matter what religion or family background or skin colour you were.”Casey described the mood during Tuesday’s Zoom staff meeting as “sad, subdued, sombre”. The school policy was that “every student matters” and it was fully behind, and understood, the Black Lives Matter movement, he said.The staff response to what has happened was full agreement to “up our game”, he said.The plan is to have an appropriate body give the staff workshops on being more racially and culturally aware.“We understand that we have girls that feel aggrieved. It is obvious these are their real feelings. Maybe this was the kick in the pants that we needed.”The girls who made the video, he said, are “distraught”, hugely remorseful, and very aware of the trouble they have caused. “They have learned a huge lesson.”“I can understand people being outraged and wanting to go public,” Casey said. “But when you are putting children in harm, then there is possibly a loss of perspective. I am saying that with the greatest of respect. We are dealing with children. And that doesn’t justify making offensive, racist comments.”Dr Karl Kitching, of the school of education in Birmingham University, has studied racism in Irish schools. He said people of colour are not recognised as being “fully Irish” by the wider community.Schools need to take responsibility for dealing with racism, he said, “but on the other hand they are not sufficiently supported”.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4276600.1591879762!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"he needs to be allowed to come home irish man detained in china for 15 months","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe wife of the Irish businessman who is barred from  leaving China   met with Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney but says she has had no further feedback since the initial meeting. Photograph:     Pavel GolovkinAPThe wife of a Dublin businessman barred from leaving China for 15 months has made a direct appeal to the Irish Government to intervene and push for his release.Tara O’Halloran said her husband Richard has been largely confined to a hotel since an exit ban was imposed on him, the first of its kind in China against an Irish citizen.Speaking publicly about her husband’s detention for the first time, Ms O’Halloran said he has been caught up in complicated events that pre-date his time in the aviation leasing company he works for. She fears for his physical and mental health, and the risks he faces during the coronavirus pandemic given that he suffers from a lung condition.AccusedMr O’Halloran has been blocked from leaving the country over an investigation into Chinese businessman Min Jiedong, owner of Dublin-based China International Aviation Leasing Service (CIALS), the firm the Irish man works for, concerning peer-to-peer lending and crowd-funding.The authorities have accused Mr Min of illegally collecting money from the Chinese public in a crowd-funding scheme and using it to buy an aircraft, currently leased to an airline in Europe.Mr O’Halloran, who joined the company a year after the events under investigation, travelled to China in February 2019 to meet investors and assess the problems facing the firm. After a week of meetings in Shanghai, he was detained at passport control at the airport as he tried to board his flight back to Dublin. He was later issued with an exit ban.The businessman, a relative of former Fine Gael taoiseach Garret FitzGerald, has testified as a witness four times in the prosecution of Mr Min. However, he has not been permitted to leave China despite both the prosecutor and Mr Min telling the court he should be.The Chinese authorities argue that Mr O’Halloran promised to transfer the aircraft and leasing revenues connected to the plane back to the Irish company’s Chinese parent but has not done so.“Under this circumstance, Mr O’Halloran is restricted from leaving China by law,” the Chinese embassy in Dublin said in a statement.The embassy said the Chinese police and court are “actively investigating and handling the case of CIALS in order to protect the property rights and interests of the victims involved in the case.“It is hoped that Mr O’Halloran co-operates positively with the local authorities in Shanghai to bring this case to a successful conclusion at an early date,” it said.Ms O’Halloran says her husband is being asked to do something he cannot do under Irish law. “It is not possible . . . it is entirely out of his hands.”Ms O’Halloran says he has co-operated with the authorities in China and that it was “a matter for the authorities to bring matters to a speedy conclusion and to allow Richard to return home to his family”.FrustratedAfter an initial meeting with Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney and contacts with his department, Ms O’Halloran says the family have had no further feedback.“So far they have just paid lip service. My children want their dad back,” she says.She has been frustrated seeing the department helping bring others home.“With the Covid-19 pandemic, I see them repatriating everybody else from all over the world to come back to Ireland to be safe, yet they can’t get Richard home. He needs their help.”A spokeswoman for the Department of Foreign Affairs said: “We are aware of the case and are providing consular assistance. We do not comment on the details of inidual consular cases.”Ms O’Halloran said her husband missed the death of her mother in January, “nearly two lots of birthdays” and other important family occasions.His long absence has badly affected their four children, Ben (13), Amber (11), Isabella (eight) and Scarlett (six) who sleeps with a framed photo of her father.“It is very difficult for them to understand because we don’t know when he is coming home or even if, at this stage,” she says.Ms O’Halloran says her husband is permitted to leave his hotel but she fears the virus would “kill him” if he contracted it. He largely confines himself to his hotel room.“It has definitely taken a huge toll mentally and emotionally. It is horrific.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4277697.1591993545!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irish freedom party chair asked to resign from eu committee over covid 19 claims","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tProf Dolores Cahill claimed people who recover from Covid-19 are ‘immune for life’ after 10 days. Photograph: Nick BradshawThe A University College Dublin (UCD) professor, who chairs the Eurosceptic Irish Freedom Party, has been asked to resign from a leading European Union scientific committee over online claims she made about the Covid-19 pandemic.In an hour-long interview with a popular alt-right activist on May 10th, which has been viewed hundreds of thousands of times, Prof Dolores Cahill promised to “debunk the narrative” of the pandemic.Lockdown and social distancing is not needed to stop the spread of the virus, she said. People who recover are then “immune for life” after 10 days and deaths and illnesses could have been prevented by extra vitamins, she claimed.People with underlying health conditions, such as cystic fibrosis, could freely engage in society during the pandemic after spending a few weeks building up their immunity in this manner, she went on.Opposing vaccinations, Ms Cahill said “politicians and the media” are using Covid-19 “as a fear-mongering propaganda tool to try and take away rights from people and to make them more sick and to force vaccinations on us.”However, the European Commission said the claims made by Ms Cahill, a professor of translational medicine in UCD, could cause “significant harm”, if taken literally.‘Not compatible’Following this, Ms Cahill was asked to resign as vice chair of the Scientific Committee of the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI), a partnership between the European Commission and the drugs industry to promote new drugs.“Professor Cahill has been requested by the Chair of the Scientific Council of IMI and the Executive Director of IMI to step down from her function,” the commission told The .“While as a private person, Professor Cahill is entitled to express her points of view, these are not compatible with the scientific foundations of the Innovative Medicines Initiative,” said a Commission spokesperson.Ms Cahill’s claims have also caused Berlin’s Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics (MPIMG), where she worked for eight years, to distance itself, saying it did not want to be associated in any way with the claims made.The IMI echoed these sentiments, saying that they were “shocked” to see her statements and that her views do not reflect those hold on Covid-19 by of IMI.A former Max Planck colleague, Prof Hans Lehrach said he was “really surprised” by Ms Cahill’s comments: “I have no idea why she says things like that,” he said.“There is absolutely no proof that people recovering from the disease are immune for life,” he said, reflecting the World Health Organisation’s understanding on the subject.Vitamins and minerals do help the immune system, but Mr Lehrach said he would “very much doubt” that they would defend against the virus. The vulnerable would be “pretty insane” to engage widely during the pandemic.Hydroxychloroquine treatmentMs Cahill also supported the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat Covid-19, one that has been supported, too, by US president Donald Trump. The drug, she said, is “safe and effective” in treating the disease.However, Prof Lehrach said that he would be “very careful” with hydroxychloroquine as testing had proven that it is ineffective as a treatment and has been known to cause death due to heart complications.The original interview has since been removed by YouTube, but versions can still be found easily online and have clocked up hundreds of thousands of views. Ms Cahill has given a number of similar interviews since.Ms Cahill is a member of the faculty at UCD school of medicine, where she is the module co-ordinator on a number of subjects, including one taught to first-year medicine students called Science Medicine and Society.When approached for comment, UCD confirmed that she is part of the university’s faculty, but refused to comment further on her claims, saying only that they are “her own views”.Ms Cahill unsuccessfully contested the general election for the Irish Freedom Party in February, eliminated on the second count in Tipperary with a total of 527 votes.

File photograph: CollinsTalks were continued until after midnight amid expectation that an agreement would be concluded over the weekend, but also growing frustration that a final text had not yet been signed off by the negotiators.On Saturday, Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed said an agreement on a programme for government “is more likely than not at this stage.Fianna Fáil’s education spokesman Thomas Byrne said “substantial progress” had been made in the talks He told Newstalk Breakfast: “Agriculture was discussed last night, and there is progress being made on that an in relation to housing too”.Sources on all sides say that, barring last-minute hiccups, there are no substantial policy disagreements standing in the way of an agreement to form a coalition government, though talks on the precise text of the programme for government – expected to run to over 100 pages – will continue on Saturday and into Sunday, it is expected.If the leaders sign off on the deal it will then need to be approved by the parties.Green Party sources said Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael had given way on their demand for increased measures to reduce agricultural emissions, specifically biogenic methane. This was seen as crucial to the Greens in achieving their red line of a 7 per cent annual average reduction in carbon emissions to 2030.Some Fine Gael sources suggested their party was being cautious in not rushing into an agreement compared to Fianna Fáil’s willingness to do a deal and concede to many Green demands, while Fianna Fáil sources expressed impatience with what they said was Fine Gael “dragging its heels”.But it is on the Greens that most attention of political insiders is now focused. In particular, senior Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil politicians, including some involved in the talks, say they do not know if deputy leader Catherine Martin will ultimately back the deal she has been negotiating over the past five weeks. Her support is likely to be crucial to any deal being approved by the two-thirds majority needed among Green members.Both bigger parties say isions in the Greens are apparent in the talks, though Ms Martin tweeted on Friday night in support of party leader Eamon Ryan after he was fiercely criticised by some party members for quoting a racially demeaning word in an anti-racism speech in the Dáil. Sources pointed out Ms Martin had waited more than 24 hours before expressing support.Some Green sources say Ms Martin is keen to secure a deal she can support but others still said they had no clarity on whether she would back the deal."},{"url":null,"title":"remember brexit it s back and yes there s another impasse","story":"So Brexit is back in the news? Yes. The UK left the EU at the end of last year – so Brexit happened – but negotiations are now under way to try to agree the shape of its future relationship with the EU, particularly on trade. Because the UK entered a transition period after it left the EU not much has actually changed since then, but this is due to run out at the end of the year. The UK said formally on Friday that it would not seek an extension to the transition period – if this was to happen it had to be agreed by the end of June.But there are a few months left for talks still? There are. But the talks so far have made little progress, need to quickly get a new impetus if there is to be any chance of reaching a deal by the end of the year. There is to be an online conference between UK prime minister Boris Johnson and EU leaders on Monday, followed by intensified talks from the end of June. Trade deals are complicated and the EU side will need time to ratify any deal, so we could be heading for a period of drama in the autumn to try to finalise an agreement.What if there is no deal? If there is no deal then the UK leaves the EU trading bloc at the turn of the year. Trade would continue on what are called World Trade Organisation terms, meaning tariffs, which are special import levies, on trade between the EU and UK and a host of new customs procedures and delays. Some of these might apply anyway even if there was a deal, but a no-deal exit from the trading bloc would be more damaging. This would be like the no-deal Brexit we were threatened with at the end of last year, with a big impact on the Irish economy.The UK has said it will give some leeway to goods entering from the EU by not imposing full checks or requiring immediate tariff payments until July of 2021.What about the Irish Border? This is where a departure without a trade deal would be different from the no-deal Brexit feared last year. Under a special protocol agreed as part of the withdrawal agreement, the UK signed up to a new trading arrangement for Northern Ireland designed to avoid the need for Irish border checks and infrastructure, even if no trade deal is completed by the end of this year.How this will work is being agreed by a special committee, and here too there are difficulties. Minister of State for European Affairs Helen McEntee said in the Dáil recently that a recent paper from the UK, while it did provide some clarification, still left a lot of uncertainty in areas like customs, tariffs and VAT checks. Under the agreement, Northern Ireland will continue to follow EU single market rules for goods and will make the necessary checks on goods, food and animals entering the North from Britain. The EU is insisting these checks are full and detailed as there will be no further controls at the Irish Border when they enter the EU single market.What are the implications for Irish business if there is no trade deal concluded? It would be a hit for Irish exporters to the UK, particularly the food sector with McEntee estimating this week that tariffs of €1.35 billion would be imposed on annual Irish food exports to the UK, which are valued at around €5.2 billion. The beef sector, which would face the highest tariffs, would be most exposed and this would feed back to jobs in the Republic, cattle prices and farm incomes. All goods exporters and importers trading with the UK would face costly new procedures and potential delays. New tariffs on imports from the UK would push up supermarket prices, likely to cost shoppers more than €1,000 a year on average, according to an ESRI study. Given the economic uncertainties of surrounding coronavirus, a UK exit without a trade deal at the end of this year would threaten a double whammy to the Irish economy and particularly to rural Ireland.What are the sticking points in the talks? The key issue is the terms on which the UK would be given access to the EU’s single market and what price it would pay in terms of aligning with EU rules and regulations. The EU side argues that as it has left the EU, the UK can no longer have the same access as it did, and must sign up to what are called level playing field provisions – sticking by EU rules in areas such as labour rules, state aid to businesses and the environment – if it wants to do so. The UK says the EU is making unreasonable demands. Specific issues such as fisheries, which were due to be concluded by July 1st, complicate matters further. As was said many times last year, the clock is ticking.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches. See more here.

Video: RTÉ\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Minister for Education Joe McHugh: Depriving children of full-time education in September would possibly have a very negative impact on their development.  Photograph:  Leon FarrellPA Government plans to fully reopen all schools by September using “class bubbles” with no requirement for social distancing between pupils have caused alarm among teachers and principals.The new drive for a resumption of full-time education will mean a radical departure from current public health advice.But Minister for Education Joe McHugh insisted the guidelines, to be published later this month, will not put the health of school staff at risk.A Department of Education study brought to Cabinet on Friday argued even if the current two-metre distancing requirement was reduced to one metre, primary school students would still only be allowed to attend school for 2½ days out of five.In secondary schools, certain year groups would be able to attend only 50 per cent of the time. Under the current two-metre rule, pupils in primary schools could only attend one day a week, while secondary students could attend for two days.Depriving pupilsMr McHugh grounded his argument on a dramatic departure from the current rules by saying depriving children of full-time education in September would possibly have a very negative impact on their development.Class bubbles would not mix with others and physical distancing requirements would only apply in other parts of schools such as yards.Mr McHugh’s push for full resumption could put the Government on a collision course with public health advice.Some parents and opposition parties complained his comments sparked confusion and gave conflicting signals about the relaxation of social distancing rules.‘Classrooms are workplaces’Sinn Féin’s Donnchadh Ó Laoghaire said parents and teachers were at a loss following the announcement. “Firstly, they are telling us how many children would return to school with one metre, and then telling us that social distancing is not a runner in schools.”Teachers’ unions warned any deviation from public health advice would be “unacceptable”.The Teachers’ Union of Ireland (TUI) criticised the reopening plans as “odd and alarming”, saying they paid “insufficient attention to public health advice”.“Classrooms are workplaces – crowded ones at that. These workplaces cannot be treated as if they enjoy some magical immunity from the risk that characterises other workplaces,” TUI president Séamus Laharte said.The Association of Secondary Teachers Ireland said it would be very concerned if physical distancing in schools deviated from what existed in wider society.The Irish National Teachers’ Organisation (INTO) said there is was a need for clearer guidance and protocols\u0026nbspfor teachers over the coming weeks, while the Irish Primary Principals’ Network also said it was disappointed at the lack of definitive guidelines and clarity.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said the Government was retaining the current travel restrictions, which require 14 days’ quarantine, but would review them in two weeks’ time. He raised the possibility of establishing “air bridges” with other EU countries which have suppressed the virus.There were 13 new cases of Covid-19 and three deaths reported on Friday.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Social media giant says China ran network of accounts to spread misinformationTwo years after Trump-Kim summit minister says peace hopes are now \u0026lsquodark nightmare\u0026rsquoThere had been repeated calls by the Maori community to remove statue of John HamiltonLam warns city cannot afford further \u0026lsquochaos\u0026rsquoalmost 9,000 aged 11- 84 arrested in protests over past yearDecision marks a setback in relations amid efforts to persuade North to give up nuclear weapons programmeSouth Pacific nation of 5m declared it was coronavirus free on MondayHospitals feel the strain as lockdowns are eased despite fears of a spike in infectionsHolidaymaker said he stumbled into abandoned well after being chased by wild dogMan (60) dies some 500 miles north of Sydney after board-riders pull him to shoreLarge crowd gathers shortly after legislature outlaws insults to China\u0026rsquos national anthemTrump administration has presented China with \u0026lsquoopportunities\u0026rsquo on the world stageStorm made landfall further south than expected giving some respite to metropolis ravaged by coronavirusDeath at Wuhan\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquowhistleblower hospital\u0026rsquo prompts wave of anger at hospital authoritiesSchools in deprived areas reported girls using newspapers and rags in attempt to manage periodAnnual vigil to mark Tiananmen Square massacre cancelled but activists still plan to rallyOfficials and media say US criticism of Hong Kong policing illustrates double standardsExperts fear country\u0026rsquos caseload could reach 1m in several weeks if virus is not curbedBejing approved decision to create laws for Hong Kong to curb sedition, secession, terrorismMove paves way for anti-sedition laws which rights advocates say will threaten city\u0026rsquos freedomsAt least 69 cases this week linked to cluster of infections at logistics facilityStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Demonstrations against prices and wages erupt in Sweida and spread to DeraaAnnexation would be incompatible with international law, Maas warnsTerror group ramps up attacks as crises including coronavirus provide opportunityGovernment pressed to speed up talks with IMF and donors to secure funds and halt slideBritish-Iranian woman seeking release after first furlough from jail in Iran since 2016Police and security force officers killed in roadside bomb and gun battleHealth authorities confirm more than 3,000 new cases on two consecutive daysOpponents warn that US-backed plan would lead to independent Palestinian stateWar and coronavirus-ravaged country to get $1.35bn from UN and Saudi ArabiaTension rises in region with Israel planning to extend sovereignty to Jewish settlementsGiven lack of other options, authorities used restrictions as main tool to fight pandemicFormer cabinet minister Saad al-Jabri was strategic architect of Saudi counter-terrorism effortsPrime minister claims allegations are a \u0026lsquodeep-state\u0026rsquo, left-wing political witch-huntLong-serving politician will become first sitting prime minister in Israel\u0026rsquos history to stand trialPA president cites imminent threat of Israeli annexation of parts of the West BankFirebomb attack on home claimed the lives of a couple and their 18-month-old sonWHO forecasts coronavirus will kill 42,000 and infect most of 28 million populationRival Gantz to take over as prime minister of Israeli unity government after 18 monthsAshraf Ghani to lead country as rival Abdullah Abdullah oversees Taliban peace process, sources sayCeremony will end political deadlock that has dragged on for more than 500 daysStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4277901.1591990341!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"britain formally rejects extension to post brexit transition period","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish cabinet office minister Michael Gove has ruled out Britain applying for an extension to the post-Brexit transition period. Photograph: Stefan RousseauPA WireBritain has formally rejected an extension to the post-Brexit transition period and the EU has acknowledged the decision as definitive, so the standstill arrangement will end on December 31st. British cabinet office minister Michael Gove met European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic on Friday as the joint committee to implement the withdrawal agreement between the EU and the UK convened for the last time before the June 30th deadline for Britain to request an extension to the transition period.Mr Sefcovic said that although the EU remained open to extending the transition period, Mr Gove “was very clear, unequivocal, on the fact that the UK is not going to seek an extension”. “We take this decision as a definitive one,” Mr Sefcovic said.Britain said on Friday that it would phase in a light-touch customs regime for goods entering the UK from the EU, with full border controls not coming into force until July 2021. The freight transport industry welcomed the staggered introduction of controls, which the British government said was a response to the challenges presented by the coronavirus pandemic.“We have informed the EU today that we will not extend the transition period. The moment for extension has now passed,” Mr Gove said.\u0026nbsp“At the end of this year we will control our own laws and borders, which is why we are able to take the sovereign decision to introduce arrangements in a way that gives businesses impacted by coronavirus time to adjust. Today’s announcement is an important step towards getting the country ready for the end of the transition period.”Controlled imports such as tobacco and alcohol will be subject to full customs checks and tariffs from January, but importers of other goods will have six months to prepare customs declarations and pay tariffs.Devolved governments rowThe Scottish and Welsh governments, which have called for an extension of the transition period, withdrew from planned talks with the British government about Brexit strategy on Friday evening.“We cannot accept a way of working in which the views of the devolved governments are simply dismissed before we have had a chance to discuss them. In reality, the meetings we have had have simply been an opportunity for the UK government to inform us of their views, not to listen or respond to ours,” they said.British prime minister Boris Johnson will hold talks by video on Monday with European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, European Council president Charles Michel and European Parliament president David Sassoli. The two sides have scheduled six meetings over the summer, with negotiating rounds on the future EU-UK trading relationship in August, September and October, alternating between London and Brussels if health restrictions allow.“With some six months to go before the end of the transition period we still have lots of work to do. This is true for all work streams, but in particular with regard to the Protocol on Northern Ireland and Ireland. The window of opportunity to put in place the operational measures needed to ensure that the protocol can function as intended on January 1st, 2021, is rapidly closing,” Mr\u0026nbspSefcovic said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

The figures suggest just one in 1,600 people have coronavirus, down from one in 1,000 in a week. The move on the two-metre rule has come amid growing Government concern over the state of the

metre rule can be axed, adding: What we\u0027re looking for is the moment when we\u0027ve got the numbers... down so far that we can really say that the two-metre rule is no longer necessary.We are doing a review right now and obviously, as we make further progress, I hope to say more.It came as Sage set out how businesses could mitigate risks in situations in which two-metre face-to-face distancing cannot be achieved. The papers, released by its environmental and modelling group, show that a distance of two metres is safer than one in reducing the risk of virus transmission.The research suggests that with the right safety measures – including good ventilation, regular breaks, wearing of masks and the right positioning of staff so they do not directly face each other – risks can be significantly reduced.Earlier this month, a major Lancet study found the risk of infection is 1.3 per cent at two metres or 2.6 per cent at one metre. But the new research says this does not consider the positioning of the person – meaning the way they are facing – or how the virus is likely to be transmitted.When people are at close range and face to face, transmission is most likely to be through respiratory droplets, but aerosol transmission of fine particles can carry further depending on ventilation. The new research says that sitting within one metre of a person side by side or back to back is as safe as facing a person at two metres when indoors. When people are side to side or behind one another, risk is via aerosols and so is determined by the influence of ventilation at one metre the exposure risks would be similar to two metres when face to face in an indoor environment, it says.One business source said civil servants had been in touch in recent days asking if they would kick up a fuss if the Government cut the distance to one metre.Government sources confirmed the calls had taken place but they said they were part of the usual liaison with business groups, adding that there is always business stakeholder engagement, asking \u0027just how badly do you feel about this\u0027 to gauge reaction.Mr Johnson has said the overall rate of infections and rates of new hospital admissions would be key to the decision. On Friday, the Scottish Secretary, Alister Jack, became the first Cabinet minister to admit publicly that he would like to see the two-metre social distancing rule relaxed.He said more tourism businesses would remain viable if the two-metre social distancing rule was halved, adding: As soon as it is possible to do so with the \u0027R\u0027 number suppressed, I would like to see it move to one metre.I think, to get back to something to near normal in the way that we conduct our lives and our businesses, as we see the virus recede – and we\u0027ve seen this happen without any bad consequences in other European countries – we should move to one metre when the time is right.Rishi Sunak, the Chancellor, Grant Shapps, the Transport Secretary, and Alok Sharma, the Business Secretary, are all said to be pushing Mr Johnson privately for the change.Meanwhile, the UK tourism industry has warned that the two-metre rule risks turning holiday hotspots into ghost towns. Tourism Alliance, which represents more than 200,000 businesses, said the current guidance would lead to a wave of business closures and redundancies.More from

healthy people, experts warned on Friday.New-onset diabetes is being observed in patients who have tested positive for the virus, an international group of 17 leading diabetes experts wrote in a letter published in the New England Journal of Medicine published on Friday.It remains unclear exactly how the virus that causes Covid-19, impacts diabetes.But research has shown that ACE-2, the protein that binds to SARS-Cov-2 allowing the virus to enter human cells, is not only located in the lungs but also in organs and tissues involved in glucose metabolism such as the pancreas, the small intestine, the fat tissue, the liver and the kidney.Researchers believe that by entering these tissues, the virus may cause multiple and complex dysfunctions of glucose metabolism.It has also been known for many years that virus infections can precipitate type 1 diabetes.A Global Registry of new cases of diabetes in patients with Covid-19 dubbed the CoviDiab Registry project has now been established.Francesco Rubino, Professor of Metabolic Surgery at King’s College London and co-lead investigator of the CoviDiab Registry project, said some Covid-19 patients who are testing positive for the disease in hospital already had the disease but were not aware.“That\u0027s obviously a possibility and they discover they have diabetes because they present in a hospital and they get checked and also because the infection actually raises their sugars even more,” he told The . However he said the number of Covid-19 patients being diagnosed with diabetes is “actually higher than you would expect from unknown diabetes being identified on admission to a hospital”. Prof Rubinon suggested that some of those patients who have developed diabetes had a predisposition for the condition and that additional damage to their metabolism that is caused by  Covid-19 has created a critical mass of dysfunction and generated in full blown clinically apparent disease. Alternatively, he said patients may have no particular dysfunctions and the virus  was efficient enough to generate this disease by itself.  Prof Rubino added: We are of course trying to understand what situation is behind the observations. Emerging evidence has also suggested that coronavirus causes severe complications for patients with pre-existing diabetes. Diabetes is associated with an increased risk of Covid-19 severity and mortality - between 20 and 30 per cent of patients who died having tested positive for the virus have been reported to have diabetes.Prof Rubino added: “Diabetes is one of the most prevalent chronic diseases and we are now realizing the consequences of the inevitable clash between two pandemics.“Given the short period of human contact with this new coronavirus, the exact mechanism by which the virus influences glucose metabolism is still unclear and we don’t know whether the acute manifestation of diabetes in these patients represent classic type 1, type 2 or possibly a new form of diabetes.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"exclusive super sized housing developments set fast tracked","story":"Major housing developments could be fast-tracked through the planning system under post-pandemic proposals being discussed by ministers.Developments of 1,000 homes or more could require fewer consents under a blueprint, seen exclusively by The , which also proposes cutting the time members of the public have to scrutinise them from six months to four.The proposals aim to allow construction to begin within 12 months of the moment plans are submitted.This could be done by expanding the remit of Development Consent Orders (DCOs), which are currently reserved for major nationally significant infrastructure. DCOs remove the need for projects to obtain a number of different consents, enabling a faster process. Under the draft proposals, they would be used for dual carriageways, waste processing sites, railways and housing developments of more than 1,000 homes.The  understands that Simon Clarke, the housing minister, has been discussing the plans as part of the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government\u0027s work for a forthcoming White Paper on planning.The plans originated in a post-virus recovery paper presented this month to Number 10\u0027s policy unit by the Unlock Britain Commission, led by Conservative MP Bim Afolami.The paper calls for reform of the Byzantine planning system and says using DCOs to speed up the process should become the norm rather than the exception for all infrastructure development of certain types.It proposes changing the Planning Act to require all developments of infrastructure to use the DCO process unless they have a particular reason not to and adds: To make that a meaningful change, the DCO process must be made suitable for infrastructure development that is not deemed a nationally significant infrastructure project.The Number 10 policy unit is currently working on ideas for a speech by Boris Johnson which would set out the recovery road map for Britain next month.Writing for the , Mr Afolami, a Government aide to the Pensions Secretary, said: By doing this, we can ensure that infrastructure projects and large housing developments can move from planning to starting construction within 12 months.A convoluted, expensive and uncertain planning system is a real hindrance to spreading and growing the economic opportunity that our people really need.Ministers consider planning reform to be one of the ways to get the economy going again, with work ongoing in Number 10, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government.Robert Jenrick, the Housing Secretary, this week called for a rethink of the overly bureaucratic planning system, which he said he wants to speed up and simplify.He said: As Housing Secretary, I want everyone, no matter where in the country they live, to have access to affordable, safe, and high-quality housing, and to live in communities with a real sense of place. It\u0027s time to rethink planning from first principles.The Unlock Britain Commission\u0027s post-Covid recovery blueprint includes a number of other ideas for reform, including changing the rules for stocks and shares Isas, allowing them to invest into private companies not listed on the stock market as a way of freeing up financing.A streamlined planning process should be used for a much greater range, and size, of infrastructure, the paper says, adding that it would become much faster, cheaper and easier to build.The paper also proposes plans to boost skills, writing off student loans for graduates of STEM subjects who spend at least five years working in STEM-specialised occupations.It suggests a number of measures to reform local government, including a league table to rank local authorities on specific categories including how quickly they fill potholes, with sanctions for repeated worst performers.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"george osborne stands editor evening standard","story":"The former chancellor George Osborne has stood down from his role as editor of the Evening Standard. He is to continue with the paper in the role of editor-in-chief, but will be replaced as editor by Emily Sheffield, according to the BBC.Mr Osborne said: After three wonderful years I’m stepping down as Evening Standard editor to become editor-in-chief.Thanks to the team who’ve made the paper a must read and helped me steer it through the greatest crisis in its history, never missing an edition and producing some of its finest journalism.Congratulations to Emily Sheffield on becoming the new editor of the Evening Standard.

The 30-minute episode was put under review with the possibility that offending sections would be edited out.UKTV made a dramatic U-turn last night, announcing that the episode would return in the coming days featuring a warning for potentially offensive content and language.Cleese, who co-wrote the show and played the lead character Basil Fawlty, said the BBC was pacifying moral panic in the wake of Black Lives Matter instead of standing by the series.Following a backlash at a string of programmes being pulled, the BBC last night announced that guidance and warnings would be used instead of ousting classic comedies that were now deemed offensive.It said: We recognise that more contextual information can be required on our archive comedy. We will be adding extra guidance and warnings to highlight potentially offensive content and language.The Monty Python star said the corporation was stupid for not understanding satire and pandering to moral outcry.The Fawlty Towers episode pulled by BBC subsidiary UKTV first aired in 1975, and included one of the hotel\u0027s residents, Major Gowen, using racial epithets when telling a story about watching a Test match against India.Cleese pointed out that having a character spout unpalatable opinions was not broadcasting their views but making fun of them. He added: If they can\u0027t see that, if people are too stupid to see that, what can one say?A lot of the people in charge now at the BBC just want to hang on to their jobs. If a few people get excited they pacify them rather than stand their ground as they would have done 30 or 40 years ago.UKTV said the offending episode had been temporarily removed as it reviewed older content to ensure it met audience expectations. Since the removal of The Germans, box sets of the show have risen in the Amazon bestsellers chart, as have other programmes recently pulled by the BBC in the wake of protests, including Little Britain and The League of Gentlemen.Cleese voiced support for Black Lives Matter, saying: The best parts of the George Floyd protests have been very moving and very, very powerful.There is a huge swell of anger and a really admirable feeling that we must make our society less discriminatory, and I think that part is very good. But he questioned the cost of purging historical items deemed to be problematic under moral criteria, which had already seen statues being taken down.He said: Sir Isaac Newton had shares in the South Sea Company, which indulged in many different types of trading, and some of it, disgracefully, was slavery. So are we going to get rid of Newton\u0027s Opticks on the grounds that it\u0027s not really sound any more because he held shares in a company that dealt in slaves?The Greeks in 500BC felt that culture, or any kind of real civilisation, was only possible because of slavery - does that mean we should take down statues of Socrates?

Those in positions of authority are scrambling to show they are addressing endemic racism, and in the commercial sphere, not ending up on the wrong side of the debate and risking Twitter storms and boycotts. In a world where nothing is exempt from moral judgment, being on trend means signing up to radical political movements.That is what Black Lives Matter is. Don’t take my word for it. Take theirs. The form of words that appears on most online posts connected to the group riffs on ‘the black radical tradition’ which counts among its past contributors the Black Panther Movement and Malcom X. BLM happily self-identifies as a neo-Marxist movement with various far left objectives, including defunding the police (an evolution of the Panther position of public open-carry to control the police), to dismantling capitalism and the patriarchal system, disrupting the Western-prescribed nuclear family structure, seeking reparations from slavery to redistribute wealth and via various offshoot appeals, to raise money to bail black prisoners awaiting trial. The notion of seizing control of the apportionment of capital, dismantling the frameworks of society and neutralising and undermining law enforcement are not just Marxist, but anarchic.Desperate to appease a vociferous clamour, celebrities and companies are queuing up to endorse. Airbnb has donated hundreds of thousands of dollars, an ironic move for a company that enables profiting from real estate through casual lets, driving up rental prices and gentrifying neighbourhoods, impacting on affordable leases in inner cities. Nike, which has come under fire for using sweatshops to manufacture unaffordable, ‘aspirational’ footwear to pitch to the poorest in society, is now striving for racial equality. Amazon has banned the police from using their facial recognition software in tackling crime, yet are happy to push for greater intrusion in the private sphere.UK tea manufacturers, whose business was built on the back of slavery and operate under neo-colonial plantation models where tea is grown and picked through agrarian toil in the developing world to be shipped for production, packaging and profits in the West have jumped on the hashtag #Solidaritea. Post-truth absurdity is where we have reached. Yet as companies commercially conflate the tagline Black Lives Matter, with the movement Black Lives Matter, momentum builds for an organisation with little scrutiny or accountability, that is able to mobilise millions and encourage, wilfully or not, outpourings of vandalism, looting and violence across the West.With enormous sums of money flooding in - BLM had already received over $100 million from the Open Society Foundations, Ford Foundation and Borealis Philanthropy among others - and many written aims straight from the Communist copybook, there is surely reason for concern. Black Lives Matter is a somewhat amorphous and decentralised movement, allowing international chapters to set up under their banner. Not having a structure, a figurehead or centralised financial control means there is absolutely no accountability. Nobody to call for an end to violence, while providing a moral shield behind which perpetrators of crime can feel emboldened.But decentralisation does not mean disorganisation. Even with a captive audience under lockdown filled with frustration, sparking a range of parallel protests across the West still demands highly skilled choreography. The sort of operation that requires thousands of avatars to flood social media platforms with calls to action, that can target and penetrate entire demographics simultaneously across a range of countries. That is simply not possible by a group of well meaning activists, however romantic about a cause you may wish to be. It can be achieved using extremely high level, sensitive intelligence equipment of the kind deep state operatives have access to.Throughout history civil rights movements have been either aided and abetted or exploited by Communist foreign actors, from the American civil rights movement to apartheid in South Africa. By sowing discord in countries, socialist activists have hoped to nurture fertile grounds for socio-political fecundity. It is well within the realms of possibility that state-backed cyber warfare emanating from Russia and China would want to exploit and exacerbate mounting discontent while the West is still reeling from the pandemic.A once small American movement that witnessed bursts of activity after inidual cases of perceived police brutality has become the most prominent protest movement in Europe, and polarises societies wherever it goes. Unlike predecessors that often fell on the swords of their figureheads, this movement remains impervious to the accountability of a leader, because there are many. What we do know of the few founding members is that many are connected to radical Left organisations. An FBI report released in 2017 found that attacks on police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and Dallas, Texas were influenced by the Black Lives Matter movement, with 28 pe rcent of those who used deadly force against police officers motivated by a hatred of police. An unclassified FBI study following the Dallas cop-killing spree of 2016 that left 5 officers shot dead reported departments and inidual officers increasingly taking the decision to stop proactive policing amid concerns that anti-police defiance fueled in part by movements like Black Lives Matter had become the “new norm.”The sight of missiles being thrown at unarmed British police, with entire ranks forced to retreat from a baying mob should leave anybody who values national and community security with chills. Footage of an attack against a police officer and his colleague in Hackney attempting to apprehend an assault suspect showed members of the public filming the incident while one joined the fracas with a baseball bat. As statues are torn down and lists of demands are drawn up, sleepwalking towards lawlessness must terrify many members of the public.The difficulty in raising criticism or calling for scrutiny of the movement, despite pulling in unimaginable revenue and endorsement from the biggest corporates, biggest names and most prominent political appeasers, is that it leaves the accuser open to being censored and attacked as a racist. As the movement establishes organised chapters across the West, is emboldened to make explicit commitments to extreme forms of socialism and anarchy, and generates a head of steam against the very structures and protections that have guarded Western society for decades, if all opposition is silenced and checks and balances swept aside, reversing a nascent tidal wave of mob rule will take significant and disturbing levels of force.I support those who genuinely want to make the world a less prejudiced and more equal place, but there are many reasons to be concerned that Black Lives Matter is not enabling this, and instead is fostering ision, chaos and destruction designed to bring the West to its knees - something that will harm the very people the movement purports to protect.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"science right government wrong","story":"According to the WHO, there are two pandemics raging across the world. The first is the one we’re all familiar with, but the second is more insidious – the explosion of fake news about the virus. “We’re not just fighting an epidemic,” said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on February 15. “We’re fighting an infodemic.”This theme was taken up by the UK Press Gazette which launched a “Fight the Infodemic” campaign on June 3. “The aim is stop key platforms like Facebook, Google and Twitter from promoting misinformation about vital issues like Covid-19 and instead to favour evidence-based journalism from bona fide outlets,” wrote the editor Dominic Ponsford.What surprised me about this is that the biggest fake news about the virus has been disseminated by the mainstream media. I’m thinking of the myth that the government’s scientific advisors urged Boris Johnson to impose a full lockdown long before March 23 and it was only because he ignored them that Britain has one of the highest Covid death tolls globally.This narrative received a boost on Wednesday when professor Neil Ferguson, a key member of SAGE before he was forced to resign, told MPs that if the government had locked down a week earlier the death toll would be considerably lower.“The epidemic was doubling every three to four days before lockdown interventions were introduced,” he told a select committee. “So had we introduced lockdown measures a week earlier, we would have reduced the final death toll by at least a half.”But if Professor Ferguson believes that, why didn’t he say so at the time? I’ve looked at the minutes of the SAGE meetings leading up to March 23 and there isn’t any evidence that the scientific attendees, including Ferguson, were urging the government to impose full lockdown.Various different social distancing measures were discussed by SAGE, but no one in the group recommended quarantining the entire population. The measures talked about were home isolation of symptomatic iniduals and the cocooning of the over 70s – both of which were introduced by the government on March 16.The penultimate SAGE meeting before the lockdown was on March 18 where it was noted that the impact of the measures introduced so far would not be known for two or three weeks. According to the minutes, the boffins said it was too early to say whether additional measures – such as closing pubs, restaurants and entertainment venues – would be necessary.In short, Boris Johnson and his Cabinet were not “following the science” when they took the decision to place everyone under virtual house arrest, and nor were they ignoring it by not doing so earlier. On the contrary, their scientific advisors were urging a more cautious approach.In the SAGE meeting on March 23, the day lockdown was announced, the attendees flagged up the negative impact of the containment measures. “Actuarial analysis is required to estimate deaths caused indirectly by Covid-19, including those caused by the social interventions,” says one of the minutes. Another says: “Given the clear links between poverty and long-term ill health, health impacts associated with the economic consequences of interventions also need to be investigated.”Some will point to the report by Professor Ferguson and his Imperial College team, warning the government that hundreds of thousands would die if it stuck with its mitigation strategy. But that paper stopped short of calling for a full lockdown. The measures it recommended were precisely those introduced by the government on March 16. As the journalist Christopher Snowdon notes, “The only time Ferguson and colleagues use the word ‘lockdown’ in the text is when they are making a distinction between their proposals and an actual lockdown.”What’s so odd about Professor Ferguson’s remarks on Wednesday is there’s no reason to think infections were doubling every three or four days in the week before lockdown. Simon Wood, professor of statistical science at Bristol University, published a paper on June 1 showing that the R number in England and Wales was less than 1 before March 23. The same conclusion has been reached by Carl Heneghan, professor of evidence-based medicine at Oxford.In other words, the containment measures introduced on March 16 were more than sufficient to halt the spread of the virus. The government’s scientific advisors did not urge the Prime Minister to go any further, and they were right not to do so. I’m convinced that the decision to place the entire country in suspended animation on March 23 will end up costing more lives than the pandemic.The myth that’s grown up around the lockdown, then, is the opposite of the truth. Boris didn’t turn a deaf ear to the scientists urging him to lock down. Rather, he ignored their advice to tread carefully and rushed into one of the worst decisions in our history.

What we should be worrying about is the kind of economy we are going to find ourselves in when the acute phase of the crisis is over says Ben ChuThe estimated hit to UK economic activity in April is truly massive – “gargantuan” in the words of one analyst, “devastating” says another.The loss of a fifth of economic output in a single month fully justifies those adjectives.But beyond the headline, what do the figures actually mean?Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhat should we be focusing on?The story of the UK’s unprecedented GDP collapse in five chartsIt’s important to recognise that this recession is not normal in the sense that they are usually brought on by something taking place essentially within the economy itself – a financial crisis, a loss of confidence by consumers, a spike in the cost of borrowing etc.In this case, it has been created by a government-ordered lockdown to contain a new disease and this has prevented huge swathes of normal economic activity taking place.Some argue that most of the activity would have ceased in any case as people stopped going to work and restaurants and travelling and so on because of the risk of catching the coronavirus.That’s debatable, but even if that is correct the essential fact remains that this is not a normal recession.And that matters because it means the level of activity has been, in a sense, artificially constrained.When the economy opens up, as it is now starting to, a large amount of economic activity will automatically return.So we can reasonably expect a majority of that lost 20 per cent of activity to return in the subsequent months as people go back to work, schools and businesses reopen.However, that does not mean we can be relaxed about the economic outlook.

Demand for our exports seems likely to be feeble with the rest of the world largely struggling with a historic recession.It’s hard to see business investment recovering strongly with so many firms having been forced to take on more debt to ride out the lockdown.Even if most of the damage we are currently seeing in these GDP figures is reversed later in the year, we might still find ourselves grappling with what in normal circumstances would be considered an exceptionally weak economy.That’s what we should be worrying about – the kind of economy we are going to find ourselves in when the acute phase of the crisis is over. That’s what will matter most for our jobs and livelihoods over the coming years.It’s where the main challenge for economic policymakers – in the Treasury and the Bank of England – also resides.The crisis has effectively forced us to shut down huge sections of our economy. It was, in the eyes of most people, necessary to save lives.But we need to ensure that, as it restarts, we get back everything we have lost.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

This could be due to the delay between people experiencing symptoms and people being tested for Covid-19.Google has previously attempted to predict such trends through its nowcast function, which launched in 2008. A paper published in the scientific journal Nature at the time explained how people\u0027s search patterns could estimate flu prevalence two weeks before it was registered by official bodies like the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).As the world\u0027s most popular online search engine, the data from people\u0027s digital footprints offered potentially life-saving insights and it was the poster child of so-called \u0027Big Data\u0027. But by 2015 it was shut down after it failed to foresee a massive flu outbreak in 2013.UK now has more daily Covid-19 deaths than the rest of Europe combinedIt was described by some publications as an epic failure and a note on its landing page now states: Google Flu Trends and Google Dengue Trends are no longer publishing current estimates of Flu and Dengue fever based on search patterns...  It is still early days for nowcasting and similar tools for understanding the spread of diseases like flu and dengue – we\u0027re excited to see what comes next.A blog post explaining the decision said that Google would work directly with academic institutions to make sense of the search data. More than 265 peer-reviewed papers have since drawn on aggregated data taken from Google searches, used to track epidemics like Ebola in 2014, Zika in 2016 and West Nile fever over several years in Italy.

Also please wash the mask (with the electronics removed) between uses,” he wrote in the Medium post.The LED housing can be cleaned using ultraviolet light.Glaiel said that he had been working the concept of the mask for a month, and thought about making the LEDs react differently for high-pitched sounds compared to low-pitched sounds.He got the feature working, but said that it “didn’t look good”.“I’m not planning on selling them so you’ll have to make your own,” he added.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And there are no front footprints.”Professor Kyung Soo Kim, who also authored the paper alongside Jong Deock Lim, Seul Mi Bae and Anthony Romilio, corroberated Professor Lockley’s view.This is because of how deep the animal’s heel left an impression in the fossil.“Our trackways are very narrow-looking - more like a crocodile balancing on a tight-rope,” he told the BBC. “When combined with the lack of any tail-drag marks, it became clear that these creatures were moving bipedally.Created with Sketch.Science Photographer of the Year shortlist  Show all 9Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.19 Soap bubble structures showing light interference colours and patterningBubbles want to optimise space and minimise their surface area for a given volume of air.

The pin ionizes the air around it. When the electrons fall back on an atom, the excess energy is emitted as a photon, which generate the corona glow around the pin. The fuzziness of the pin is because the camera did not actually capture light reflected on the pin but rather the light emitted by the ionized light around it. - Richard Germain69 Calmness of EternityHimalayas mountains, Nepal.

Dinosaurs and their bird descendants walk on their toes. Crocodiles walk on the flat of their feet leaving clear heel impressions, like humans do.“However, the conclusion has not been accepted totally.”Look at any videos of living crocs and the rotation of their feet when they\u0027re galloping: it\u0027s outwards, not inwards towards the midline of the trackway. Just from their orientation, it looks more like some kind of dinosaurian track-maker to me.

Eight batches of Starlink satellites have been launched so far, with plans for them to eventually form a 12,000-strong constellation.Elon Musk says Mars-bound Starship spacecraft is now \u0027top priority\u0027In 2019, astrophysicist Dave Clements described the Starlink project as a tragedy for astronomy, claiming that the so-called megaconstellations of satellites would cause interference for both radio and optical telescopes.In response, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk said he was taking key steps to reduce their brightness, which are now being realised on the latest launch.SpaceX worked with the American Astronomical Society (AAS) to test different methods to address the issue. These included painting reflective surfaces black and using sun shades to block sunlight.The latest approach involves twisting the satellites during periods of their orbit when they are most reflective, so that only the knife-edge thin sides of the solar panels are visible.SpaceX told The Independent that it also worked with the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NROA) and the Green Bank Observatory (GBO) to minimise the impact of the satellites.Despite these measures, there will still be times that the satellites are visible to the unaided eye and will continue to be noticeable at certain times in the first week following their launch.We\u0027ve taken an experimental and iterative approach to reducing the brightness of the Starlink satellites.

The pop star has urged lawmakers to take down the statues, arguing that the “villains” they celebrate do not deserve them. “As a Tennessean, it makes me sick that there are monuments standing in our state that celebrate racist historical figures who did evil things,” Swift tweeted. “Edward Carmack and Nathan Bedford Forrest were DESPICABLE figures in our state history and should be treated as such.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesShe noted that Carmack, whose statue was torn down last week during protests, was “a white supremacist newspaper editor who published pro-lynching editorials and incited the arson of the office of Ida B Wells”.Demonstrators toppled the statue of Carmack, which stood outside the Tennessee Capitol, on 30 May. Around the US and in the UK, a number of statues celebrating slave owners and other figures with racist histories are being taken down in support of the Black Lives Matter movement. Swift suggested that Carmack’s statue be replaced with one of Wells for her “pioneering work in journalism and civil rights”.She also issued a condemnation of the state’s house committee for voting against the removal of a bust of Nathan Bedford Forrest, which has been branded “hideous” by US media.

Twitter, like Facebook and other major social media sites, is currently banned in China.“We should expect continued evolution and improvement, given the enormous resourcing the Chinese party‑state can bring to bear in aligning state messaging across its diplomacy, state media and covert influence operations.” the ASPI wrote.The research pointed out a number of tactics from the Chinese government to attempt to shape the information environment to its advantage,” including:The coordination of diplomatic and state media messagingThe use of Western social media platforms to seed disinformation into international media coverageThe immediate mirroring and rebuttal of Western media coverage by Chinese state mediaThe co‑option of fringe conspiracy media to target networks vulnerable to manipulationThe use of coordinated inauthentic networks and undeclared political ads to actively manipulate social media audiencesAdditional reporting by ReutersBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Unfortunately, not long after her return, jobs began to get cancelled because of the intensifying Covid-19 crisis.She started looking for something else right away – and is currently living and working on New Moor Farm in Southminster, Essex, working with asparagus, having swapped fashion for food.Though a far cry from a usual career, Philip is enjoying her new setting. “Right now, I live on site on the farm, in one of the caravans in the orchard. It’s nice,” she explains. “The community is amazing. There are so many different characters on the farm. Everyone is really friendly and we’re all here for the same reasons: to help and to work.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHer day-to-day routine varies. “Most days I’m up at five, start working at six on the farm, in the packhouse,” she says. “Generally, I’m doing a little bit of everything, so I’m helping on the line, bundling, helping customers, grading – just helping out wherever I can.”Philip is among Brits across the country working on farms in order to help the industry continue despite the many obstacles presented by the Covid-19 pandemic.The temporary closure of much of the food and hospitality industry has left huge quantities of fresh produce at risk of going to waste. The pubs and restaurants that would usually purchase large amounts of vegetables remain shut and travel restrictions have prevented pickers from overseas working on the farms.Join the Pick For BritainThat’s why the Government is urging fit and healthy people looking for work across the country to get involved. The Pick For Britain initiative is helping to bring workers and employers together to ensure the farming industry can continue.From furloughed employees whose contracts allow them to work during this time, to university students on their summer breaks, it’s a great opportunity to earn money and meet new people – while helping Britain’s food industry during these unprecedented times.The growing season is only just getting started, so from now until September, bringing in the harvest requires a major effort. Visit pickforbritain.org.uk to find out moreEat seasonal and local vegBut that’s not the only way to support the industry right now. Simply eating more in-season local produce will help to prevent wastage.A wide range of vegetables are currently being harvested in the UK. These include asparagus, cucumbers, mushrooms, courgettes, spinach, summer squash, radishes, beetroot and tomatoes – and buying and cooking with this seasonal veg is a great way to contribute to the farming industry.​In need of some recipe inspo?

That’s why there\u0027s never been a better time to try something new.Among the wide range of different species found in UK waters are mussels, crab, mackerel, herring, rainbow trout, hake and coley (or saithe).

Some 90 per cent of single parents are women.Victoria Benson, chief executive of Gingerbread, the leading single parent charity, who is a single mother herself, told The Independent the lockdown is seriously affecting her mental health.‘Support bubbles’ add to coronavirus lockdown confusionThe mother-of-four, who lives with four children aged between eight and 17, said: “Some days, I am unable to breathe because I’m so stressed. There is so much to do. It’s so busy. I woke up at 3am this morning and I’ve been up since 3am. I’ve only done two hours of school work with my eight-year-old daughter in two weeks. I feel really guilty. I feel worried she is slipping behind.“My daughter is really anxious. She asks me whether I am going to die and whether she is going to die. My teenagers are really anxious about their exams. I am finding it really stressful. My job is full-on. My eight-year-old daughter can’t work on her own. She needs me to educate her. It is impossible to do both that and work. It’s really tough not having another adult to share the load and share education with.”The charity executive welcomed the new social bubble rules but said there were a number of shortcomings – adding that many single parents had contacted the charity to ask for clarification about the measures due to feeling confused.She said: “Lots of people don’t have anyone. They are truly isolated so won’t be helped by bubbles. Most single parents use a patchwork of childcare arrangements based on childcare providers, schools, and after-school clubs. Social bubbles also won’t help the desperate financial issues facing single parents.Asking people to return to work ‘pushes single mothers into corner’“Many single parents are really worried about what they will do when they are called back to work. A disproportionate proportion of single parents work in shutdown sectors like hospitality, retail and admin, which are now reopening. Or they have agency jobs or zero-hour or temporary contracts. But now they don’t have childcare due to the coronavirus crisis. If you have no childcare, you can’t work. You don’t have a choice. They are worried their employer will say get back to work or be made redundant. No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I also think it’s a disgrace not giving free school meals over the summer holidays. Many single parents will have to make very stark choices about how they feed their children. More will be driven to food banks.”Ms Benson warned many single parents could not create bubbles with grandparents due to them having to socially isolate to look after their health. Social bubbles also do not apply to parents or children who may be shielding due to being in a vulnerable group, she added.The announcement earlier in the week that most children will not go back to school until September had only made her more anxious, she said.Paula, a single mother who has two children, told The Independent the support bubble announcement had made her feel more lonely than previously.“It opens up more problems than it solves,” the 45-year-old, whose children are ten and 14, said. “It made me feel really lonely. My parents are over 100 miles away. My natural instinct would be to see them. But they are shielding so there is no option to go there. My best friend is in Northampton so is too far away too.” Women will lose work if nurseries not bailed out, union group claimsPaula, who did not want her last name used, added: “I’m trying to balance working from home and schooling. It is a juggling act. I’m sleeping a lot lighter and a lot less and having strange anxiety dreams. I’m getting up early at 5am to try and do three hours work in the morning before the kids are up. I feel guilty like I’m not giving fully to anything. Because there isn’t enough time.”Matt Hughes, a single parent with one daughter, criticised the new social bubble rules for being overly complicated. The 41-year-old, whose daughter is nine-year-old, said he and his sister, who is also a single parent, were currently trying to work out which of them his parents should see. He added: ”I’ve been single for five years since my partner died. I know the new rules are supposed to combat loneliness but they make you ask who there is to bring into your bubble. Lots of my friends have also got their own families. There also isn’t space in the house for an extra person to stay.”Joe Levenson, of Young Women’s Trust, said while social bubbles will provide some “welcome comfort” to single parents, with so many children unable to return to school or nursery until September at the earliest, the dearth of childcare options remains an “enormous issue”. She added: “Young women have told us how hard it is to juggle looking after children at home with work, which is why there needs to be a strong focus from government on ensuring a support infrastructure is in place for parents.”A Department for Education spokesperson said: “Our early years providers have been central to this country’s response to the coronavirus outbreak, with a many providing childcare to critical workers and vulnerable children during this time.“From 1 June, nurseries have been allowed to open more widely so more parents can return to work. To further support working parents, we have introduced temporary measures to ensure critical workers will still be eligible for much needed childcare offers if their income has changed due to coronavirus.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

All the famous faces, including a picture of Sir Peter, are “fans” of the Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group.Each fragment will be signed by the artist and auctioned on Bidsquare, with bids starting at £325. The auction will be live until midnight on 26 June.The idea originated when London Advertising approached Sir Peter about the project as it wanted to use the mural to raise money for organisations helping people during the pandemic.Sir Peter, who also designed artwork for Paul Weller, Ian Dury and The Who, said: “I’m very happy that the Mandarin Oriental mural can be used a second time to raise money for such a wonderful purpose. I do all kinds of areas of work but one of them is to make crowds of people.Created with Sketch.

But organisers stepped up after the lockdown began and started providing 5,000 meals a week to families in Poplar struggling to afford or access food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesDizzee volunteered as part of his work with Kitchen Social – the Mayor’s Fund for London programme providing food for children across the capital during the school holidays. “I was given an amazing opportunity to visit and help out Kitchen Social at Bygrove Primary School in Poplar, who are providing free food, books and school equipment to kids in the local area where I grew up,” he said.“Thank you to all the amazing people I met and thanks to the Mayor’s Fund for London for connecting the dots.”How to support our campaignBygrove Primary School is also receiving vital supplies from The Independent’s Help the Hungry campaign appeal partner The Felix Project.The food surplus charity, which delivers to hundreds of food banks and community projects across London, began helping the school at the start of the crisis by dropping off one or two trays of fresh produce and staple items each week.The charity has since increased the supply from one or two trays of food each week to 40 trays to help organisers cope with the huge demand.Mark Causton, manager of the school’s initiative, said: “The Felix Project have been an immense help – I can’t praise them enough. We know we’ll need to carry on this work right through the summer, so we rely on all the fresh food they’re supplying.”Mr Causton added: “We’ve seen a lot of parents furloughed or losing work over the past couple of months. In the case of some families struggling to afford to buy shopping, this is one of their only sources of getting food for their children.“It was really great to have Dizzee Rascal here helping out. He got stuck in, and got on so well with all the volunteers and all the families. It was just nice to see a smile on a lot of people’s faces.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

Figures from the Independent Food Aid Network (IFAN) show a 175 per cent rise, with both charities reporting this their “busiest period ever”. Furthermore, a survey by the giving platform Neighbourly of 900 charities and community groups providing food to the vulnerable found that 70 per cent expect the situation to get even worse in the next six to 12 months.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent proprietor Evgeny Lebedev paid special tribute to the almost 6,000 ordinary iniduals who have dug deep to contribute to our appeal. He said: “Time and time again Londoners have shown that they are capable of immense generosity and community spirit in this period of crisis.“To all those that donated, bought and bid — I salute you.”Morgan Stanley said the bank and its employees in London had made the donation as part of their global Covid-19 response.How to support our campaignClare Woodman, head of Morgan Stanley EMEA, said: “The Felix Project plays a vital role in distributing food to people in need, especially those severely impacted by the pandemic. I am proud our employees in London are supporting them as part of our Covid-19 Hunger Relief Campaign.”Another substantial donor was Partners Capital investment group, which donated £95,287.John Collis, head of Partners Capital, Europe, said they “selected The Felix Project as one of our charities to support during this difficult period as it is one of the most impactful charities in London today”.Heads down for quiz nightThe original Top Gear trio — Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May — will tonight host a special Zoom quiz in aid of our appeal partner, The Felix Project. Participants in the Quintessentially Foundation’s “World’s Greatest Quiz Night” will face five rounds of questions devised by Nicholas Shearing, questions producer for top British TV quiz shows Pointless, Debatable and Impossible. May, who has driven Felix vans delivering food to vulnerable Londoners throughout lockdown, said: “At least in this stay-at-home pub quiz version, it will be easy to cheat.” 7.30-9pm. Tickets £10: thefelixproject.orggreatestquizOur appeal was also boosted by the silent auction, in partnership with Quintessentially Foundation, which closed this week with 135 bids placed for 36 lots and raising almost £40,000.The most highly prized lots were two tickets to a Liverpool FC game, four tickets to the Euro 2021 semi-finals, a video-chat with Spurs coach Jose Mourinho, a private guitar lesson with singer-songwriter Ellie Goulding and a helicopter lesson.The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

After paying rent and all her bills from the universal credit she receives at the beginning of the month, she now finds she has just £4.30 left over for food and nappies for the rest of the month.How to support our campaignSo she is almost entirely dependent on school vouchers available for her oldest two children (£15 per child per week) to buy absolute essentials, and one weekly food package dropped off by the Sufra food bank.“I don’t mind going hungry sometimes, so long as my kids have food,” said Ms Sarri-Gonzalez. “Sometimes I might have just one main meal for myself in a day. There was one point during lockdown I didn’t manage to eat anything for myself for two days, almost three days. But I always set the table for the children – I keep things as normal as possible for them.”“It’s so difficult at the moment. So stressful. I’m hoping when the kids go back to school later in the year I can go back to work and make things easier somehow.”The Independent’s Help the Hungry campaign appeal partner The Felix Project has quadrupled the volume of surplus food it gets out to people in need since the crisis began.The work remains as urgent than ever. The most recent YouGov poll for the Food Foundation charity shows over 1.5 million people in households with children have been unable to access food for economic reasons during the lockdown.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe latest figures from The Trussell Trust show April was the busiest month ever for the network of food banks, with an 89 per cent increase in emergency parcels compared with the same month in 2019.And the number of parcels provided for children has more than doubled, while almost twice as many families with children are receiving them (a 95 per cent rise).Colman visits The Felix ProjectDr Rachel Loopstra, lecturer in nutrition at King’s College London, said: “It’s clear from the data, as well as from trends in foodbank use, that families with children are really struggling right now. Watching parents struggle to put food on the table and go without food themselves is devastating.”Rebecca Archer and her partner – who have three girls aged eight, six and three at home in London’s High Barnet – have found it difficult to afford enough food during lockdown. “The shopping I do is costing a lot more with them at home all the time,” she said.Once the bills are paid and the main weekly shop is done on a Monday, the couple finds they have about £50 left to get through the week – about half the amount they usually had before the pandemic hit.The family has recently taken advantage of two £15-a-week school vouchers they get for their two oldest girls, and receive some cooked meals from their neighbour Katie-Louise Barber – a volunteer delivering food using The Felix Project’s supplies.“It’s been a real strain. Thinking and worrying about money all the time isn’t easy,” said Ms Archer. “I never thought I’d be worrying about having enough for the children to eat. There was one point we just didn’t have enough for the pre-paid gas meter, so we had to go without that for more than a week.”The Trussell Trust, which runs the country’s biggest network of food banks, has warned food charities cannot cope “indefinitely” with the huge spike in demand for help caused by the pandemic.A coalition of anti-poverty charities had written to the chancellor asking for an emergency income support scheme that would increase child benefits and end the five-week wait for initial universal credit payments.Anthony Cotterill, leader of the Salvation Army in the UK, warned: “It’s years since we have seen poverty to be such a real and present danger for so many people. We are approaching a poverty tipping point.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis. Find out how you can help here.

Everyone is very grateful,’ says a volunteer who also uses service when his own illness means he is unable to pitch inFormer music manager John McIntyre was unsure how he would cope when lockdown began.“I was very scared,” said the 75-year-old who has a respiratory condition and lives alone in a one-bedroom flat in Dalston. “If I caught Covid, I wouldn’t be able to get enough oxygen to the heart. I just had to follow the advice and be safe.” Mr McIntyre, who used to manage the jazz reggae band The Beatroots, has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and emphysema.He has relied for his daily meal from local charity Made In Hackney which is supplied by our Help the Hungry appeal partner, The Felix Project. Mr McIntyre is one of more than two million people who are classified as “extremely vulnerable” because they have compromised immune systems. For the last 10 weeks, many of them have struggled to get access to food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSince March, volunteers from the River House Trust charity have been dropping off Felix produce to people living with HIV. One such volunteer is former actor Stephen Hart who was diagnosed in 2006. When he is too ill to leave the house, he also uses the food delivery service.Despite being high-risk and a life-long diabetic, Mr Hart has been helping to get food to those more vulnerable than him. He has been unable to work since his health deteriorated two years ago, but Mr Hart, who lives alone in south London, said he wanted to help others.How to support our campaign“When I feel well enough, I pick up boxes from River House and drop them off for people who need them,” he said. “I do it when I can but some days are bad days.”Mr Hart said his condition means sometimes he can’t get out of bed. He occasionally receives a Felix box for himself so he knows he has food when he is too sick to move. “It is reassuring to have food in the house,” he said. “Felix has been a lifeline.”Although the British HIV Association said there “remains no evidence” that people with HIV are at greater risk of Covid-19 infection, those with a low CD4 count – the white blood cells affected by HIV – have been advised to shield.Mr Hart said members of the HIV community have been “nervous” since the outbreak. “There isn’t much specific advice so the community has been trying to look after each other.”A 62-year-old living with HIV for 37 years, who asked not to be named, described how his parcels have helped him. He said: “I pick up the boxes as I don’t have energy to go shopping. They’ve been great.”Mr Hart said it was extremely moving to see the response to his deliveries: “It is amazing. Everyone is very grateful.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

It has four core beliefs: family, integrity, teamwork and success – all integral pillars of its Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme.Put together by Sharon Gray OBE and the federation’s head teachers, it’s designed to welcome pupils back to class after lockdown. “Everybody in the Embark community has done their bit,” says Gray, a headteacher for 20 years, mostly in special schools supporting youngsters experiencing social, emotional and mental health difficulties and schools going through challenges.“It’s been all hands on deck,” executive headteacher and Trust leader of Embark’s schools Matthew Crawford adds. “Even two weeks into lockdown we were thinking about our children returning to school, whatever date that may be.”Safety at school1. Anyone who is unwell or been in contact with somebody showing coronavirus symptoms should stay away from schools, colleges and childcare settings2. Hands should be cleaned more often than usual with soap and running water for at least 20 seconds and dried thoroughly. Alternatively, hand sanitiser or alcohol hand rub can be used3. Promote the ‘catch it, bin it, kill it’ approach to coughing and sneezing4. Clean frequently touched surfaces regularly using standard products, such as detergent and bleach5. Help to minimise contact and mixing by altering classroom layout and timetablesWith regards to physical changes that parents and pupils can expect to see in corridors and classrooms, Embark is working with Government guidance and undertaking a thorough, bespoke risk assessment for each of its schools. “It can’t be a one-size-fits all approach,” Crawford stresses.According to Anna Upton – head of the 240-pupil Chaucer Junior School in Ilkeston, Derbyshire – questionnaires were sent out to reconnect with parents, through which they could express concerns and suggest ideas about the return to classrooms.According to Upton, staggered breaks and how drop-offs will work were important issues that were flagged in questionnaires. “But the risk assessment the Trust has put in has allowed us to make a comprehensive plan and we can communicate that to the parents,” she explains.“What the Trust have done with the programme is to implement nine stages which support our schools to open as safely as possible, supporting the staff parents and the children. The risk assessment means that I, as a headteacher, can do what’s right for my school.”Chair of trustees Sarah Armitage emphasises the importance of teamwork based around a guiding principle: families first. We look after families, so we reach out we talk.” she says.“Then there’s teamwork. Let’s harness the power of the team so it’s not the headteacher sitting by themselves with all these things to think about – that load is shared.”Armitage’s back-to-school outlook is optimistic too: “We have created something with this programme that we hope will be massively beneficial. Our role as leaders is to keep that going, carry on putting emotional needs at the heart of everything we do, because then children are able to learn and benefit – and move through this crisis.”Information in this article applies to schools in England only.

The government says it will phase in full controls from April on products of animal origin, with the extra forms and customs declarations required for all traders three months later. Extend Brexit transition period to save stalling trade talks, EU urgesUK borders ‘still not ready for leaving single market at end of year’Officials say they were working on the basis that full controls would be in place for July but that they could be delayed even longer if there is significant disruption.The European Union is expected to impose full border controls on goods travelling from the UK on 1 January as planned.“Today’s announcement is very welcome news for the logistics industry,” said Alex Veitch, head of international policy at Freight Transport Association (FTA).“Government has listened to our concerns and made allowances to enable our sector to recover from the Covid-19 pandemic and plan effectively and in good time for a new trading relationship with Europe,” he said, adding that business would “now have time to learn and adapt to new procedures”.Michael Gove, the cabinet office minister who is overseeing much of Brexit preparation, said: “We have informed the EU today that we will not extend the transition period. The moment for extension has now passed. At the end of this year we will control our own laws and borders which is why we are able to take the sovereign decision to introduce arrangements in a way that gives businesses impacted by coronavirus time to adjust.

The government wants to negotiate a free trade agreement that would eliminate all or most tariffs to be paid on goods, but even in this case businesses would still be subject to the new checks and extra paperwork. The customs sector has said that 50,000 new customs agents will be required to deal with all the new bureaucracy, with nowhere near that recruited so far. Britain left the European Union in January but is currently in a Brexit transition period under which all EU rules apply until the end of the year.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Please consider a contribution or subscription.England’s chief nurse was dropped from one of Downing Street’s daily coronavirus briefings after refusing to publicly back Dominic Cummings, senior sources have told The Independent.As Boris Johnson’s chief aide was engulfed in scandal over his trips to Durham and Barnard Castle during lockdown, Ruth May had been due to appear alongside the health secretary Matt Hancock in the press conference.But, in practice questions hours before the briefing, she was asked about Mr Cummings and, after failing to give support to the prime minister’s chief adviser, she was immediately dropped from the press conference, according to senior NHS sources.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesInstead the health secretary had to present the slides on Covid-19 himself for the first time, alongside Professor John Newton from Public Health England. The incident, on 1 June, was two days after England’s deputy chief medical officer Jonathan Van-Tam sparked headlines by saying that lockdown rules “apply to all” when asked about Mr Cummings. He has not appeared at the press conferences since 30 May.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?Another added: “JVT was the first to publicly push back on TV. Everyone is being asked to support the government positions prior to doing a press conference. If they don’t, they get dropped.“First it was Dominic Cummings, then easing lockdown and now the R-rate and the two-metre rule.”Separately, Whitehall officials are critical of what they see as No 10’s grip on the daily briefings and the way the science and health advice is being used.No 10 has previously touted the briefings – with ministers alongside health and scientific advisers – as an opportunity for the public to get advice directly from the experts on coronavirus. When they began in March, Downing Street said they would focus on informing the public “on how to protect themselves”.In April, when questions from members of the public were introduced alongside those from journalists, the prime minister’s official spokesman said it was “absolutely right that the public gets the chance to put their questions to the government and its experts”.Mr Johnson repeatedly insisted that public adherence to lockdown would not be affected by the revelations involving Mr Cummings.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Mr Shapps said he was sure Ruth May would be back at the briefings in future.NHS England medical director Steve Powis said he did not know anything about “the various discussions”, adding: “I’ve been here many times saying exactly what I think.”Asked to comment, No 10 said it strongly denied the claims that Ms May had been dropped over her views on Mr Cummings and added that health and scientific advisers would continue to take questions in the briefings.

Please consider a contribution or subscription.Wearing face coverings is to be compulsory on public transport in England from 15 June, with fines for those who refuse, transport secretary Grant Shapps has announced.Speaking at the daily Downing Street press conference, Mr Shapps said the move was designed to prevent an upsurge in coronavirus infections as the country moves to the next stage of lockdown relaxation, with non-essential shops allowed to reopen.Mr Shapps said wearing a face covering would be made a “condition of travel” on public transport, allowing passengers to be refused carriage if they do not comply, with the British Transport Police called in to deal with those resisting the rule where necessary. Face coverings are not currently included in the Health Protection Regulations which give the police legal power to take action over lockdown breaches. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMr Shapps said: “As of Monday 15 June face coverings will become mandatory on public transport.“That doesn’t mean surgical masks, which we must keep for clinical settings. It means the kind of face covering you can easily make at home. There will be exemptions to these rules for very young children, for disabled people and those with breathing difficulties.”He added: “We need to ensure every precaution is taken on buses, trains, aircraft, and on ferries.”Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?“With more people using transport, the evidence suggests wearing face coverings offers some – albeit limited – protection against the spread for the virus.”Frontline staff such as bus drivers will also be required to wear face coverings, and Mr Shapps said the government will work with devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to try to make the change nationwide.The announcement was welcomed by London mayor Sadiq Khan, who has long lobbied for mandatory face coverings on the capital’s Underground system.“I’m pleased that our lobbying has paid off and the government has finally seen sense and made it mandatory for people to wear face coverings on public transport,” said Mr Khan.Mick Whelan, general secretary of the train drivers’ union Aslef, agreed: “This is a sensible step. We have been working closely with the government to ensure that agreed increases in services on Britain’s train and Tube network is done in a safe and controlled manner, to help spread the loading, and maintain social distancing for the safety of passengers and staff.“The instruction to wear face coverings to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus will ease the concerns of people travelling, and working, on the transport network.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive updates on politics every morning by emailHowever, scientists are ided over the value of homemade face coverings.Dr Antonio Lazzarino, of the department of epidemiology and public health at University College London, warned that their use might encourage people to wash hands less and to make more use of buses and trains, where face coverings will offer no protection against them being infected by touching handrails contaminated with the virus.“It is now commonly accepted that face coverings provide very little protection, if any. But one clear, logical, widely accepted side effect is that face coverings may give an excuse to easing other more important measures,” said Dr Lazzarino.“Will more people use the Tube or buses because they will feel more secure given that everybody wears a face covering? This will increase the risk of transmission.“Will people be able not to contaminate their hands and the handrails by not touching their face coverings and not touching the handrails while standing inside buses and trains? This seems to be impossible to me. Face coverings can therefore be a vehicle of infection, rather than a barrier.”But health care professor Prof Trish Greenhalgh of the University of Oxford said: “Face coverings aren’t 100 per cent effective, but they’re not zero per cent effective either.“I’ve seen evidence that a double layer of cloth is between 60 and 90 per cent effective in stopping the spread of viral-laden droplets coming from the wearer, and also that the same mask is also 30-50 per cent effective at stopping virus particles getting to the wearer. You can argue about the exact percentages, but overall, if everyone wears a face covering when they’re at close quarters, transmission is going to go down dramatically.”Dr Simon Clarke, associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, said: “This policy will add more burden on the general public to prevent the spread of Covid-19. This is much more complicated than ‘wash your hands for 20 seconds’ or ‘stay at home’. We are asking the whole population of Britain, with no prior experience of mask-wearing, to overnight become competent makers, wearers, and maintainers of PPE.“I have seen no new evidence to suggest why the government is reversing its previous policy, and ignoring its previous scientific guidance and the guidance of the WHO. I’m left wondering if this is a political decision, rather than one based on science.”Labour’s shadow transport secretary Jim McMahon said: “This is just another example of the government being slow to act. Two months ago, Labour immediately backed the Mayor of London’s call for face coverings on public transport to be compulsory. Yet only now Tory ministers are acting.“Two months after first raising this with government we are still yet to hear whether drivers will be issued with gloves, masks, and other PPE items as standard, what specification this PPE should be and, if there isn’t sufficient PPE, whether buses should still run.“We can’t go on like this. We need a comprehensive transport plan to get our public transport moving, to protect staff and to protect passengers.”Network Rail chairman Sir Peter Hendy said he expected most passengers to comply with the requirement to wear face coverings.“I am not expecting a huge upsurge in railway staff having to police this,” he told the No 10 briefing. “I am expecting sensible passengers to do their duty and look after themselves and others.”Mr Shapps said that if people refused to comply they could be fined under new provisions in the national rail conditions of travel and the public service vehicle regulations for buses.“It is a condition of travel. You cannot travel unless you are wearing a face covering,” he said. “There will also be other powers so it could ultimately lead to fines. I very much hope we won’t be in that situation.”He said he did not expect enforcement action to be required on a regular basis, saying: “I expect the vast majority of people won’t need to be forced into this, because wearing a face covering helps protect others and most people simply want to help defeat this disease.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The US also continues to have more confirmed Covid-19 cases and deaths – which have passed 112,000 – than any other nation.The National Center for Disaster Preparedness (NCDP), issued a warning this week that the US case count was “multiples more” than the confirmed two million.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?US authorities have otherwise claimed that high testing levels were contributing to the confirmed case count, in comparison to other states and international data.Whilst new coronavirus cases have declined in some parts of the US, including New York, there are now 20 states with rising infection rates as states ease some restrictions. California, Texas, Florida, North Carolina, and Arizona are among 20 states with more cases on average in the past week, according to New York Times analysis. Arizona alone has seen, on average, more than 1,000 new cases each day this week. The highest per capita rate in the US. “It’s very clear that it’s a real increase in community spread,” Will Humble, Arizona Public Health Association executive director, told KJZZ in Phoenix. “It’s not some artifact of additional testing.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Please consider a contribution or subscription.China has removed pangolin parts from its list of traditional medicines, state-backed media reported, in a move campaigners say is a vital step in helping to protect the endangered animal.Pangolins – the world’s most trafficked mammal  – are highly sought after in China and Vietnam for their meat which is considered a delicacy, while their scales are used in traditional medicine and folk remedies.Similar in size to domestic cats and the only mammal covered in scales, all eight pangolin species are protected under international laws but there remains a growing illegal trade of the animals. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThis week health authorities omitted pangolin scales from China’s latest Pharmacopoeia, an approved list of traditional drugs and remedies due to “wild resources exhaustion”, according to a report in the Health Times.WildAid CEO Peter Knights said the move was “the greatest single action that could have been taken to save pangolins from extinction.”“The increased protection coupled with the swift and comprehensive closure of live wildlife markets and removal of many wild species from the list of what can be consumed as food in China were already very positive steps to saving the pangolin worldwide and reducing the possibility of them ever being a vector for disease.“And now this announcement, effectively the closure of legal sales of pangolin scales, shutting the last major loophole in pangolin protection efforts,” he added.People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) welcomed China’s decision, but urged action to stop the sale of pangolins on the black market. “PETA gives a nod to China for taking an important step to combat the demand for pangolin scales,” director Elisa Allen told The Independent.“However, as long as it remains desirable and profitable for endangered animals’ body parts to be sold for medicine, wildlife will continue to be killed on the black market.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Some scientists believe they may incubate the Covid-19 virus that is thought to have emerged in Wuhan last year and has since swept the globe.Scientists find virus similar to Covid-19 in pangolinsFollowing the outbreak of coronavirus at the end of last year, China banned the consumption of all wild animals in a bid to prevent further outbreaks but many wet markets have since reopened.Earlier this year, The Independent renewed its call for the banning of trade in wild animals to help protect endangered species and avoid future pandemics.“These actions of China will have a real impact, these are steps that were critical, that needed to be taken if real conservation was going to happen for these animals,” said David Olson, director of Conservation at WWF Hong Kong.“Most of the demand for pangolin is coming from traditional Chinese medicine and consumption. That’s what is driving this large scale illegal trade.”With additional reporting by Louise Boyle Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Please consider a contribution or subscription.A lake in India which wasn’t pink before, has now turned pink, baffling locals.Lonar Lake, about 300 miles east of Mumbai in the state of Maharashtra, is a body of water formed by an impact crater from a meteor which struck the Earth some 50,000 years ago. In recent weeks, the colour of the water in the crater has changed from an unremarkable green to a more remarkable reddish pinky tinge. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIt is thought changes to the salinity of the water may be partly responsible for the recent colour alteration, while the presence of unusual bacteria may also play a role. Due to dry weather the lake has also become shallower.In a video posted to Maharashtra Tourism\u0027s Twitter feed, local geologist Gajanan Kharat said the colour of the lake had changed in the past, but had not done so quite so vividly.Joe Exotic\u0027s pink sequin shirt goes on eBay for £519Pink supermoon draws people out of their homesGiant hot pink slug feared extinct in Australian wildfires survivedRussia claims to have contained oil spill after Arctic river turns red“It\u0027s looking particularly red this year because this year the water\u0027s salinity has increased,” he said. “The amount of water in the lake has reduced and the lake has become shallower, so the salinity has gone up and caused some internal changes.”Scientists have taken samples of the water for analysis, which will reveal the main reason for the colour change.According to The Times of India the lake is famous for being the world’s largest basaltic impact crater.The paper quoted MN Khairnar, deputy conservator of forests for the region, who said: “We are observing the phenomenon to such an extent for the first time. We will collect samples of the lake water for testing to find the reason behind the occurrence.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailExperts have reportedly noted that Lonar Lake is a highly alkaline body of water with high salinity, and its chemistry supports the growth of a family of bacteria known as halobacteriaceae. These organisms thrive in highly saline conditions, and some produce a red pigment called bacteriorhodopsin which absorbs sunlight and converts it into energy. When halobacteriaceae bloom in large quantities, the body of water they are in may therefore take on a reddish hue.The Times of India also quoted the principal chief conservator of forests \u0026amp Melghat Tiger Reserve (MTR) field director MS Reddy, who said a similar phenomenon has been observed at the Umria lake in Iran. The colour change has made it “a hot topic of conversation among the state’s forest department, scientists and nature lovers,” the paper added.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

What previously took a number of researchers a long time can now be accomplished by one drone operator in minutes.”The paper’s lead author Dr Andrew Dunstan, of the Queensland Department of Environment and Science, said: “Previous population survey methods involved painting a white stripe down the green turtle’s carapace when they were nesting on the beach, then getting on a small boat and counting painted and non-painted turtles.“Our eyes are attracted much more to a turtle with a bright white stripe than an unpainted turtle, but the pain washed off after a few days and the counting accuracy suffered.“Trying to accurately count thousands of painted and unpainted turtles from a small boat in rough weather was difficult. Using a drone is easier, safer, much more accurate and the data is permanently stored,” he added.Managing director of the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, Anna Marsden, congratulated the researchers and described the images produced by the drone as “extraordinary”.“Raine Island is the world’s largest green turtle nesting site and that’s why we’re working with our Raine Island Recovery Project partners to protect and restore the island’s critical habitat,” she said.“We’re taking action to improve and rebuild the island’s nesting beaches and building fences to prevent turtle deaths, all working to strengthen the island’s resilience and ensure the survival of our northern green turtles and many other species.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We always urge any prospective owners to do their research, see the puppy with its mother and not to buy an imported puppy. “Buying an imported pup leaves new owners open to the very real risk they are supporting cruel puppy farming, with the parents kept in awful conditions, used as breeding machines with sick and dying pups  - and there is no real way of checking.While theres no evidence Mr Chai - who was purchased from a third party breeder - came from a puppy farm, Molly has since admitted she wouldnt opt to buy a pet from overseas again, saying: If we had the time again we would have got a dog from the UK or got a rescue dog from the UK.Here, The Sun Online investigates the problems with buying and importing overseas pets, and takes a closer look at why it increases the risk of buying an animal that has been cruelly farmed.Mr Chai was shipped into the UK by a puppy company who have denied any wrongdoing.But several other former Love Island stars whove purchased dogs from the company have said following Molly and Tommys announcement, they wouldnt use her again.Laura Anderson,  - didnt have any issues with her puppy but has since said she wouldnt recommend buying from the breeder.Taking to Instagram Olivia Attwood, , said: Since I came out of Love Island Ive literally had breeders like that messaging me, offering me free dogs, like theyre a pair of shoes of something. Its just horrendous.There is no care in that kind of breeding.Olivia Buckland also spoke out, making it clear that she wasnt slamming Molly, but saying: Third party breeders dont have a clue where theyre getting their dogs from, I dont care what b****** they sprangle you they are getting a puppy from another country, they are not seeing the mum, theyre not seeing the dad, even sending a young puppy by plane from places like Russia is ridiculous.Sadly, Mollys situation is far from rare, and is a tragedy restaurant manager Sarah Brown*, , from Chichester, knows only too well.She bought an eight-week-old border collie puppy called Evie last Christmas, only to have to make the agonising choice to have her put down just three days later.While Evies full background and whether she was imported is unknown, Sarah believes Evie came from a puppy farm, which is why she was so poorly.Sarah tells Sun Online: I know exactly how attached Molly would have been to that puppy even after a few days, and its a horrible thing to have to go through...Its absolutely gut-wrenching.I found Evie on a website, and there were some red flags when we arrived to see her, but the puppies seemed fine and we knew that we could give her a better le away from the environment she was in.We took her home that day, but by the next day we had to rush her to the emergency vet because she was sick and lethargic.Her condition deteriorated and she was diagnosed with parvovirus. We made the horrible decision to have her put down just two days later - she was in pain and we didnt want her to go through that.It was so horrendous, and I also felt angry too - it was so reckless. Someone was just selling puppies as a money making scheme, but actually youre dealing with a living animal, that has feelings.While the UK government have made ious attempts to crack down on petfishing and puppy farming, it is clearly still a problem.A previous Sun investigation revealed an estimated  poorly puppies are ­trafficked into the UK by Eastern European gangs every day, and many customers are unaware theyve bought from an unregistered breeder.RSPCA Chief Inspector Ian Briggs says: Sadly, a rising demand in puppies means that responsible, reputable breeders who pride themselves on high levels of animal welfare cannot meet demand and we’re seeing more and more puppies being illegally smuggled into the country from abroad or being bred on puppy farms here at home.“The RSPCA has investigated the illegal puppy trade from Europe and it is clear that the trade is worth many hundreds of millions of pounds annually, hides immeasurable misery in the breeding, transport and selling of these puppies and so is connected with organised criminal elements which makes its detection dficult.“We believe more than , puppies a year could be coming into the country from places such as Ireland, Romania and Hungary.“Travelling long distances as a young pup is stressful and a real welfare issue. There are also risks of serious disease and future behaviour problems which can leave owners distraught. But it is not just abroad, there is always a risk of falling victim to poor breeders and unscrupulous puppy farms in this country too.Zoe Costigan, vet at pet well-being specialist firm ITCHpet, says: “A few weeks ago, a small bichon frise puppy came in with horrendous sickness and diarrhoea, the owners had met the vendors in a car park and the puppy had come form Romania.Obviously it was not possible to meet the parents although they had seen a photograph of the mother dog - or so they thought. Unfortunately despite extensive medical treatment and supportive care, the puppy passed away of suspected parvovirus.“[She had] a serious unsuspected heart problem, it was absolutely heart-breaking for the owners because the only answer was to put the poor pup down. When buying these animals, you know nothing about the health, welfare or temperament of the parent stock.This type of situation is unfortunately not uncommon.” While Molly-Mae and Tommy have since claried it was pre-existing health conditions, not the journey, that was responsible for the pups unfortunate death, this has done little to quell the controversy surrounding the decision to import their puppy.This is because while theres no indication Mr Chai was bred in cruel conditions, it is a common-known fact that puppy farmed pets often display a range of health conditions.Adam Amhama, Managing Partner at Paws in Work, says: In the worst-case scenario, the conditions on a puppy farm could mean tens or hundreds of breeding bitches in squalid conditions with little access to food, water, natural light, or social interaction. In essence, the dogs are seen as a commodity and so there is no importance placed on their health or happiness. Puppies born in these conditions are more likely to have health conditions due to poor hygiene standards, inbreeding, sick or unhealthy mothers and the likelihood of being unvaccinated or untreated for fleas and worms. The puppies can also develop extreme behavioural issues that stem from improper socialisation and countless negative experiences from the moment they are born.The issue is exacerbated with overseas puppy farms, as the cost of running these farms is signicantly lower than in the UK and there is less regulation of dog breeding in general.Seeing the puppy in the home it was born and with the mother is impossible to do unless buyers travel to the country which the pup is from. FaceTime or video footage are not suitable replacements for seeing the puppy and mother in person.Experts also warn it is vital to do your research evengetting a puppy in the UK, as puppy farming is still commonplace and breeders should be Kennel Club approved. Charities in the UK have been overwhelmed recently with requests to adopt the last couple of months, with Dogs Trust re-homing  per cent more pups than this time last year.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In her case, it’s not pretty.Where to start  How about son number two who, thanks to his friendship with billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein is now embroiled in an ugly, cross-Atlantic ding dong with an American legal system that kowtows to no one.Clearly, Andrew hoped his royal status might ensure discretion. But the US Department of Justice has other ideas and has now publicly accused him of lying when he says he has offered to co-operate with their inquiries into Epstein’s questionable activities.It’s uncertain whether The Queen and Prince Philip have Netflix in their lockdown lair at Windsor Castle, butthey have watched the documentary Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich — in which their reportedly favourite son is mentioned many times — they will have spat out their popcorn.Aside from the well- documented claim by Virginia Roberts that she was trafficked to London at the age of  to have sex with Prince Andrew , one of the most damning accusations is the alleged sighting of him at Epstein’s private island where airport staff now say that the billionaire, who allegedly killed himself last year, frequently arrived with “underage girls”.Ordinary people staying schtum at the time for fear of losing their jobs is one thing but the silence of the many powerful men who enjoyed Epstein’s hospitality is quite another.Prince Andrew is undoubtedly one of them and, at the very least, he owes it to Epstein’s survivors to sit down with the US Department of Justice and reveal what he does, or doesn’t, know.And asthat’s not enough to give his mother sleepless nights, he and his ex-we Sarah Ferguson are also being sued for a £.million unpaid debt on a Swiss ski chalet.Meanwhile, son number oneis happy enough in his second marriage, but reportedly harbouring a deep sadness that one of his sons has chosen to leg it to the US, along with the baby grandson he can no longer hug.On top of that, he faces forking out millions to help Harry and Meghan pay for personal protection because not only have they chosen to settle down in paparazzi central, but in a country where the gun culture means any nutter can wander into a store and arm up as easily as buying a microwave.Son number threehas just announced that his children won’t use royal titles and will work for a living.But one wonders whether, given the pressure to streamline the monarchy, they jumped before they were pushed.Daughter Anne is a reliable stalwart, but grandson Peter recently announced his marriage to we Autumn is over, and as for grandsons William and Harry, it’s fair to say that the reported fall-out of those two young brothers who walked so stoically behind their mother’s coffin must be causing The Queen great sadness.So, with all that going on with her nearest and dearest, how will she feel when lockdown finally lts and she’s expected to put on a brave face to the world again Will she think, “I’ve had enough” and, as was rumoured prior to the pandemic, abdicate on her th birthday next year Doubtful, given that she pledged she would be of service “my whole le” and that, traditionally, British monarchs occupy the throne until death.But, given her family ructions, who could blame hershe did decide to call it a day If he had bodyguards with him on his ious visits to Epstein, then perhaps they could enlighten the US authorities on Andrew’s movements at the time Andhe didn’t, then why the hell does he need them now Asthe new, -day quarantine rule wasn’t daft enough, it’s emerged that police have been told to take “no immediate action”a passenger gives a  address on arrival in the UK.Right.

This movement is a catalyst for change, and right now, its telling us a lot of things need to be addressed so we can make space to heal, Starbucks said in a letter to employees announcing the new shirt design.Its critical to support the Black Lives Matter movement as its founders intended and will continue to work closely with community leaders, civil rights leaders, organizations, and our partners to understand the role that Starbucks can play, and to show up in a positive way for our communities, Starbucks said.In a video, which has since been removed, the company VP of inclusion and ersity explained before the new announcement of shirts that agitators who misconstrue the fundamental principles of the movement and could use them to amply isiveness.Pins representing “political, religious or personal issue[s]” have been included in the ban, sparking allegations of hypocrisy as the coffee chain hands out LGBTQ and marriage rights buttons to its workers.Calvin Bensen, a -year-old barista from Atlanta, told BuzzFeed News the company’s response was “disappointing in ways I can’t express in words.

He added: We are doing a review right now, and obviously as we make further progress, I hope to say more.His comments come days after new cases of coronavirus dropped to just over  - numbers not seen since March. The Scottish Secretary Alister Jack also said the rule should be cut in half as quickly as we can.Speaking on BBC Radio Scotlands Good Morning Scotland programme, he said todays dire economic figures - a drop in GDP of  per cent last month alone - showed the need to act quickly.Its critical to save peoples livelihoods we start opening up the economy as quickly as possible, he said.Headded: As soon as it is possible to do so with the R number suppressed, I would like to see it move to one metre.I think, to get back to something to near normal in the way that we conduct our lives and our businesses, as we see the virus recede, and weve seen this happen without any bad consequences in other European countries, we should move to one metre when the time is right.More tourism businesses would remain viablethe two-metre social distancing rule was halved, he argued.Ms Sturgeon tweeted today that she was also considering reducing the m rule in time.She said: If we can effectively eradicate COVID - and then control through Test  Protect  policies to mitigate against cases coming into country - we can restore much greater degree of normality. Decisions then about, eg, m v m are more possible. But first we must suppress eradicate.Boris Johnson has repeatedly suggested he wants to cut down the two metre social distancing rule.Everyone who doesnt live in the same household must stay apart from others to stop the spread of the virus.The prime minister’s official spokesman said the rule was being “kept under constant review”.It was reported today that the PM has been told by scientists the decision to cut it is his, and there is no magic number he can rely on to ensure people will be safe, The Times claimed.But as schools and shops open up, there are fears that the economy will continue to suffer thanks to the distance.Pubs, restaurants and bars are all on track to open from the start of July.But keeping two metres apart is likely to mean they cant reach anywhere near the capacity they need to in order to survive.Greene King chief executive officer Nick Mackenzie today urged the PM to slash the rule down to one metre.He stressed that a number of Greene King pubs will not be financially viable or able to open with current restrictions in placeEconomics fear millions of jobs could be lost in the hospitality sector as a result - and some businesses may have to close their doors for good.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If it rises above one - a sign the epidemic is growing - tougher restrictions may be reintroduced.There is a time lag in the calculations, with the latest R value relating to what was happening two to three weeks ago.Prof Matt Keeling, Professor of Populations and Disease at the University of Warwick said there is no way to suggest that one region is worse than the other due to the over lap in data.All the ranges are closer to the critical threshold of R than we would ideally like to see - which means that the epidemic is declining relatively slowly. This also means we havent got much wiggle room for additional relaxation of social distancing measures.He added that as the number of cases becomes smaller in many regions these predictions will become more uncertain.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Therefore, we consider this risk of exposure also to be, at most, medium likelihood. This likelihood nevertheless is outweighed by that from other infected people in the household.The experts added: Cats and dogs are equally susceptible to the virus attaching to host cells, because of the structural similarity of the receptor protein, ACE, to the human receptor.Sage carried out a qualitative risk assessment after two dogs were infected with SARS-CoV- - the virus that causes Covid- - in Hong Kong.One was a -year-old Pomeranian and the other a German Shepherd whose owners had both contracted coronavirus.The dogs were tested on several occasions and nasal swabs were positive for the virus across repeat time points. Once the dogs had tested negative twice, they were released from quarantine but sadly the Pomeranian died two days later of unkown causes - but suspected to be due to stress.Meanwhile, a cat in Belgium also tested positive for the virus after its owner fell ill with Covid-.The cat had diarrhoea, respiratory distress and vomiting before the virus was detected in faecal samples.It prompted concerns that pets could be a route of transmission but experts concluded that the risk to Brits remained low.Sage said: There is still a considerable level of uncertainty about the roleany of companion animals in SARS-CoV- transmission. There are no surveillance data and any risk level relies on previous observations of seropositive animals in previous outbreaks, the precautionary advice from the OIE and the two cases in dogs in Hong Kong.Companion animals can have very close contact with their owners which could lead to exchange of respiratory fluid therefore, they may be exposed.Nevertheless, exposure may not lead to infectivity and infection in animals and the SARS-CoV- appears to be predominantly transmitted from human to human. Until more surveillance data are available, a precautionary risk level has been given.Reviewing the report, Prof James Wood, head of Department of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Cambridge, said:“Despite millions of people having had Covid-, the numbers of pets found to be ill or infected is still tiny. Put simply, our pet dogs and cats can catch Covid- from us, when they are living with us, but only do on very rare occasions.“The risks of owners catching Covid- because their pet dog or cat has it are very low.

Have they now at last found the elusive needle itself  Maybe. Just maybe.There are hopes that Madeleine’s heartbroken parents Kate and Gerry — and millions around the world — may finally see the case solved.Christian B — currently serving a seven-year sentence in a German jail for the rape of an American woman in Portugal in  — may prove to have been responsible for the heinous crime of abducting, and likely killing, Madeleine.Hans Christian Wolters, the state prosecutor in Braunschweig, Germany, claims to have evidence not made public that Madeleine is dead.Christian, , has admitted nothing. He has not even been interrogated in depth about Madeleine.Current appeals to the public by the German authorities and Scotland Yard indicate key bits of the jigsaw have yet to be found.What, though, suggests they may have got their man We have compiled some of the many facts that suggest the police may at last have found him.By May , \" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"when Madeleine ­vanished, Christian had been living on and off around Praia da Luz for more than ten years.\" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"He already had a record in ­Germany as a sexual predator — a conviction for “performing sex acts in front of a child” when he was only .Having gone to live in Portugal, he had been extradited to Germany to serve a further sentence for other crimes against juveniles.Later, back in Praia da Luz, he had money, appeared to be working — as a waiter at one point — but that was a front for his le of crime.Christian reportedly took advantage of the annual influx of summer holidaymakers to commit multiple burglaries. He did time for stealing petrol and made shady deals buying and selling cars.He allegedly bragged that he “knew all about” what happened to ­Madeleine — although that does not mean he was her abductor.A reported boast is far from being conclusive evidence. The police need much morethey are to put ­Christian in the dock.German officials suspect he ­murdered Madeleine. Scotland Yard, cautious as ever, continue to treat it as a missing person case.But there is much more that may link Christian to the crime.BETWEEN  and  there were numerous break-ins all within  miles of Praia da Luz, during which an intruder either assaulted, tried to assault or, in one case, attempted to assault young girls.In an incident involving two young British girls, aged eight and , a man entered their apartment as the parents slept. The intruder got into bed with the younger daughter, who asked: “Is that you, Daddy ”The man said: “Yes.” But she knew it was not her father. The older girl then woke and saw what was happening. The man, who was wearing a mask and spoke English with a foreign accent, walked out of the room.Christian had reportedly worn a mask in  when he allegedly raped a woman in the Algarve.People clearing out premises that he had vacated found, among other things, wigs and costumes.WHILE living in the Algarve in  Hazel Behan, then , was raped by a man armed with a machete. He was “dressed all in black, wearing a ­leotard and a black leather mask.” She also remembered the man who raped her had a distinctive mark at the top of his right thigh, perhaps a birthmark or tattoo. Christian reportedly has birthmarks all over his body and scars on his right leg.Mrs Behan — now married with children — also remembers that her rapist had blond eyebrows and ­“piercing blue eyes, even in the dark”.In his mugshot Christian clearly has blue eyes.The attacker, she added, “spoke English, with like a German accent.”She told her story at , in chilling detail, five years ago — long before the current police appeal for information about Christian.ON May ,  — the day Madeleine vanished — or the day before, Derek Flack, who lived in Praia da Luz, was heading to the shops with his we when he saw a man watching ­apartment A — the room where the McCanns and their children were staying in the Ocean Club ­complex.He noticed a second man either in or beside a dirty white van parked on the other side of the road.Brit Derek thought the first man’s gaze appeared fixed on the apartment and its veranda. He went to the police after Madeleine disappeared.\" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"Christian owned a Volkswagen T Westfalia camper van which was seen in police photos.It did not resemble the van Flack described, although reports of mysterious “white vans” are often a feature of child abduction cases.One such early sighting in the Madeleine McCann case — of a ­German-registered VW van, a man, and a blonde little girl — featured in news stories last week. But that ­vehicle was traced long ago, and the owner turned out to be an innocent holidaymaker with a daughter who looked a little like Madeleine.A van can be seen in aerial shots of a house in which Christian once lived.But a police source said it was not a VW but a Renault and its owner is not a suspect.THERE is other compelling testimony that someone was watching apartment a before Madeleine disappeared.Tasmin Sillence, a British girl age  at the time who had previously stayed in the same apartment, had seen a man lounging against the wall “staring intently at the balcony” on the Monday of the fateful week. She later saw him the day before ­Madeleine vanished, again apparently watching the apartment.A British tourist staying nearby who asked not to be named told private detectives working for the McCanns that she too saw a man watching the apartment on two occasions.The woman recalled: “I grabbed my daughter’s hand and pulled her towards me because for some reason the man unnerved me.”And on the afternoon of the day Madeleine went missing, \" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"Brit Carole Tranmer was taking tea with her aunt on the terrace when she saw a man come out of apartment A. which was directly below them.Carole, a former secretary, said he closed the gate “very carefully and quietly” and “looked to one side and the other”. She called the police as soon as news broke of Madeleine’s disappearance.Her information and that of Tasmin indicates that a would-be thief or abductor had staked out the McCanns’ apartment.And now the investigators’ focus is on Christian, their descriptions of the suspicious man are striking.Both women said he was aged between  and , light-skinned, with fair or light cropped hair, and was either ft in or ft in.In , Christian was . Reports describe his hair as being blond and short. He is just under ft tall.There is a final striking detail in the descriptions of the man who appeared to be staking out the McCanns’ apartment.Tasmin said his face was “ugly, even disgusting”, with small pimples, while the unnamed Brit tourist recalled the face she saw as “very ugly, with pitted skin.”Reports from Germany in the past few days reveal Christians “face is pockmarked”. Shown a picture of the German, the unnamed British tourist reportedly said firmly: “That’s the man I saw.”AMONG the investigation files are statements several witnesses made about a man — on occasion two men — who came to their doors asking for money for a nearby orphanage.There was no such orphanage. The callers requesting donations were scam merchants.But was the motive more sinister  One of the men said he was looking for cash to help “keep young girls away from prostitution”. He appeared to one resident to be in his mid to late-s and spoke English well. Another recalled: “Due to his appearance and mannerisms, I did not feel he was Portuguese.” His accent “did not sound Portuguese.”Police thought the accent of one of the fake charity collectors may have been Dutch or German.One of the scammers claimed the orphanage he was supposedly raising money for was at or near a place a resident remembered as being called something like “Baro St. Hoa”.There is indeed a hamlet, not far from Praia da Luz, named Barao de Sao Joao. Christian had a girlfriend there and — as The Sun has reported — was a familiar figure at drug- fuelled parties in woods nearby where \" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"he reportedly traded drugs for sex with young girls.DRUG dealing, and the use of drugs, is another feature of Christians criminal profile. The owner of a property he reportedly frequented said that after the villa was vacated she was shocked to find “syringes and used needles and a spoon and bricks of hashish in a shoebox”.A very sinister use of drugs could explain a mystery surrounding the disappearance.During the commotion after ­Madeleine disappeared — amid her parents’ cries of shock as well as the comings and goings of the police — the little girl’s twin brother Sean and ­sister Amelie had not woken.Everyone — their mother above all — had been astounded.Could it be, Kate asked police within days, that \" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"an abductor had sedated all three children before escaping with Madeleine There is anther factor to consider — an indication that a non-Portuguese man was responsible for crimes in the area.The year Madeleine disappeared there was an epidemic of burglary — a four-fold increase, in fact, of thefts in and around Praia da Luz.Break-ins were common at the Ocean Club, the resort at which the McCann family was staying.Apartments on the lower floors were often targeted, one of them in the same block the McCanns’ used.On the night that apartment was robbed, shortly before Madeleine and her family arrived, a man who was probably casing the joint had appeared at the door asking for “the German family”.In another break-in at the resort, a child had been disturbed — but the thieves fled when the parents came back.FINALLY, there is a clue that establishes almost conclusively that Christian was in Praia da Luz on the night Madeleine vanished. Analysis of mobile calls shows that the phone registered in his name — number --- — was used in the town that night, shortly before the little girl was found to be missing. Unless someone  was using his phone, Christian was there.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Last year, the US Senate passed a resolution recognizing Juneteenth Independence Day as a national holiday, but it has not yet been reviewed by the House.It is observed across the US by all but four states: Hawaii, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Montana.Juneteenth is a portmanteau of June and . It is celebrated as the day all African-Americans were freed from slavery in the United States after Union General Gordon Granger rode to Galveston, Texas, and told the slaves of their emancipation in .In accordance with a proclamation from the Executive of the United States, all slaves are free, Granger read to the crowd.Texas was the first state to make Juneteenth an official holiday.CEO of Twitter and Square, Jack Dorsey. recently stated that his companies would be honoring the day as a company holiday moving forward.Dorsey made the announcement on Twitter, saying: Both Twitter and Square are making #Juneteentha company holiday in the US, forevermore. A day for celebration, education, and connection.Countries and regions around the world have their own days to celebrate emancipation, and we will do the work to make those dates company holidays everywhere we are present.Dorsey made the announcement two weeks after the death of George Floyd, which has sparked racial injustice protests nationwide.Juneteenth, considered the Black Independence day, is celebrated like the Fourth of July with gatherings, picnics, and parties with family and friends.The National Juneteenth Observance Foundation, an association based in Mississippi, has worked for years to get Juneteenth officiated as a national holiday. The foundation issued an open letter to President Donald Trump in January  urging him to issue a presidential proclamation recognized as a national holiday.Upon the reading of General Order # by General Granger, our ancestors, released from the tyranny of enslavement, celebrated jubilantly, establishing Americas second Independence Day Celebration and the oldest African American holiday observance, it reads.We request that you issue a presidential proclamation to establish Juneteenth Independence Day as a National Day of Observance in America, similar to Flag Day or Patriot Day. Your proclamation will support legislation in the U.S. Congress concerning gaining greater recognition of Juneteenth in America. The letter proclaims that the country needs healing from the scars of enslavement.The annual observance of Juneteenth in America affords the country a tremendous opportunity to constructively reflect on our legacy of enslavement and move forward as a unied nation.The Juneteenth Flag was created by Ben Haith, founder of the National Juneteenth Celebration Foundation , in .It features a white Star of Texas emblazoned over a red and blue background, signying freedom over a new American horizon.Mississippi was the last to abolish slavery a mere seven years ago.In a monumental historical oversight, the state of Mississippi hadnt submitted the necessary documentation to raty the th amendment until .The amendment, which declares slavery a constitutional violation, was put to a vote in  where three-fourths of the then  states voted in favor of ratication. State lawmakers in Mississippi, however, came to a standstill over compensation for the value of freed slaves.Dr. Ranjan Batra, professor of Neurobiology and Anatomical Sciences at the University of Mississippi Medical Center investigated the history of the th Amendment ratication in Mississippi after watching the movie Lincoln.Calls to the national archive confirmed that although the amendment was indeed ratied in , the archivist never received the proper paperwork for it, rendering the ratication unofficial. Batra enlisted help from Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann to amend this.The last paragraph [of the bill] directs the Secretary of State of Mississippi to inform the national archives of the law of the ratication which is exactly the way ratication is supposed to proceed, but that hadnt been done for whatever reason, Batra told ABC News.Mississippi gets a lot of bad press about this type of stuff and I just felt that it is something that should be fixed, and I saw every reason that could be done, he said.

From Winston Churchill to Nelson Mandela, it is feared the monuments will be targeted by either anti-racism or far-right protesters as Brits take to the streets following the death of George Floyd for a third weekend running. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan is warning people to stay at home for fear of violence sparked by far-right counter demonstrations, and ongoing coronavirus infection concerns. Police have imposed some strict guidelines, including a pm curfew cut-off time for the protests. In wake of unarmed black man Mr Floydaposs death in police custody in Minneapolis, Black Lives Matter protesters have rallied worldwide, calling for an end to racial injustices. The vast majority of people demonstrating have done so peacefully. Last weekend, protesters in Bristol captured headlines around the world last Friday when they tore down a statue of slave trader Edward Colston and threw it into the harbour. On the same day, a statue of Churchill in Parliament Square was defaced with graffiti claming he was racist. Now, amid fears of clashes between Black Lives Matter protesters and far-right groups, a number of key statues have been put in protective boxes. It comes after the Democratic Football Lads Alliance called on its supporters to descend on the capital to protect monuments.

The Conservative politician is described on the governmentaposs website as an inspirational statesman, writer, orator and leader. But critics have pointed to his views on race and imperialism, and he is known to have described Britainaposs empire as being for the good of the primitive and subject races. He also opposed Indian independence. Ahead of planned protests in London this weekend his statue has been covered with protective boards. The move has been described by Boris Johnson as absurd and shameful. The Prime Minister says that although Churchill held some views that would be unacceptable today, he saved the country from fascist and racist tyranny. Cenotaph  Part of the official war memorial to Britainaposs war dead, which stands in Whitehall, has also been hidden from view. It comes after the monument was defaced, along with Churchillaposs statue, during last weekaposs Black Lives Matter march. Graffiti with the letters BLM was sprayed on the base of the memorial, where wreaths are laid on Remembrance Sunday each year. It has now been boarded up to protect it from further vandalism, and Mr Johnson has urged protesters not to turn out this weekend. A growing minority unfortunately have hijacked them and they are using them as a pretext to attack the police to cause violence and to cause damage to public property, he said. My message to everybody is for all sorts of reasons, they should not go. You should not have a situation where people who are protesting on one basis are violently attacking the police and public property.

The monument was scheduled to be put into storage on Thursday due to concerns about Baden-Powellaposs associations with the Nazis and the Hitler Youth. But the removal was delayed after a crowd of people - some wearing Scout unorms - gathered around the statue and vowed to protect it. It comes after a petition calling for the memorial in Poole Quay to stay in place gained more than , signatures. Mark Howell, deputy leader of Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council said many felt that removing the status would be giving in to protesters. Guyaposs and St Thomasaposs Hospital Trust has confirmed that it will be taking down a statue of its founder, who had links to the slave trade. Workmen placed  of wood around the structure on Thursday. Guy - who founded the London hospital in  - amassed a fortune of £,as a shareholder in the slave-trading firm South Sea Company. A statement from Guyaposs and St Thomasapos Charity, Guyaposs and St Thomasapos NHS Foundation Trust, and Kingaposs College London, said: Like many organisations in Britain, we know that we have a duty to address the legacy of colonialism, racism and slavery in our work. We absolutely recognise the public hurt and anger that is generated by the symbolism of public statues of historical figures associated with the slave trade in some way. We have therefore decided to remove statues of Robert Clayton and Thomas Guy from public view, and we look forward to engaging with and receiving guidance from the Mayor of Londonaposs Commission on each. We see the pervasive and harmful effects of structural racism every day through our work. Black people have worse health outcomes, and this inequality is one of many ways racism permeates our society. We are fully committed to tackling racism, discrimination and inequality, and we stand in solidarity with our patients, students, colleagues and communities. Nelson Mandela  Mayor of London Sadiq Khan instructed Nelson Mandelaaposs statue in Parliament Square to be covered. The monument has stood in honour of the anti-apartheid leader, who was President of South Africa from  to , since . The countryaposs first black head of state, Mandela was imprisoned for  years on Robben Island while fighting to end institutionalised racial segregation. The move comes amid fear of counter protests from extreme far-right groups this weekend. Mr Khan said: Iaposm extremely concerned that further protests in central London not only risk spreading Covid-, but could lead to disorder, vandalism and violence. Extreme far-right groups who advocate hatred and ision are planning counter-protests, which means that the risk of disorder is high. Be in no doubt these counter-protests are there to provoke violence, and their only goal is to distract and hijack this important issue. Staying home and ignoring them is the best response this weekend. Mahatma Gandhi  Along with Churchill and Mandela, a statue of Indian independence leader Mahatma Ghandi is also being boarded up in Parliament Square. Gandhi, famous for his role in securing Indiaaposs independence through nonviolent protest, is widely considered the father of his country. But there have been calls to remove a number of his monuments in the UK, as campaigners accused him of aposracismapos. A bronze statue was unveiled in Leicester in  and a third was put up in Manchester in  despite objections. A petition against the Leicester statue describes Gandhi as a fascist, racist and sexual predator who has brought inconsolable suffering. Robert Peel  Authorities have also decided to protect keep a statue of Sir Robert Peel in Tamworth, Birmingham - but this time over fears it might be confused with another. The memorial appeared on a website called ‘Topple the Racists’, which maps statues of historic figures whom it opposes. Peel actually served as a minister in the Government which made slave trading an offence. Danny Cook, leader of Tamworth Borough Council, said: “Given the current national focus on memorials, including statues of Robert Peel, we feel it necessary to take extra precautions to protect Tamworth’s -year-old Peel monument for the time being and fence it off.

The estimate shows ministers have been planning on the “reasonable worst case” assumption made two months ago. The staggering death toll today released by the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergenciesincluded , patients dying directly due to Covid-. The assessment says a further ,-, people would die with the virus or other conditions caused by botched care linked to pressures on the NHS during the outbreak. These immediate extra deaths are due to problems such as lack of staff, equipment or intensive care capacity linked to hospitals struggling to cope. This can lead to problems and delays in getting care that would have otherwise saved lives. It estimated that without any action by the Government lockdown the country up to . million people could have died directly or indirectly due to Covid-. The paper concluded: “This analysis can help to demonstrate the trade-offs that have already been made in deciding to take social distancing measures to delay the disease. “It shows that up to  million deaths have been averted by avoiding the unmitigated RWC scenario where CCU capacity would have been breached and lives would have been lost through lack of access to medical care.  “In contrast, the estimate of lives lost from a recession is much lower – ranging from  to , additional avoidable deaths per year using current methodologies. “So the benefits of government intervention far outweigh the costs.” The damning review, dated April , had input from the Department of Health and Social Care, the Government Actuary’s Department and the Home Office. Out of the estimated , Covid death toll, between , and , of these people would have died in the next year anyway.  These deaths would have been brought forward by Covid-, according to the estimate. The paper stated that in the longer term delayed non-emergency treatments could lead to , extra deaths. This was on the assumption that % of elective care that would have been done over six months is postponed. But it added: “However, with reprioritisation of cases when servicesto normal, the actual mortality impact can be expected to be far smaller than this.” It added: “The novel coronaviruspandemic will affect the number of deaths in the UK.“This extends beyond people dying from contracting COVID-, as there will also be impacts on the population’s health and mortality due to changes in healthcare activity to tackle COVID-, and government’s other responses to the pandemic.” Another paper released by Sage showed on March  - less than a fortnight before lockdown - modellers were looking at scenarios to achieve herd immunity without overwhelming NHS, through lots of smaller local lockdowns.

It comes after scientists advised against bubbles being introduced as they could create apossignicant unwanted effectsapos. However, the Government decided that from today, people living alone in England can form bubbles with another household. Northern Ireland is adopting a similar relaxation of the regulations for people living alone. In a report of its meeting on May , published yesterday, the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergenciesadvised strong caution to introducing social bubbling and said it could not be seen as a universal good. But the SAGE report said that while larger households social bubbling together posed a signicant potential risk, bubbling may be appropriate in limited circumstances. How the social aposbubblesapos will work Who is covered by the new arrangements  Adults living alone or single parents living with children under the age of . What will they be able to do that they could not before  They can form a bubble with one other household which means they will effectively be treated as a single household for the purpose of the lockdown rules. That means they can visit each other indoors in their homes - staying overnightthey wish - and they will not have to observe the two-metre social-distancing rule. These bubbles are strictly exclusive - neither household can form a bubble with anyone .  Who might benefit Elderly people living alone could form a bubble with the household of an adult son or daughter enabling them to visit and even hug their grandchildren for the first time since lockdown. Single parents could pair up with their own parents allowing them to share childcare duties and reuniting grandparents and grandchildren. Couples who do not live together will be able to visit and to stay with each other. If one half of a couple shares a flat or house with one or more other people, they can see their partner as long they live alone -their partner also shares a home they cannot see each other. Andseveral people share a flat or house and all have partners who live alone, only one will be able to see their partner, which could lead to some interesting conversations. This will affect large numbers of young people living in towns and cities.  What about households where both grandparents are still living - can they now visit their children and grandchildren  At this stage onlytheir son or daughter is the only adult in the other household in the bubble. Andthe grandparents have two or more children who live alone, they will have to choose between them. Downing Street has acknowledged not everyone will benefit from the change although officials have hinted a further loosening of the rulesthe coronavirus outbreak continues to decline. Can households form more than one bubble  No. The arrangement must be exclusive with no switching of bubble partners. Will people have to formally register these bubble arrangements  No, it will be taken on trust. No  says the public has shown great responsibility in following the social distancing rules so far. Is there any limit on the distance between households in a bubble  Again no, although officials are suggesting people should try to stay local where possible.  What about vulnerable people who are shielding due to their age or health problems  At the moment, officials say it is too soon for them to be able to join support bubbles. What about parents who are separated but who currently share childcare with the children moving between the two households  That will continue. If the parents are the only adult in the household they can form a bubble with another household - meaning the children could potentially be in two bubbles, one for each parent. What happenssomeone in a bubble develops coronavirus symptoms  All members of both households in the bubble must self-isolate for  days. Does this apply only to England A scheme in Northern Ireland has also been brought in from Saturday. This is for a person who lives alone, and can visit someone aposs private dwelling, including staying one or more nights. If they have a child or children living with them they do not qualy. This will be be reviewed on Monday.  What do the scientists say  A SAGE report of its meeting on May  said: Sage advised that social bubbles have the potential to create signicant unwanted effects and advised against their introduction in the short term, when other distancing measures have only just been lted or in conjunction with release of other measures. Sage advised strong caution concerning the introduction of social bubbling - particularly in the short term, when other distancing measures have only just been lted or in conjunction with release of other measures. Sage has advised previously against making too many changes at once. Sage concluded that bubbling may be appropriate in limited circumstances. The report was published a day before adults living alone or single parents in England will be allowed to mix with one other household. Further reports to SAGE, also published on Friday, warned that breaching support bubbles could lead to a signicant risk of increasing transmission.

Michael Boughton, , held his first gig with best mate Michael Evans after Mr Evansapos dad died of coronavirus. They were unable to hold a large funeral and wake, so the duo honoured his le in Mr Broughtonaposs garden.Since then, Mr Boughton has been cheering neighbours up with his music but an anonymous resident complained to the local authority.And, as Lancashire Live says, the dad-to-four received a letter in the post warning him of his behaviour.I’m just really disappointed that the person who complained didn’t approach me first or even post a letter through my door and instead went straight to the council, Mr Boughton, from Blackpool, Lancashire, said. I understand people have their reasons and when I read the council’s letter I was really disappointed. It’s not worth refuting the complaint, I don’t want to get fined.  I have finished it at a reasonable time because I have small children myself. “It was not my intention to upset people. I wanted to bring people some cheer and I never wanted to be a nuisance.

The figure, thought to be a representation of Africa, had been in position at the front of the Georgian house at Dunham Massey in Cheshire. On Friday, a spokeswoman for the National Trust said the decision had been made to move the statue. She said: The statue has caused upset and distress because of the way it depicts a black person and because of its prominence at the front of the house. We donapost want to censor or deny the way colonial histories are woven into the fabric of our buildings. For these reasons, we have decided to move it safely from its previous location while we make plans to address it in a way that fully acknowledges the appalling histories of slavery and the slave trade. The lead figure, depicting a black man holding a sundial above his head and wearing a skirt of feathers, is believed to have been sculpted by Andries Carpentier in , the trust said.  aposBlackamoorapos was a European art style that depicted highly-stylised figures, often African males, in subservient or exoticised form and the term is now viewed as racist or culturally insensitive.  The statue was created by th century sculptor Andrew Carpenter as part of a series representing the continents and was bequeathed to the National Trust along with the rest of the Dunham Massey estate by Roger Grey, th Earl of Stamford, following his death in . The hall and its gardens are now a popular tourist attraction and herds of deer roam more than  acres of ancient parkland. Statues associated with Britainaposs colonial and slavery pasts have come under scrutiny after a statue of slave-trade Sir Edward Colston was taken down by Black Lives Matterprotestors in Bristol at the weekend.

For nearly three months selfless frontline workers have been working flat out to keep Britain running as Covid- ravaged the nation. And now, thousands of key staff could be rewarded with a party at Buckingham Palace to recognise their dedication during the crisis. Under proposals being considered by the Government, the Queen will be asked to host the event. Councils have begun collating lists of people from nurses to shop workers, postmen to delivery drivers and carers, who deserve to be recognised.A Government source said: “There’s a firm-held belief that this would be a fitting way to celebrate those people who have sacriced so much on the coronavirus front line, whether it be in hospitals, care homes, ­supermarkets or postal staff working tirelessly to keep our country moving.“It is hoped a decision would be made towards the end of the year before proposals could be finalised.” A Palace source said “any Government proposal would be carefully considered”. An insider with knowledge of the plans revealed local groups, including charities and ­businesses will be invited to nominate a community hero they believe should be honoured. Thousands are expected to be put forward which could lead to a raffle system being implemented, like the process for the Queen’s diamond jubilee concert on the Mall in , when there were  ­applications for each pair of tickets. Organisers are hopeful the Queen would be able to attend, potentially alongside Prince Charles, the Duchess of Cornwall and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, who have all highlighted the work of the emergency services and key workers throughout the crisis. William, , worked as a helicopter pilot for the East Anglian Air ­Ambulance for  months between  and  before stepping down to take on more royal duties on behalf of the Queen. The -year-old monarch is said to be keen to find ways of honouring the sacrices by so many Brits throughout the pandemic. During lockdown she broadcast two historic statements to the nation, as well as taking part in her first ever public video call this week to celebrate Britain’s seven million unpaid carers. During one in April, as the pandemic took hold, the Queen made a televised address - just the fth of her -year reign – to declare: “Better days will , we will meet again.” She added: “I want to thank everyone on the NHS front line, as well as care workers and those carrying out essential roles, who selflessly continue their day-to-day duties outside the home in support of us all. I am sure the nation will join me in assuring you that what you do is appreciated and every hour of your hard work brings us closer to ato more normal times.” The Queen, who had to cancel all events this summer, also appeared in a special royal family video to pay tribute to health staff last month on International Nurses Day. Until recently there had been weekly applause for key workers around the country every Thursday night as the nation gave thanks for their efforts. Every summer the Queen normally holds three garden parties at the Palace to recognise contributions of ­iniduals to national le. Nobody can ask for an invitation, and those who receive one will be unaware until it arrives. Another is held at Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh. A medal for workers who helped save lives during the outbreak is also being discussed. The Mirror is behind a campaign to honour NHS heroes with a gong.  A document ­circulated round ­Whitehall also details proposals for a humanitarian medal to recognise the work of those who put their lives on the line. Such a medal has ­previously been approved by the Queen, but never issued. There are reports suggesting the special edition gong could be ready by September.

Luckily, she eventually tested negative but was diagnosed with bronchiolitis and was allowed home on the Wednesday.” Despite some more hospital stays with baby Nate, who has been sickly since birth, the family soon settled into a routine with a newborn and a house full of kids.

I wanted to make it modern whilst still keeping the costs down, Claire-Louise said. Iaposd seen on Pinterest that you could use a vinyl wrap on work surfaces. I used DC fix wrap which has held up really well around knives and hot pans. This is a great budget alternative to replacing worktops.  It is tricky when placing the vinyl wrap around the hob and sink but you do get the hang of it with practise. Iaposd recommend buying an extra-large roll in case you make a mistake. We learnt to use a credit card to smooth out any air bubbles and then a filing kne to make sure the material was flush to the wall tiles. For paint, make sure you use wood and furniture paint.

Both the paint and vinyl wrap have been extremely hardwearing.It took me ages to decide on the wallpaper as I was worried that it would make the kitchen look too dark but with the white units, it has the perfect balance.

The -year-old is one of thousands of young mums who have seen their jobs evaporate due to the lockdown and now she fears she could face a battle to get back into the workplace. She said the news of her job loss came as things were getting better adding that she had been on a short-term contract at a London university, despite her manager asking for her to be made permanent staff. Anne, who chose not to give her real name, had been on the six-month rolling contract in administration but was told it would not be renewed in August. She said: I feel the senior managers were stopping it and protecting the institution by always doing temporary contracts in the case of something like this happening. It means they wouldnapost be so liable or responsible. It is just better for that institution. Research by PwC revealed % of people that have already lost their jobs due to the pandemic are women, as they are often in the most insecure employment. Anne, who has a degree in geography and business management, now faces trying to survive with her two-year-old son on universal credit.  Generally speaking I donapost find it dficult to get jobs, however these are unprecedented times and obviously there is going to be more competition and so that is something I fear because there are just lots of job cuts, she said. Anne, who has found support with the Young Womenaposs Trust, said lots of people have reported admin jobs disappearing during shutdown as companies try and sht paperwork online. Since remote working was introduced because of lockdown, a lot of processes have become automated and electronic - why would companies go back to paper-based administration , she said. Anne was receiving in-work credits, but had been hoping to come off them once her son was in nursery and she could work longer hours.  I was well on that path to full independence and things were getting better for me, she said. All I had to do was slowly increase my days as my son grows up and I could come off universal credit, so I am just really hoping I will be able to find a job and go back on to that path, she said. Anne plans to retrain as a social worker once she has enough free time to study. I feel like I have the motivation and experience to help and give back to my community - itaposs quite exciting but I know I canapost run before I can walk. I have to be patient, she said.

What they saw made their spirits soar. This trio had watched repeatedly over the past fortnight with a combination of pride and hope – and fear, when violence flared – as similar protests reacting to the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota, swelled across America, including a few miles from their home. But there was something particularly powerful about the largely peaceful UK scenes. “What was so encouraging to me was the crowds weren’t all black Britons marching – you had black Britons, a lot of white Britons, Asian Britons, you had a real cross-section of people coming together in Britain saying, ‘This is enough,”’ explains Arndrea Waters King. “We have felt supported and inspired by what we have seen in the UK,” adds her husband, Martin Luther King III. This family, of course, has especial reason to be buoyed by the global demos they are seeing in the face of -year-old Floyd’s death on May , which ­exemplies deep-rooted discrimination across the US, and the world. Human rights advocate Mr King is the son of Dr Martin Luther King Jr, whose campaign for civil rights for African Americans was brought to a tragic halt  years ago with his assassination by James Earl Ray, on April , . And -year-old Yolanda, sitting serious next to her parents, is the iconic figure’s only grandchild, who wishes she could have met her “Papa King” and “sat on his knee”. Poignantly, she turned  the day Floyd died – and more than ever, feeling confused and angry, she would love to speak to her grandfather. In the UK, protests have at times turned to violence. Last weekend crowds in Bristol tore down a statue of slave trader Edward Colston. While the Kings do not condone violence, they ­advocate a dferent way, but are empathetic. “I always believe there is a way to get things done, the right way, but people are emotionally ­frustrated right now. I certainly concur with the spirit,” says Mr King, . “These statues belong in museums. The public has to acknowledge its history. I just don’t believe they are symbols that represent unication of communities so don’t belong on the outside. They don’t belong in places of honour. “My father used to say a riot is the language of the unheard, and while he never condoned violence he certainly ­understood why people would protest with violence, why they were forced to violence.” The family point out the UK’s slave trade history is tied to ­America’s, and agree there are similarities between racism faced here, and in their country.Although they also highlight Brexit as a specic catalyst for ision.“The vote was a vote that emboldened a racist attitude, to say others are not important, it’s all about us, we need to disconnect from people, target­ ­immigrants,” believes Mr King.There is also a disturbing parallel to be drawn between racist comments made by their president, and racist language previously used by our PM. The couple say while Donald Trump isn’t listening, Boris Johnson must.Mrs King says: “I’d hope he’d use this moment to listen to his people, make atonement for where he has made errors, and try to build a better society for all Britain. He has an opportunity to be a dferent type of leader to what we have witnessed here. “I believe he has a brand new baby  I’d hope he would be cognisant of what type of world he wants for his child and all British children.” Mr King describes how his family were all “brought to tears, anger, ­frustration and hostility” when they watched the video showing Floyd pleading for breath as police officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck for almost nine minutes. Chauvin faces charges of second-degree murder and manslaughter, while three other officers are charged with aiding and abetting murder. Initially, he admits he couldn’t bear to watch the “heinous act”. “We saw the le come out of this human being who could not do anything,” he says, a rare flash of anger.

Mr King, aged  when his dad died, recalls racial harassment. “Every now and then one of us would pick up the phone and people would make very nasty threats using the N-word, or tell us to ‘get out’,” he says. Yet he was taken on marches with his dad and witnessed the strength of feeling he galvanised. “I travelled with my dad eight or  times, and marched two or three times, but I didn’t see any violence,” he recalls. “If my father had lived and others, we’d be in a dferent world.” I ask whether as an adult, he has experienced racism.

Mum-of-two Prizzilla Greer, , and husband Skylar, , thought they were done having babies after the arrival of their second child Lola, now four. She even asked doctors to perform a female sterilisation, or tubal ligation, after her daughter was born by c-section in January . But after a surrogacy centre matched her with a gay couple who were desperate to become parents, she decided to go through it all again, despite having never met them. She has now become mum to a newborn son, after carrying an embryo created by IVF.to get the Mirroraposs biggest and best stories delivered straight to your inbox at www.mirror email Prizzilla, of Oahu in Hawaii, USA, explains: The sperm from one of the dads and the egg from their donor was used. They had embryos created at the IVF clinic before I was even matched with them just waiting to be transferred to my uterus. Gestational surrogacy doesnapost require the surrogate to use her own egg, so I was able to carry the embryo that was already created by my intended parents and their egg donor.  We just had to make sure my uterus was healthy enough to carry the embryo to term. I really was just an oven for their bun.Prizzilla, also mum to Nixon, five, says she signed up to become a surrogate after seeing a friendaposs post on Facebook.She was contacted by the Hawaii Surrogacy Centre just a month later, and met the intended parents over Skype in October . The pair, who are from Australia, had been trying to have a child for more than  years. Explaining why she was moved to help them, Prizzilla says: I had started to see my friends share their troubles with infertility, and it was the first time I was introduced to that, because the women in my family donapost have any trouble getting pregnant. I felt some guilt knowing that this was someoneaposs dream to have a child all their le and someone like me, who never really planned for it, was able to do it right away.  When I was , someone posted about surrogacy - it was like  oaposclock in the morning, it was on Facebook. I never even went on Facebook back then, but I just knew I was meant to be at that place, at that time to see that post. I just started crying because I felt like it was a sign that this is what I am supposed to do, even though I hadnapost put too much thought into it before. After a series of medical checks, a single embryo was successfully implanted in May . And on January , a bouncing baby boy arrived.

Their owner, Lora Larkin, had popped in the shower for ten minutes when the pooches escaped from the unlocked dog door into the garden. The pups decided to go outside through their dog door, which I didnapost realise was unlocked, Lora, , said. They must have heard the garden sprinklers come on. We had recently prepared a section of our yard for new grass, so it was bare. They ran through the sprinklers and rolled on the ground until they had both become a muddy mess. When I found them there was no turning back. They had to be left to dry out for a couple hours before I could even begin to clean them because adding more water just causes the dirt to sink even further into their fur. Lori, from Tampa, Florida, took these snaps of her hapless pets after she washed the pups in the sink. Samoyeds originate from western Siberia and northwest Russia. In these cold communities, their shed fur is used as an alternative to wool, and can survive temperatures well below freezing. According to the Samoyed Club of America, when Samoyeds become bored they may start to dig or become destructive. With their history of being sled dogs, their ancestors would dig deep into the snow for protection against the bitter cold winds. Lori added: We had to clean their fur with dish soap and water, we kept it simple because they have sensitive skin. Samoyedaposs have two coats so itaposs best to blow dry then get them wet with water. Whilst we love our pups, they are a very high maintenance breed, much consideration should be taken into account before adding a Samoyed to your family. They require lots of exercise, attention and also they love to bark a lot.

But even among this community, Christian Brueckner stood out. The German detested the “scruffy hippies”, as he called them, preferring to dress in old tailored suits. He also shunned their drug-fuelled lestyle, at least publicly, saying narcotics made him “lose control”. Brueckner apparently tried to portray himself as a gent, wooing women with his classic good manners. But behind the veneer there was a dark side to him, which remained hidden to even his closest friends. When he first arrived with a girlfriend in tow in , aged , he was already a convicted sex offender in Germany.  He had fled to Portugal after serving a two-year juvenile term for abusing a six-year-old girl in a playground and exposing himself to a nine-year-old girl when he was . And that was not his first brush with the law. Born Christian Fischer in Baia in , he was given up by his birth mother and placed in a children’s home, then adopted by Fritz and Brigitte Brueckner from Bergtheim, Baia. He was convicted of his first burglary in nearby Wuerzburg in , aged .  His adoptive parents sent him to a reform home for delinquent teens after Fritz was seriously injured in a car crash. In , Brueckner got an eight-month suspended juvenile term for multiple thefts and driving without a licence. After serving time for the later sex offences he started his new le in Lagos. He became a regular in the bars and clubs and was often seen at all-night parties in the hippy village of Barao de Sao Joao.He first came to the attention of Portuguese authorities in , when he was arrested following a bar brawl. He was handed a two-month jail term in Evora, near Lisbon, but was freed after a matter of weeks.  By the time he wooed a lonely -year-old English woman newly arrived in Lagos in , he had been in Portugal for almost a decade. As with previous girlfriends, he turned on the charm and played up to his “gentlemanly” image. The woman, now , told the Mirror: “At first I didn’t actually like him that much. I was , he was a couple of years younger. I knew he liked me but I wasn’t interested. But Chris could be very, very charming, very funny and very smooth in the way he talked. “He always dressed nicely, held the door open, that kind of thing. He drove the nice car – the black Jaguar – was very gentlemanly and spoke properly.  “I was alone in Portugal, no family around and a bit lonely. We became friends in the spring of  and that moved on to us becoming romantic. At first it was great.” The Mirror told this week how the woman, who does not want to be named, said he later changed. She claimed he flew into jealous rages, and allegedly smashed her head against a toilet wall in  after she hugged a male pal. She said she still lives in fear of him now. Shortly after their relationship began, Brueckner left his bar job and made money repairing classic cars. The woman, from Berkshire, said: “He liked taking me to the beach in his Jaguar. He didn’t like the town beach in Lagos. It would always be the West coast beaches, the isolated ones.  “He didn’t like lots of crowds. He didn’t like all the tourists in the summer.”She told how he once made her “strange German food” at his home. It is this house, situated on a hill ­overlooking Praia da Luz, that has become the focus of police attention. Brueckner moved out in , after receiving a nine-month prison term for petrol theft – a year before Madeleine McCann disappeared aged three from her family’s holiday apartment in the resort in May . A neighbour who cleaned up the property told last week how she found filthy conditions and bags of wigs and exotic clothes. This came as a surprise to his British ex, who remembered him being “house-proud”. But she also had an explanation for the items found.She said: “Chris loved to dress up, but not in a kinky way. He loved fancy-dress parties, especially Halloween, so he kept all sorts of outfits in the house. “He wasn’t into anything weird with me. We just had a normal sex le.” Despite his previous offences, his ex had no clue he was sexually attracted to young children. Instead, she and her pals in Lagos suspected Brueckner – now in a high-security German prison – had a thing for older women. She said: “There was one lady he used to take out to dinner sometimes, she was a bit older, and he said it was just for company. There was another lady, she was much older. He used to walk her dog and clean her apartment and she gave him money for that.” Months after they split in , Brueckner raped a -year-old woman in her Praia da Luz home. He was handed a seven-year jail term last year but is appealing his conviction.  His ex said Brueckner’s only passion, besides his cars, was making money. She said: “Other people get joy out of films, music, socialising, that sort of thing. But for him,there was no money to be made out of something, then there was no point doing it.” Brueckner was living in a camper van in the Praia da Luz area when Madeleine vanished from the Ocean Club resort. Police had him in their sights within five days and staff at the resort were shown his picture and name to seethey recognised him. But he only became a suspect in  when a caller to the German version of Crimewatch claimed he had hinted in a bar that he knew what had happened to Madeleine. In the intervening decade, Brueckner had regularly moved between Germany and Portugal. His German pals told the Mirror he had two dogs he treated so badly that one of them died. One was a daschund-cross called Mrs Muller, the other a rottweiler called Charlie. He reportedly left them locked inside a kiosk bar for six weeks – with one becoming so malnourished it died.

It will be a massive plus that we have something to work to.“Every manager will probably tell you the same – we need a date for when we are going to go back.“But as I said, I am cautious because there is an awful lot going on at the moment, from where you can take your kids to when you can go and meet other people.“Everything is changing and I don’t think football will be any dferent.”Reconstruction plans have now been run up the flagpole and ripped back down again more than once.Consensus, as is so often the case in Scottish football, has proved impossible to reach.Meanwhile clubs like Dundee, whose business model means they sit uncomfortably in the Championship, have been left in limbo.It has affected everyone at the club – and their manager is growing tired of the uncertainty.However, McPake is conscious of the wider issues in today’s world, and his annoyance is tempered by realism.He said: “There is frustration but for me that can’t be put on anyone.“There is a frustration in every industry about where we find ourselves.“We have never been in a situation like this before and what that brings is a real level of uncertainty.“We are looking for answers every day. I would be very reluctant to blame that on a single person or organisation as you can see it right across the world at the minute. But yes, it is frustrating.“If you are looking at it purely from a footballing point of view it is really dficult for the players, for the backroom staff and for the fans.“But again there is a bigger picture here in terms of a health crisis.“We have to be guided by the government and the governing bodies in football but it has not been easy.“Everybody is in the same boat really and there are no real answers to what is happening and when we can get back to what is perceived as normal.“It is dficult – there is no other way of putting it.”For as long as the Championship remains without a definitive restart date, many elements of Dundee’s normal business operations will remain on hold.

It is not like a normal summer or break in the season like a winter one or international break.“There is always a structure to football and when you are back. The players, staff, everybody knows that but at the moment that has completely gone.“It is everyone’s longest lay-off – we are now getting to the stage where the players have been off the same amount of timethey had a serious injury so that brings its problems physically and mentally.“It is just about trying to get everything right so that when we do get the green light to start back we are in as good a position as possible.”EXCLUSIVE: Ex-Dundee striker Peter MacDonald confirms he’s hanging up his boots and says best day of his career came as a Dark Blues player\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp dundee-fc-peter-macdonald-retirement-st-johnstone-rangers embed # secretWJcMNsFIpT\" data-secret\"WJcMNsFIpT\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

We knew we needed to improve his fitness.“Once we got him fit – we needed to get him up to scratch and keep him playing at the same time – and got into his head in terms of how we played, he was great for us.“He was brilliant at taking the ball, getting us up the park and running past defenders, his pace was a major asset.“I didn’t have a lot of hair at the time but I still lost a bit because he would drive you bananas at times with some of the silly things he’d do in good positions.“It goes without saying that he’s matured well beyond that now. He might have lost a bit of pace in recent years but he is a seasoned campaigner.“Back then he was desperate to come up to Scotland and play games.“The big thing we sold him on was the area, the lestyle – the tranquillity up here compared to the hurly-burly down south.“We told him he could get himself on the TV, sell himself in the big games and we were the type of club thatsomeone came in for you with a decent offer, you’d have the option to go.”Hayes – who started out at Reading – eventually left for Aberdeen in  after three years with Inverness.Over  games in five seasons and a League Cup winners’ medal in the Granite City followed before he clinched a £ million move to Celtic.The winger struggled to establish himself as a Hoops regular but he started several crucial games for the Scottish champions, including the  Scottish Cup final triumph over Hearts and the stunning Europa League victory over Lazio in Rome last November.Two months earlier he grabbed the second goal in the Old Firm derby as Neil Lennon’s side beat Rangers - at Ibrox.Hayes’ Parkhead exit – which has also led to interest from his former employers at Pittodrie – came less than two weeks after he picked up his third title medal in three campaigns with the club.Malpas said: “I thought Jonny would’ve got another contract at Celtic and that he would happily have stayed.“But maybe they’re trimming their squad a bit to get players in and maybe there wasn’t going to be the chance to play as many games next season.“He certainly didn’t let Celtic down when he was called upon.“For United, though, good on them for trying to sign Jonny. They’re clearly thinking about the right players and I think that’s the type of player they need.“He’s experienced and he’s played at a very good level. He’s still got pace, he can play in more than one position and he’s good in a dressing room.“I thinkyou were struggling in the middle of the pitch he could do a job there as well.“You’d never say he was the best defender, but he never seems to get a doing from the wide players he plays against.“Sometimes you think he isn’t the best at beating people yet he always seems to get crosses in.“For us at Inverness he was great at getting the ball in the box and created a lot of goals for guys like Adam Rooney.”The former United captain saw a transformation in Hayes during his time with the Dons.He added: “I’ve followed Jonny’s career for years and hoped he would do well.“He was great for us and did everything we asked. He’s one of the many guys you like to think you’ve helped a bit.“Jonny’s really matured and looked after his fitness. At Aberdeen he was playing under a bit more pressure in front of a more demanding crowd and that helped him make the move to Celtic.“He was a cheeky chappie when we had him –he got a bit of stick, he’d give a bit back. Some things used to affect him but I could see a dference at Aberdeen, he’d outgrown that and he could handle that.“We had a great group at Inverness. When we went in, we only kept three or four players and started again.“Graeme Shinnie was one of the kids that was there and he has developed into a right good player as well.“These guys would run through a wall for you and they were a joy to work with.“We didn’t have great facilities but these guys wanted to learn, they wanted to work and they had a great attitude.”Dundee United appoint senior club representative to liaise with Terrors fan groups\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp dundee-united-fan-groups-liaison embed # secretNdKFhlJe\" data-secret\"NdKFhlJe\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Within a couple of days the response was staggering.There were volunteers from all corners of Mid Argyll willing to sew, donate material and give freely of their time. Local businesses were also quick to respond with offers of material, pattern printing and transport for moving stock around.I am overwhelmed by the support and generosity of people in Mid Argyll. They have risen to the challenge and far exceeded my expectations.We have around  stitchers from Cairndow to Ardfern, and villages and towns in between, producing brightly coloured ‘scrubs’ using mainly donated fabric, scrap material and jazzy duvet covers. The first donation of ‘scrubs’ is expected to be handed over to the hospital this week and we are sure they will brighten up the wards.Our crowdfunding page, ‘Let’s Get Scrubbing for Mid Argyll’, was originally set up to buy everything to make the scrubs. It has broken the original £ target and we would love to hit the £, mark so please feel free to donate.I am overwhelmed and humbled by this experience and publicly thank the group team leaders, the volunteer stitchers, those working behind the scenes and the wider community for their support and generosity.My thanks is also extended to the following businesses who have helped in so many ways: MacLeod Construction, Kit-You-Out, Mary’s Meals, Top Designer, West Coast Motors, LG Upholstery, Clock Tower, Tarbert COS Thrt Shop, Premier Laundry, Ian Y McIntyre, Willie Leitch Sailmaker, Owen Sails and the Lithgow Family at Ormsary Estate.Nikki Thompson, Ardrishaig.Sir,The time will come when we are through the turmoil of this pandemic but as we work our way through it, I wanted to share a situation that reflects the actions of many.I was recently collecting shopping in Tarbert for registered vulnerable people and, as I was taking off my gloves before getting into the car, I was aware of another#s presence close by pushing a mobile rubbish bin. It was Damon. He saw me about to put my gloves into the rubbish bag in my own car and said cheerily #You can pop them into this bin here,you like#.I was so taken by that gesture. What an example of initiative, thoughtfulness and kindness. It summed up the incredible work of so many volunteers, co-ordinated by Team Tarbert#s Fiona, with Margaret co-ordinating prescriptions, and many others.Perhaps there is no better time for us all to reaquaint ourselves with Rudyard Kipling#s poem #If#.It seems to perfectly summarise humanity working at its best, in which, during this crisis, thanks to so many, Tarbert can walk tall. Stay safe.Peter Minshall, Tarbert.Sir,I write regarding the Argyllshire Advertiser edition dated Friday April  and the front page heading #Hospital prepares for Pandemic#.The article states: #No figures have been released about the incidence of coronavirus in Argyll and Bute# because the HSCP spokesperson said #we are following national guidance and due to reasons of patient confidentiality we will not be able to make public where in the Highland health board areas the positive cases are#.This statement is complete nonsense and shows either the HSCP in Argyll has not been privy to this information or they are just using the term #national guidance# as a smokescreen and an excuse and or sheer incompetence.No-one was asking them for patients# names and addresses, merely figures of those affected in a given area.The people appointed to positions of responsibility in Argyll and Bute HSCP are hopeless when it comes to joined-up thinking and accountability.All they will do is spin you a line and quote stuff like #national guidelines#, which is code for #I don#t have a clue#.Karl Edwards, LochgilpheadSir,Scottish and Southern Electricity Networksis extending the support it provides to those most vulnerable by expanding the eligibility of its Priority Services Registerto include customers at increased risk of severe illness during the coronavirus pandemic.Nearly , customers already receive additional care and support through SSEN’s PSR – a free, tailored service.In addition to those self-isolating or shielding for  weeks, customers are eligiblethey:Julie Walker, SSEN."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsMidton has been making the distinctive and coveted awards for the Royal Television Society for the past  years # and this week the company#s resourcefulness in adapting to face shield production was acknowledged by the society.

By adding night-scented plants and soft lighting, along with pale-coloured flowers and foliage that appear to glow in the fading light, your garden will become an enticing ‘room’ to sit in at the end of the day.White flowering plants # like big blooms of hydrangeas # have a lovely glow in the evening garden reflecting the last of the light which makes them appear brighter than other plants.  Pale blues and lilacs also look their best in fading light, so sea holly with its tiny blue flowers that sit in rosettes of silvery-grey bracts is a great addition.Bright foliage also creates an evening glow in the garden. Light-coloured, iegated and silver leaf plants reflect any available light. Lambs Earis a popular ground cover plant that has the most wonderful soft, furry, silver-grey leaves.  It’s fairly drought resistant so a good choice for a dry, sunny border.Many beautul flowers only produce scent at night and often have a stronger aroma than their daytime counterparts.  Fragrance is released from night-scented flowers as the heat of the day lingers into the evening.  Petunias may seem be a strange choice for a night garden, but they are night scented. Some smell during the day, but not to the same intensity of the night scent. Night Scented Stocks do just that and have a pastel colour flower palate.It’s best to plant scented night garden flowers where you’ll brush against them or come close to them. Try planting them around doors and paths.  If you are planting in pots make sure you arrange them round seating areas to provide a heady aroma or position them near doors and windows so that the fragrance drts inside.Even though planting the right night-flowering plants in the right place will give you stunning effects,you want to really enjoy your garden after dark, some form of garden lighting is essential.  Try not to floodlight your entire garden. Instead, pick out specic plants and trees to showcase. Up lighting, either set on spikes or recessed into the ground, showcases plants beautully at night.But it’s not just at night time you want your garden to look good so here are some tips for this month from the Royal Horticultural Society."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 15 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,A big thank you to whoever has tidied up Ardrishaig Community Garden, mown the grass and repaired and painted the fences.Such a peaceful place to call into while out exercising.

Mindfulness concentrates your mind on the ‘here and now’ and is a proven way of dealing with mild depression or anxiety.Focus on what the plants feel like – not just their fragrance when touched – from leathery and lacey to soft and smooth. You can also mix plants that are great to touch with tactile hard landscaping elements such as a water feature, smooth polished round pebbles or the glazed ceramics.Some top touching plants and features to considerLeaves # try Stachys byzantina, commonly known as Lamb#s Ear. Its soft, downy, furry silver-grey leaves are a favourite among gardeners who tend to use it for ground cover in rich soil. As a contrast there is Acuba japonicawhich has smooth, glossy leathery leaves.Flowers # who can resist touching a bottlebrush Callistemon cintrinus – bundles of tiny delicate stamen flowers form a brush that’s soft to touch – or the soft paper-thin petals of a poppy Papaver orientale.Grasses # run your hand over the arching, thread-like leaves of feathery Stipa tenuissima also known as Mexican feather grass or the more robust drought proof ornamental Festuca glauca with thread-like blue foliage that forms dense mounds.Bark – tree bark can also provide a tactile experience especially when it’s the stunning flowering cherry Prunus serrulate with mahogany coloured bark that peels away in bands round the trunk.Landscaping – you can easily y the textures in your garden by choosing dferent hard landscaping options. If you have smooth pebbles surrounding a water feature that you can run your hand over and through, you could place lichen-covered rocks in another area of the garden.Our general well-being is intrinsically linked to the natural world which is why Thrive – the gardening for health charity – has developed the Thrive Gardening Club.For fortnightly tips on getting the most out of your garden, whatever your age or ability, and information on how gardening can keep you healthy and feeling good visit www.thrive.org.uk get-involved keep-in-touch subscribe-to-gardening-clubThrive is the UK’s leading provider of social and therapeutic horticulture programmes using gardening to bring about positive changes in the lives of people living with disabilities, ill health or mental health issues, or who are isolated, disadvantaged or vulnerable."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 22 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,Mental Health Awareness Week, now in its th year, runs from May  to May .This year, the theme for the week is kindness and across the country, people will be celebrating kindness in digital and creative ways within social distancing restrictions.The last couple of months, with all the uncertainty of the virus and the impact of lockdown, have been an extremely stressful and worrying time for many people across the Highlands and Islands. People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world. We hope these resources will help raise awareness of the impacts of invasive species and inspire more young people to learn something about them.No prior knowledge is needed and there’s lots to learn and have fun with so become an Alien Detective and help us tackle invasive species today.All of the ‘Alien Detectives’ resources can be found at www.invasivespecies.scot alien-detectives.Callum Sinclair, SISI Project Manager, Newton Stewart.Sir,We may not be able to hold picnics in the usual way just yet, but why not hold the next best thing – a virtual picnic  That way you can invite as many people as you want.National charity Family Action is running its Virtual Family Picnic from May  to May  and everyone is invited.

We stayed with Margaret and Iain McDonald at their home named Meadowview in Tarbert which was located near the school.We all enjoyed the area so much that we continued to visit every year for the next consecutive eight years.Margaret invited me to go out on the herring boats once or twice. One was named Village Maid and the other Village Belle and, needless to say, we often had kippers for breakfast, which were very nice. I remember there was a boat called the Southern Cross tied up to Cock Island # can anyone tell me any history of it and when it disappeared There also used to be a smokehouse for kippers along from Tarbert to Ardrishaig.Another fond memory I have is watching the logging trucks unloading on the quay and watching them get loaded on to large boats and I think then being shipped round to Sweden or Finland. Is that correct or not as I thought there was a paper mill at Fort William As mentioned earlier, I joined North West Ambulance Service in the s and Margaret used to send me the Argyllshire Advertiser and in one of them was an advert for recruitment to the Scottish Ambulance Service.I duly got an application form from Paisley and was all but sending the form in when I realised it would be very unfair to move so far away from our young children#s grandparents and for them to be unable to see them growing up. At the time your local pharmacist was retiring and my we Sue was a qualied pharmacist, but our children were both under school age so relied on her parents for child care. Ironically, I believe the job was filled with a Blackpool pharmacist whom I had met ocassionally.My love for Scotland continued, and we had our honeymoon travelling around Scotland and calling in at Tarbert for several days on the trip round.Our last trip up there was  in June as a treat from our daughter who accompanied us on this trip. The weather was glorious, and one day we caught the bus to Skipness and walked part of the Kintyre Way back.Another day we took the MacBrayne Ferry to Islay, which was again a glorious day out, also visited Crinan, Lochgilphead and Inveraray, followed by a couple of days fishing off the pier in Tarbert. We travelled back via Portavadie and Dunoon, and have in the past used the ferry to Arran, then Brodick, Ardrossan and home.Thank you for taking the time to read this.

But the COVID- lockdown interrupted proceedings.This season’s Scottish Cup was a bit of a disappointment with Star exiting the competition in the second round after losing out to a vastly improved Dumbarton United side -. On the plus side, the first round saw Star take on Paisley League team Pollok FC and an excellent performance saw Star run out convincing winners -, one of only four defeats suffered by Pollok in all competitions.In the West Region Cup, Star progressed to the quarter-final again. A first round bye, a convincing - win against Cambuslang FA then a walkover saw the Lochgilphead youths face Paisley League A Division team Erskine.In a hard-fought encounter, Star matched Erskine for most of the game but with only  players available they couldn’t get the breakthrough they needed and eventually lost -.Star started their league campaign in September with a competitive match against new team Thorn, who transferred from Paisley A Division. Star lost -.Two strong performances in October saw Star record  a terric - win over Shettleston, last season’s league runners up, and a - win against St Patrick’s Sports Academy # an entertaining but nerve-wracking game.A mid-season stutter in November saw the Lochgilphead boys lose out to Cathcart -, then Clydebank -, both newcomers.The losing run continued into early December as Star faced last season’s champions Drumchapel Amateurs ending up down - at half-time before recovering their form with a committed second half display to pull it back to -. Unfortunately they lost out to a fourth Drumchapel goal as they chased the winner themselves.This set Star back on track as they finished the year with a hugely convincing performance, demolishing Cathcart -.January and February proved a real battle with the weather with wind, rain and freezing temperatures # often all three # only allowing four games to take place. Star secured fine victories over Busby, -, and Glasgow Red Star, -, and fought back to grind out creditable draws with Shettleston, -, and Place Park, another new team, -.Star played one league game in March before lockdown and again it was another entertaining game with a rollercoaster feel to it. Facing up to Drumchapel Amateurs, both teams played out another terric match which had everything.Coming back from a goal down and with only  men, Star played cracking football to race into a - lead but it took its toll as Drumchapel stuck to their task to draw level before adding a couple more goals to secure a win in the final five minutes.This was another fine season for Red Star s, competing well in a strong league, with only  signed players.Though the season was cut short, the boys played  games winning , drawing two and losing seven. They scored  goals and conceded  goals. There were some cracking games and the boys were looking forward to the knock-out stages of the league cup.Inconsistency probably cost Star a few more wins, but that’s what youth football development is all about and there is potential for the boys to develop.Well done from coaches and parents to the  boys who played this season – Craig Aitken, Zak Barclay, Gregor Brown, Keiran Caskie, Lewis Curran, Ruaridh Green, Woody Hoad, Alexander McLean, Conner McMurchy, Leon Murphy, Innes Paterson, Jamie Stewart and Tom West.Thanks for great support goes to sponsors Ardrishaig Community Trust, main strip, SC Crawford Building Contractors Limited, change strip and zip tops, Jewsons, tracksuits, and Mid Argyll Youth Development Services and the parents, supporters, referees and opposition teams that have made the season so enjoyable."},{"url":null,"title":"sheena shows the way as tarbert tees off","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGolf started again at Glenralloch as lockdown measures were eased slightly across Scotland.The first members were on the tee at am on Friday May  for the re-opening, followed by a steady stream as the day went on.

This is achieved by installing a large cylindrical passageway in the centre of a cage, from which tarpaulin hangs and protects salmon from lice infestations when they swim to the surface to fill their swim-bladders.At Port na Cro, the tarpaulin hangs to a m depth and the feeders are placed at m.Gareth Siney, farm manager at Port na Cro, said: #At the moment, we use lots of dferent tools to tackle sea lice such as water pressure and using cleaner fish that naturally pick the sea lice off our salmon.

Hotels require one space per room.I understand that the parking standards have only recently come into effect and all other licensed premises have the benefit of being historical licensed premises and therefore protected. However, I fully believe that a common sense approach should have been taken in this instance, particularly as I submitted a very detailed travel plan which included not only promoting nearby parking options, bus timetables and taxis but actually incentivised travel to and from The Catrsquos Pyjamas by bus, taxi or on foot. When coming up with the concept of The Catrsquos Pyjamas in late summer early autumn  the first thing I did, being a total novice to owning a bar, was to engage with the licensing department.The licensing standards officer advised me I could operate with occasional licences whilst working toward the full premises licence so after submitting the occasional licence applications I was surprised to be told by planning I needed to submit a change of use application for the occasional licences.Bewildered by the conflicting information but just wishing to do what was required, I immediately submitted the application and paid the associated fee.It is frustrating that I was erroneously informed that a change of use was required for occasional licences which stopped me operating and establishing precedent.It is also frustrating I find myself in this situation because I accepted the advice and guidance of East Lothian Council. I am not seeking to apportion all the blame on the council as I have made mistakes, the biggest of which is being naive enough to believe that those who should have and give you the correct information actually do have and give you the correct information. What we have created at The Catrsquos Pyjamas is truly special. Those who have enjoyed an evening with us will validate that.I have had such incredible support from people across Dunbar and beyond that it continues to blow my mind. There is a real desire for The Catrsquos Pyjamas to work and given the chance it could become something truly amazing which is beneficial not only to the town but the county. But this journey has been very painful and costly.There has been a clear campaign against The Catrsquos Pyjamas to the point of it being a vendetta.Objectors have ly contacted the police to report noise when there was none ndash veried by Police Scotland ndash just to get it on the record ahead of the licensing board hearing. I need to take time to reflect on everything that has happened, to reflect on the impact that it has had on myself and my family. I need to investigate whether another location would be better orthe business model should change.At the moment all I can say is sincere thank you to everyone who has supported this venture from the outset and especially to my family for all the blood, sweat, tears and cash they have put into creating this very special place.Ross Hardie,The Catrsquos Pyjamas,Belhaven,Dunbar"},{"url":null,"title":"kids-create-chain-key-workers-tesco-superstore","story":"They were asked to create a window display for the store by its community champion, Jane Shepherd, and were rewarded with some treats.The hub, based at Pinkie St Peterrsquos Primary School, provides learning and childcare.

Unless you are in the shielded category, this will allow two households to meet indoors, or socially distanced drinkers and diners to sup in beer gardens and at pavement tables.

In theory at least. The worry is that,the grim weekly supermarket trip offers any guide, the new normal might feel almost as disturbing as our current lockdown.

And yet, unless there is a surge back to our old ways, the economy will slide even further into the abyss. Itrsquos hard not to feel a moral obligation to help businesses get back on their feet.Some weeks ago, I contemplated what I was most looking forward to doing when we emerged from purdah. Apart from meeting family and friends, top of the list was going for a coffee, closely followed by a day in the library. If to this could be added an early evening drink in the pub, possibly planning our next trip to Italy, I would ask nothing more. What a thrilling lestyle, you must be thinking. Yet Irsquom probably not alone, during these eerily frozen weeks, in realising how narrow and predictable the margins of my le are, and happily so.They say it takes six weeks to form a habit, so perhaps we will get used to the protocols protecting us when we enter the classroom, or train, or go shopping for clothes. It might become second nature to dine behind plastic screens on the bistro table, or to stay three steps away from our nearest and dearest, even in their own homes. And in one respect at least Irsquom looking forward to making my own mask. In winter I resemble a figure in a John Bellany painting, my nose ice cold and red raw. A fleecy face-covering could save on central heating.Even as the danger of infection diminishes, the sobering reality is that fear will persist for a considerable time. To expect to gather in a cafe as we used to, drawing up chairs to crowd around a table, is to day-dream. Almost nothing will be the same as in the good old days, or at least not at first. In the months ahead we will either have to accustom ourselves to new and uncomfortable regulations and rules, or stay housebound.Therersquos little doubt, though, that seeing the ties that bind us being slowly slackened is a huge psychological boost. As yoursquoll have guessed, Irsquom not Melrosersquos answer to Marco Polo. When Ryanairrsquos engines begin to roar, it wonrsquot be me yoursquoll see in the duty free. Yet the mere fact of being banned from travelling more than five miles from home is what has felt so constricting in recent times, even , like me, yoursquore usually quite happy staying within easy walking distance of your door.As we go through the gradual phases of our staggered release, like a barge inching through a lock, simply knowing that we can go wherever we like will come as a tremendous relief. Who careswe must be home by bedtime  Just glimpsing somewhere dferent will be excitement enough. It marks the restoration of a basic human liberty. And, as our leash ens, so spirits will lt. The invisible cordon sanitaire that has been restraining us in will vanish, and to a large degree our lives will feel like our own again.Yet while we yearn to get back to our old haunts, elements of the crisis have shown a better way, which hopefully will endure. The rise in walking and cycling signals a serious cultural sht. Along with the upturn in home deliveries, it might indicate the beginning of the end for the car. Even where I live, in the country, the air is cleaner, the roads emptier, the birds louder. The outpouring of care and concern shown across the nation for neighbours and those in need has strengthened peoplersquos connection to their community. More of us have been shopping or ordering locally, and discovering whatrsquos on our doorstep. Some have been baking their own bread, or cooking from scratch, and discovering the humdrum but satisfying joys of home le. Looking to the uncertain future, a few are on their way to becoming self-sufficient.As we gradually emerge into a freer existence, carrying hand sanitisers the way Clint Eastwood holstered a Colt , one thing seems certain. We wonrsquot take anything for granted again. The simplest of activities have already assumed a profound signicance. To call something ordinary or normal will soon be the highest terms of praise.

Jumpy impatience is never becoming, especially when combined with hazy nostrums about what comes afterwards.For there can be noto Plan A, far less an advance to a Plan B, without trying to answer the huge economic and social problems being generated at speed by the pandemic.That hellish hard work may lack the quick gratication of a process wheeze, but it has to be done before electors will consider whether independence is the next best step.What the SNPrsquos excitables need first and foremost is a Prospectus B to make the case when the time is right.But that, like our rubble economy, will take years to rebuild."},{"url":null,"title":"australian-prime-minister-apologises-no-slavery-claim","story":"PM Scott Morrison had defended the legacy of British explorer James Cook, who in  charted the site of the first British penal colony in Australia, which became present-day Sydney.Mr Morrison, who represents the Sydney electoral district of Cook in parliament, described the British naval hero on Thursday as ldquovery much ahead of his time, and urged people calling for the district to be renamed to ldquoget a bit of a grip on this.:Robert the Bruce statue vandalised with graffiti claiming he was a racist kingldquoWhile slave ships continued to travel around the world, when Australia was establishedhellip it was a pretty brutal place, but there was no slavery in Australia, he told Sydney Radio BG.But he made a rare apology on Friday after critics pointed out that tens of thousands of South Pacic islanders were forced to labour on Australian sugar cane plantations in the th century and Australian indigenous people were forced to work for wages that were never paid.ldquoMy comments were not intended to cause offence andI did, I deeply regret that and apologise for that, Mr Morrison said on Friday, adding that slavery was not lawful in the original Sydney colony.While he was seeking public restraint in re-evaluating historical figures in response to George Floydrsquos death at the hands of Minneapolis police, the Western Australia state government announced it will rename the King Leopold Ranges in Australiarsquos north west.State lands minister Ben Wyatt, an indigenous Australian, described the Belgian as an ldquoevil tyrant who should not be honoured.The announcement came after a statue of the monarch, who forced many people into slavery in Congo, was defaced and removed from the Belgian city of Antwerp.:Billy Connolly on pathetic Scottish Labour and what he really thinks about independenceMr Morrisonrsquos denial of Australian slavery came as a second blow to many indigenous Australians after he expressed gratitude following Mr Floydrsquos death that Australia did not share the US problem of police violence against the black population.Aborigines account for % of Australiarsquos adult population and % of its prison population, with more than  indigenous Australians dying in police or prison custody in the past three decades.A statue of Cook in a Sydney park was a focus of anti-racism protesters in Sydney on Friday.A cottage built by Cookrsquos parents in England in  that was moved to the Australian city of Melbourne in the s has also been targeted by activist vandals."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11475603.jpg?type=article-full","title":"pilot-whales-stranded-shore-scottish-island","story":"The whales were part of a -string pod and were found off the coast ofLochboisdale in South Uist, Outer Hebrides on Thursday night.However, on Friday several were foundstranded and in distress on the shoreline ndash with the other pilot whales in deeper water nearby.:Robert the Bruce statue vandalised with graffiti claiming he was a racist kingLocals raised the alarm and rescue charity British Divers Marine Le Rescuecalled for boats in the area to steer clear of the rest of the creatures off the coast.Thanks to the efforts of the islanders, eight of the pilot whales were successfully refloated out to sea.

There is a real danger that,the process of reopening areas of the economy is botched, the long-term impact of the restrictions could prove as damaging as the disease itself.It is welcome, then, that the Scottish Government should have announced its provisional intent to lt restrictions on aspects of the tourist industry from July , as long as progress has been made to phase three of the route map for exit. It is not only a crucial part of our economy, but tourism and other industries which augment or are a component of it, including the transport, hospitality, sport and cultural sectors, are those that have suffered the harshest effects during the period of containment.It is cheering, too, that a move to phase two begins next week and, of course, that the death toll and rates of infection outside hospitals and care homes have fallen signicantly.There remain, however, major doubts about the handling and timetable of both the UK and Scottish Governments in moving towards lockdown in the pandemicrsquos early stages the grim toll in Scottish care homes, which has been characterised as the greatest disaster of the devolution era, must be counted as an abject failure of government. The likelihood that the UK may be already one of the worst,not the worst, affected countries in both fatalities and economic impact, ought to be a warning of the terrible dangers of mishandling the moves towards recovery.The considerable problems not yet resolved in testing are further grounds for caution. Yet an overzealous interpretation of the precautionary principle, or delay for the sake of token dference, may end up causing irreparable damage to peoplersquos jobs, livelihoods and personal lives.No one expects that things willto anything like normality soon. Firms and employers have already made huge changes to the way they expect to work, but there are numerous areas where government needs to balance risk and pragmatic action. Many employees will find it dficult toto work until schooling resumes. Social distancing requirements for workplaces will have a major impact on manufacturing productivity. The proposed UK quarantine rules obviously curtail foreign visitor numbers, and evenmany Britons choose to holiday at home, there will be transport dficulties for coaches, trains and ferries.Above all, without a serious examination of the guidance on the two-metre limit on public distancing, itrsquos dficult to see how many pubs, restaurants and small retail outlets can be commercially viable. Of course, it should be maintainedthe scientic evidence is clear but other countries have given more relaxed guidance without it leading to renewed outbreaks.

This is merely a rather more visceral rendition of what governments and universities do routinely when they remove degrees and honours from figures who fall from grace. Viewed purely from an artistic perspective many of these old statues are of limited aesthetic value anyway and Irsquod be inclined to remove most of them on those grounds and replace them with something more vivid and edgy that honours the nobility of lesser realms. Stick the old slave-owners in a museum and let their mass defenestration be regarded as a moment in history of itself.What is more important here, I think is this historic opportunity of pulling down the much more insidious and less visible structures which permit racism and racial discrimination to flourish in the long term. I was moved by Anas Sarwarrsquos speech on Thursday at Holyrood in which he starkly outlined our casual indference to racial inequality in civic Scotland.Purely in the political realm I have been disobliging of Mr Sarwarrsquos machinations and stratagems in seeking to shape the Labour Party in Scotland. But there was no doubting his passion on this occasion as he took us through the myriad executive positions in Scotland by which civic influence is wielded and told us they were the exclusive preserve of whites. Scotland and Glasgow in particular is home to a prominent, well-educated Asian community who have contributed greatly to the economy and culture of our nation ndash Mr Sarwar himself is a gted son of this group.Yet, in  smart, erse and inclusive Scotland doesnrsquot trust any of them to be major decision-makers in the civic boardroom cliques which determine future strategies in education, health and the arts. Therersquos little point in posting pictures on Facebook of your presence at a Black Lives Matter demonstration and the harrowing of the nationrsquos rogue statuaryyoursquore not shamed and embarrassed by such civic and cultural apartheid.In September,  Glasgow University published a report of how it had benefited directly from the Atlantic and Caribbean slave trade. The figure of poundm emerged but it admitted that this was probably incomplete, so sinewy and deep-rooted were the routes and means of profiteering from slavery. Itrsquos inconceivable that other Scottish academic institutions, venerable trades houses, finance firms and family fortunes have not similarly benefited from the routine torture, rape and murder of millions of black people.Nor was this confined to the actions of a few old merchants whose stone effigies are currently looking a bit precarious. In a book of essays published in  called Recovering Scotlandrsquos Slavery Past, Professor Sir Tom Devine and a group of his fellow academics outlined the extent to which almost the entire economy of Scotland in the th and th centuries was under-written by profits from the Caribbean slave markets.:Black Lives Matter: Every Scottish street linked to slave-trade revealedIn his concluding essay, Sir Tom wrote: ldquoThe funds which helped to lubricate the Chesapeake trade were drawn from Scottish landowners, trustees, tradesmen, physicians, military officers, spinsters, widows and university professors, among many others. That also meant the profits of the slave-trade tobacco business were widely distributed through these financial networks well beyond the ranks of the active merchant community itself.Perhaps itrsquos reasonable to question how far back we need to go and whether the raking of ancient ashes can achieve anything. Yet, no-one is proposing punitive land and property-grabs or to impoverish those whose present fortunes are directly descended from racist genocide. Itrsquos surely also reasonable to encourage these families, firms and trades bodies to make a similar audit of their slavery-derived fortunes. Like Glasgow University they could make proportionate reparation with endowments and scholarships for the descendants of those whose suffering once fed and watered the entire Scottish nation.When the Labour Party began to introduce all-women, constituency short-lists they were criticised for endorsing the sort of discrimination they purported to revile. Yet, such a response failed to acknowledge that centuries of male privilege saw many men being promoted and honoured merely by their membership of exclusively all-male golf clubs and masonic lodges. A similar programme of positive discrimination in favour of our Black, Asian and minority ethnic communities is clearly requiredScotland seeks to become a truly inclusive and erse nation.Andblack lives really matter then our response has to be much more profound and long-lasting than knocking down a few old statues.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

If he does so, he will see repeated arguments from the Scottish Government and its advisors that lockdown was not necessary. As late as March , we were told very clearly that \"we are definitely not at the stage of needing lockdown measures in Scotland\". Not by Boris Johnson, not by Dominic Cummings, but by the Chief Medical Officer for Scotland under the admiring eye of Nicola Sturgeon.In the case of quarantine, we need to see footage of the First Minister or the Health Secretary advocating such a move at any stage. Or perhaps correspondence to the Home Secretary or Health Secretary to show how much more prescient the Scottish Government was. In the absence of quarantine, it was all the time within the devolved public health powers of the Scottish Government to test international arrivals at Scotlands airports and advise them to go into quarantinethey tested positive. Or to set up a strict Scotland-only protocol for everyone entering the country by whatever means. These steps were not taken, and again, the people deciding not to do so were not bogeymen in London but the Scottish Government.The buck stops in Edinburgh and no-one should forget it.Peter A Russell, Glasgow G.GEORGE Dalestates that \"Nicola Sturgeons Government has been giving out coronavirus guidance in a very casual manner\" nothing could be further from the truth. At the very start of this crisis, Ms Sturgeon made it clear that she would address and treat the population as grown-ups who would behave responsibly, and the vast majority of people have repaid her trust. However, although there is reason to be optimistic that the worst of the pandemic is over, for now, it would be a fatal mistake to assume that our lives can quickly go back to normal complacency could easily allow Covid to flourish again.I strongly disagree with Michael Gallagher when he writes that \"compelling vulnerable people to self-isolate for a further seven weeks is a truly appalling measure\". My daughter is in the shielded group as she is undergoing chemotherapy, so I fully understand how very dficult and distressing it is for everyone in that group and for their families. But I am also extremely relieved that the First Minister is continuing to shield these very vulnerable people to do otherwise could have truly appalling and unbearable consequences.Ruth Marr, Stirling.THERE is much to admire about Nicola Sturgeons energy with delivering her daily bulletins updates to the nation, but I have to ask: is she starting to dither with less coherence in her message I have to confess to harbouring a vested interest in this matter, but I dont get the rationale about the dates we may be able to start self-catering vacations in Scotland. A July  start to holidaying in Scotland was originally pencilled in. It appears, in England, the earliest date is Saturday July , yet, in Scotland, it has now slipped to Wednesday July . Why a Wednesday when most rentals and breaks in Scotland run from Saturday to Saturday  Why not Saturday July   I understand our R rating is more positive now, and July is the peak of the Scottish holiday season. There would be great economic benefits in starting up on July and easing the huge dficulties facing our important tourism industry.I do have a week booked in Argyllshire from Saturday July  so I hold my hands up about my self-interest. It would allow a family holiday with our six-month-old granddaughter, whom my we and I along with other family members have never been able to cuddle and bond with due to our adherence to the spirit of lockdown. I could understand and acceptthe date is July  for good reason, but a midweek date is illogical and not an example of a joined up plan.What are the reasons for the change or was the script just a trle muddled  Can someone please explain Keith Smith, Edinburgh EH.IN , Scottish residents spent some  million nights overseas while overseas visitors spent some . million nights in Scotland .If quarantine restrictions continue for the foreseeable future, thus preventing virtually all international travel in and out of Scotland, and everyone in Scotland still spends the same number of nights away from home, our tourist industry is going to have to gear up to cope with the incredible demand for the equivalent of an extra . million nights per year .Perhaps our accommodation providers should stop moaning and start rolling up their sleeves to prepare for when and where the action really starts.Quite apart from providing a massive boost to the economy throughout the Scottish tourist areas, there is also the warm feeling that those airlines which so recklessly and illegally brought thousands of cases of Covid- into the UK with such tragic and disastrous consequences, are going to continue to suffer their self-inflicted bloody noses for some considerable time to come.Quarantine Rules OK.Andrew S Noble, Dunoon.MERELY requesting people to wear masks while shopping is not enough.

Unsurprisingly, as time passes so businesses from across the region are increasingly seeking clarity on a wide range of issues vital to their survival.With Phase  of the unlocking process due shortly, the FSB believes that this is the perfect time for smaller businesses to question Mr Ewing on what the Scottish Government is doing to support businesses over the next year.The FSB’s Highlands  Islands Area Leader and director of the Kylesku Hotel, Tanja Lister, said: “We know how anxious businesses are becoming about their abilities to survive in this new world and, given that the virus is unpredictable, they clearly want as much clarity as possible so that they can plan their survival strategies once unlocking takes place.“In particular, they want to know when and how unlocking will take place, what they must do to comply with distancing protocols, how local communities will be persuaded that the time is right to unlock, and the nature of the Government-backed business support that will be put in place to carry the regional economy though to next Easter and beyond.“Nobody should think that businesses can go from nought to  in a few days – it will take a long time for them to recover, and many will need ongoing support from governments, public agencies, other businesses and, very importantly, the general public, for many months to come.“We know how heavily engaged Mr Ewing is in his vital role and we are delighted that he is giving up his time to take questions on Monday. This is the perfect time for him to meet Highlands  Islands businesses and we are looking forward to a very productive hour with him.”Questions must be submitted in advance and we will ask as many as we can in the allotted time, say the organisers.

Hundreds were accused after the Horizon system showed cash shortfalls at their branches.Speaking in the House, Mr Carmichael said: “I hope that when he s to the department today he will tell his officials and tell also the Post Office senior management that this review just isn’t going to cut it.#This is a complex case and that is why it requires a judge-led inquiry, and that is what will happen eventually, so why not just cut to the quick and do it now ”Responding for the Government, Paul Scully MP said: “The point is the terms of reference within this review are the same as a judge-led inquiry.#I do not want an inquiry that lasts  years and that sub-postmasters are going to come back time and time again with no justice.

Not wearing a face covering may mean passengers will not be able to travel.Due to social distancing requirements, the numbers of passengers within the terminal building will be limited and only travelling passengers will be allowed in the terminal. Special assistance support is still available for those who require it.All passengers will be welcomed by a member of the HIAL team on arrival who will help guide them through the new procedures.Based on the latest advice from the Scottish Government and Health Protection Scotland temperature checks are not currently required.Managing director Inglis Lyon, said: “My colleagues have worked extremely hard to offer a safer environment for passengers at our airports and we will continue to rely on the understanding and cooperation of travellers to follow our new procedures to make their experience as smooth as possible, given the current restrictions.“We are pleased that we are now able to focus on a safe and gradual resumption of air travel, however it is vital that everyone plays their part in helping ensure we avoid risking transmission of COVID-, by ensuring that you turn up at the airport wearing your face mask, maintaining social distancing and personal hygiene. We will continue to move in lockstep with Transport Scotland and adhere to Health Protection Scotland advice.“We do not know , or when, we will be able to travel as we did pre-coronavirus and given that all of us must adapt to these new habits and procedures in order to go about this part of our lives.“As we implement our procedures, we are doing our utmost to get everything right for our passengers.

These figures do not account for tests undertaken through the UK Government testing system.Mr McArthur who, alongside the local press, has repeatedly appealed for this information to be released, was pleased that figures had finally been made public.He said: “I welcome the decision by NHS Orkney to publish localised information and provide the public with greater clarity on the level of testing taking place in Orkney.“I have been pressing Ministers for weeks to agree to releasing testing data.  To date, despite warm words, the Scottish Government has refused to budge.“I therefore welcome NHS Orkney’s decision to follow the lead taken by NHS Shetland in making public this information.  As we move forward with ‘test and protect’, other types of information will also be needed to give people an understanding of the situation in their local area.“It is clear that transparency is key to building public confidence and the compliance we will need to see as we continue to emerge from lockdown. This move by NHS Orkney is a good step in the right direction.”NHS Orkney has sought to remind the community that testing is available for anyone over the age of five who has symptoms, and to keep up hygiene standards in order to prevent the spread of the virus.Mr O#Brien said: “It is down to the great work and commitment from all those who live and work in Orkney that we have kept positive results so low, but we must not get complacent.#As the lockdown is being relaxed and people begin moving around more freely, we will be exposed again.“To keep safe, our community must continue to stick to the hygiene and infection control guidelines.”These include:copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This is an understandable source of frustration for many customers pic ykZlQsZBmdash Transport CommitteeJune , Unions told the committee they are opposed to what they described as a ldquofire and rehire approach being considered by British Airways.They stated the airline is proposing to give redundancy notices to most of its , workers and offer jobs with new terms and conditions to a proportion of them,it cannot reach an agreement on job cuts and other changes.The minimum -day consultation period for some workers ends on Monday.BA has had discussions with pilotsrsquo union Balpa, including over the possibility of voluntary redundancies.But the other two main unions representing its workers ndash Unite and GMB ndash are not engaging in talks.The committee found that British Airways had received nearly pound million from the Government as of May  by furloughing , staff.Willie Walsh, chief executive of British Airwaysrsquo parent company IAG, told the MPs that the amount of money the airline received from the scheme in April was equivalent to less than two days of staff wages.Unions have argued that the airline could survive evenall its planes were grounded for  months.The committeersquos report stated: ldquoThe behaviour of British Airways and its parent company towards its employees is a national disgrace.ldquoIt falls well below the standards we would expect from any employer, especially in light of the scale of taxpayer subsidy, at this time of national crisis.There have been calls from some MPs for British Airways to be stripped of some of its lucrative take-off and landing slots at Heathrow as punishment for the treatment of its workforce.Tory MP Huw Merriman, who chairs the committee, said: ldquoWe will continue to bring pressure where we can, including the airport slot allocation process.ldquoThis wanton destruction of a loyal workforce cannot appear to go without sanction by Government, parliamentarians or paying passengers who may choose dferently in future. We view it as a national disgrace.British Airways said in a statement: ldquoMr Merriman made clear several weeks ago that the Transport Select Committeersquos report would be lsquofuelled by the kind and impassioned messagesrsquo he received, rather than the facts.ldquoThe facts are clear. The Government has no plans to help the sector restart and recover as evidenced by the introduction of the -day quarantine regulation.ldquoWe find ourselves in the deepest crisis ever faced by the airline industry. A crisis not of our making but one which we must address.ldquoWe will do everything in our power to ensure that British Airways can survive and sustain the maximum number of jobs consistent with the new reality of a changed airline industry in a severely weakened global economy.Unite general secretary Len McCluskey said: ldquoThe case the company makes for sacking , and trashing the wages of those who stay on the workforce is full of holes because it is a transparent effort to generate profits out of a crisis.BALPAs response to the @CommonsTrans report in full: https:t.co tBmTFFRAmdash BALPAJune , ldquoBA is fooling nobody. Never before has the country witnessed such wholesale mistreatment of a UK workforce and such brutal industrial thuggery.The committeersquos report into the impact of the pandemic on the aviation sector also urged the Government to abandon its -day quarantine rule at the end of June.It called for a ldquomore targeted and nuanced border control policy, allowing people travelling from countries where the infection rate of Covid- is relatively low to enter the UK on a less restrictive basis.A Government spokesman said: ldquoWe continue to work at speed to help protect the long-term future of the sector, however we will always put public health first, and we must not risk an extremely damaging second wave of the virus.copy -.

It looks increasingly likely that any exit from lockdown and safe re-opening of tourism and hospitality businesses could be during the low season.#Without financial support to tide them over, that could be the nail in the coffin for many businesses.“In Shetland, like where in Scotland, earnings from tourism during the spring and summer months sustains people through the winter and it is a real worry that coronavirus hit just when the visitor season was starting.#It is clear that a -month plan, at least, is needed to ensure that viable businesses can survive to provide a living for their owners and be ready to safely welcome visitors again when the time is right.”Speaking via video link earlier this week, Mr Carmichael welcomed the Chancellor of the Exchequer#s announced extension to the furlough scheme to protect jobs – but added more was needed to help tourism.“Here in the Northern Isles we particularly see that in the visitor economy, which is crucial to us,# he added.#The assistance for bed and breakfast operators, or operators of self-catering accommodation, leaves too many people without the assistance they need.“A support scheme that finishes at the end of August, or September or whenever it will be, simply will not be adequate in parts of the country such as ours.#Those parts of the country that have seasonal tourism require a -month programme, or  the tourism industry that will be left to be resurrected at the end of this process will be that much weaker, and the rebuilding and recovery that much more dficult.” on Wednesday also heard from struggling tourism businesses.One BB owner said she had been unable to apply for support funds as they required applicants to have paid businesses rates, whereas she paid domestic council tax.Living Lerwick has also raised the plight of small tourism operators.Project manager Emma Miller said that as some did not have a business banking account they had been unable to apply for the Creative or Tourism and Hospitality Enterprises Fund, which opened in Scotland to support the industry. raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"more vessels but aprils gross tonnage is well down on last year ","story":"Lerwick Harbour saw a big reduction in shipping tonnage during April compared with the same month last year – although the number of arrivals was actually up slightly.A total of  vessels called, compared with  in April , but the overall tonnage dropped from , to ,grt.The deficit was partly due to no cruise ships callinglast year, although ferries, live fish carriers and oil traffic were all also down considerably.The April arrivals this year included  fishing boats,  workboats tenders,  ro ro ferries,  live fish carriers, eight oil boats, eight tugs, five tankers, five ferries and three pilot boats.The fishing vessels comprised  Shetland,  British, three Danish, two French and one Norwegian boat.For the first four months of the year the overall number of arrivals at Lerwick holds up reasonably well with  – , as compared to , in .

She added that she would have been willing to pay a “reasonable fee”they had attempted such a feat themselves.And Catherine Emslie wrote an open letter addressed to Sada chairman Mr Stevenson, claiming that she had been forced to do so because earlier correspondence with Shetland Arts on literature development in the isles “fell on deaf ears”.In response to the concerns, Mr Stevenson assured Wordplay devotees that the festival will–Shetland Arts feels the festival “can be shown to be an effective part of the development of the arts in the islands”.He repeated Mr Howell’s previous statement about Wordplay, and Shetland Arts’ other festivals such as Screenplay and Shetland Folk Frenzy, being consistently “up for review”.Mr Howell insisted last month that the trust had not decided to cancel the festival for good, but added: “I think everything should be under review.”Mr Stevenson said Shetland Arts was “not mandated to run or support any specic festival, event or development programme”, and that all of their festivals and events would be consistently up for debate during the development of their three-year strategy, which the trust is currently in the process of developing.All three of the trusts events, Shetland Folk Frenzy, Wordplay and Screenplay, had to be cancelled “solely as a response to the Covid- pandemic”, he said.Mr Stevenson, as with Mr Howell last month, urged any concerned fans of the festival to make their views known to the trust when they hold a public consultation later in the year.He said that Shetland Arts “is not, and does not profess to be perfect” and would listen to any constructive criticism levelled at them.Mr Stevenson did not address whether the trust had considered holding the event virtually, either for free or by charging a fee, but he did add that there had been “a number of constructive points” made about the quality of the Wordplay festival across the last few years.The festival “took a break” in , with a short event called  Stories and Music replacing the annual festival.And in  Wordplay was replaced with the Shetland Noir crime-writing festival, which was only held once..."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/racism-collage.jpg","title":"editorial we cannot rewrite history but we must constantly revise our reading of the","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineBlack, Asian and minority ethnic men and women have been pointing out for centuries that that they live in a white people#s world.The murder of black people by white American police officers has caused protests and riots before, although not from Minneapolis to Sydney by way of Portree, Duntulm, Ullapool and most points in between.Three things in particular distinguish this movement from its predecessors.One is its abovementioned internationalism.Another is the fact that many politicians and even police have made no secret of their sympathy for the cause.A third, which seems somehow to be connected to the first two, is that it is occurring simultaneously with the equally worldwide phenomenon of Covid-.It is no secret that the virus extracts its most vicious toll from BAME communities, who are almost everywhere in the world most defenceless against its onslaught.Is this part of our brave new post-coronavirus world Has the virus, whether we are black or white, pushed us into a new view of our societies, of which the global Black Lives Matter campaign is a foretaste It is right to question whether it was the wisest time to take to the UK’s streets en-masse. Many protesters’ actions, in clear breach of social distancing rules, were dangerous.Yet nobody should shed tears when the bronze statue of a brutal th century Bristol slaver is hauled from his distinguished plinth in the city centre and thrown into the harbour.Our main concern should be how and why it was allowed to stay there for so long.As Edward Colston#s effigy toppled towards the watery grave to which he had consigned so many enslaved Africans, a protestor knelt on Colston#s neck.That was a graphic illustration of the incident which precipitated the storm: the throttling by a Minneapolis police officer of the US citizen George Floyd.George Floyd#s last words were #I can#t breathe#, which applied both literally and to his place in society.There is nothing sacrosanct about most secular statues. Before  statues of Adolf Hitler were commonplace in Europe.You would be hard pressed to find one now.The same applies to Josef Stalin in most of the former Soviet territories.Just outside New Delhi there is a lonely and extensive graveyard of hundreds of statues of former eminences of the British colonial Raj. Wild dogs roam among them.Closer to home, Glasgow#s and Edinburgh#s exploitation of slavery is being recognised by the alteration of Glasgow street names and a plaque in Edinburgh#s St Andrew#s Square by the -foot statue of Henry Dundas, which will detail his connections with the slave trade.It#s either that or throw him in the Forth.We were no innocents in this field. In , no fewer than  per cent of Jamaican slave plantations were owned by Scots.Research by University College London has revealed that when slavery in British territory was abolished in , the equivalent of £ billon in compensation was handed out to just over  Scottish proprietors.They were not all in Glasgow and Edinburgh.Donald Martin of Monkstadt in Skye cashed in on his ill-gotten gains. So did Alexander MacLean of North Uist.The Raasay proprietor George Rainy banked his share from human traffic, as did Donald MacLeod of Lewis and Alexander McBarnet of Attadale.There are no statues of those gentlemen to throw in the sea.But the next time somebody suggests a similar fate for the statue of the Duke of Sutherland on Ben Bhraggie # a fate to which we would have little objection # we should remember that black lives also matter.They did then and they do now.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/HWRC__Portree_Re_Opening_15th_June_graphic-scaled.jpg","title":"portree recycling centre to re open on","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoineand receive confirmation before travelling to the site.The Portree site is open for essential waste disposal only, and householders are advised that journeys to a HWRC must only be undertakentheir waste cannot be stored at home safely.

Orwe the providers are the birds, desperately hoping for an income, fat and seed to feed us after an extra-long winter.Social media fluttered with posts from businesses stating ‘we hope to be open’, the sensible ones being aware of Fergus Ewing’s proviso: “This date cannot be definitive and is conditional on public health advice and progression to phase three of the route map.”While a lot of work will need to be done, practicalities and protocols worked out, how do we clean rooms, how do we ‘meet and greet’, do we leave rooms fallow for  hours, do we use PPE when cleaning, I think as much work needs to be done in the wider community.How are the visitors going to eat, how are they going to shop I have seen some quite lax adherence to protection in local shops with face covering usage fairly minimal at best.We have probably got away with this behaviour due to the low numbers of cases outwith the care home community.This could change with an influx of people from away. Any vigilantism must be directed at ourselves and the messages we put out when we go about our day to day business as lockdown eases.Protect ourselves and others.Those vulnerable people we have been looking after with prescription runs and message collections, some of them might not be looking forward to an influx of staycationers.What  are they bringing with their much-needed cash None of these problems are insurmountable. Guidelines will be available and in the month ahead, confidence will hopefullyand a dose of common sense will go a long way to making things work.The talk is that furlough is just the precursor to redundancy, and the economy will be struggling in all sectors.The knock on is likely to be fewer visitors with less money, and of course with the quarantine enforcement for overseas visitors, there won’t be many coming from afar.I hope the tourismwill be a trickle, then a stream, in order for us all to get used to how it can work.Despite being involved in the business I actually hope that it never s to the flood, the tsunami of the last two years, where the danger was the destruction of our environment and our community.We were perhaps too busy making money to spend time with our families, friends and neighbours.While loving the quiet roads, the time spent with family, and the time spent re-evaluating prioritiesit couldn’t last for ever.The savings are being eaten into, the government assistance also doesn’t last forever, reality looms.There is an economic model of price and product determination, that everybody is acutely aware of called “supply and demand’.In recent years as the visitor numbers went through the roof, and perhaps became unsustainable, bed provision rose, spare rooms developed, cabins and pods built, garages renovated.Still numbers rose, and so did the prices, a simple correlation.There is likely to now be an oversupply of bed provision, the economists would foresee a reduction in price as people compete for a smaller market.This may at first bring prices down to a realistic level, there was perhaps a danger that Skye was becoming a rich person’s destination.A possible consequence may be what I have heard described as “a race to the bottom”, with what is effectively a price war, and possibly falling too far.This when the product suddenly has become more expensive to manage, rooms costing more to clean, hotels only being able to cope with fewer guests to comply with social distancing.We have a free market economy, there is little or no control, people can charge what they like, and undercutting is a valid entrepreneurial technique do something better cheaper#!I mentioned weeks ago, for many, the tourist dollar is the icing on the pension cake, a second income to a professional wage.Perhaps there is a fine line between need and greed.Some tourist operators have been forced to use food banks and needing help from the Skye Community Response group during lockdown.As business s, and these people can begin rebuilding their livelihoods, perhaps others have to decide what their own needs are.The pension or the wage might be enough.One of the reasons I love starlings is the incredible murmurations they create in autumn, just before roosting in the evenings.These bickering birds who flutter and jostle around the trees, for twenty minutes or so before descending to reeds and branch to sleep, put on a display with no equal in nature.Moving in unison, they create patterns in the sky, shapes, forms, dance. Apparently, each bird affects the six or seven around it but a flock of tens of thousands moves asone, producing something beautul.Community can be like that.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3168438.jpg--.jpg?1591781511000\n","title":"local translink staff in grocery donation drive","story":" Translink staff in Ballymena Bus and Rail Station have responded to the COVID- emergency by starting a special grocery donation drive for people in need in their local community.

The Volunteer Bikers Groupbegan with just five riders and now has  members who travel all over distributing food parcels, medication and personal protective equipment . Deliveries have included essential chemotherapy drugs for a patient in Donegal, who needed an urgent delivery from Altnagelvin Hospital. There have been some unusual requests too, with one volunteer tasked to deliver a Moses basket arriving to find the mother-to-be already in labour. The group is self-funding, with volunteers using their own motorbikes and fuel, but it does accept donations and to date has raised almost £, for the Northern Ireland Children#s Hospice. To recognise their efforts, representatives were invited to Stormont on Thursday, where they were thanked personally by Health Minister Robin Swann. Among them was their youngest PPE maker, -year-old Jamie Watson from Stranocum in Co Antrim, who has made over  frames for face shields. The five men who started the group are father and son Paul and Phil Johnston, John Lawson, Michael Price and Richard Webber. However, what began as a few trips to help elderly and vulnerable people needing prescriptions and essential items in the north Down area has mushroomed into an impressive assistance operation with volunteers from every corner of Northern Ireland. Every motorbike club in the province is involved and the volunteer riders include men and women from all walks of le - from helicopter pilots and barristers to business owners and people who are unemployed. One of the group#s main roles has been helping to deliver some of the , scrubs made by volunteers in their own homes on behalf of NI Scrubs Group. Mr Lawson said: There were so many iniduals and community and sewing groups out there making the PPE but there was no mechanism to get the items from A to B, so we filled that gap. Fourteen-year-old Jamie Watson actually uploaded mask frames for D photocopiers and started printing them off himself. There were wee factories all over the place making components for the NHS frames and we were collecting dferent elements of those so they could be put together. We wanted to take the pressure off the NHS. As well as travelling all over Ireland, the volunteers have also teamed up with motorcycle groups in the Republic and other parts of the UK to guarantee items reach their intended targets. One such delivery was from Wigan to Omagh Hospital and Lisnaskea Health Centre, with the local volunteers travelling to Cairnryan to collect the items from the English riders. All of the volunteers have been #cleared# through Access NI for pharmacy deliveries, and the group also received a tracking system - donated by UK company Microlise - which allows it to monitor its riders and deliveries. It means it can supply authorities with details of where riders have beenCovid- contact tracing should be required. Co-volunteer Phil Johnston explained that riders are still out seven days a week. Despite relaxation we still find there are some people not willing to risk leaving home and we are supporting them with deliveries of prescriptions and PPE, he explained. And the group has no plans to stop any time soon. We do feel there is benefit to us and the wider community in remaining. Options include support for blood bikes, transplant movements and other areas where the health service will need all the support it can get, he said. Plus, we are reluctant to step back in the event there is a second wave. Mr Lawson said the support and feedback the group had received had been phenomenal. It#s a privilege for us to do this. This has drawn together the entire motorcycle community in Northern Ireland and we almost feel we are carrying a banner for the bikers of Northern Ireland, he added.It is why we don#t accept any money. We feel aswe are giving something back.

Surgeries were put on hold at the Children#s Hospital in Belfast when the restrictions were first introduced in March.This meant the young patient had to endure further months of an exhausting regime of kidney dialysis seven nights a week, making it uncertain he could even start primary school this year.After carefully studying the risks involved of operating during the pandemic, his medical team asked the family to take a leap of faith and perform the surgery.The operation followed the success of the adult renal and nephrology service, who have performed around  transplants from deceased donors since the start of lockdown.Dr Karl McKeever is the patient#s consultant and clinical director in the Children#s Hospital.He told the Belfastit was a proud day for the team after a frightening period when all bets were off on when surgeries for children could resume.He also spoke of the touching moment the young boy celebrated on the ward after his operation.Everybody was very frightened about what lay ahead, he said.This particular patient was already teed up for a transplant because of high clinical need before the pandemic.That had to be postponed and the clock was ticking because other patients can sadly die on dialysis.That has been the case in other parts of the world that have been harder hit and haven#t been able to start their services.The team faced a dficult decision between protecting the donor and patient from Covid- and the harm of doing nothing.Work started with Dr Mairead Convery, a consultant paediatric nephrologist, networking with management in the Belfast Trust and other experts across the UK to assess the risk.After collecting enough data, the team concluded that with the proper safety measures, the risk of Covid- to the donor and patient was small.It#s been a very exciting time amidst all the bad times, said Dr McKeever. It#s so transforming for the family who have had to take that leap of faith.The impact of dialysis and what families have to go through needs to be seen to be believed and is very humbling for us.He continued: I always remember when the little boy ed to the ward a few days after his surgery and chanted #We did it, we did it!#It was particularly interesting to see the awareness he had at such a young age about what was going on in society around them.He understood why it had been held up, so to see it come off in such a good way with all of the team involved was amazing.Between two and six kidney transplants are usually performed at the Children#s Hospital each year.The numbers are low so it wasn#t a worry we couldn#t catch up, but it was the risk to the patients as the days went by on dialysis waiting for this le-changing surgery, Dr McKeever said.So, it#s just been super for this wee man and his family. After going through so much in recent years, I#d say they#re not entering a new chapter as much as a new book.Dr Convery added she was absolutely delighted to be first paediatric centre in the UK and Ireland to perform a living donor transplant during lockdown and thanked staff for their perseverance in giving a child the most amazing gt.Most importantly, we would like to thank our patient, their family and the donor for their courage and cooperation throughout the process.

Singing is also discouraged, and the passing of an offering plate among worshippers must not be your practice for the foreseeable future.The document says that in relation to the administration of the sacraments, guidance is still being considered by Church leaders and will be communicated in due course.Rev Trevor Gribben, clerk to the General Assembly, said the lockdown restrictions had been a painful experience for worshippers. The past three months of lockdown across the island of Ireland has presented unprecedented challenges, he said. For our ministers and congregations, this has included the enforced closure of our church buildings and an inability to meet together for worship face-to-face. While undoubtedly this has been a painful experience for many, I have been encouraged to see how our people have adapted to share God#s Word creatively online, and keep in contact with members and others in the community through phone calls, emails and old-fashioned letters.He said theto normal church services posed more complex problems than the sudden closure had. As lockdown restrictions gradually ease, our congregations must think carefully and responsibly about the practical preparations necessary to facilitate theof worship services and other aspects of church le, he added. Each congregation#s circumstances will be dferent and they will come to a iety of decisions about what activities to recommence, and how quickly this can happen. However, meeting together with brothers and sisters in Christ is central to Christian le and a primary expression of church as the family of God.And we look forward to having the opportunity to do so once again.Belfast Most ReadCoronavirus: Northern Ireland leads the way as shoppers descend on Belfast for retail Pastor Barrie Halliday charged after Black Lives Matter commentsBlack Lives Matter: Pastor Barrie Halliday who told protestors to #go home in a boat# defends videoLinfield chairman says club will not be dropping new kit design after UVF comparisonsCoronavirus Northern Ireland updates: One further death as NI#s shops reopen ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

This is to allow clubs to plan and work towards the start of the   season and the playing of rugby matches. September has been given as the month in which rugby matches will be permitted tofor clubs. Given the changing nature of the reopening of society and the recovery from the Covid- pandemic, a specic date will not be issued until further clarity is available and will remain subject to change. The given date will also factor in a minimum window of five weeks permitted for contact training ahead of ato rugby matches. googletag.cmd.push The Competition Stage is the final stage in the summary roadmap of the IRFU Return To Rugby Guidelines.

The governing body recognises concerns over travel, safety and expense and this will be reflected in the season’s structure. Clubs should expect that games at the start of the season will be kept local where practicable. This is another welcome step in ourto rugby. There is a huge amount of work going on behind the scenes in clubs at present as they put Health  Safety plans in place to manage the risk of Covid-. This announcement helps give us all something to work towards, commented Greg Barrett, Chair of the IRFU Rugby Committee. googletag.cmd.push It’s important for rugby players to have competitive sport to look forward to and they deserve to know that ourto rugby guidelines are built around their welfare. We will provide further clarity on what the   season will look like, but what we can say is that the first matches permitted will keep travel to a minimum. This should help with concerns around travel, but our hope is that this will also serve as an opportunity for the rugby community to support their clubs and help generate some much needed cash-flow. For now, I would urge clubs to continue to focus on completing the Covid- Safety Planning Stage of our guidelines and availing of the education  training supports that the IRFU have put in place. That is ultimately what will lead to the resumption of rugby as we know it. RELATED - Mixed feelings over ato local GAA action. More...

This is to allow clubs to plan and work towards the start of the   season and the playing of rugby matches. September has been given as the month in which rugby matches will be permitted tofor clubs. Given the changing nature of the reopening of society and the recovery from the Covid- pandemic, a specic date will not be issued until further clarity is available and will remain subject to change. The given date will also factor in a minimum window of five weeks permitted for contact training ahead of ato rugby matches. googletag.cmd.push The Competition Stage is the final stage in the summary roadmap of the IRFU Return To Rugby Guidelines. All clubs are currently in the Covid- Safety Planning Stage, which they must complete before moving to the resumption of training at any level. The IRFU are working toward a modied season for  . The governing body recognises concerns over travel, safety and expense and this will be reflected in the season’s structure. Clubs should expect that games at the start of the season will be kept local where practicable. This is another welcome step in ourto rugby. There is a huge amount of work going on behind the scenes in clubs at present as they put Health  Safety plans in place to manage the risk of Covid-. This announcement helps give us all something to work towards, commented Greg Barrett, Chair of the IRFU Rugby Committee. googletag.cmd.push It’s important for rugby players to have competitive sport to look forward to and they deserve to know that ourto rugby guidelines are built around their welfare. We will provide further clarity on what the   season will look like, but what we can say is that the first matches permitted will keep travel to a minimum. This should help with concerns around travel, but our hope is that this will also serve as an opportunity for the rugby community to support their clubs and help generate some much needed cash-flow. For now, I would urge clubs to continue to focus on completing the Covid- Safety Planning Stage of our guidelines and availing of the education  training supports that the IRFU have put in place. That is ultimately what will lead to the resumption of rugby as we know it. RELATED - Mixed feelings over ato local GAA action. More...

His younger years coincided with a bright spell in the clubs history. He spoke to Michael McMullan about losing championships, winning the John McLaughlin Cup and building for the future. Gutty McGlone is no dferent to any other competitor. Defeat hits him like a sledgehammer. It festers to the very pit of his stomach. Its county final afternoon in  and an emerging Lavey team savour the sweet aroma of victory. Inside, in the corner of the Glen dressing room, McGlone reflects. The remnants of their - to - defeat get tossed through his mind again, something only disappointment can do. googletag.cmd.push The pitter patter of water in the adjoining shower area stops. The noise you only hear above the eerie silence of failure. John McErlain, Liam Devlin and Damian Barton emerge. Their confab draws a common conclusion. They had left three titles behind them. Next year will be dferent. In , -year-old McGlones debut season, the Bridge didnt stand up for themselves in the championship against Ballinderry, before losing the game. Eamonn Coleman was manager and after making him a regular from the mid-point of the league, Hugh wasnt selected for the championship defeat to the Shamrocks, with Coleman later confessing it was about protecting him for a career ahead. He just wasnt ready. googletag.cmd.push Three years earlier, torn ligaments in McGlones right ankle, sustained in school action for St Pius, worked out for the best. “Before that, I couldnt kick with my weak foot,” recalls Hugh, who would later coach at underage and engineer the foundations for the current senior team. He remembers the late Brendan Convery insisting on ato school training once he could walk, before arming him with a bag of balls. “Convery made me stand on the and kick every ball into the goals with my left foot. The next week, he made me go to the ,” McGlone clearly remembers. The man who managed Laveys All-Ireland winning team was developing McGlone without him even knowing. “I gradually got stronger and stronger and thats where I ended up playing at left corner back for the Bridge seniors at , because I had two feet and was able to go up the line...that was all down to Brendan Convery.” St Pius annexed an U Vocational Schools All-Ireland, with McGlone on board. A year later, in , Derry minors, who played most of the game with  men following the first-minute dismissal of Gregory McCloskey, were beaten by a point in Newry by Down, who went on to win the All-Ireland. McGlone lined out at corner back and a year more experienced, had established himself as a regular on the Bridge senior team. Once again, they crossed paths with Ballinderry. After having previously taken two games to beat Magherafelt, they met the Shamrocks in the infamous semi-final replay encounter at Greenlough. Newbridge came through to play Dungiven in a final.  The Newbridge team pictured before the  Derry senior final It wasnt to be. Newbridge were going to stand their ground this time. Familiarity bred contempt and after another tempestuous battle with the Shamrocks, which saw pitch invasions, Newbridge were thrown out leaving Dungiven to be awarded the title in the boardroom. Losing was becoming a habit and in the aftermath of their  defeat, before leaving Glen, they made a pact. “We are going to learn from this,” McGlone relays of the collective dressing room message. “We left one , we didnt get playing in oneand now we have lost one. We are not going to lose another one.” *** You earned your corn at Newbridge training. The championship jersey wasnt handed out willy nilly. Gutty McGlone, the youngest of seven boys in a house of  children, would leave home for the short walk to the hall for a Saturday pre-championship meeting before the  final. He was unnecessarily uneasy. “Im not sure of my position here,” McGlone thought. He was ever-present and never substituted during the year, but Stephen Walls, an All-Ireland minor winner with Derry in , was breathing down McGlones neck. “Thats the class of player we had on the bench. I knew I had played well, but because of the competition at the time in the Newbridge team, I was thinking I could get a gunk here I knew the pressure was on, thats why you had to perform.” It was an era that secured back-to-back senior leagues in  and , as well as three reserve championships inside five years. “This just wasnt about the senior team, those three teams were the pinnacle of us winning thechampionship in ,” McGlone stated, in no uncertain terms. Before emphasising it again. “We played games at training during ...it was a senior team against a reserve team. We struggled to beat them, so that shows you the class of talent we had in Newbridge at that time.” McGlone name-checks Mickey McGrogan and Shane Doherty as some of the forwards who trotted into his left corner back area in training games, players not even listed on the -man match-day  for the final. And they gave him his fill of it. “Then, you had big Hugh McGrogan, Paudis Da, running around at midfield, kicking the shite out of Damian Barton. There was no respect given whatsoever.” It was dog eat dog. And it needed to be. This was to be the year. “Rabbiand Sam , our managers, picked  seniors against  reserves, so we would learn how to play together in games.” The seniors never overran their reserve counterparts. “Not a chance,” Gutty stresses. The seniors never won by any more than four or five points, with the reserves winning the odd game. It worked wonders when it mattered. “Any time we were down by a couple of points , that team didnt know when it was beat. Now it mightnt have been the silkiest team, but boys just never quit,” Hugh admits. After three years of knocking on the door, with the pain of defeat lingering like a dark cloud and with the younger players beginning to mature, it was time to die dog or shite the licence. *** There was another ingredient. Sam Bateson is described by McGlone as the tactician with his managerial partner Thomas Fullerton also knowing his football. The perfect match. Fullerton, a reserve winning captain, was playing with McGlone in a  Graham Cup game. Magherafelt were running them ragged and led by six or seven points at the interval. “It was one of the first times I saw we had steel and other teams didnt have, Thomas went f**king ballistic at half-time,” Gutty remembers. It was a watershed moment. The law was laid down. Like the rest of the team, McGlone imposed himself. They were like men possessed and won the game well. “I was niggling with my man and remember him filling my mouth when we began to get on top,” said McGlone, who walked off the pitch with blood running out of his nose. “Hes not playing football in the next round, but we are,” Rabbi uttered to him, with a laugh. “Thats when I thought, the odd slap in the mouth doesnt matter, as long as you come out on the right side of it.” Another piece of valuable advice was dished out by John McErlain who often played in front of him on the left wing. In his early days, McGlone would often hoof the ball to safety. As a young buck, and under pressure, it was safer than getting caught in possession. “John roared at me one day in a league game,” he remembers. “I was told to either use the ball up the wing or just lay it off. Its those wee things that helps you when you are growing up.” As the  season began to grow, Newbridge beat  champions Bellaghy in the first round, followed by a hard-earned victory over  winners Glenullin and a semi-final encounter win over Banagher. It took them to the decider against neighbours Castledawson. Midway through the first-half, Brian McErlain was sent off. In the reshuffle, Damian Barton dropped back to centre-back. “Damian was that good with the long pass, that we didnt really have to attack and we could keep six at the back,” McGlone said of his captain. “He was able to get the ball to Devand Paddy Barton up there. On that day, I thought the Newbridge defence was outstanding...everybody. It was tight, it was hard hitting and Castledawson didnt get going.” They knew that Eamonn Heaney wasnt going to make Dawsons starting team, but would play a part. He had played at full-back in the  final, but was now threw in at full-forward to help rescue the game. It wasnt long before Rabbi was out over the sideline to instruct McGlone to do a marking job on Colm McKee for the remainder of the game, having blotted out the substituted Mickey Hughes. “Neither me or Colm touched the ball, but the management had trust in us. I was the youngest man on our team and they were happy to leave me on their county man.” Having played in three county finals and losing two of them, McGlone – who has a memory for detail that matches his enthusiasm – always remembers the call for stewards to pick up their end of match positions. “Its one of the worst feelings you could have as a footballer when you are getting beat by two or three points,” he recalls. One year on from hearing it against Lavey in , they led Castledawson when the announcement bellowed out. He remembers dampening Eoin Gribbins joy at the thought of having their clutches on that elusive championship. “One goal and they are back in it,” McGlone warned him. “In the Lavey game, it seemed to last  seconds until the final whistle, but when it was called that year , we were ahead...it seemed like an eternity until the whistle.” Newbridge were not to be caught. They kept their promise from  months earlier and Damian Barton collected the John McLaughlin Cup after a -year gap, for their th and last title. From McGlones recollection, win lose or draw, Wilfie Garvin, Mick McKenna, Jim Gilmore, Seamus and Dermot Doherty, Owen and Willie Gribbin would always be in the Newbridge dressing room after games. They were part of the teams fabric. “I remember those boys being in the day we won it and I was never as glad to see it. Its one of the wee things I will always remember.” Later in the evening the team went for a meal at the ONeill Arms in Toome, before heading back to Newbridge Hall for the celebrations. McGlone wasnt a teetotaller, he enjoyed a drink like most of the others and it was curbed during the championship preparations. “I never touched drink the night we won the championship, not one pint,” Gutty said of his premeditated decision. “I wanted to savour the whole thing and not to be talking to the older men around the club and me maybe half tight.” The next two or three days were dferent. Between the Elk and the Thatch, it was party central. On the Monday night, the squad did a tour of Newbridge on the back of Mick McKennas lorry.   Derry champions Newbridge “Everyone was on the back of er,” Gutty laughs. “We went down to Toome to pick up Stephen McErlain and then did every road in Newbridge. You wouldve thought there were  cars behind us. For the next two or three days, I dont think we sobered.” They were at the top of Everest. But surprisingly, being one of the most consistent teams of the time, it was the only senior championship that crop won. In , they took the foot off the pedal and lost to Ballinascreen in the semi-final who were beaten by eventual All-Ireland champions Lavey. “In  Eugene Young came in to manage us and we got to the final. We missed two goals and theyscored two goals, that was the dference in us winning another one.” While picking up intermediate silverware in the interim, he recalls the disappointment of relegation in  after surviving for three or four seasons in play-offs. “To start your career with a championship medal in your pocket at  or , struggling and relegation was tough. To go from being top of the pile...from walking around behind bands, to relegation, it was tough.” McGlone picked up an intermediate medal in , but when the same title ed five years later, he had stepped away from the seniors, choosing to play with the reserves. Gutty was coaxed out back into the senior ranks by manager Gavin Devlin for an impact role at full-forward, using his guile to pull full-back lines of position. A dead leg suffered in , a niggle that never fully cleared up told McGlone it was time to pull the pin. In retirement, he was never going to step away from the game he loved. The buzz in his voice, with every word dancing, speaks volumes for his fanaticism for football. He stayed on as long as he could, with the club having little youth coming through. It was time to dig new foundations and survey the lie of the land in the local school. “There were big numbers from U down, so we decided wed start with the underage,” states Hugh, who had the help of Neil Young, Martin Gribbin and Gabriel Farren. It was the clubs first U U group, as part of a unofficial South Derry underage initiative. With clubs coaching for three weeks and playing a blitz on the fourth week. “We couldnt believe it, when all  of them turned up at the first session,” he said of a group that supplied seven players to the senior team beaten by Slaughtneil in last years championship. “By U, CKcame in to help. He had taken teams around Newbridge that boysdidnt want, hed step up. Noel McPeake and Sean McKenna came in too and helped.” After winning the U B league and championship, McGlone took a break before ing at minor level and asked for another step up in class. At the pre-season meeting he asked those in the room with two B medals to stand up. “About  percent stood up and when asked who has at least one , and the rest of them stood,” McGlone states. It was time to move up to the A grade. In their first game, they were away to Slaughtneil and unlucky not to beat a team who were U champions two years earlier. After losing heavily to Magherafelt in the Hughes McElwee Cup, the league game between them finished in a draw.  The  Newbridge U U  “If you win a Byou have to step up to A. We were not going to win anything. If we played somebody and there was  points in it and we played them a second day and there was two points in it, we are progressing.” McGlone expressed. He was looking further down the track. His sons are now playing on the senior team, he helped shape. In recent years, they picked up another intermediate title and are back in the top flight. Hopefully to stay. “Now we have a  again that,nurtured right, can dine at the top table again. Hopefully...I am one of the men that is going in around the dressing room in the next five or six years like the older boys did when we won.” Guttys fanaticism has never diluted, nor is it likely to.

I was the youngest man on our team and they were happy to leave me on their county man.” Having played in three county finals and losing two of them, McGlone – who has a memory for detail that matches his enthusiasm – always remembers the call for stewards to pick up their end of match positions. “Its one of the worst feelings you could have as a footballer when you are getting beat by two or three points,” he recalls. One year on from hearing it against Lavey in , they led Castledawson when the announcement bellowed out. He remembers dampening Eoin Gribbins joy at the thought of having their clutches on that elusive championship. “One goal and they are back in it,” McGlone warned him. “In the Lavey game, it seemed to last  seconds until the final whistle, but when it was called that year , we were ahead...it seemed like an eternity until the whistle.” Newbridge were not to be caught. They kept their promise from  months earlier and Damian Barton collected the John McLaughlin Cup after a -year gap, for their th and last title. From McGlones recollection, win lose or draw, Wilfie Garvin, Mick McKenna, Jim Gilmore, Seamus and Dermot Doherty, Owen and Willie Gribbin would always be in the Newbridge dressing room after games. They were part of the teams fabric. “I remember those boys being in the day we won it and I was never as glad to see it. Its one of the wee things I will always remember.” Later in the evening the team went for a meal at the ONeill Arms in Toome, before heading back to Newbridge Hall for the celebrations. McGlone wasnt a teetotaller, he enjoyed a drink like most of the others and it was curbed during the championship preparations. “I never touched drink the night we won the championship, not one pint,” Gutty said of his premeditated decision. “I wanted to savour the whole thing and not to be talking to the older men around the club and me maybe half tight.” The next two or three days were dferent. Between the Elk and the Thatch, it was party central. On the Monday night, the squad did a tour of Newbridge on the back of Mick McKennas lorry.   Derry champions Newbridge “Everyone was on the back of er,” Gutty laughs. “We went down to Toome to pick up Stephen McErlain and then did every road in Newbridge. You wouldve thought there were  cars behind us. For the next two or three days, I dont think we sobered.” They were at the top of Everest. But surprisingly, being one of the most consistent teams of the time, it was the only senior championship that crop won. In , they took the foot off the pedal and lost to Ballinascreen in the semi-final who were beaten by eventual All-Ireland champions Lavey. “In  Eugene Young came in to manage us and we got to the final. We missed two goals and theyscored two goals, that was the dference in us winning another one.” While picking up intermediate silverware in the interim, he recalls the disappointment of relegation in  after surviving for three or four seasons in play-offs. “To start your career with a championship medal in your pocket at  or , struggling and relegation was tough. To go from being top of the pile...from walking around behind bands, to relegation, it was tough.” McGlone picked up an intermediate medal in , but when the same title ed five years later, he had stepped away from the seniors, choosing to play with the reserves. Gutty was coaxed out back into the senior ranks by manager Gavin Devlin for an impact role at full-forward, using his guile to pull full-back lines of position. A dead leg suffered in , a niggle that never fully cleared up told McGlone it was time to pull the pin. In retirement, he was never going to step away from the game he loved. The buzz in his voice, with every word dancing, speaks volumes for his fanaticism for football. He stayed on as long as he could, with the club having little youth coming through. It was time to dig new foundations and survey the lie of the land in the local school. “There were big numbers from U down, so we decided wed start with the underage,” states Hugh, who had the help of Neil Young, Martin Gribbin and Gabriel Farren. It was the clubs first U U group, as part of a unofficial South Derry underage initiative. With clubs coaching for three weeks and playing a blitz on the fourth week. “We couldnt believe it, when all  of them turned up at the first session,” he said of a group that supplied seven players to the senior team beaten by Slaughtneil in last years championship. “By U, CKcame in to help. He had taken teams around Newbridge that boysdidnt want, hed step up. Noel McPeake and Sean McKenna came in too and helped.” After winning the U B league and championship, McGlone took a break before ing at minor level and asked for another step up in class. At the pre-season meeting he asked those in the room with two B medals to stand up. “About  percent stood up and when asked who has at least one , and the rest of them stood,” McGlone states. It was time to move up to the A grade. In their first game, they were away to Slaughtneil and unlucky not to beat a team who were U champions two years earlier. After losing heavily to Magherafelt in the Hughes McElwee Cup, the league game between them finished in a draw.  The  Newbridge U U  “If you win a Byou have to step up to A. We were not going to win anything. If we played somebody and there was  points in it and we played them a second day and there was two points in it, we are progressing.” McGlone expressed. He was looking further down the track. His sons are now playing on the senior team, he helped shape. In recent years, they picked up another intermediate title and are back in the top flight. Hopefully to stay. “Now we have a  again that,nurtured right, can dine at the top table again. Hopefully...I am one of the men that is going in around the dressing room in the next five or six years like the older boys did when we won.” Guttys fanaticism has never diluted, nor is it likely to. One of the games great characters.  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

GAA GOLD, a new archive based series from TG, looks back at the ’s through the prism of the GAA year.  Each programme focuses on one year and we travel through the GAA season with a mixture of all of the classic games, news stories and music hits from that year. The first programme of the series starts with the year and the programmecharts that year’s twists and turns on Gaelic fields throughout the land with league finals, provincial finals, All-Ireland semi-finals and All-Ireland finals. That year end ends with Joe Connolly’s emotional and evocative speech on the steps of the Hogan Stand with the cheeky line of “People of Galway, we love you! googletag.cmd.push In  All Ireland Football Final, there was Seacuteamus Darbys famous goal that shocked Kerry - and the nation - to end their five in-a-row hopes. In the Hurling Final the Cats claimed their nd All-Ireland title captained by a young man named Brian Cody. In  we will see Jimmy Barry-Murphy’s famous rocket goal against Galway in the All-Ireland semi-final. Michael O’Hehir on commentary said“This is one you need to see in slow motion but the slow motion won’t even slow it down!”.  In the Minor hurling final there is a young man named Niall Quinn playing for the Dubs against Galway. He scored a great point on the day and would go on to score  international goals for the Republic of Ireland soccer team. The Football Final that year saw  players sent off in the Dublin v Galway battle. googletag.cmd.push The series will include the  Ulster Football Final - Frank McGuigan was on fire for Tyrone that day and scored  points from play - each one better than the last as Tyrone claimed their first provincial title since  in Clones.  This was also the GAA’s centenary year with the All-Ireland Hurling Final held in Semple Stadium between Cork and Offaly. We hwill see the first ever International Rules tests between Ireland and Australia from that year with plenty of action on and off the ball. In  we have some action from the first ever Ladies Football Final to be played at Croke Park. The Kerry’s Ladies team went one better than the men as they claimed a‘five in-a-row’ with victory over Wexford. There are other more quirkier events in the GAA season too. In  a National Football League Quarter-final between Dublin and Cork ended in a draw. Cork failed to reappear for extra-time so Dublin ran the ball down unopposed and shot into an empty Cork net to claim a very unusual victory. All of these great memories can be seen in this new GAA GOLD series with the soundtrack of the era - a mix of both international and Irish acts such as U, Thin Lizzy, The Pogues, Mamas Boys, The Undertones, Cry Before Dawn, Sineacutead O’Connor, The Dubliners, The Hothouse Flowers, The Stunning and many more.

On the re-opening of walkways around GAA grounds, this was an opportunity to get people back out again socialising as a club community and using the club grounds with their Trip  Tipp initiative. The idea was to get as many families as possible out walking, running or crawling, each doing a  mile leg of the  mile journey in allocated, socially distanced, safe slots. googletag.cmd.push A pound contribution per family was requested, with all proceeds going to aid football and camogie youth restarting back training, with the expected rules and regulations that will surely be in place. The uptake was fantastic with  families taking partand more families looking to take part every day so they surpassed their  mile journey!. The club wish to place on record their thanks to all those that participated or helped out in any way preparing the grounds, sorting and fitting hand sanitizers, marking the walkways for one way social distance adherence, with special mention to Paul McIver who was the driving force behind this excellent initiative. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

When he came out of the changing room bearing a grey hoodie, with the rest of his team-mates in black and white, you wondered had he even got a jersey. But whatever he dreamt about on the night before, whatever he thought about over dinner, he wouldn’t have believed he would have scored an injury-time goal to win the trophy for his new club and win the man of the match award. googletag.cmd.push That’s exactly how it panned out. The sides level at - apiece, thirty seconds of injury-time played, and a long ball is spilled and flapped at by Ronan Tracey in the Foreglen goal. Poaching on the edge of the small square , as he did time and again in the green and gold jersey, it was a simple task for O’Kane to punch home the winning goal. Some ironies are just written in the stars. This one came in spite of every single ounce of effort Foreglen had to give. Kevin O’Connor was O’Kane’s partner in crime since the two were knee high. They tormented defences in Intermediate football for years. They fought shoulder to shoulder for the green and the gold. googletag.cmd.push O’Connor played like a man possessed. He played like a man who wanted to show the world he didn’t need a partner. The Foreglen forward took Rian Kealey, a superb player, to the cleaners. O’Connor ended up with five points and set up his side’s goal in a magnicent display. That goal, made by O’Connor and finished by James Brolly, looked as though it had swung the balance in the favour of the underdogs with just four minutes to go. Having been behind from the th minute of a rather stagnant first half, Foreglen had worked incredibly hard to stay in touch with the Magpies. A combination of wasteful finishing from Eugene Kelly’s menand superb defending from a young full-back line of Ruairi and Shane Duffy and Cathal O’Hara kept Damien O’Connor’s side in contention. This was no holds barred football. For the young Dungiven side, sprinkled with Kevin Farren, Kevin Johnston, Sean Murray and Donal McGilligan of last year’s minor team, this was probably the toughest game they’ve played, in a physical sense at least. For that, you have to give Foreglen great credit. Brothers John and Oisin Duffy were lost to their defence before the game, having set off travelling on Friday. They’re without Niall McFeely long term. To most teams with as small a pick, those absentees would be terminal against a side that contained six players that played in last year’s senior county final. But when have Foreglen ever laid down  Kevin O’Connor might have kicked the points, but the spadework was done by plenty other. Ciaran McFeely had an excellent game, the best he’s played in some while. He went after everything, especially in the second half. Darren O’Kane’s heart is bigger than his chest. There’s not much of him, but he ploughs into everything. He’s pretty much the Foreglen prototype. They felt the big decisions didn’t go their way. They may have had a point. Directly after Brolly’s goal, Martin Farrell latched on to a great ball from Darren O’Kane. He appeared to be fouled in front of goal but referee Joe Mulholland blew him for over-carrying. Ninety seconds after what turned out to be Darrell O’Kane’s winning goal, Kevin O’Connor was pushed in the chest inside the area as he collected the ball. The referee felt he went down too easily and played on. But for all the feeling of the world being against them, they were lucky to still be in the game at half-time. Having played with a fresh breeze, they were frustrated by constant stoppages over a stop-start  minutes. With  minutes of -a-side football played, the score was just - apiece. It hadn’t caught fire at all. But Dungiven were missing what chances were being made. They kicked ten wides in that half hour. Foreglen had just three points at the break, but just as importantly, they had conceded just five. What the fans were treated to in the second half was night and day from what they had got in the first. It became a rip-roaring game. It effectively became championship. The first seven minutes of the half were scoreless. The stage seemed set. James McNicholl got out well and fed the man coming off his shoulder. That man fired brilliantly past Ronan Tracey from twelve yards. That man had no fear of celebrating his goal. That man was, of course, Darrell O’Kane. Foreglen seemed to react to the identity of the scorer as much as the goal itself. They responded in the most positive manner. Martin Farrell , Ciaran McFeely, Kevin O’Connor and James Brolly hit points in six brilliant minutes to close the gap back to two. Dungiven’s only response in those six minutes came from O’Kane’s right foot. Kevin O’Connor was not letting it go without a fight. His storming run saw Rian Kealey pull him to the ground along the endline. He got up and sprinted out to the ’ and with Dungiven sleeping, took a quick free that left James Brolly with a relatively simple finish from  yards. That levelled it with just four minutes to play. But they couldn’t quite get the score they needed to nose themselves in front. They just didn’t have anything to hold on to. Substitute Fergal McGuigan kicked a  yard free wide and it seemed as though the gods, having rescued Kerry earlier in the day, had dressed themselves in green and gold. But it just had to be Darrell O’Kane’s day. Of all the men in all the world, it just had to be him.

John O’Neill, from Ballinderry, took to the roads around the village to document the lives of local parishioners during the Covid- lockdown. The project is still ongoing, but Fr Peter Donnelly from St Patrick’s Church in the parish, says the donation of pound, is very welcome. “It is very much appreciated by the entire Ballinderry family as this would be additional expenditure, which has become necessary,” he told the County Derry Post. “Because of the health emergency, we’ve had to seriously think about introducing a webcam, and all of these improvements are costly, and this money will go towards that. googletag.cmd.push “It was very generous of him with his time and photography expertise. It was a kind thought indeed and it was well supported.” The project grew momentum after a local man, Charlie Collins, presented John with a list of  people in the parish who were over . “I would touch base, or say I was calling in an area on a certain day and people would get in contact,” said John. “I arranged rough times that I would call so they were watching or had a family member keeping an eye out. “The older folk were asking about how they would buy a photo, so I did a flat rate and said % would go to Fr Donnelly down in Ballinderry chapel.” googletag.cmd.push One of Johns shots from the project. Pic: John ONeill - Sperrins Photography. Fr Donnelly said the thought of a photographer doing the rounds was enough to give the parish’s elderly parishioners a boost. “The older members found it enormously important and looked forward to getting prepared to have their photographs taken,” he said. “John managed to capture their dferent personalities very well. There are many ways of taking a photo but the artistry is in capturing the character of the person themselves. “I thought he got everyone’s personality very well. Rather than people feeling a bit self-conscious or formal, he was able to put them at ease. “It was a wonderful idea and it was very heartening to see it so well supported.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A number of complaints had been raised about the booking system put in place following the easement of coronavirus restrictions. Cllr Kathleen McGurk said some constituents had experienced dficulty when trying to make a same-day booking, but moves have since been made to improve the service. “I asked the Environmental Services Director to improve the current system to ensure there are less issues when trying to book a slot including provision same day booking,” said Cllr McGurk. “I very much welcome the improvements that the council team have now implemented and praise should be given to the quick response to the complaints. googletag.cmd.push “The new online booking systems which is being rolled out should streamline the service for all users.” The online system, which will facilitate same-day booking, will be trialled at sites in Coleraine and Limavady this week, with the council hoping to roll it out to all sites within a fortnight. The number of slots has also been increased to allow for four vehicles every ten minutes, with a view to increasing it to six vehicles this week. In the meantime, the council has increased the number of operators taking bookings to seven at centres that do not yet have the online booking system in place. googletag.cmd.push “I appreciate there have been frustrations caused by the booking system and some have called for its removal entirely,” said Cllr McGurk “However it is essential that we maintain it for the meantime to avoid the long queues and congestion seen in other Council areas. “It is also worth noting that since the introduction of the booking system, most council recycling centres are working to full capacity with slots being entirely filled for the following day. “If this wasn’t managed correctly it would lead to peak usage times which would have the potential to overwhelm staff at the centres and cause traffic issues. “Whilst this may not have been as likely a scenario in smaller recycling centres, it was important that the same approach was taken to all centres across the council area.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

These exclusive photographs show the special screens which have been erected at Tinneys Bar in Derry. All other pubs are expected to install similar screens between staff and customers as the hospitality sector reopens following the coronavirus lockdown.  A local blinds shop has been assisting Derry bars and businesses as they prepare to reopen safely. Ace Blinds have been operating in the Derry area, serving the community for over five years and employing local people. As businesses adjust to the so-called new normal after lockdown, they have to enforce social distancing and come up with innovative ways to protect their customers. googletag.cmd.push Therefore, Ace Blinds has fitted ‘COVID- roller shields’ in local bars and the orders have been mounting from other businesses in the city. “It has gone a bit crazy at the minute and we have already taken  orders for bars,” says John Kelly of Ace Blinds. It is new territory for Ace Blinds in terms of the material they are using. “The plastic material suits bars great as they can be moved up and down very easily, not like perspex, and they are a lot easier on the eye for customers, so more friendly. They can be attached to suspension ceilings with a special clip so no drillingneeds be. googletag.cmd.push “The material is easily cleaned, you just hold the bottom bar and wipe clean and it can be secured to bars or the groundneeded.” The company has fitted the bathroom at EI Engineering to separate sinks which provides an extra layer of protection for workers. Other businesses in the town have come to them with dferent proposals which they’re working through together. This week, the Economy Minister Dianne Dodds announced that all non-essential goods retailers in Northern Ireland can re-open from tomorrow. Pubs and restaurants are expected to follow suit in July. Confirming the ‘major step forward’, the Minister said: “The pandemic has had a devastating impact on the local economy. The recovery has already begun and it is time now for the pace to accelerate. The re-opening of all goods retail outlets will be a huge part of this. “The safety of staff and customers is of course paramount. All retailers must be able to implement measures that minimise the risk to their staff and to the people who visit their stores. “We will be co-existing with this virus for some time to come so it is vital that we continue to adhere to guidance to work and live safely.” The Minister added: “The re-opening of our local shopping sector is a signicant step forward in the Executive’s pathway to recovery. I and my Executive colleagues remain committed to moving forward in the recovery while at all times keeping the health, wellbeing and safety of people at the centre and being transparent in our approach.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Former Director of Anti-Slavery International Aidan McQuade has called for the statue to be taken down the street renamed, due to Mitchels support for slavery. “Theyshould have a proper look at who Mitchel was and the things that he said,” McQuade stated in an interview with Newstalk. “Do you want to be honouring that guy with the name that you have ” googletag.cmd.push Glenullin didnt indicateany approach had been made to have clubs name changed, but issued the following statement to the County Derry Post. “The appropriateness or otherwise of the names which were adopted by founding members of our GAA clubs is nothing new. “Any GAA led discussion around the naming or renaming of our clubs, pitches or competitions is welcome, and Glenullin would gladly be a part of any national discussion.” John Mitchels GAC Claudy did confirmed that no approach was made to their club on the subject.

Shaking up the Derry senior championship isnt an exact science. However, after the recent figuresindicatingthe lack of players not coming through to senior inter-county level, I thought I would get a pen and copious amounts of paper out, to devise a isional element to the countys golden goose – the race for the John McLaughlin Cup. I have often penned on these pages how dficult a job the CCC have and especially in a dual county. Now I am going to rip up the championship and start afresh. This week, the format of any championship that will take place this year will be up for debate. The group stages are going to be pondered over to get club players more games. googletag.cmd.push My study is one for the  season and on the basis that this year never happened. All the facts and figures come from last season and the years before. I remember trying to chat with an Austin Stacks’supporter one night in Portlaoises Maldron Hotel about the ins and outs of the Kerry championship. At the end of the day,the standard of football is to improve, then we need to get more of it. It was the wee small hours of the night, Slaughtneils clash with Kieran Donaghys side was getting closer. It wasnt the few pints we were hovering over that caused the confusion, it was just a dficult thing to decipher. googletag.cmd.push For Derrys version, I am stripping away any connection between league and championship. Thats the first point, in the hope that over the next decade, theleague can continue regardless of county games. At the end of the day,the standard of football is to improve, then we need to get more of it. PLAN A For Plan A, I am basing the Derry SFC on having  senior club teams and three isional teams. For the  senior clubs I have selected on the basis of looking back at the last five years of the championship. Slaughtneil, Coleraine and Magherafelt are in there, as previous winners. Add in Loup, Ballinascreen, Glen and Lavey as teams who have contested finals. Bellaghy, Ballinderry, Greenlough and Banagher make the cut, having reached at least a semi-final. To get the tally up to , I have tapped into the  league placings. Swatragh, in third place, make the cut and the next highest ranked team, in thplace, is Dungiven. The rest of the clubs will ply their trade in the intermediate and junior championships. This is where things change. A few people told me I was crazy to start delving into this, but so is standing still and not exploring. But sure, without the draw of any live action, its an interesting delve. The natural break in the three isional teams would be north and south Derry and the city. On the face of it, this wont work. The city teams just wouldnt be strong enough, so I have renamed it as Foyle and drafted in Claudy, Slaughtmanus and Faughanvale. Players from these clubs would be key players on St Columbs Derry teams and itwould leave the following selection. FOYLE OAKS : Ardmore, Doire Colmcille, Doire Trasna, Sean Dolans, Steelstown, Faughanvale, Claudy and Slaughtmanus. That would leave North Derry with nine to pick from, including  senior champions Glenullin and Foreglen, the most consistent intermediate side of the last decade, to form the backbone. Add in the likes of Lee Moore, Gary Keane, Tiarnan Woods and goalkeeper Oran Hartin. NORTH DERRY : Ballerin, Craigbane, Drum, Drumsurn, Foreglen, Glack, Glenullin, Limavady, and Magilligan. So that takes us down past the Ponderosa and over that imaginary boundary between north and southDerry. Kilrea and Newbridge will form the basis for the South Derry team. The Pearses have been in the senior final in the last decade, with Newbridge having laid a foundation of youth for the future. Goalkeeper Aaron Cassidy of Ballymaguigan would be a serious addition. The Keenans in Castledawson, Patrick Feeney and Emmet Crozier from Moneymore, not forgetting Eunan McElhennon and Iarlaith Donaghy. SOUTH DERRY : Ballymaguigan, Castledawson, Desertmartin, Kilrea, Lissan, Moneymore and Newbridge. There we go. Easy wasnt it. On to the small print. The intermediate winners are promoted to the senior championship for the following year. For relegation, the eight teams that dont make the senior quarter-final, their championship form from the last five years is taken into consideration. Wins, draws and score dference all collated. The two lowest performing teams go into a play-off, with the loser getting the chop. Since the isional teams wont have any championship history, they will be exempt from relegation for five years to see how it beds in. At that point, the fuller evaluation of the project will have taken place. The dficult situation will be fitting it all in. So senior games would be played on dferent weekends. And with dual players needing to be fitted in, Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Paddy Henry, Johnny ODwyer and the likes. With the club leagues being detached, they can start earlier and with moreclubswithout county players as it wont affect their championship stance. What happens South Derry beat Coleraine in the  county final. They wont be able to go into Ulster, so in that case the league winners would advance. Or maybe, the winners of the Larkin and Kerlin Cups play off in a decider as a plan B to pick an alternative county champion. PLAN B While I was at it. I picked a much more radical plan B, that would see eight senior teams and eight isional teams, like inKerry. Just to prove I was listening that night in the Maldron. Fromchampionship form, the senior teams would be: Slaughtneil, Coleraine, Ballinderry, Loup, Ballinascreen, Glen, Lavey and Magherafelt. And, from looking at the  league pairings, intermediate and junior would be as follows. INTERMEDIATE : Bellaghy, Dungiven, Banagher, Greenlough, Swatragh, Claudy, Newbridge, Kilrea, Foreglen, Drumsurn, Faughanvale, Steelstown, Glenullin, Castledawson, Ballymaguigan and Limavady. JUNIOR : Slaughtmanus, Lissan, Doire Trasna, Ballerin, Desertmartin, Glack, Craigbane, Magilligan, Drum, Sean Dolans, Doire Colmcille, Moneymore and Ardmore. Jumping clean off the page is the likes of Bellaghy,  times senior winnersand Swatragh, third in the league last year, playing at intermediate level. The sticking point would be the loss of senior status by some clubs,whowould find it very hard to get promoted back to senior level. Relegation, promotion and qualication for Ulster would follow the same pattern and have the same obstacles as plan A. Its hard to see this one ever getting the time of day, but sure it gives the Sideline Views version of the CCC something to compare. Both are dferent, both will be hard to sell, but wouldnt it be great to get some proper dialogue on something to widenthe base of players for a strategic plan at inter-county level. NEXT WEEK: We will reveal the ious team selections from Sideline Views preferred Plan A option and how a possible championship draw could pan out. RELATED - Spreading the net wider. More...

Tucked off the Halfgain road, it is one of Slaughtneils greatest gems. Glenn, who coaches fitness in the wild outdoors with his company Wild Le, was due to celebrate his rd birthday by competing in a half triathlon, before it was cancelled due to the sporting lockdown. “I always try to do something challenging on or around my birthday. I guess it makes me feel alive as my inevitable demise looms ever closer,” Glenn said. It was time to put his creative mind to work and invent a new challenge, something on his doorstep. googletag.cmd.push “I love kettlebells and live in the middle of a nature reserve with loads of footpaths so it meant I could do the challenge without having to travel,” he points out. He has a background in combat sports, primarily Filipino Stick Fighting, is a big lover of tree climbing, cold water wild swimming. “A fellow stick fighter and kettlebell instructor, Dave Hedges, from Dublin completed a mile of swings a few years ago and sowed the seed to do it here.” As part of his challenge he aimed to raise money for local mental health charity, STEPS. After targetting pound as a total, he smashed it and currently has pound, in his Justgiving account. googletag.cmd.push “As someone who has and still does suffer from, at times acute anxiety, raising money for mental health support is a no-brainer,” he explains. “Suicide is the single biggest killer in men under the age of  and the daily number of deaths is going up for both men and women. In Northern Ireland the suicide rate is about double that of England, with almost  percent of our community suffering from mental health issues.” “We are all affected by mental health issues, either directly or indirectly, and its time for it to stop being a taboo subject.” A back injury curtailed Glenns early preparations and he switched rehab mode. His days comprised a series of flexibility routines. “The human body is remarkable at healing and movement is medicine. After a couple of weeks I felt I was good to go, so started doing kettlebell swings daily, building up in volume and then moving onto to the walking swing whereby i take a step forward at the top of each swing.” With over , swings during his iron mile, technique was everything. There was the small matter of managing his hands, such was the wear and tear from the kettlebell. “The kettlebell is constantly moving inside your grip so any hard skin or calluses there tend to rip off,” Glenn outlines. “So I had a weekly routine of filing, shaving and moisturising my hands. They are more rubbery that leathery. “I used a kg kettlebell. This would be fairly light for my average workout but after , swings it felt anything but light. If I do it again i may go up to a kg. The heat was the biggest issue. Within five minutes of his scheduled .am start, he was dripping with sweat. “I was wishing we started two hours earlier, sweat in the eyes and on the palms is less than ideal.” With about  metres to go, Glenn could feel blisters popping on his fingers, but the finish line was in sight. One year older, another challenge met and money raised for a worthwhile cause.

Tucked off the Halfgain road, it is one of Slaughtneils greatest gems. Glenn, who coaches fitness in the wild outdoors with his company Wild Le, was due to celebrate his rd birthday by competing in a half triathlon, before it was cancelled due to the sporting lockdown. “I always try to do something challenging on or around my birthday. I guess it makes me feel alive as my inevitable demise looms ever closer,” Glenn said. It was time to put his creative mind to work and invent a new challenge, something on his doorstep. googletag.cmd.push “I love kettlebells and live in the middle of a nature reserve with loads of footpaths so it meant I could do the challenge without having to travel,” he points out. He has a background in combat sports, primarily Filipino Stick Fighting, is a big lover of tree climbing, cold water wild swimming. “A fellow stick fighter and kettlebell instructor, Dave Hedges, from Dublin completed a mile of swings a few years ago and sowed the seed to do it here.” As part of his challenge he aimed to raise money for local mental health charity, STEPS. After targetting pound as a total, he smashed it and currently has pound, in his Justgiving account. googletag.cmd.push “As someone who has and still does suffer from, at times acute anxiety, raising money for mental health support is a no-brainer,” he explains. “Suicide is the single biggest killer in men under the age of  and the daily number of deaths is going up for both men and women. In Northern Ireland the suicide rate is about double that of England, with almost  percent of our community suffering from mental health issues.” “We are all affected by mental health issues, either directly or indirectly, and its time for it to stop being a taboo subject.” A back injury curtailed Glenns early preparations and he switched rehab mode. His days comprised a series of flexibility routines. “The human body is remarkable at healing and movement is medicine. After a couple of weeks I felt I was good to go, so started doing kettlebell swings daily, building up in volume and then moving onto to the walking swing whereby i take a step forward at the top of each swing.” With over , swings during his iron mile, technique was everything. There was the small matter of managing his hands, such was the wear and tear from the kettlebell. “The kettlebell is constantly moving inside your grip so any hard skin or calluses there tend to rip off,” Glenn outlines. “So I had a weekly routine of filing, shaving and moisturising my hands. They are more rubbery that leathery. “I used a kg kettlebell. This would be fairly light for my average workout but after , swings it felt anything but light. If I do it again i may go up to a kg. The heat was the biggest issue. Within five minutes of his scheduled .am start, he was dripping with sweat. “I was wishing we started two hours earlier, sweat in the eyes and on the palms is less than ideal.” With about  metres to go, Glenn could feel blisters popping on his fingers, but the finish line was in sight. One year older, another challenge met and money raised for a worthwhile cause.

There was substantial damage done to the crop.The farmer continued: ldquoI also had a man who was purposely letting his dog into a field to go to the toilet every morning. This field is used to cut silage for the animals to eat in winter. What these people donrsquot understand is that dog faeces is potentially harmful to cattle.ldquoI appreciate that people like to go for a walk and it is unprecedented times where people are more cautious about meeting people on the roads, but they canrsquot use farmland as recreational ground.ldquoThat is a farmerrsquos work space and every blade of grass is used in farming, eventhere areno cows in the field that they are walking in. The ground is being used for something, be it winter fodder or rotational grazing.ldquoThere are cows calving in my fields and what I am more worried about is that someone is going to get hurt. Cows are extremely volatile around calving season and they will attackthey think their young are in danger.ldquoThe most dangerous animal on a farm is not a bull, itrsquos a newly calved cow. They can and will kill. People think that cows are docile but they can kill.The farmer added: ldquoI am having to look into getting professional CCTV equipment put in place over the land, an expense I could really do without.Mr McGrath said people walking through gated fields, leaving the gates lying open and allowing the livestock to get out placed an ldquounnecessary burden on farmers.ldquoWith some Covid- restrictions being eased itrsquos great to see that people are able to get out and about a bit more whether that be for walking their dogs, going for a longer walk or run or just getting out and about. We need to make full use of our wonderful natural surroundings for our own health and for our own emotional and psychological wellbeing.ldquoHowever, there are issues creeping in regarding walkers and runners using gated fields and pieces of farmland as access points whether for a shortcut or just because they feel they can do this.He continued: ldquoWhen I was growing up in Downpatrick you didnrsquot dare trespass on the land. There was enough respect for the farmer and the great contribution they make to our local communities and as a child probably a healthy level of fear as well.ldquoI want our communities to respect our farmers and to appreciate that they give to the community so much more than they get back.ldquoSoyoursquore out and about and enjoying your walks or runs, please stick to the public roads and public rights of way..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"A walk in the pairc  ","story":"LOCAL GAA clubs are gearing up for ato action.After a three-month lockdown caused by the Covid- pandemic, clubs can look forward to a resumption of gaelic games.Thatrsquos good news for players and spectators, who have been starved of action.The clubs were able to unlock their gates for the first time this week.From Monday they were allowed to open their grounds for small groups of people to use walkways.Non-contact training for club teams will begin on June , initially in groups of no more than ten players with two coaches.Full-contact training can take place from July , with underage games commencing on the same date.

The industry directly employs , people, with thousands more supported in work through the supply chain.The impact of the virus on the sector could be devastating, Baroness Ritchie told peers during a debate on measures needed to repair the UK economy.ldquoProjections indicate that this level of employment could be reduced by  per cent, she said. ldquoThere has been no spend in the tourism industry since March  and it will be late July before tourism outlets open.ldquoMany of those people who will find themselves out of work will have to rely on the benefit system which is already under extreme pressure. It is punitive and needs to be overhauled with the needs of people put at the centre of the debate.She continued: ldquoTo encourage visitors to come to our region to spend money and to invest in our economy, we need to protect our people.ldquoThat means we must ensure our shops are allowed to open subject to social distancing rules and the British Government needs to abolish air passenger duty and reduce VAT on tourism.ldquoThat would assist our hospitality industry and those employed in it as well as the many people who depend on it for their basic source of income. These fiscal measures could indirectly make contributions to reducing inequalities in our society and community. Baroness Ritchie said the furloughing of many staff within the hospitality sector was currently concealing the true extent of the job losses that would follow when the scheme was ended.She also said the pandemic had revealed the ldquodeep levels of poverty and inequalities that are entrenched within many communities.She went on: ldquoThere have been greater levels of dependence on food banks for essential food provisions.

the reinstatement of services at the Downe Hospital.Baroness Margaret Ritchie and Alliance councillor Patrick Brown are both demanding the full restoration of services which were removed at the height of the Covid- pandemic.Baroness Ritchie says she has pressed health chiefs on the issue, but to date has not been given a timeline by the South Eastern Trust.ldquoIt is important that the work on the reinstatement of services and staff continues and that the timeline for doing so is published so that the public is fully aware of all the circumstances, she said.ldquoUndoubtedly, all the staff in the Downe Hospital, including medical, nursing and ancillary, have worked with very dficult challenges over the last few months and they deserve our support, solidarity and congratulations.Baroness Ritchie said she had been told equipment will be ed to the Downe and that the Trust was progressing plans for the rebuilding of non-Covid health and social care services.She said she had pressed senior management on the provision of endoscopy services at the Downe and was informed that the service recommenced in the day procedure unit on June .She said  patients were examined during the first session and that the Trust currently had  patients on their lsquored flag escalation listrsquo for endoscopy services.She said priority was being given to those with higher risk of cancer at this stage. ldquoThese patients are getting access to urgent endoscopy usually within the three-week target, she remarked.She added: ldquoIn response to my query about the scoping work for additional services to be provided at the Downe Hospital, the Trust has informed me that planning for the provision of services to be delivered from the day procedure Unit at the Downe Hospital is part of the overall work the Trust is progressing in relation to the rebuilding of non-Covid  health and social services.ldquoIt is also anticipated that other day case surgical work will recommence shortly

what he said were ldquomuch-needed services for the local community.He claimed privatising healthcare put limits on those who could receive treatment.ldquoOur constituents should have access to high quality local services, he said.ldquoWhilst the dficult and unprecedented circumstances caused by the Covid- pandemic have undoubtedly added a strain on hospital resources, the decision to involve a private contractor for endoscopy treatments should be swtly reconsidered.ldquoInstead, efforts should be made to find a cohesive solution with current medical staff and relevant unions, in order to safeguard our local services.He continued: ldquoThe decision to close the AE Department in Downe Hospital was taken to reallocate resources and staff to other hospitals to help fight Covid-,

of emergency medical care prior to the pandemic, with an AE Department that only operated for  hours of the day.Cllr Brown said a global health crisis should not be used as an excuse to remove or rationalise health services.He remarked: ldquoDowne Hospital is a vital local employer and necessary for the health and wellbeing of residents across the District.ldquoLocal rural constituents should

Nowadays umpires would have said try tomorrow.The decider itself proved to be a turgid, low-key affair, with little atmosphere and a contest which matched the gloomy conditions.ldquoIt just felt like a midweek league game, said Paul Linehan. ldquoPeople were at work, there was no crowd to speak of, it was cold and it wasnrsquot much of a game.ldquoNorth Down batted first, we bowled and fielded brilliantly, and they scraped to just . Karl Quinn and man of the match Philip Lennon each took three wickets, Jim Patterson got two, while Brian Hodges and Brian Ferris got one apiece.ldquoWe opened with Keith Malone and Derek McCann and I was due to come in three.

Keith was going well and I just needed to stay in.ldquoAnyway, desperate to get off the mark, I predicted Robin Haire was going to bowl me a long hop.

It is hard to believe that it has taken  years to get to the stage we are at now at, but the sight of new homes going up is welcome, he continued.ldquoWhile the regeneration of this part of Downpatrick is vital, so is the impact the new homes project will have on addressing a critical shortage of social housing. Many of those in need of a new home are in the urgent need category and the sooner tenants can start to move in, the better.Cllr Curran explained that those in the urgent need category are the priority as far as housing providers are concerned.He also hopes that given the progress that is being made at the former hospital site that families may be able to move in before December.The councillor said the new social housing project will benefit the wider community by providing construction jobs and boosting buildersrsquo suppliers and hopes that those on the waiting list for homes in the town will be offered the new properties.He added: ldquoThis eagerly-awaited scheme is ridding Downpatrick of a derelict site which will be transformed to deliver modern homes in an area of high demand.Local SDLP MLA Colin McGrath also welcomed the plannersrsquo approval.He said: ldquoThe housing development at the old Downe site has been a protracted and drawn out process.ldquoHaving been in regular contact with Clanmil to see what were the outstanding issues holding this development back to hear that council planners are to approve the next stage of the development at long last is very

initiative aimed at revitalising Ardglass harbour are expected to be published before the end of the month.Stormont fisheries minister Edwin Poots is due to unveil the first stage of a report from the Fishing and Seafood Development programme whichwill include a timeline for work that needs to be done at Ardglass and the other Co Down ports of Kilkeel and Portavogie.Earlier this year, Mr Poots met with South Down MLA Colin McGrath and local councillor Dermot Curran to discuss the future of the village port.They highlighted the importance of the Ardglass fishing industry to the district and wider South Down economy and outlined planned improvement work at the harbour, including deepening it to facilitate larger herring and mackerel vessels.Mr McGrath and Cllr Curran emphasised the need for additional investment in the harbour and its infrastructure, insisting that the port receives its fair share of funding to help enhance the existing fleet.They said that the harbour was ldquostrategically important for the Co Down fleet, highlighting its crucial role in driving the South Down economy and its location as a central hub for processing fish landed in Ardglass.The politicians said additional investment is critical to allow Ardglass harbour to expand with appropriate slipways provided for larger vessels to dock safely.Several weeks after the meeting with Mr Poots it was revealed that ambitious plans to redevelop Ardglass harbour could cost in the region of poundm.The figure is contained in a detailed consultants report commissioned to undertake an in-depth feasibility study to look at potential developments for the harbour which is home to Northern Irelandrsquos third largest fishing fleet.The key issue the consultants focused on was deepening the harbour to facilitate larger vessels, with work also undertaken to look at improving harbour conditions, berthing pontoons for smaller vessels and increased berthing facilities.In addition, the study included a comprehensive review of possible harbour layouts, historic document research, topographic and bathymetric harbour surveys, quay wall inspection above and below the waterline and computer modelling.The consultants also liaised with the Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairswhich has been given a copy of the consultants report ahead of further discussions with its officials on the way forward.Ardglass has the only all-weather harbour between Howth and Bangor and has three primary areas including the so-called fish dock within the south pier.Last August, ious concept layouts produced by consultants were reviewed by members of the Ardglass Harbour Developments group which has been set up to oversee the regeneration of the port. The concepts were subsequently amended in November.The prime focus is on deepening the harbour and moving forward, a cost effective approach may be to zone dredge levels in particular areas.Cllr Curran, who is keen to hear what Mr Poots has to say in a few weeksrsquo time, said there were plans to deepen the outer harbour by nine metres and the area adjacent to Cochranersquos building at the inner harbour by two metres to facilitate crab vessels.He confirmed that consideration is also being given to creating a pontoon with finger berths adjacent to the quay wall in front of Cochranersquos with gangway access for crab vessels. No leisure craft would be permitted at this part of the harbour.ldquoNew investment in Ardglass harbour can help sustain existing jobs and create new employment opportunities, said Cllr Curran. ldquoThe port plays a ket part in the local economy and is at the heart of village le.ldquoArdglass lands some of the largest quantities of prawns in Ireland and deepening the harbour will mean that larger fishing vessels that currently dock where, will be able to access local facilities.Cllr Curran also fears that not deepening the harbour could potentially lead to an economic collapse for the Ardglass fishing industry.He added: ldquoI look forward to hear what the fisheries minister has to say towards the end of the month and hope that it will be positively good news for Ardglass..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Roadworks causing delays in town centre  ","story":"A DOWNPATRICK businesswoman has called on Phoenix Gas to complete pipe laying work in St Patrickrsquos Avenue by next Monday mdash as promised.The company is investing poundm investment across East Down and to date has laid over  miles of natural gas pipeline, with contractors also currently working in Newcastle.Phoenix officials have been working with the Department for Infrastructure to identy areas where pipe-laying could be brought forward to avoid further disruption to traders, visitors and residents, with work in Downpatrick starting several weeks ago.A mains pipeline has already been laid in a number of areas in the town, with contractors recently completing work in the Edward Street area.

We are actively reviewing the wider situation on indoor meetings with family and friends and will provide an update on that next week.ldquoIrsquom pleased that we have also agreed today to open up the housing market and permit house moves. This is particularly good news for those who have been living in unsuitable accommodation and families in temporary accommodation who will now be able to move into social homes that are waiting for them.ldquoThe issue of childcare is crucial in our recovery journey and our decision to permit the opening of church facilities and community halls for day care is an important step in addressing this key issue.ldquoI believe that the relaxations we are announcing today are a balance between the welfare, social, and emotional needs of our people, as well progress towards opening up our economy.Health Minister Robin Swann said: ldquoThe Coronavirus emergency has been the biggest test of our whole society in many years. In dealing with the immediate threat to public health, we had no choice but to impose restrictions that were not only dficult to live with, but were in themselves damaging to our wider economic, societal and personal wellbeing.ldquoThe Executive committed to keeping these restrictions under review and agreed that we would not keep restrictions in place longer than we need to. Today, based on the scientic evidence and medical advice on the prevalence of infection and the course of the epidemic, we have agreed to make some signicant relaxations to the restrictions that remain in place.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Catching up will take a huge effort. Where are the resources for this Reading scores for example affect exam results and from there access to higher education and employment.This is serious.I can only imagine the stress and angst some parents are feeling as they struggle with home teaching.As the paper reported it is the disadvantaged who are becoming more disadvantaged. Does anyone seriously believe that children who can’t or won’t work at home at the best of times are doing so now  Many children will be falling further behind.Why aren’t we talking about how to get our children back at school  Naturally parents, children and staff are fearful of ato school, so let’s look at what the science and the scientists say. Either it is safe to go to school or it isn’t.According to the Depart ment Health Northern Ireland Dashboard one person under  has died in NI and not one under  and % of the deaths have been of people over , and the Office of National Statistics reports thatyou are under  you have a one in a million chance of dying ProfessorKarol Sikora, who holds a double first from Cambridge and wasformerly Director of Cancer services at the World Health Organisationsaid with regard to primary school and nurseries “opening schools is absolutely vital” ...“the people who are suffering most are the most disadvantaged” and “the evidence that young children spread this is almost zero”. He goes onto say ,”why wait until September ” The Chief Scientic Officer of the WHO mirrors his views.Prof John Lee, Professor of Clinical Pathology at Hull, sums it up thus “The majority of cases are asymptomatic. The most common symptoms are not fever, cough, headache and respiratory symptoms they are no symptoms at all. Somewhere around . per cent of those who catch the disease recover.”The re-opening of schools in a phased and conditional way places immense stress on principals  School Management Teamswho will have to reassure children, parents and staff whilst at the same time organising staff rotas, part class rotas, year group rotas, curriculum arrangements — say  subjects, staffing, desks ,movements, toilets, canteens, ,break times and so on and in many cases teach. In a post primary school with  in a year group – so  classes – which, with phasing, would mean with, each class ided into ,  sub groups— the school has five year groups then that is  sub groups to rotate across eg  subjects with probably a rotated staff.Similarly in a primary school, complicated by the principal with a substantial teaching commitment.How do you do it, how do you ensure continuity of education The ‘safety measures’ — masks, screens, Personal Protection Equipmentetc give the illusion of safety whilst increasing fear and anxiety and this will hugely increasethechildren do notto school soon. I see groups of children playing and associating naturally – sothey go into school and have to stay two metres apart,how absurd is that  .Mental health issues are on the increase in schools as it is — there aren’t enough resources at the moment, there is a crisis looming when the children–we continue to fill them with fear. Principals are faced with one particularly dficult dilemma. Given that the government is not putting in any extra money, the principal can phasechildren in say one day a week and they miss out on their complete education, GCSE preparation etc orthey can bring in lots of subs and run the budget into chaos, for which they willbe heavily criticised.The obstacles are insurmountable.Our children need educated in an environment conducive to learning, not one filled with fear and anxiety. Feedback from the teacher and social interaction is what makes learning happen, why the need for complicated and impractical phasing  It is either safe or it isn’t.Michael Fullan, the esteemed educationalist said, “scratch a good teacher and you will find a moral purpose” and now is surely the time to demonstrate our moral purpose as public servants.

The public spats have become sparse and there is a strategic effort by Mrs Foster and Ms O’Neill to present a united – even a cheerful – front.As part of the new strategy, two weeks ago the first and deputy first ministers did a rare joint interview with Sky News, and this week they allowed the Press Association behind the scenes access at Parliament Buildings, with the photos showing two relaxed leaders smiling and appearing to work comfortably with each other’s advisers. Ms O’Neill told PA: “We had a tetchy start no doubt, things were more strained at the start, but we have had to work our way through our problems”Mrs Foster similarly downplayed the infighting, saying: “People like to talk about the little bit of turbulence at the beginning of the Covid piece around schools, but I think we’ve managed our way through that.”Could it be that the renaissance promised in January has now come six months late, forged amid the grim task of dealing with le and death decisions One of the reasons why it is still impossible to fully answer that questionis also the reason to believethis might not be the radical sht that it might at first appear.That reason is Stormont’s enduring secrecy. It was secrecy which allowed improper behaviour to thrive in the old Stormont – enabling everything from Mrs Foster’s spad Andrew Crawford to pass to his relatives confidential documents saying that cash for ash was ending to Sinn Féin circumventing the law to operate a hidden parallel system of government in which the real decision-makers were unseen and therefore unaccountable.The real test of whether things have changed for the better will not be smiling bonhomie between the first and deputy first minister – because we have been there before.After three years where there wasenmity between the DUP and Sinn Féin, it is easy to forget that just weeks before Stormontfell there were smiling joint photo opportunities, a joint article in which the first and deputy first ministers vowed not to walk away, and even a joint spokesman for their joint message.Similarly, their predecessors – Peter Robinson and Martin McGuinness – had, in between their own spats, struck up what ultimately appeared to be a genuine rapport.Yet we now know that it was in this period, while Stormont’s drivers were smilingand agreeing to drive in the same direction, that the administration was careering downhill.As some commentators marvelled at the chemistry between Stormont’s leaders, behind the scenes the behaviours later exposed by RHI were becoming more pronounced and more embedded while a weak civil service acquiesced in rule-breaking.Therefore, recent history shows that the DUP and Sinn Féin attacking each other at election time and then working closely together in government, while it might not be easy, is something which these profoundly pragmatic parties, who have jettisoned much of their past ideology to get to where they now are, learned to do a long time ago. Yet self-evidently that was not in itself the solution to Stormont’s problems.The real test of whether there has been reform will be whether our rulers change their ways – particularly around transparency– and whether they back tough new reforms which would prevent them ing to wallow in past practices.On that front, the evidence suggests far less change than the new PR strategy would imply.In recent weeks the DUP and Sinn Féin leaderships – despite internal DUP opposition – have come out against Jim Allister’s punitary bill which would make it possible for civil servants, spads and ministers to go to jailthey repeat some of the behaviour of the RHI scandal, particularly around hiding government communication on private email accounts, or by leaking sensitive commercial information.Meanwhile, several weeks ago the Assembly committee which scrutinises Sinn Fein Finance Minister Conor Murphy’s department asked him for all emails relating to his failed order for personal protection equipment via Dublin. Mr Murphy handed over a tranche of emails, but it was only sharp-eyed MLAs who spotted that there were two dates on which no emails had been disclosed.When they went back to his department, they were told that the emails were “not relevant” to the committee’s request.Then the department changed course, claiming that the emails were commercially sensitive, prompting Paul Frew – not some hardline opponent of this executive, but a DUP MLA – to last week tell the assembly: “I have grave concerns about the transparency of these departments, the secrecy in which they still conduct business and the way that they treat scrutiny committees with disdain”.Last week the News Letter revealed documentary evidence that DUP chief executive Timothy Johnston, while working as a spad in past Executives, had also simultaneously been running swathes of the DUP while taxpayers paid him £, a year to be a temporary civil servant.When Stormont Castle and the Sinn Féin-run Department of Finance were asked about recouping some of his salary, both said they would not be attempting to do so, nor even investigating the issue.Each of those examples would sit comfortably with past executives.In November , in his valedictory speech to the DUP conference, Peter Robinson used rhetoric which would not be out of place in the words of Mrs Foster or Ms O’Neill today. He said that Northern Ireland was “leading the way in public sector reform”, that there was “a political process that was stable and secure”, that“there can be a fresh start on solid foundations”, and added optimistically: “We have resolved all those toxic issues that threatened the continuation of devolution”.We now know that was just weeks after RHI had been running out of control and just over a year before the entire Stormont edice would implode under its own contradictions.While journalists should be sceptical, we should not be cynical — not only out of fairness to those on whom we report, but becausewe believenothing everchanges, then when change does come we will miss it. It may be that there have been seismic shts at the top of the executive and a recognition that the old ways were self-destructive.Butthere has been real, as opposed to cosmetic, change, the DUP and Sinn Féin are doing their best to hide it.—— ——A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

I must also say I have a degree of sympathy for the police in terms of them trying to enforce legislation that is not particularly clear or consistent.”Councillor Martin Reilly, SDLP group leader, when also asked plainlyhe condemns the police, said: “I’m not going to answer something without first of all having spoken to the party press office.”The News Letter had in fact already spoken to the press office on Thursday a press officer said they would speak to Colum Eastwood, but no response was ever forthcoming.Meanwhile the News Letter can also reveal the Charity Commission is now considering looking into NWMF.The commission’s guidance says trustees must make sure their charity acts in accordance with the law, including health and safety law.The commission said: “I can confirm that the matter has been referred to our enquiries team to consider further.”Charity accounts show the NWMF was funded in  overwhelmingly from two sources – the Big Lotteryand The Executive Office .Together they provided about £, of its roughly £, funds.

Please try again later.Submitting...Mr Campbell, who worships at a Free Presbyterian Church in Londonderry, said: “It was responsible and appropriate for churches to set aside their freedom of worship rights to help preserve le in accordance with the law, but we must all be mindful that freedom of worship is a fundamental right in our British democracy. It should be treated as such by all in government.“As the rest of the economy and public services in Northern Ireland begin toto normal, we all want to see our church congregations able to worship together safely once again.”Last weekend, the Irish government indicated that churches in the Republic can re-open for public worship from Monday, June . Church re-opening in the south would probably force the Stormont Executive to make a similar move as the four main denominationsand even churches like the Baptists and Free Presbyterians, operate on an all-Ireland basis with some parishes and congregations in Fermanagh and Tyrone straddling the border.The Church of Ireland, meanwhile, has provided protocol guidance to its parishioners in Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic for dealing with ato churches for services.The church says the guidance is not intended to replace those issued by statutory authorities in both jurisdictions and should always be interpreted in the light of official public health advice. A letter issued by the CoI primate the Rev John McDowell said many of the issues raised may be applicable to other purposes or to other church buildings. “Further advice will follow in relation to the re-opening of churches for activities other than worship or the opening of other parish buildings,” said the primate.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

in one of his articles that such a progressive town as Penarth was without an operatic and dramatic society, writes Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Societypresident, Mary Gardner.The response to his outcry was quickly taken up and within three weeks the Penarth Operatic Society was formed.The Societyrsquos first production was Gilbert  Sullivanrsquos Iolanthe, played at The Hippodrome which later burnt down, and what a glittering opening evening it must have been as the audience wore evening dress.The review featured next day read, ldquoBrilliant Initial Performance.More newsVale council issues warning over the use of parksFines increased for coronavirus lockdown breachesMarie Curie Great Blooming Tea Party goes virtualA few years later in , the drama section came into being and with it a new title of the Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Society, known affectionately as PODS.Since then PODS has progressed down through the decades with many highlights along the way.One being in  when PODS presented that great musical, The King And I, which won the premier prize at the Waterford International Festival, for which the company received a beautul Waterford crystal vase.The Town Council held a reception to honour the Society at the Paget Rooms, and James Callaghan, the local MP, paid his tribute to PODS saying it ldquoadded lustre and brought culture to Penarth.Another landmark was the play, Dear Octopus, by Dodie Smith produced for PODS th anniversary celebrations.One of our most challenging and exciting shows was Cabaret in , which won the National Operatic  Dramatic Associationrsquos award for Best Production and Best Stage Management and Technical presentation.More recently in , to honour and pay tribute to the many men who gave their lives in World War One, PODS presented the very special play, Last Man Standing, which also won a NODA award for Best Drama.In , PODS decided to do pantomime, and this has been a greatly gratying and popular addition to the companyrsquos output.Itrsquos wonderful to see children in the cast having on-stage experience, and then those children in the audience, perhaps for the first time, enjoying and loving live theatre.PODS is a very busy Society putting on four shows a year, a musical, two plays and a pantomime.Mrs Gardner said: ldquoThis year, sadly and very upsettingly after much hard work by all involved, the covid- virus struck as PODS had just set-up at the Paget Rooms ready for its run of Goodnight Mister Tom, only to be told the venue would be shut down next day.ldquoSince January, the Society had also been rehearsing for its May musical, The Full Monty, and that too has had to be cancelled.       ,params: .pushldquoNevertheless, when this terrible emergency is over the company will put on these two productions sometime in the future. ldquoPODS is proud of its achievement in giving much pleasure and entertainment to the local community with its first-class shows over the last  years, and its goal is to make its centenary in  with the help of its faithful audiences, friends and patrons.PODS is always ready to welcome new members, but at the moment it cannot meet or rehearse due to the covid- restrictions.It might be some time before restrictions are lted on groups being able to rehearse together, or audiences allowed back in theatres, meanwhile PODS members keep in touch

make face masks compulsory public transport","story":"Mark Drakeford said Englands decision to bring in a requirement for coverings had raised issues for people commuting between the two countries.It came as Public Health Wales said a further four people had died after testing positive for coronavirus, taking the total number of deaths to ,, while the number of positive cases grew by  to ,.More NewsLuxury car manufacturer Aston Martin to axe  jobsMans efforts toWorld War One Penarth soldiers plaque found in New ZealandPenarth RNLI leboat crew rescues people caught out by Bristol Channel tideOn Friday, Mr Drakeford was questioned about his governments position on non-medical coverings after a trade union representing doctors in Wales said bringing in rules would help control the spread of Covid- and save lives.Mr Drakeford told the Governments daily press briefing in Cardf: \"The context for face coverings has changed because of an announcement made yesterday in England about mandatory use of face masks on public transport.\"That will not come in until June , and that gives us a short number of days in order to consider the position here in Wales recognising that changed context.\"Mr Drakeford said a \"definitive statement\" on the issue would be made in the first part of next week, and that detailed questions about Englands new rules would be explored with ministers and officials in Westminster.But he said the UK Government had not discussed or given advanced notice of the decision with Wales, and questioned whether England was concerned with \"making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards\".\"I wish that wed had a chance to explore this with the UK Government before they made the announcements,\" he said.\"That would have allowed us to have some answers to the questions that I raised today before the event rather than after the event.\"But while on the bulk of issues we continue to be able to have discussion and co-operation in advance of decision making, in a small number of cases we hear about it only after the decision has been made.\"He added: \"Were going to have to use the time we now have to find out from them the extent to which they have got answers to these questions in advance of making the decision, or whether its a matter of making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards.\"Mr Drakeford said the advice from the chief medical officer for Wales remained that wearing face masks gave people \"some marginal extra protection\" but was not sufficient to make it mandatory.\"The chief medical officer has expressed his anxieties that people might do more risky things because they think a face mask offers them protection, which it doesnt,\" Mr Drakeford said.\"But context changes because in England it is mandatory to use face masks while on public transport.\"Trains and roads between north and south Wales weave in and out of the border all the time and in a sheer practical sense, we have to think through whether having separate regimes is a possibility when you can leave on a train that starts in Wales, goes into England, comes back into Wales, goes back into England, comes back into Wales.\"Earlier on Friday the British Medical AssociationWales called on the Welsh Government to change its stance on non-medical face coverings, and ensure a supply are available to the public.The trade unions council chair for Wales, Dr David Bailey, said: \"BMA Cymru Wales advocates the wearing of face coverings by the public in areas where they cannot socially distance.\"There still remains a considerable risk of infection, and emerging evidence has shown thatmouths and noses are covered when people are in areas where they cannot socially distance, it may help in controlling the spread of infection of Covid- and therefore save lives.\"BMA Cymru Wales is calling on the Welsh Government to change their position immediately, to lessen the risk of the public spreading the virus.\"Wales main train operator, Transport for Wales, said it would \"work collaboratively\" with partners to ensure passengers were kept safe travelling across borders.A spokesman said: \"The cross-border nature of our network means that we will continue to work collaboratively with industry partners to ensure customers understand how they can travel safely as they travel between Wales and England.\"The safety of our colleagues and customers is our top priority and wed like to reinforce the message to stay local and only use public transportthe journey is essential and theres no other travel

decision to bring in a requirement for coverings had raised issues for people commuting between the two countries.It came as Public Health Wales said a further four people had died after testing positive for coronavirus, taking the total number of deaths to ,, while the number of positive cases grew by  to ,.More NewsLuxury car manufacturer Aston Martin to axe  jobsMans efforts toWorld War One Penarth soldiers plaque found in New ZealandPenarth RNLI leboat crew rescues people caught out by Bristol Channel tideOn Friday, Mr Drakeford was questioned about his governments position on non-medical coverings after a trade union representing doctors in Wales said bringing in rules would help control the spread of Covid- and save lives.Mr Drakeford told the Governments daily press briefing in Cardf: \"The context for face coverings has changed because of an announcement made yesterday in England about mandatory use of face masks on public transport.\"That will not come in until June , and that gives us a short number of days in order to consider the position here in Wales recognising that changed context.\"Mr Drakeford said a \"definitive statement\" on the issue would be made in the first part of next week, and that detailed questions about Englands new rules would be explored with ministers and officials in Westminster.But he said the UK Government had not discussed or given advanced notice of the decision with Wales, and questioned whether England was concerned with \"making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards\".\"I wish that wed had a chance to explore this with the UK Government before they made the announcements,\" he said.\"That would have allowed us to have some answers to the questions that I raised today before the event rather than after the event.\"But while on the bulk of issues we continue to be able to have discussion and co-operation in advance of decision making, in a small number of cases we hear about it only after the decision has been made.\"He added: \"Were going to have to use the time we now have to find out from them the extent to which they have got answers to these questions in advance of making the decision, or whether its a matter of making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards.\"Mr Drakeford said the advice from the chief medical officer for Wales remained that wearing face masks gave people \"some marginal extra protection\" but was not sufficient to make it mandatory.\"The chief medical officer has expressed his anxieties that people might do more risky things because they think a face mask offers them protection, which it doesnt,\" Mr Drakeford said.\"But context changes because in England it is mandatory to use face masks while on public transport.\"Trains and roads between north and south Wales weave in and out of the border all the time and in a sheer practical sense, we have to think through whether having separate regimes is a possibility when you can leave on a train that starts in Wales, goes into England, comes back into Wales, goes back into England, comes back into Wales.\"Earlier on Friday the British Medical AssociationWales called on the Welsh Government to change its stance on non-medical face coverings, and ensure a supply are available to the public.The trade unions council chair for Wales, Dr David Bailey, said: \"BMA Cymru Wales advocates the wearing of face coverings by the public in areas where they cannot socially distance.\"There still remains a considerable risk of infection, and emerging evidence has shown thatmouths and noses are covered when people are in areas where they cannot socially distance, it may help in controlling the spread of infection of Covid- and therefore save lives.\"BMA Cymru Wales is calling on the Welsh Government to change their position immediately, to lessen the risk of the public spreading the virus.\"Wales main train operator, Transport for Wales, said it would \"work collaboratively\" with partners to ensure passengers were kept safe travelling across borders.A spokesman said: \"The cross-border nature of our network means that we will continue to work collaboratively with industry partners to ensure customers understand how they can travel safely as they travel between Wales and England.\"The safety of our colleagues and customers is our top priority and wed like to reinforce the message to stay local and only use public transportthe journey is essential and theres no other travel alternative.\" article_url   content_id

option to alleviate potential flood risk.More NewsVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldMillions become unpaid carers due to coronavirus crisisPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownThe campaign by the Save Dinas Powys Woods and Protect Homes from Flooding group was launched in March  after the Woodland Trust said NRW was proposing to build a dam within its site of Cwm George and Casehill Woods.The group said the proposals would involve cutting down  square metres of trees including  square metres of ancient trees and regular flooding upstream during high rainfall would result in further destruction of ancient trees, hedgerows, wildle, and plants.Dormice and other protected species like bats were at risk, the group said.The woods, much-loved by the community, attracts visitors from other areas and is the Woodland Trustrsquos most visited site in Wales with more than , visitors.Hundreds of people took part in marches in  to oppose the dam.NRW released its draft Outline Business Case in February  and a consultation period with the local community took place.Hundreds of people attended a meeting in February to oppose the dam and they wrote to NRW, with their views, during the coronavirus lockdown.Chairman of Save Dinas Powys Woods  Protect Homes From Flooding, Peter Smith said the group welcomed the announcement that NRW will not develop a dam in the Dinas Powys Woods.ldquoLocal people recognise the flood risk in the village, but are overwhelmingly in favour of a natural flood management programmein the Cadoxton River and Eastbrook catchments, plus improved channel maintenance andrequired local hard defences, rather than an environmentally unfriendly dam, Dr Smith said.ldquoOur proposals will slow the flow of the rivers upstream thus reducing the risk of flash flooding, and by removing obstacles improve flow downstream.ldquoWe now look forward to working with NRW and The Woodland Trust to design an effective NFM scheme.ldquoBoth have expertise in this area, and, having made funds available for NFM projects, we know that the Welsh Government is keen for Wales to become an exemplar of good practice. community involvement and support will remain key features of our campaign.He added: ldquoWe are grateful to people far and wide who have supported our campaign, including the Woodland Trust, our local community councils, and county councillors.ldquoWe extend our particular thanks our local MS, Jane Hutt, for her advocacy and support.Community councillor, Chris Franks said NRW must not now ignore any problems.ldquoClearly over the years there has been reduced spending on maintenance of the stream through Dinas Powys and towards Barry, he said.ldquoThe public has said that the NRW must improve monitoring of flows on the Cadoxton River, implement natural flood management measures and improve flow at Cardf Road bridge where the stream passes under the A to reduce flood risk.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquolsquoFollowing our meeting on May  Sir David Henshaw chairman of NRW wrote to me on May  to say that NRW received almost  responses to our consultation on the Outline Business Case with the vast majority being opposed to the upstream storage option on the Cadoxton Brook.NRW chairman, Sir Henshaw said: ldquoWhen we consider the marginal

has spoken of the plight of rural communities during lockdown in Uganda.Three months ago, Jenipher Wetaka Sambazi, a Fairtrade coffee farmer from the Mt Elgon region in Uganda, was sharing her experiences of the benefit of Fairtrade in Penarthrsquos Tabernacle Baptist Church.More NewsVictory in campaign to save Dinas Powys ancient woodland as dam plan is abandonedVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownNow she and her family, like communities around the world, are under lockdown.In March, campaigners, businesses, supporters, and students from around Wales heard Jenipherrsquos story, face to face.Now she is unable to travel or even meet with her neighbours.This means the coffee picked at the end of the last harvest remains on the mountain and Jenipher and her fellow farmers are prohibited from travelling to gather it for processing under the current lockdown rules.There are currently several hundred known cases of covid- in Uganda, but none in the Mount Elgon region and no fatalities in Uganda as yet.Farmers want to keep it this way, but lockdown is causing other concerns such as limiting access to food and healthcare.This is the time of year when there is the least amount of food available, and the closing of markets and freedom to travel for farmers to source food and water means that times are exceptionally hard.Jenipher as vice-chairwoman of a Fairtrade coffee cooperative, is responsible for many who rely on the cooperative for work.The expert hand-sorters who are seasonal workers and rely on this part of the coffee chain to feed their family at this time, have no coffee to sort.While they may have some spare eggs, vegetables or matoke to trade, the threat of soldiers prohibiting them from doing so is too much for them.Farmer co-operatives, an essential element of Fairtrade, enable and encourage communities to work together.Fairtrade also requires an extra amount of money, the Fairtrade premium, to be paid to producers.Fairtrade farmers like Jenipher are struggling, but they have the benefits of a strong local community as well as the backup of the Fairtrade premium.Fairtrade International have announced a .m euro Fairtrade Producer Relief fund targeting the immediate needs and Resilience Fund to help producers rebuild their businesses after Covid-.Jenipher Wettaka Sambazi said: ldquoLe is hard.ldquoThe markets are shut so there is nowhere to sell or earn money, or to buy food and basic essentials.ldquoLocal health centres have been shut to reduce the chance of spreading the virus, but since all transport is banned, those who need operations, treatment or antenatal care need to walk  km to the nearest hospital.ldquoTwo women and their unborn babies have died on the way.\"Roger Casey, who attends Tabernacle Baptist Church said: ldquoIt was wonderful to meet Jenipher and hear her story.ldquoWe get through a lot of coffee in our office and meeting a real coffee farmer from Uganda makes you think about the real people and real lives behind that Fairtrade logo.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquoMeeting Jenipher during her visit to Wales earlier this year was inspiring.ldquoThe increasing dficulties facing rural farming communities because of the pandemic has shown how important Fairtrade cooperatives continue to be and I am glad that leaders like Jenipher continue to promote the benefits of Fairtrade and to support communities.National co-ordinator of Fair Trade Wales, Aileen Burmeister added: ldquoFair Trade producers are being impacted by covid- restrictions.ldquoGlobal stock markets are falling, meaning that farmers and workers are receiving far less for their produce.\"It is in these times that we can really see how important the Fairtrade minimum price is. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

This is an understandable source of frustration for many customers pic ykZlQsZBmdash Transport CommitteeJune , Unions told the committee they are opposed to what they described as a ldquofire and rehire approach being considered by British Airways.They stated the airline is proposing to give redundancy notices to most of its , workers and offer jobs with new terms and conditions to a proportion of them,it cannot reach an agreement on job cuts and other changes.The minimum -day consultation period for some workers ends on Monday.BA has had discussions with pilotsrsquo union Balpa, including over the possibility of voluntary redundancies.But the other two main unions representing its workers ndash Unite and GMB ndash are not engaging in talks.The committee found that British Airways had received nearly pound million from the Government as of May  by furloughing , staff.Willie Walsh, chief executive of British Airwaysrsquo parent company IAG, told the MPs that the amount of money the airline received from the scheme in April was equivalent to less than two days of staff wages.Unions have argued that the airline could survive evenall its planes were grounded for  months.The committeersquos report stated: ldquoThe behaviour of British Airways and its parent company towards its employees is a national disgrace.ldquoIt falls well below the standards we would expect from any employer, especially in light of the scale of taxpayer subsidy, at this time of national crisis.There have been calls from some MPs for British Airways to be stripped of some of its lucrative take-off and landing slots at Heathrow as punishment for the treatment of its workforce.Tory MP Huw Merriman, who chairs the committee, said: ldquoWe will continue to bring pressure where we can, including the airport slot allocation process.ldquoThis wanton destruction of a loyal workforce cannot appear to go without sanction by Government, parliamentarians or paying passengers who may choose dferently in future. We view it as a national disgrace.British Airways said in a statement: ldquoMr Merriman made clear several weeks ago that the Transport Select Committeersquos report would be lsquofuelled by the kind and impassioned messagesrsquo he received, rather than the facts.ldquoThe facts are clear. The Government has no plans to help the sector restart and recover as evidenced by the introduction of the -day quarantine regulation.ldquoWe find ourselves in the deepest crisis ever faced by the airline industry. A crisis not of our making but one which we must address.ldquoWe will do everything in our power to ensure that British Airways can survive and sustain the maximum number of jobs consistent with the new reality of a changed airline industry in a severely weakened global economy.Unite general secretary Len McCluskey said: ldquoThe case the company makes for sacking , and trashing the wages of those who stay on the workforce is full of holes because it is a transparent effort to generate profits out of a crisis.BALPAs response to the @CommonsTrans report in full: https:t.co tBmTFFRAmdash BALPAJune , ldquoBA is fooling nobody. Never before has the country witnessed such wholesale mistreatment of a UK workforce and such brutal industrial thuggery.The committeersquos report into the impact of the pandemic on the aviation sector also urged the Government to abandon its -day quarantine rule at the end of June.It called for a ldquomore targeted and nuanced border control policy, allowing people travelling from countries where the infection rate of Covid- is relatively low to enter the UK on a less restrictive basis.A Government spokesman said: ldquoWe continue to work at speed to help protect the long-term future of the sector, however we will always put public health first, and we must not risk an extremely damaging second wave of the virus..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: British Airways u treatment of staff a national disgrace, say MPs article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

A wide range of services were stood down or scaled back due to the risk of spread of COVID-. New services were introduced to meet the predicted demands of the pandemic. A spokesperson said: With the first peak of the COVID- outbreak in Northern Ireland having passed, the Trust is now focused on planning, with our HSC partners, how to restart services while maintaining sufficient flexibility so that services can respond to future waves of this disease. In working together with our health and social care partners across NI to implement the recovery of non-COVID- HSC Services, the agreed regional approach will be to ensure equity of access to treatment for patients and clients across NI, to minimise transmission of COVID- and to protect the most urgent services. A set of guiding principles in the form of a ‘checklist’ has been established by the Department of Healthto guide service planning. The DoH has asked that service restart plans be assessed against the checklist to ensure that they have been subject to a rigorous risk assessment, take account of new ways of working and can be safely implemented in line with social distancing, use of personal protective equipmentand infection prevention and control requirements.The Western Trust has introduced a Reset Framework to support staff in assessing the impact of scaling up or restarting services and to ensure there is a rigorous and careful approach to planning.A spokesperson continued: The Western Trust Stage  Plan identies the services we have maintained throughout these initial months of the COVID- pandemic across a wide range of areas. It identies those that we will continue and others that we will begin to restart or scale up. It sets out some of the important preparation work needed to provide COVID- safe environments and working practices, to protect our staff, patients and service users. There are a number of constraints which are foremost in the planning process, including availability of PPE availability of drugs and restrictions on the practice of vulnerable staff.Our Stage  plan will focus on:Supporting strong community services for frail or older people. Preparing for the impact of the COVID- pandemic on mental health services. Managing risk, and providing COVID--safe services for staff and our service users. Involving our staff and service users.Speaking about the launch of Stage  of the Trust’s Reset Plan, Dr Anne Kilgallen, Western Trust chief executive, said: “There is no doubt that this has been one of the most dficult periods we have ever had to experience.I would like to thank our community and hospital staff for their hard work and dedication. Members of the public have also been unwavering in their support and this has not gone unnoticed. “There are many challenges which we have faced and will continue to face in the new COVID- environment. Our Stage  plan sets out the steps we are taking to rebuild, reset and make necessary changes to our services into the future.“It is accepted that COVID- remains a public health risk to our population and a phased and flexible approach is needed to restarting services. As a result, the way services are delivered may look and feel dferent. There are opportunities to do things dferently in ways that improve care. Many great initiatives have already begun.” Dr Kilgallen continued: “While there are signicant challenges ahead, the public should be reassured that we are committed to providing the best possible care in environments that reduce the risk of infection for staff and services users alike. We will continue to work diligently to create COVID--safe environments while we rebuild services.” A copy of the rebuilding plan – Stage One can you be found on the Trust website www.westerntrust.hscni.net  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_efdddabbeedf   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_ffbedadc   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
