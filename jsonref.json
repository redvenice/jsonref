His first work, The Relapse: Or Virtue in Danger, was a huge success.After penning several other pieces over the next few years, he switched career in 1702 and became an architect.His first design was Castle Howard in Yorkshire, for Lord Carlisle. He would go on to design the Queen’s Theatre (or Opera House) in the Haymarket in 1703.Then, in 1705, John Churchill, 1st duke of Marlborough, asked him to design the palace at Woodstock, Oxfordshire - Blenheim Palace.There followed several more country houses in the style of castles - such as Kimbolton Castle in Huntingdon (1707–10) and Kings Weston in Gloucestershire (now in Bristol c. 1710–14). But Blenheim remains his most famous work.                                                     The jewel in the crown of this home is a private roof terrace which enjoys sweeping views of the Greenwich observatory and nearby Royal Park. Vanbrugh Castle, believed to have been modelled on the French Bastille, was built in 1718 by highly acclaimed architect Sir John Vanbrugh, who lived there with his wife Henrietta Maria Yarborough until his death aged 62 in 1726.The  politically radical Vanbrugh was imprisoned in the Bastille in his youth for espionage.He was also involved in a plot to overthrow James II and put William III on the throne, to protect English parliamentary democracy. Sir John is best known as the designer of UNESCO World Heritage Site Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire and Castle Howard in North Yorkshire.Vanbrugh Castle has since been used as an RAF school for the sons of servicemen killed in the World Wars but was restored and refurbished by the Blackheath Preservation Trust for luxury living space.The apartment - currently owned by Dave Edgar and his wife, Barbara, who have lived there for more than 20 years - boasts four bedrooms, a modern kitchen, and a living and dining room consisting of solid wood doors and large picturesque windows.The master bedroom has a dressing room and a bathroom adjacent to it, while on the second floor lies the three other neat-looking bedrooms.The basement has a utility room and large cellar while outside there is an annex along with two off-street parking spaces.Paul Kirby from Fine \u0026amp Country said: \u0027Vanbrugh Castle presents a fantastic opportunity for someone to live in a historic castle while having all the benefits of London on the doorstep.\u0027The most impressive feature of the four-storey household is the expansive private roof terrace that boasts far-reaching views of the London skyline.\u0027Because the property sits upon a hilltop, you overlook the lush communal gardens, the wonderful Greenwich observatory and the nearby Royal Park.\u0027We think the property would suit a family who want the best of London living in a welcoming and friendly location.\u0027           The castle\u0027s design is believed to have been inspired by the Bastille, where the politically radical Vanbrugh was imprisoned in his youth for espionage  Paul Kirby from Fine \u0026amp Country said: \u0027Vanbrugh Castle presents a fantastic opportunity for someone to live in a historic castle while having all the benefits of London on the doorstep\u0027          Vanbrugh Castle has since been used as an RAF school for the sons of servicemen killed in the World Wars but was restored and refurbished by the Blackheath Preservation Trust for luxury living space          After penning several comedies following his imprisonment,  Sir John switched career in 1702 and became an architect          The basement has a utility room and large cellar while outside there is an annex along with two off-street parking spaces"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/12/23/4D2B0AD000000578-0-image-m-14_1528843303013.jpg","title":"Would FIVE stone lose six months 10 000","story":"A controversial competition is offering a member of the public the chance to earn £10,000 if they agree to put on five stone and lose it again in six months (Pictured: The Bark advert)It is being run by website Bark.com, which connects customers with local service professionals.

The switch was narrowly approved in a referendum last year.According to Bloomberg, Erdogan could take home the presidential vote in the first round, with nearly 51 per cent, his closest rival trailing behind at just over 30 per cent.If no presidential candidate gains 50 percent of the vote, a second round vote will be held two weeks later between the two candidates with the most votes.  Bloomberg\u0027s poll found that if there is a second round of votes, \u0027Erdogan’s lead would be more substantial\u0027.Turkey¿s Election Is Too Close to Call, Bloomberg Poll Shows - Bloomberg"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/13/12/4D2EDA7D00000578-0-image-m-4_1528890192160.jpg","title":"CBI chief British car manufacturing faces extinction","story":"    Paul Drechsler (file image), who is standing down from his role in the business organisation, said politicians are not focusing on the economics of BrexitBritain\u0027s car industry and other manufacturing face \u0027extinction\u0027 unless Britain remains in a customs union with the EU, the president of the CBI warned today.Paul Drechsler, who is standing down from his role in the business organisation, said politicians are not focusing on the economics of Brexit. The warning comes just days after Jaguar-Land Rover announced it was moving some jobs to Slovakia, leaving hundreds of jobs in the west midlands at risk.Other major manufacturing giants have issued warnings about the impact of Brexit on their future investment decisions - but few have so far actually changed course.Mr Drechsler told the BBC: \u0027There is a risk that the auto industry in the UK faces extinction if there\u0027s no customs union after Brexit.He added: \u0027If we do not have a customs union there are sectors of manufacturing society in the UK which risk becoming extinct.Commons in chaos as every SNP MP walks out of PMQs after...May defies Tory Remainer rebels as she warns that Parliament...Share this article\u0027Be in no doubt, that is the reality.\u0027The debate that\u0027s going on across the country, in terms of politicians, it\u0027s not about economics, it\u0027s about politics.\u0027He added: \u0027There\u0027s zero evidence that independent trade deals will provide any economic benefit to the UK that\u0027s material.

An art class lasts an hour. The teacher spends 10 minutes explaining what the students have to do, then they spend the next 45 minutes doing it. And while they’re cutting out, drawing and colouring, the teacher just sits there at his desk. That repeats hourly, from 8am until 6pm, every single day.So about four years in, I started making work in the classroom. I first became obsessed with hyperrealistic drawing. My students were what I had in front of me, so I started taking passport-style photographs of them, which I would copy. Within a few months, people thought my drawings were photographs. I then moved on to colour photographs and oil painting, before realising that the photographs were what was most interesting. In the darkroom, I would notice things I hadn’t seen in the viewfinder. The student sitting behind the model, or the one holding the paper background and looking away. So I started integrating more students into the images. And since it was an art room, the materials I had to hand – paper, cloth, tape, plaster – made their way into the images, too. I’d plan out exactly what I wanted to do, and then do a few versions of each, with different pupils. Sometimes I’d need to bring objects in from the outside – a very large jumper, a woollen hat I had asked a seamstress friend to make, or a pair of trousers of which she had lengthened one leg.With this image, I started with the cardboard feet and gradually added cardboard arms. The boy couldn’t get the feet on without taking off his shoes, and I left his shoes exactly where he put them. They reminded me of my father, a very lazy man. When he comes home after work, he takes off his suit to put on his joggers, and leaves it right there on the floor. Running through these images, and my work in general, is this idea of Moroccan society being stuck, in limbo. A society that doesn’t move, yet isn’t stable one out of kilter. Sometimes the model would appear to be hanging from the ceiling, or he’d be seated at a desk tipping over to one side. Sometimes they’d be seated at desks on top of desks. Fifteen years on, Morocco has changed but not necessarily developed. You see people driving in the wrong direction on the motorway, or not stopping at red lights others throwing stuff out of windows donkeys weaving through traffic. There are laws, but everyone just does as they please. It is the world upside-down, a surreal place.If I was bored, the students were, too. I had to follow the curriculum in class, and it was so repetitive, so pointless, that anything out of the ordinary was exciting for them. As soon as I took my camera out, their faces would light up. “What’s he going to get us to do now?” I could feel their gaze on me: we had a real understanding. I didn’t direct them in terms of making facial expressions. I’d just set up the camera and tell them how to position themselves. It was only when I developed the film that I’d notice they were smiling, or looking serious.It didn’t make them any more interested in art. They really didn’t care. These sessions never led to any conversations. I would try to engage them further – talking about Matisse’s cutouts, say, his technique, his childlike sensibility – and they’d listen respectfully, but without curiosity. One day I gave copies of one photo to the two students who were in it, and they immediately put them in their notebooks and asked if they could leave. I scratched my head, wondering if they’d not realised it was them in the picture. I asked them what they thought. They said they didn’t think it was beautiful – because a good picture, for them, was a portrait with big smiles. I don’t remember any of their names – I saw about 460 students a week – but I’ve since met a couple who remember me. Once in Paris, I was waiting to cross the road and noticed a north African girl on the other side, staring at me. When we passed each other, she stopped to ask if I was Monsieur Benohoud. To which I replied: “Let’s get out of the road first.” We spoke for a while, and she said: “You were my teacher you took photos of me in that series.” She was an adult now, no longer a teenager.• Hicham Benohoud’s series The Classroom will be exhibited in the Carte Blanche show at PHotoESPAÑA 2018, in Madrid, until 26 August.Training: Art baccalauréat art teacher training at the Centre Pédagogique Régional, Marrakech, and the Centre de Formation de Plasticiens Intervenants Ecole des Arts Décoratifs, Strasbourg."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea932ecf922fdba53f668f44e24f80daa270b8b8/36_242_2574_1545/master/2574.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=382d99532745eb742978f0428f024aaf","title":"to forget is to offend the slave trade legacy nicola lo calzo in pictures","story":"From carnival-goers in the West Indies to voodoo ceremonies in west Africa, Nicola Lo Calzo’s photography confronts us with memories of slavery"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f06bff23e24378e6336178f6b9d04f5d80223cc4/586_75_1924_1155/master/1924.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc77a262f3e709b78ea12a5ee1f4dd56","title":"junot diaz sherman alexie morality contract publishers","story":"Offensive opinions. Bullying. Sexual misconduct. As the literary world is rocked by scandal US publishers are asking authors to sign contracts with ‘morality clauses’. Are they really the answer?When the American Libraries Association awards its Andrew Carnegie medals in New Orleans later this month, there will be no winner for excellence in non-fiction. Sherman Alexie, the poet and novelist who was due to receive it for a memoir, You Don’t Have to Say You Love Me, has declined the award following allegations of sexual harassment.Last month, the novelist Junot Díaz withdrew from the Sydney writers’ festival and from chairing the Pulitzer prize board after being confronted by his own accusers. As the allegations swept through social media, another writer, Mary Karr, joined the fray, tweeting of her distress that her testimony to DT Max, the biographer of her one-time partner David Foster Wallace, about Foster Wallace’s abusive behaviour had been marginalised. “Deeply saddened by the allegations against #JunotDiaz \u0026amp I support every woman brave enough to speak. The violence #DavidFosterWallace inflicted on me as a single mom was ignored by his biographer \u0026amp @NewYorker as ‘alleged’ despite my having letters in his hand,” she wrote.Such high profile cases are far from rare as the #MeToo movement spreads across the creative industries. They come at a time when writers are facing increasingly draconian attempts by publishers to police their behaviour, calling into question centuries old assumptions about the desirability – or even the possibility in today’s networked world – of separating writers’ lives from their work.Sexual harassment might be the most acute manifestation of this crisis but it is only one aspect of it. Last year, Simon \u0026amp Schuster cancelled a book by the rightwing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos after comments he had made about sex between men and “younger boys” put an abrupt end to tolerance of his controversialist views. Just months earlier, when the book deal was announced, human rights organisations had rallied to defend the firm’s right to publish his autobiography, Dangerous, however objectionable his views were held to be.Cancelling contracts is a costly and legally dangerous business for publishers – as the Yiannopoulos case revealed. It involved waving goodbye to a reported $250,000 advance, and Simon \u0026amp Schuster only avoided being sued for breach of contract when the disgraced author opted to drop the lawsuit and self-publish instead. The fear among authors and agents is that the case will be seen to strengthen the argument for personal behaviour to be written into author contracts.Clearly, reputation doesn’t matter to a controversialist in the way it does to literary authors such as Alexie or Díaz, who are facing serious damage to their careers. In the weeks since 10 women came forward with accusations against Alexie, the Native American author has been subjected to a cascade of punitive measures. His name has been stripped from a scholarship awarded by the Institute of American Indian Arts, all references to him have been “deleted or modified” in the blog Native Americans in Children’s Literature, bookshops and libraries are destocking his books and his US publisher has said that it will be postponing the paperback of his memoir (though his UK publisher, Penguin Random House, says it will continue to reprint his work as required).Díaz’s US publisher scrapped the publicity schedule for his children’s picture book Islandborn, and his forthcoming public lectures have been cancelled. His UK publisher Oneworld has confirmed it is going ahead with publication, but will postpone it until the autumn. Meanwhile, this month three editors resigned from the Boston Review after the magazine, where Díaz has worked as fiction editor since 2003, announced that it was keeping him on, because “the objectionable conduct described in the public reports does not have the kind of severity that animated the #MeToo movement”.Shortly before the accusations – in what has been denounced by his detractors as a pre-emptive move – Dominican American Díaz wrote a long and moving confessional in the New Yorker about the legacy of damage inflicted on him by being raped as a child. Supporters in the academic world have rallied round him with an open letter in the Chronicle of Higher Education claiming that the “(at times uncritical) reception and repetition of the charges ... amounts to a full-blown media-harassment campaign”. While not dismissing the allegations, the 26 signatories, who include professors from Harvard, Yale, New York, California and Florida, warn that “the … characterization of Díaz as a dangerous and aggressive sexual predator from whom all women must be protected reinforces racist stereotypes”.The high emotions surrounding the behaviour of writers are starkly exemplified by the case of Foster Wallace. Though Karr feels understandably aggrieved that her experience wasn’t taken more seriously by his biographer, she would be wrong to think it wasn’t noted. In a blog written at the time, Kristen Roupenian – who went on to write the New Yorker short story sensation “Cat Person” – described her dismay at discovering in Max’s book that the literary hero she worshipped as a student would probably have dismissed her as “audience pussy”.She wasn’t looking for a boycott of his work, she wrote. “All I expect is a quiet, un-showy disqualification for the role of hero, mentor or saint. I would like the ‘statue’ (Wallace’s word) of his public image to be carefully dismantled, for the overblown ideas we have of him and what his life meant to slowly begin to deflate. I would like him to become just another writer, imbued with no moral authority beyond what is contained in his words on the page.”“Publishers feel an obligation to use their personal social media accounts to publicise books and to go out for drinks,” says Kremer. “People forget that these are not friendships, they are friendly business relationships. You have to understand what’s off limits.”The urgency of addressing these issues is not simply about protecting those who work in the industry, but of finding a way to safeguard the freedom of literature itself. When the Díaz story broke in the US, Elleke Boehmer, professor of world literature in English at Oxford University, considered whether his Pulitzer prize-winning novel The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao should be taken off her teaching syllabus. Her department decided to let it stay on the grounds that “what would be really valuable would be not to block writers’ voices, but to put others alongside these authors who are now being deplatformed”.“We’ve been here before,” says a senior UK biographer, who declined to be named, citing the furore over Philip Larkin’s racism and misogyny, which threatened to obliterate his reputation after the publication of his Selected Letters in the early 1990s. “Yes, I am fearful that wonderful writers with horrible personal lives are going to fall out of the literary canon because of their terrible behaviour. Puritanism isn’t good for literary understanding.”But these are different times, in which technological changes have created unprecedented forms of accountability. For Kremer, finding a way forward involves responsibility all round – a challenge that is especially tough in an era when reputations can be made or destroyed with an anonymous comment beneath an article, or a single tweet. Her hope is that new, negotiated social contracts will prove more powerful than no-platforming or the imposition of morality clauses that, as Nicola Solomon, CEO of the Society of Authors, points out, could be wrongly invoked to end contracts with writers whom publishers no longer wanted for reasons that had nothing to do with their morality.Writers have a central role to play in exploring the nuances of the new, wired environment, whether through short stories, such as Roupenian’s “Cat Person”, which investigates the politics of unwanted sex, or novels such as Lisa Halliday’s recent Asymmetry, which examines the perils of cultural asymmetry in terms of both a young editor’s relationship with an famous older writer, and the right of a white, female writer to describe the experience of a young Iraqi-American man.As Warner said in her speech: “Striving to be good is not the same as good writing. Engaging in fictive truth-telling is not the same as winning gold stars for conduct.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc81b7cf609938e8587b1c4f9998167926500cff/0_0_2308_1385/master/2308.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bf736eaa1b25ac103be70e413269aa71","title":"top 10 lost womens classics","story":"From scifi author Octavia Butler, to the other Elizabeth Taylor and Charles Dickens’s descendant Monica, these writers are worth adding to your libraryWhat is a “lost” women’s classic? How unappreciated does something have to be before you consider it lost? Also, lost to whom?As a Virago author, I am proudly, painfully aware that my book was paid for – literally and figuratively – by the art of women who are now dead. There wouldn’t be a taste for the kind of gothic body-horror in my debut, Promising Young Women, had Angela Carter not been serving it under a cloche in the mid-80s. There wouldn’t be a space for female humour if Nancy Mitford hadn’t carved it out with a scalpel. There wouldn’t be a thirst for workplace romances if Charlotte Brontë hadn’t drawn up the template for them. My first book was written by telling all these women – and many others – to turn around so I could smooth my paper between their shoulder blades. And yet, all of my favourite authors went through a period of lostness before they were picked up by some gutsy publisher. In many cases, that publisher was Virago: in 1978, Virago Modern Classics set out to publish either women who were out of print, or whose work didn’t get the respect it deserved, and changed the literary landscape in the process. There are writers who are beloved within their niche, who have thriving fanbases, but still might not have a single book in Waterstones. Are they lost? Lost until someone finds them, I guess. But lost, as a status, is a transient one. The following books have all endured some kind of success, some kind of loss, and at least a few of them will have you saying: “What do you mean, lost? I saw that in an airport WH Smith!” To this, I have no answer. These are simply the books that I want to push into people’s hands, that they might not find elsewhere. The books, you’ll realise, that your library was lost without.1. Kindred by Octavia ButlerThis is often cited as the first science fiction published by a black woman, but you don’t need to put Kindred in the category of “firsts” to find it brilliant. It follows 26-year-old Dana, a black woman moving in with her white boyfriend, who is periodically sent back in time to a pre-civil war Maryland plantation. Here, she’s forced to protect her distant white relatives from destruction while they abuse her and other slaves. It is the marker you should judge all other time-travelling narratives by.2. Home Cooking by Laurie ColwinI have limited interest in adjectives, and food writing is full of them. Even good food writing I find hard going. Or at least, I did, until someone gifted me this slim little paperback. It’s full of gross references to 80s food, such as creamed spinach. Regardless, it’s a tragicomic exploration of life and friendship through food, something every food writer wants to achieve, but Colwin truly pulled out of the bag.3. Are You Somebody? by Nuala O’Faolain I had always wondered, when reading Nora Ephron, if Ireland ever had an equivalent. Someone witty and female who would not only call a spade a spade but acknowledge the blade, the handle and the funny way it sticks out of the earth. Recently, I discovered that person in Nuala O’Faolain. Her memoir Are You Somebody? is equal parts hilarious, tragic and wonderfully gossipy. “Years after I was in Hull, Philip Larkin apologised. ‘I was asked to look out for you,’ he said. ‘But I’m afraid I couldn’t be bothered.’”4. Passing by Nella LarsenPassing is one of those books you’re either obsessed with, or have never heard of. A gem of the Harlem Renaissance, it follows two black women, the married Irene and the beautiful Clare, who has committed to a life of “passing” as white and is now homesick for the culture she abandoned.There were thousands of “tragic mulatto” narratives being peddled in Larsen’s day, and most of them had a very similar arc: light-skinned black girl tries to “become white”, fails, is rejected by both cultures and dies tragically. Most of them are worth leaving in the cultural dust. Passing both follows the genre and subverts it completely, its use of Irene as narrator making it a compelling psychological drama as well as an investigation of race and class in Harlem in the early 20th century. 5. Confessions of a Failed Southern Lady by Florence KingRepublican, southern, and gay, King was the definition of an equal-opportunities hater. She was the Dorothy Parker of the American south, and because Dorothy Parker figures are much better suited to chic cocktail bars than they are to sweltering wraparound porches, she has largely flown under the radar. In her own words, “even my different drummer had a different drummer”.6. One Pair of Feet by Monica DickensThis wartime nurse may have been a descendant of Charles Dickens, but she had very little interest in feigning compassion at the discomfort of others. This reads more like a diary than a memoir, with none of the usual ego and self-preservation of autobiography.7. Dolly City by Orly Castel-BloomWhen a book’s very first page includes the butchering and eating of a pet goldfish, you know you’re in for a bumpy ride. Baby stealing, grave-digging, pet-eating, Holocaust jokes – you name it, this Tel Aviv nightmare has it. A cult classic about motherhood and, in particular, Jewish motherhood, Dolly City is horrifyingly dark yet ceaselessly comic.8. Angel by Elizabeth Taylor It took me becoming a Virago author to finally understand that there are two very different Elizabeth Taylors. Angel is the story of a teenage girl with a preternatural taste for melodrama who ends up writing a bestseller whose success baffles even her publishers. You can’t help but think that it’s a sly wink from Taylor, who wrote a score of books and dozens of short stories, toward the industry as a whole.9. The Young Visiters by Daisy Ashford What better way to fill the ninth spot on this list that with an author who was actually nine when she wrote her book? What’s fascinating about the story is that, while it was written by a child, it is definitely not a children’s book. It’s a serious society novel, and takes itself hugely seriously. It ends up being an unwitting parody not only of literature, but of adults as a class of people.“Bring three glasses of champaigne commanded the prince and some ices he added majestikally. The goods appeared as if by majic and the prince drew out a cigar case and passed it round.“One grows weary of Court Life he remarked.“Ah yes agreed the earl.”10. The Brontës Went to Woolworths by Rachel Ferguson “I was so rasped with life that I hit Goldsmith’s tomb with my umbrella. I said, ‘I’d give five pounds if somebody’d come along and tell us both how clever we are.’”At a certain point, you’re going to run out of Mitford novels to reread. Fear not, good sister, because if wry, absurd novels about posh sisters are your drugs of choice, this is your crack."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef1cca029f4204b98f2a4ef56d65a13198695a99/0_0_3543_2127/master/3543.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de47cf003d5552dd96d4a10707da6a0e","title":"mps call for further scrutiny of pwcs audit of philip greens bhs","story":"Committee presses regulator after £6.5m fine for PricewaterhouseCoopers over BHSMPs have called on the accountancy regulator to consider investigating PricewaterhouseCoopers’ auditing of Sir Philip Green’s wider retail empire, after the firm was hit with a record fine over the handling of BHS under his ownership.The Financial Reporting Council confirmed late on Tuesday that PwC had been handed a record £6.5m fine, reduced from £10m after it agreed to settle and admitted misconduct. Steve Denison, one of the firm’s senior accountants who audited BHS’s accounts ahead of its sale for £1 a year before the department store chain collapsed, is separately facing a 15-year ban and record personal fine of £325,000 from the industry watchdog. The fine was reduced from £500,000 after Denison admitted misconduct.The Commons work and pensions committee, which carried out an investigation into the demise of the department store in 2016, is pressing the FRC on whether further investigation and wider sanctions are called for. It has asked whether the FRC will investigate PwC’s audit of the accounts of Taveta, the Sir Philip Green-led former parent company of BHS that sold the department store to the former bankrupt Dominic Chappell in 2015.Taveta controls Arcadia Group, which includes Topshop, Dorothy Perkins and Burton.Frank Field MP, the chair of the committee, said of the FRC’s sanctions of PwC and Denison: “This is undoubtedly a good first move. It reopens the key question of whether BHS was in fact a ‘going concern’ when it was jettisoned for £1. For that, the company directors as well as the auditors are on the hook.”The committee has also asked for further details of the misconduct of PwC and Denison that earned them the fines, and of whether there was a conflict of interest in the advisory firm auditing the accounts of BHS and the parent company that was trying to offload it.The regulator said that in addition to the financial sanctions and a “severe reprimand” it has asked PwC to monitor its Leeds-based audit practice and provide detailed reports to the FRC for the next three years, while ensuring that all audits of high-risk non-listed companies or high-profile companies are reviewed for quality."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc8fd2ed774b06730f9c76ed4b0fb8a9e7b39a49/0_215_5400_3240/master/5400.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a8cb8d7e2ade784329db3292beb9585","title":"what is manchester one mans mission to photograph a citys essence","story":"Following the Manchester Arena attack, Paul Dobraszczyk spent one year, 80 walks, 300 miles and 9,000 photographs trying to capture what unites the cityOne of the strongest responses to the suicide bombing at the Manchester Arena last May was a call for unity: for Mancunians of every persuasion to be strong and stand together. Like so many others, I felt a need to identify with the city and its people, to respond in some way that keyed into this desire for solidarity.I decided to immerse myself in the city by walking the streets and building an archive of photographs. With the edges of Manchester’s city centre in the throes of breakneck redevelopment that is seeing the construction of dozens of high-rise luxury apartment blocks, I wanted to find what had endured beyond this bubble of speculative building – and to find something that might counter it.Tony Walsh’s 2012 poem This is the Place – read to a crowd of thousands the day after the attack – spoke passionately of Manchester as a city with a distinct identity that embraced international clout (music and football) and defiant localism (cups of tea and cobbled streets). But a question kept coming back to me: what exactly is Manchester – where does it begin and end? Strictly speaking, the city of Manchester is only a small part of a wider metropolitan region: the county of Greater Manchester, created in 1974, which brought together 10 metropolitan boroughs and two cities – Salford and Manchester – under a larger urban identity. Yet for me that wider urban region – which at 493 square miles is nearly as big as Greater London – meant very little, because I’d not had cause to visit many areas outside of the city centre.One year, 80 walks, 300 miles and 9,000 photographs later, I am still overwhelmed by the sheer variety of places, buildings and people. Everywhere was different and yet so much recurred. There was a whole family of buildings, both fanciful and mundane, that developed out of the co-operative movement, which began in Rochdale in the 1840s and quickly spread to the whole urban region and far beyond. There were the dozen or so libraries scattered around the region that were funded by Andrew Carnegie in the early 20th century (and most of which, thankfully, were still open – proof of a longstanding communal loyalty to these buildings). And there were the cotton mills: towering brick edifices in various states of disrepair that grew out of Manchester’s role in the industrial revolution as the global centre of cotton production. While many of these mills have now been demolished, hundreds still remain standing as testament to the industry that once united this enormous urban region and gave it a distinct working-class identity.For me though, it was the more mundane things that brought a sense of unity to Greater Manchester: the electricity substations, often built in a housing style, that told you which borough you were in the hundreds of Victorian terraces that still make up the majority of the region’s housing stock, which manage to be both uniform and endlessly varied in their small details and a gamut of ghost signs that identified lost industries from Manchester’s days as Cottonopolis. And then there were the bees – symbols of civic pride invented by the Victorians that were transformed in the wake of the Manchester Arena bombing into icons of defiance, unity and strength. Countless bee stickers now adorn cars and windows, bee tattoos mark bodies, and bee paintings and murals enliven walls.Chance encounters along the way backed up the commonly held idea that people in the north of England are friendlier on many of my walks, people were keen to point out local landmarks and interesting buildings they’d grown up with. People were generally quick to identify themselves with the larger urban region, explicitly or otherwise. A farmer in Tyldesley spoke of the enormous pipes under his land that brought fresh water from Thirlmere in Cumbria to Manchester a pensioner in Bramhall told me how lucky he felt to be living in Stockport – half a mile away, outside Greater Manchester, he wouldn’t be entitled to free travel on public transport.It is these networks – the hidden infrastructures and invisible boundaries – that are perhaps the most important things that bring unity to a sprawling area. And yet there are still great disparities in Greater Manchester: for instance the woeful Northern Rail network that, for many is the only form of transport available apart from buses.I had not expected to come across architectural wonders outside the centre. So I am aghast that very few guides to Manchester include any detail on buildings such as Rochdale Town Hall, completed in 1871 and to my mind one of the finest Victorian buildings in the country. They also make little mention of the Monastery in Gorton, a monumental edifice completed in 1872 and reopened as a community hub in 2007. It is a gothic rampart that towers over one of the poorest districts of the city. And nowhere did I find reference to the joyous exuberance of many of the region’s mosques, or the astonishing 1930s stained glass that fills the church of St Oswald \u0026amp St Edmund Arrowsmith in Ashton-in-Makerfield.Of course, no single resource can offer an exhaustive visual record of the built environment and there are many types of building that I’ve not covered. My project, The Stones of Manchester, is more of an invitation to see the city anew to connect erse and fragmentary views to embrace the commonplace, often ignored things that make the area feel as though it belongs to us. In cities, it is what continues to endure, be it houses, amenities or infrastructure, that provides an anchor around which communities can flourish. In other words, precisely the opposite of what is currently happening in the heartland of Manchester, where buildings for the rich are disregarding not only the history of the city but also the people that made it.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7632b02e40c5fbe0842864087bf88e474c18b70e/458_0_3332_2000/master/3332.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=589465a1caf5269c6d5191e7a6484a98","title":"suits fruit and scooters 30 years of hanois 36 streets in pictures","story":"William E Crawford was one of the first western photographers to work in postwar north Vietnam.

But how and why do clubs continue to get away with behaviour that should be classed as breaking equality law?People carry these beliefs with them in their day-to-day lives and make choices – from whom they will let into their nightclub to the policies they make – depending on the power and position they hold in our society. So MP Philip Davies saying in parliament this week that black people are “more likely to be murderers” and a West End club charging a black girl double may appear to be unconnected events. But in reality, they are laced together in the wider tapestry of racist stereotypes that masquerade as “objective policies”.And door policies are an obscure place where insidious racism can easily lurk in dark corners. It has not been legal to ban someone from your bar or club because of their race since the 1965 Race Relations Act. But you can refuse someone entry because of say – their outfit – as long as it’s the same rule for everyone. Clubs can use subjective and ambiguous excuses to stop people they deem “undesirable” from coming in. It’s then up to the patrons to prove that the rules are only being applied to them unfairly. This makes it difficult to prove racism is the cause. But Google “nightclub racism” and you’ll find TripAdvisor posts, videos and news articles abound with stories that strongly suggest this is a pervasive problem. Some excuses are not even subtle. A group of NFL players claimed they were turned away from central London club Cirque Le Soir in 2017 for being “too urban”, despite the group having prior reservations. Again, the nightclub denied the allegations.When last year, Trapeze nightclub rejected a planned Grenfell fundraiser because it would play bashment and trap music, they were accused of “passive racism”. The general manager said these genres of music “attract a poor-quality demographic and result in problems”. Bashment and trap music are both associated closely with black people.Some nightclubs clearly see ethnic minority groups as an “undesirable” demographic that are unfairly categorised as a risk to public safety. The disproportionate use of Form 696 on events thought to attract a largely black crowd followed a similar logic – often citing “safety” concerns as the reason events could not go ahead.Yet these same clubs unashamedly use famous black stars to emphasise their “elite” credentials. Drama is proud to cash in on Rihanna and Drake’s passing appearances at the club. I’m sure their music is the soundtrack to every Saturday night at the venue. It is laughable that a nightclub accused of charging black women double for entry and saying: “Eww your kind isn’t allowed in here” to black and Asian patrons, plays “mainly hip-hop and R\u0026ampB”. Black people are desirable as entertainment or decoration, but not as clientele.I rarely go out in the West End because I find the mediocre R\u0026ampB mixes fall flat, and one drink is often the price of two H\u0026ampM T-shirts. But I do not believe it’s a coincidence that I’ve always gone with a group of white people and also never had an issue getting in. I’m glad to see the London Night Czar Amy Lamé will investigate the alleged incident at Drama. But until we see a serious change in public attitudes I don’t see racist door policies coming to an end anytime soon.• Kimberly McIntosh is a policy officer for Race on the Agenda"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a0838453031ab0bd8c50d69324c788b18f34856/131_0_3986_2392/master/3986.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=530aa9f6fa806759ff9326a2ce018b23","title":"new look fast fashion high price low cost","story":"The refrain coming from the “fast fashion” retailer New Look reminds me of that Chumbawamba song from the 1990s. They get knocked down but they get up again (repeat ad infinitum). The brand has gone into a form of insolvency called a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), shuttering 60 stores and losing 980 staff. Its leadership also pinpointed where things all went so horribly wrong. Bewitched by an “edgier, fashion-forward consumer”, it lost sight of its “heartland” (presumably non-edgy, non-fashionable consumer). In the world of fast fashion, providing the wrong product to the wrong consumer and forgetting your roots is a cardinal sin.Of course New Look is not alone. House of Fraser is also pursuing a CVA, Next has had a shocker and H\u0026ampM had to confess to $4.3bn of unsold clothes. This is presumably too much inventory to be dealt with even by the energy-from-waste plant in H\u0026ampM’s home town of Västerås in Sweden that is partly powered by burning fashion waste.Now some rational people might point out that when your system involves needing to burn clothing, your system is sick and you might want to change it. But not fast fashion. As woes emerge, fast-fashion brands are inclined to explain just how tough their mission is. To provide super-cheap, on-trend clothing they must outsource to factories in textile hotspots (such as Bangladesh) that can provide low-cost labour. But these are far away, exposing brands to longer delivery times. Have you all got your tiny violins ready? If they miss the window to sell then they have to be discounted, reducing margin. Meanwhile, we consumers demand the new product in store at least once a week. Otherwise we will flounce out and take our fashion pounds online, snapping up clothing from the likes of Boohoo and Prettylittlethings, heavily endorsed by celebrities. In short, the beleaguered brands seem to be saying that this fast-fashion model is killing them.Um, too bad – they invented it in the first place. The fast-fashion barons have grown rich on this model, despite the margins. They moan about risk, but from the outset it’s been clear who really shoulders it. As I wrote about in my 2011 book, To Die For, the pressure of this model is felt most keenly by the garment workers at the pinch point of production: the cut, make and trim facilities – typically outsourced to hubs such as Dhaka in Bangladesh. At this point the scramble for margin and the lack of investment in standardised facilities combine with the relentless pressure of getting giant orders out for volume retailers in the west. The impact of this is devastating, as we saw with the collapse of the Rana Plaza complex in Dhaka in 2013, when 1,335 garment workers were killed.Toys R Us: 180 stores employing 3,000 staff, collapsed 28 February. Owes £15m in VAT, due by 1 March.Maplin: 200 electronics and gadget stores, founded 1972, also failed on 28 February.Warren Evans:\u0026nbspbedmaker went into administration earlier in February.East: fashion brand with nearly 50 outlets folded in January.Juice Corp: business behind brands including Elizabeth Emanuel and Joe Bloggs went under in January.Multiyork: furniture chain with 50 stores went into administration in November.Feather \u0026amp Black: bedroom furniture and bedding specialist with 25 outlets fell into administration in November.Debenhams, a 178-store chain that is more than 200 years old, is axing one in four of its managers and considering closures to cut costs. It has warned that profits have been hit by lower than expected sales, with profit margins also down as a result of having to cut prices to match rivals.The fact that Rana Plaza did not prompt a moratorium on fast fashion tells you everything you need to know about where the balance of power sits. Brands can still dictate their terms. Even adding safety measures such as fire escapes in host factories must be paid for by increased volume of production.From New Look’s perspective, it has done everything it can to keep the engine going, even bringing some of its production back to the UK in order to turn designs around more quickly. Unfortunately it got its fingers burned when TS Knitwear (the Leicester factory with which New Look placed an order) was discovered by a Channel 4 documentary team working for Dispatches to be subcontracting to a supplier that paid garment workers in the UK £3 an hour. New Look said it had no knowledge of this.But we know that ethical scandals don’t really hit sales, so why did it go so wrong? The financial press points to an accounting scandal at South African retail giant Steinhoff, owned by Christo Wiese, who bought the brand in 2015 (he stepped down as a New Look director last month). It seems that the complex financial underpinning of the deal has unravelled.But there is also the possibility (never entertained by the industry) that consumers have consumption fatigue. More than 100bn new garments a year are now thrust on to the global market. Many are designed and made so that they are quasi-disposable, treated very much as a perishable product. Increasingly they are interchangeable.New Look’s new narrative doesn’t entertain this sort of chat. Instead it contains the traditional bounce-back ingredients: parachuting in a former executive who used to run the brand in the heady days when it was the UK’s number 2 retailer and trumpeting clothes under £20. All, the brand says, in the service of long-term profitability.Herein lies the problem. Fast fashion is built to maximise profit for a select few, and churn out a huge volume of cheap clothing. Its vision, characteristics and need to expand and conquer means there is no long term.• Lucy Siegle is a journalist who writes about ethical living"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7b9b9b4eb15320a58b5f20cd5ffca2b58a95d78/0_461_2306_1383/master/2306.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d258c2405f36fb20bf560e62742a5466","title":"the guardian view on albert einstein free thinking and hidebound attitudes","story":"Albert Einstein’s humanitarian reputation almost matches his scientific stature. From the 1930s onwards he vigorously denounced racism, “a disease of white people”, once observing that “being a Jew myself, perhaps I can understand and empathise with how black people feel as victims of discrimination”. So it is especially shocking to learn of racist and misogynist comments that he made while travelling in Asia in the 1920s. In his newly published diaries from the period, he describes the Chinese as “industrious, filthy, obtuse” and “a peculiar herd-like nation”. Though he praises their modesty and gentleness, he also echoes contemporary warnings that they posed a demographic threat: “It would be a pity if these Chinese supplant all other races. For the likes of us the mere thought is unspeakably dreary.”How could a figure renowned for his empathy and wisdom have written such passages? The answer “seems very relevant in today’s world, in which the hatred of the Other is so rampant in so many places … It seems even Einstein sometimes had a very hard time recognising himself in the face of the other,” the\u0026nbspdiaries’ editor notes.Such views were prevalent at the time – but far from universal.

Two Leicestershire women have set out to change thatGrowing up in Pakistan, Nafeesa Katib remembers watching cricket with her siblings on a TV hired at the weekend as a treat. It wasn’t a viewing choice at the time – it was the only thing being broadcast – but she remembers it fondly. “Even if we didn’t like cricket we had to watch it, and in the end all of us fell in love with the game,” she says. She remembers thinking: “Where are all the women on the cricket field?” That thought stuck with her after she moved to the UK as a teenager. Now 41, and living in Leicestershire with her husband and two children of her own, she is helping to redress that imbalance, in her role as a cricket coach for girls aged eight to 14. Her hope is to be a role model to all the girls who attend her sessions – but also to show, as a visibly Muslim woman playing and teaching cricket, that a headscarf need not stop anyone playing sport. “If you’ve got somebody who inspires you, who shows you, yes, I can do it, it’s a great feeling. And that’s what I try do,” says Katib.Women’s cricket has never been more popular in the UK – 2017 was a landmark year, as millions watched the England team triumph in the Women’s Cricket World Cup in front of a sold-out crowd at Lord’s. In the wake of that result, the cricket governing board said it was committed to getting more south Asian women involved in the game.One reason is the lack of appropriate coaching and facilities. In Oadby, where Katib lives, there were no organised sporting activities for her nine-year-old daughter on a Saturday morning – until cricket came along. “Most of the things are aimed at boys, like the football clubs for example,” says Katib. “There were some crafty things for girls, but not all girls are into arts and crafts.”Her friend and fellow coach Mai Kazi emphasises that the scheduling of sports sessions can be an issue, particularly for kids who come from a Muslim background. “Most of the Muslim kids in the area go to Islamic school between 4pm and 6pm, and that’s when most of the clubs are held,” says Kazi. But a Saturday morning works perfectly for her and her 13-year-old daughter, and the sessions are something they now do together. The coaches have worked hard to create a safe environment for girls from all backgrounds, who might be feeling apprehensive about throwing themselves into the game.“There are a few girls who wear headscarves,” says Katib. “The first time they came they were very nervous and really worried about them, with one hand touching their head at all times. But over time I’ve been able to give them a bit of confidence. At the end of the day, it’s all girls there.”Although having women run the sessions has boosted participation from the local Muslim and south Asian community, it’s the sight of two familiar faces that encourages parents to keep bringing their kids back. “A lot of the mums that drop their girls off know us from school,” says Kazi. “We live in a very small borough, so it’s the kind of place where everyone knows each other. There is obviously the sense of: ‘Oh, this is run by someone we know.’”She believes that community feeling is essential to the project’s success: “The fact it’s very local has really appealed to people – otherwise, they’d have to travel to Leicester, which isn’t always possible.”Katib has just completed her level two coaching certificate and hopes, one day, to run her own club. But the key thing for her is to keep showing her daughter there’s no such thing as a sport girls can’t do.“I’ve never wanted my daughter to think that certain things are only for girls, and that certain things are only for boys,” she says. “There shouldn’t be any limitations for anything.” In 2017 one of the key elements of Natwest’s partnership with the ECB was to help raise funding to open up even more opportunities for young people, both male and female, to enjoy cricket. This will continue in 2018.As a erse and inclusive sport, cricket truly has no boundaries, and NatWest think that’s worth protecting. That’s why they’ve supported it since 1981. NatWest are proud to be the principal partner of the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) and the official partners of Chance to Shine, reflecting the bank’s own values and commitment to fairness and inclusion.To find out more, visit Natwest Cricket"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/24ee956a67a95bcf6ef54eb18f7f73ab5d2ed68a/0_0_5744_3447/master/5744.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3e4ee9216fe196f73876ab94eb865d5","title":"five simple dos and five definite donts for budding entrepreneurs","story":"Struggling to sift through the cliched self-help quotes and business jargon for something constructive?

They now sell sauces globally.“Everyone loves a good story, don’t they,” says Sahota. “It’s something customers can relate to but also, in our case, it helped us stand out with retailers who we wanted to stock our products.” To highlight the backstory, Sahota cast his father in a series of online comedy music videos to promote the brand.Don’t think all advice is good adviceIf launching a business or a product is like having a baby, entrepreneurs face a similar barrage of well-meaning, often contradictory advice from family, friends and a million business books. “Sarah Wood, the co-founder of the video ad tech company Unruly, once said the best piece of advice she ever got was that advice itself was overrated,” says startups’s Shane Donnelly.Sahota hates the kind of motivational self-help quotes that flood Instagram – “An investment in yourself pays the best interest” and all that sort of thing. “It starts off really well intentioned but it can really get on top of you after a while, so I ignore it all now,” he says.Do ask for experience not advice“A lot of advice is regret in disguise,” Bailey says. “Everyone’s got an experience, but rather than ask for advice, I often recommend asking for that experience.” In other words, not so much “what would you do?” but “what did you do?” – then make your own decision.“The worst advice I got was when I called this big wholesaler in east London and he said: ‘My biggest piece of advice for you is just quit, this is really hard’”, Sahota recalls. “And then he goes: ‘I’ll take a pallet off you if you want.’ And I remember thinking: ‘You told me to quit but you also want a pallet of my sauces? I’ll show you.’”Don’t stick with a product beyond its sell by dateBuilding a product around yourself only enhances your emotional attachment to your baby, but attachment parenting can be bad when things get tricky. “Where people come unstuck is they fall in love with their first creation and stay with it even when the evidence is against it,” says Bailey.“Holding a sentimental attachment to elements that just aren’t working will do your startup no long-term favours,” Donnelly adds.Do go back to the beginningIf sales or interest in your product aren’t what you had hoped, Bailey suggests going back to page one of your story. “Remember what it was that first motivated you,” he says. “What problem were you trying to solve? You have to be open to trying 10 or 20 different solutions and seeing what works.”For Sahota, the first element was working – his sauces were popular and central to his story – but to satisfy investors and progress as a business, he knew the answer was to make his crisps work. “And we should have made that move a lot sooner,” he says. “But I felt like I couldn’t look beyond the sauces unless I was dead.”Don’t look like an amateurIt doesn’t matter how good your story is if you come up short when talk turns serious. “You’ve got to have that nice soft exterior to connect but when you sit down with the supermarket or an investor, they have to know you mean business,” says Sahota. “You need to be able to say: ‘When you put my product on your shelves, I’ll drive customers in to your store because I’ve got followers who want it and I will add value to the category.’ That is hugely important for retailers.”Do ask the right questionsCustomer research is vital for any new business. “But people always ask their customers: ‘Would you use this product that does this cool thing,’” says Bailey. “But that’s a leading question. They’ll say: ‘Yes’ – and that looks like validation. But you should be asking about experience and behaviour.”Knowing how someone lives will help you to see how your product fits into people’s lives.To do this, Bailey suggests directing people to a landing page on your website and setting up a waiting list long before you launch anything, and then having a conversation with those people on the waiting list. “Even if you just get 10 people, that also means they feel the problem you’re trying to solve. And if nobody signs up, that tells you something, too.”Don’t fall into bad habitsKnowing how to structure each day – and what to do – can be tough for a solo starter, particularly one who has come out of an office environment. “You need to create really good habits straight away,” Sahota says. “There’ll be days when it’s really hard and those habits will get you through even if you’ve run out of willpower or motivation.” The sauce entrepreneur sets himself daily goals. “It could be something really simple like sending one really good email to a potential lead and following it with a phone call. On some days it’s good to set your goals low so you feel like you’ve achieved something.”Do take care of number one“Basically, get enough sleep and you’re halfway there,” Bailey says. “I used to work for a big consultancy, working all hours and travelling, and I hated the lifestyle. When I started my first business I was like: ‘I’m going to take my work-life balance seriously.’ Nonetheless, two years later, an investor turns to me during a crisis and says: ‘Dave, here’s what you’re going to do. You’re going to take a holiday for a week and come back to this fresh.’ It was what I needed.”Now you’re well versed in the major dos and don’ts, it’s time to get down to business.

The email also said the waste of food involved added to the stress of people sleeping rough in the city, whose number has doubled in the last year.It also implied, however, that the goodwill of students was a contributory factor in the increase. “Oxford’s students have a highly developed social conscience, as is evident from the number of homeless people who come to seek assistance in this city. Needless waste of food is an aggravation of their distress,” it said.“This is unlikely to have a positive effect on applications from underprivileged minorities,” it said.Students flagged up the email on social media to express their incredulity at the suggestion that homeless people were drawn to the city because of the generosity of students.Defending the email in Cherwell, the Oxford student newspaper, Edwards said: “The fact that homeless people come to Oxford from elsewhere is clearly acknowledged. This is a credit to the city’s excellent facilities, but also, we believe, to the generosity of students, townsfolk and tourists.”The university played down the comments, insisting the email was primarily aimed at curbing trashing. A statement said: “The overall intention of the proctors was to appeal to the social and environmental consciences of Oxford students, urging them to consider the impact of the waste and inconvenience caused by trashing.”Jane Cranston, a former high sheriff of Oxfordshire who now chairs an inquiry into rough sleeping in the city, said the proctors were right to highlight the well-developed social conscience of students, but added: “To suggest that homeless people are attracted to Oxford because of it is a more questionable statement. Oxford has a reputation as a ‘safe’ city for homeless people and many people, including the city council, the county council, many charities, the churches, students and members of the public contribute a great deal of time, care and professionalism to tackling this distressing social problem.”Alex Kumar, the chair of Oxford student union’s homelessness campaign, accused the university of trying to “cynically weaponise Oxford’s homelessness crisis as an attack on students”.He added: “One cannot view the escalating homelessness crisis in this country as detached from the housing crisis – a crisis exaggerated, even driven, by speculation on the housing market and the ownership of property throughout this country increasingly in the hands of few, as demonstrated by recent revelations about the grand scope of property held by the university across this entire country.” Linda Smith, the deputy leader of Oxford city council, said the rise in rough sleeping in the city was driven by government cuts to mental health and substance addiction services. “It is a national problem. We didn’t have this problem on our streets of Oxford 10 years ago,” she said. “Belatedly the government has woken up to this and Oxford was awarded £500,000 last week. “We already fund 167 beds and we will be expanding our provision to fund an extra 64 beds next winter. We want to get to a position where nobody has to sleep rough on the streets of Oxford.”Asked whether rough sleeping was linked to the generosity of students, Smith said: “Everyone is entitled to their opinion. I’m not going to suggest that people should not give to beggars.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d2ae2c7f408a1ececdb9c29b6f0ae0c36f8c9f3/21_71_5059_3036/master/5059.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=30ea9b22aade5fb813b0988404db0176","title":"england 2018 world cup team photo the fashion verdict","story":"From Harry Kane’s hair to John Stones’ coy pose, we rate the Three Lions’ lineup for their Marks \u0026amp Spencer photoshootIt is always curious to see a footballer in a suit, rather than his or her kit.

A navy suit is apolitical, too: Barack Obama preferred blue suits, but so did David Cameron. Black is too funereal. Grey is too matrimonial. They are, it should be said, quite tight, a little too tight perhaps to contain their extraordinary bodies, the hopes and dreams of a nation and various tattoos.Still, it is worth remembering the three-piece has some A-list weight behind it.

That the British retailer is in financial trouble, with 100 stores to close in the next four years, is well-documented, as are claims that it has forgotten who its target customer is. But judging by its autumnwinter 2018 womenswear presentation in London on Tuesday, the potential is there: next season is all about quality, consistency and rediscovering its core customer.“This is heartland M\u0026ampS,” said the company’s style director, Belinda Earl, introducing the new foundation edit she described as “the mainstays of any woman’s working wardrobe”. It includes a city coat, a black blazer, a pair of black trousers and a striped Breton top. The focus at M\u0026ampS this season is to provide beautifully executed staples that women can wear day to night, throughout the year, every year things that, says Earl, “we’re known for and want to be known for even more to build a broader customer base”.There remain seasonal trend items with which to mix and match, such as statement T-shirts, metallic pleated skirts and – something the design team are predicting will be a hit – a buckled kilt that comes in traditional tartan as well as black. There are also several contenders for the “new pink coat”, including a long Prince of Wales check coat, £99 a long shearling-style coat, £99 and (the style that everyone will want) a faux-fur leopard-print teddy-bear coat, £79.However, the emphasis on understanding what M\u0026ampS has historically been really good at – knitwear, outerwear and underwear – is clear and will be what they are hoping bring back to the masses. Trousers come in multiple cuts and colourways, as does knitwear, while tailoring is available in classic heritage patterns and materials. At the presentation, the design team showcased its clothes alongside underwear to show it has approached this collection with a more holistic idea of how women dress – ie choosing what bra and knickers to wear depending on what we want to put on top. Crucially, though, these mainstays won’t be one-season wonders, but will reappear next season and the one after that.“It’s something that we’re very conscious of doing,” said Earl. “When you do find a piece, you tend to want more and we’re looking to build on that. It’s a big reminder to us and the customer that those are the pieces that should be the focus of everyone’s wardrobe.”Earl remains positive. For womenswear, she says, “having a tighter focus does make things clearer”. Meanwhile, she and her team remain intent “on making sure that we give our customers true choice within each of the destination departments and that we are reflecting the trends in ways that fit and flatter”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb158b546f927d0469c3d01fa3870764259e3e4a/0_0_2600_1561/master/2600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35be165723d5d62c2e630e173fcc93a6","title":"the best fathers day gifts for under 50 in pictures","story":"It’s the big day this Sunday from a Muji backpack to a silk tie and a classic pair of socks, here is our guide to stylish gifts that won’t break the bank"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/63f81b0abc1452015f4b7a557737c8412c2c187c/0_196_5995_3597/master/5995.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c67e7e8f457960984ed146641353c6f","title":"oceans 8 review sandra bullock cate blanchett anne hathaway","story":"This Ocean’s Eleven spin-off in which an all-female gang plots a daring daylight robbery soon runs out of steamYou’ve heard of The Sons of Katie Elder.

Except that it’s more a gender-switch on Ocean’s Twelve or Ocean’s Thirteen, those bleary sequels that stumbled their way to the DVD bin of yesterdecade. Maybe getting a woman director would have given it more zip, though the problem is with the script.Sandra Bullock plays Debbie Ocean, sister of Danny, just out on parole. She cheekily contacts her old compadre Lou (a seriously underused Cate Blanchett) to set up the daring robbery she’s been perfecting in her head during five long years in the joint. Debbie has to assemble a crew for this job: to steal a multi-million-dollar diamond necklace from the exquisitely contoured, swan-like neck of superstar Daphne Kluger (Anne Hathaway) as she attends Manhattan’s ultra-elite Met gala. For this they need crooked designer Rose Weil (Helena Bonham Carter) fence Tammy (Sarah Paulson) bling-thief specialist Amita (Mindy Kaling) pickpocket Constance (Awkwafina) and hacker Nine Ball (Rihanna). Ocean’s 8 motors along pretty enjoyably for a while it’s always great to hear Bullock break out her raspingly fluent German, and there are some flavoursome cameos, including Anna Wintour and a subliminal walk-on for Wendi Deng. But Debbie’s smaller-scale mischief – shoplifting and scamming free nights in luxury hotels – is weirdly more enjoyable than the main event. Then the mark introduces a lame third-act twist, more of a stagger, the tension goes slack and it all heads south. Where were the climactic crises and heroic solutions? Where were the big moments where it all goes wrong and then right in unexpected ways? Where were the flashbacks disclosing that we, the audience, have been played? Where, in fact, was the dramatic interest? Nowhere. It just blandly settles on a note of sentimental self-congratulation and unruffled triumph.

Inspired by the miraculous skills of Tsubasa Oozora, the comic books’ eponymous star, Hasebe has been kicking a ball for as long as he can remember.But there were also unique cultural factors behind Hasebe’s boyhood obsession with the game. In a country that has long been more associated with two other sports, baseball and sumo, his home town of Fujieda in Shizuoka Prefecture was highly unusual by Japanese standards due to its extraordinary passion for football instead. Despite Fujieda’s status as a small provincial city with a population of just over 100,000 people, it has produced a succession of renowned players including Hiroshi Nanami and Masashi Nakayama, who both represented Japan at the 1998 World Cup in France.Growing up in such an environment Hasebe – who has starred in the Bundesliga for a decade now – was not rated all that highly before his late teens.Partly thanks to the tutelage of his parents, Hasebe was a diligent schoolboy and, at 15, earned a place at Fujieda Higashi High School. This famous institution accepts only students of strong academic ability, but is also renowned for its highly successful football club who are perennial contenders at the nationally-televised All Japan High School Soccer Tournament each year. At first, Hasebe made little impression within the team and for some time struggled to even make the bench. Team-mates from the time recall that he spent more time during his first year quietly going about chores than actually playing in particular, they say, he had a most steady arm when it came to marking the lines on the pitch. It was only towards the end of his second season at Fujieda Higashi that he finally got his chance to make an impression with a football rather than just white paint. A late growth spurt helped him win a regular starting position and, slowly, the confidence of those around him. Even then, his reputation as a player was still only average at best the future long-serving captain of the Japanese national team was never once seen as a candidate for the armband at his own high school.However, as a third-year, Hasebe would show a dramatic and sustained improvement in his performances as an attacking midfielder. Around the turn of the millennium, major nationwide tournaments at under-18 level were held every summer, autumn, and winter. Hasebe performed superbly at both the summer and autumn tournaments to attract a surge of attention having been a total unknown just months earlier. Soon afterwards, he earned what would be the first of many call-ups to the Japanese age-level national teams. The professional J-League clubs did not ignore these performances and it was Urawa Red Diamonds who pursued Hasebe’s signature most persistently. However, the 18-year-old’s parents remained keen that he should continue his education and argued that he should go to university rather than take the risk of turning professional at his age. Even his high school coach, despite such an upturn in performances, told him again: “There is no way you will make it in the professional leagues”.The only one to offer different advice was another member of Hasebe’s family – his grandfather: “If you’re a man, you take the challenge.” It was his grandfather who had originally bestowed upon him the name Makoto – meaning “honesty” or “integrity” – and he continued to support his beloved grandson’s dreams of playing football for a living by persuading everyone else to put their objections aside. Ultimately, parents and teachers alike would bow to the strength of this ambition and allowed Hasebe to choose his own path. Roughly a year after Hasebe signed his first professional contract, his grandfather fell ill and passed away. To Hasebe, still only 19, this came as a crushing blow but, at the same time, he discovered an ever more indefatigable desire to make a success of his career. Those who witnessed his second season with Urawa described him as a completely different person as a series of spirited performances led to a regular place in the starting XI for the first team. His development continued unabated towards, at last, captaincy material and his status today as one of the greats of Japanese football.If Hasebe manages to score in Russia this summer, it would be no surprise to see him point upwards and shout to the heavens. This goal, of course, would be dedicated to the grandfather who has inspired him throughout everything.Akihiko Kawabata writes for Footballista.

Most of its 22,000 residents work in the mining industry, his first coach lost his hand in a mining accident and the only full-size football pitch is in a terrible condition even in the summer, not to mention the freezing winters.Slightly built and a bit shy but determined and dedicated in the extreme, the midfielder was spotted by CSKA Moscow scouts at the age of 16. Nurtured carefully by the coach Leonid Slutsky, he was promoted to CSKA’s first-team squad in 2015, made exceptional progress and played for the national team at Euro 2016, albeit slightly out of position. By the time of the Confederations Cup in 2017, Golovin was absolutely integral to the side, frequently linked with a move to clubs such as Arsenal and Chelsea. In 2018 he is seen as Russia’s main source of creativity – at the age of 22.If only Russia could tell a few more stories like Golovin’s, they would have been a major force when staging the World Cup on home soil. In a vast country of nearly 145 million people, where football is the most popular sport despite fierce competition from ice hockey, there must be many similar talents waiting to be unearthed. But their chances of catching anyone’s attention are close to zero, while those who do miraculously make it into professional football do not receive the right help to develop.The core of the problem is not financial. A lot of money has been poured into Russian football in recent times, especially since the country was awarded this World Cup in 2010, but it was not spent wisely. Instead of investing in academies, youth coaching and quality training pitches, including indoor facilities, it was wasted on expensive foreigners, agents’ fees and disproportionate salaries. As a result, few Russian players regularly performed at a decent level, while those who did largely lost all motivation to improve because they were spoiled.It is quite curious to compare the current situation to that of the early 1990s, after the Soviet Union broke up. At the time Russian football was in a disastrous state economically and players dreamed of moving to western Europe. The most talented found themselves in the top leagues, such as Igor Shalimov and Igor Kolyvanov in Serie A, Andrei Kanchelskis in the Premier League, Valery Karpin, Aleksandr Mostovoi and Viktor Onopko in La Liga, and Sergei Kiryakov in the Bundesliga. Others went to earn their living in lesser leagues such as Israel. Their places in the Russian league were taken by up-and-coming youngsters and, while the level of football was not that great, they enjoyed a lot of opportunities to develop.Thus the generation of the 2000s grew up witnessing the international success of Russian players and wanted to follow in their footsteps. That is why players including Andrey Arshavin, Aleksandr Kerzhakov, Roman Pavlyuchenko and Pavel Pogrebnyak were desperate to prove their worth outside of Russia. In their era salaries at Zenit St Petersburg and Spartak Moscow were already quite high but that did not stop them. In fact they were ready to earn less in order to play at a better level. Times change, though, and the current generation is different.With names such as Samuel Eto’o, Hulk and Axel Witsel lured to the Russian Premier League at the beginning of the decade, the salaries of homegrown players increased dramatically as well. In order to prevent clubs from fielding only foreigners, the Russian FA imposed a quota on non-Russian players allowed for each game. Consequently the price of the most talented Russians went up even further, the best example being the promising yet unproven striker Aleksandr Kokorin who earned €5m a year at Dynamo Moscow.No club outside of Russia would have paid Kokorin even a third of that, thus there was no chance of him moving abroad. He did not feel the need to improve in the Russian league either, and seemed to concentrate on finding ways to waste his wealth. When reports of Kokorin and his team-mate Pavel Mamaev spending €250,000 on champagne in Monte Carlo after the national team were eliminated from Euro 2016 reached the home, fans easily believed them, even though the duo claimed the numbers were exaggerated.Kokorin and Mamaev are not alone. Alan Dzagoev was considered one of the brightest teenage talents in the world a decade ago but the midfielder chose to stay at CSKA and his development had gradually stalled. Oleg Shatov, also born in 1990, showed remarkable potential in his youth but lost his way completely and was not considered for the World Cup squad. Both were 20 when Russia was awarded the tournament. Ideally they should be world-class stars by now, hoping to lead the national team to glory but, while they are far from blameless themselves, the system contributed to their downfall.A lack of planning is evident in every department of the national team. Take central defence. Everyone knew that Sergei Ignashevich would celebrate his 39th birthday during the World Cup, and the Berezutsky twins would turn 36. Nevertheless, even the limit on foreign players did not help. Apart from CSKA, all the top clubs still used foreign centre-backs and Russia were left without decent successors when the trio of veterans retired from the international game in 2016.Stanislav Cherchesov, the Russia coach, was forced to use the inexperienced Georgi Dzhikiya, the unconvincing converted left-back Fyodor Kudryashov and the error-prone Viktor Vasin, who waited for his chance on the CSKA bench until the age of 28 – but even that emergency plan was ruined when Vasin and Dzhikiya tore knee ligaments earlier this year. Ignashevich has came out of retirement for the World Cup but the fact he is by far the best solution speaks volumes about Russia’s disastrous preparations.The irony is there must be thousands of potentially top-class, physically strong centre-backs in Siberian towns such as Kaltan. The Russian game is just unable to find them, teach them, give them opportunities at the required level and send them out to get some experience in the top leagues. Thus those would-be footballers work in the mines instead, while Iceland – with a population of nearly 340,000 – is expected to have a much better World Cup.The reason is obvious. Iceland were minnows until starting a magnificent long-term project at the beginning of the century, based on training youngsters, promoting youth coaches and building facilities that allow year-round playing. Russia invested their money in buying Hulk and building a white elephant of a stadium in Saransk instead.

Forward to a glut of football over the next few weeks – some of it great, some of it poor, all of it compelling – and back to previous tournaments, acting as they do as signposts in our lives. We remember how they shaped our summers as well as ourselves and, as is the case with most things, the first World Cup tends to mean the most.Italia 90. That was mine. I was nine, a year into my love affair with football and it was the tournament that sealed the deal. Omam-Biyik’s header against Argentina Baggio’s dribble against Czechoslovakia Schillaci’s eyes Rijkaard’s mouth O’Leary’s penalty the warm hue of the television coverage that was like nothing I had seen before ... it was mesmerising. And making that summer of 28 years ago even more glorious, there was England.Oh, England. Young readers may struggle to believe this but there was a time when the national team were less a trigger for regret and cynicism and more a source of pride and hope. More than that they were liked, and no more so than in 1990.Bobby Robson, everyone’s favourite uncle, was in charge and the team was made up of seemingly decent blokes, the type who smell of Old Spice and have normal, proper jobs. Add Paul Gascoigne, that most lovable of rascals, to the mix and it was easy to be intoxicated by “our boys”. World in Motion played endlessly during those long, warm days and it went on all the way to the semi-finals, at which point there were tears before bedtime but also confirmation that, yes, I was an England fan.But it didn’t last. Come France 98 I was utterly indifferent to England’s progress and by Euro 2000 the bond had snapped completely. I laughed when Phil Neville gave away that penalty against Romania, a reaction that confirmed the worst – not only did I no longer care about England, I found their failings utterly hilarious.Several factors explain the change. On a somewhat superficial level, I found it increasingly difficult to get behind players from Manchester United, Chelsea, Everton and elsewhere as my dedication to being a Liverpool supporter hardened during my teenage and early adult years. Wanting the likes of Gary Neville, John Terry and Wayne Rooney to do well felt like an act of treachery rather than loyalty, with all the overblown fuss that surrounded the “golden generation” hardly helping matters. By the mid-noughties England felt like a travelling band of celebrities and no good can, and should, come from that.On a deeper level there was also the fact that as I got older, I felt less English. It’s the fate of many second-generation immigrants and especially those who have seen their mum called a “fucking Paki”, as I did in the 90s. Quite frankly, there’s nothing like a bit of racist abuse hurled at one of your parents in the middle of the street to make a person feel disconnected from the place of their birth and those who live in it.The hooliganism was a problem too, and in that sense Euro 2000 was a real watershed moment. Seeing those boozed-up dunderheads tear through Charleroi before England’s game against Germany made it even clearer that this particular source of national engagement wasn’t for me.All of which was a shame given how much England had meant to me, with Euro 96 the undoubted high point. I’m from Wembley and it felt like the centre of the universe for those few weeks in June. I also went to the Scotland game, saw Gascoigne score that goal and, up to that point, had never felt more deliriously content.The love died but now, slowly but surely, it has returned. Well, sort of. Because as England get comfortable in Russia I find myself willing them to do well. Godspeed Gareth and the boys, to Volgograd and beyond.This is an England setup that is easy to get behind. The manager is thoughtful and upstanding, bringing a primary school headteacher quality to the role (not to mention an actual tactical plan), while most of the players come across as decent lads. Yes there’s Jesse Lingard and his bloody dabs but even he fizzes with a tiggerish energy that is rather endearing.The captain, meanwhile, looks like the type of bloke you’d hire off Checkatrade to paint your spare room and be thoroughly satisfied with his time-keeping as well as work, while the sinister targeting of Raheem Sterling by a certain section of the media has had the effect of turning the player into a figure of sympathy.So England are nice again, unburdened by hype and Baden-Baden narcissism, and that’s no bad thing, especially as Brexit continues to tear a hole through society. Frankly, it’s become exhausting arguing with people over the colour of a passport and now comes a chance for the fighting to pause and for everyone to get behind a single cause.That’s certainly what I intend to do, and while too much has happened since 1990 for me to feel deep affection for England, there’s enough there to work with, enough for me to say I want “us” to do well."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3aadf53027101fbff5be1c8bca3f5f143d27a54/0_0_4469_2955/master/4469.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bafedb0d4cc448053286265a62ee7f8f 700w","title":"perfect stuffed aubergine eggplant  recipe felicity cloake","story":"A classic Provençal recipe to make short and tasty work of the forthcoming glutStuffed marrows reek of wartime privation giant, woolly things made to stand in for everything from meat to bananas, thanks to their overwhelming lack of any discernible flavour. Stuffed courgettes, with their thinner skins and creamy flesh, are a far more attractive prospect, however, and popular throughout southern Europe and the Middle East. The classic Provençal version, stuffed with sunshine itself* is one of my favourites: a simple accompaniment to grilled fish or meat, they make a very satisfying meal in their own right, and the recipe is easily adapted to other Mediterranean veg such as peppers, aubergines – or even our very own marrow, should you be a fan.(*not really – that would burn your tongue)Many recipes call specifically for the round variety, which can be hard to track down in the UK. They’re an easier shape for stuffing, but if you’ve got a glut of long courgettes, they’ll work just as well – after all, if they’re good enough for Michel Roux Jr, who waxes lyrical about his mother-in-law’s extra-large courgettes (“gorged with sun, they really taste like no other”), then they’ll probably do for the rest of us.Fortunately, the middle doesn’t go to waste: every recipe I try incorporates it into the stuffing. You can leave a lid on round courgettes, if you like – they look rather sweet in Bruno Loubet’s recipe from his book Mange Tout – but it will prevent what’s inside from crisping up in the oven, so I prefer to use them in the stuffing as well.While anything fried in olive oil is inevitably delicious, the process does make the courgettes rather soft and greasy, while those put in the oven raw take so long to cook that the stuffing dries out. Best, I think, to parboil them: it’s easier than shallow-frying them, although there’s no need to do so for as long as Médecin recommends: Wells’ five minutes proves quite sufficient.Peyraud is also a controversialist when it comes to filling her courgettes: “I know that most people add chopped meats to the stuffing, but I don’t think meat makes any sense in stuffed vegetables.” I’m inclined to agree: Roux’s minced pork and sausagemeat mixture is very popular with testers, but doesn’t deliver the sunny southern flavours I’m after.That said, Wells’ courgettes, stuffed with a mixture of fresh goat’s cheese and sauteed courgette flesh, seem to lack something – a stuffing needs carbohydrate in some form to be truly satisfying, I think. There are many options breadcrumbs are popular, either soaked in milk or water, and Loubet uses couscous, but our favourite is Médecin’s rice, which keeps its shape better in the oven, giving the finished dish a more interesting, and less stodgy, texture. Undercooking the rice itself will help with this – Médecin’s is rather soft after 20 minutes’ hard boiling and then 45 minutes in the oven – and doing so with other ingredients, including stock, will give it a flavour boost, as well as saving on the washing-up.I also don’t think the filling needs the eggs that he, Peyraud and Roux put in it makes the mix too wet. However, like Olney, I will be adding diced tomatoes, which will help to lubricate proceedings.The ubiquitous onion is a must, as is a generous helping of garlic, though for a less Mediterranean vibe, Roux’s carrots and leeks are also rather nice. Whatever you use, make sure you fry them first to reduce the water content, or you’ll end up with soggy rice.A good handful of salty cheese such as parmesan, pecorino or a hard goat’s variety will add enough richness to render Médecin’s petit salé cured pork unnecessary, although if you happen to have some to hand, it is a pleasant addition, as, I suspect, would be anchovies.Be liberal with the herbs here both courgettes and rice can take it. Médecin uses basil, which I don’t think really stands up to prolonged baking Peyraud and Olney go for parsley but my favourite is Roux’s mint, which supplies a lovely fresh flavour. For a typically French touch, you might also add a pinch of curry powder, as in Wells’ recipe – it’s a, perhaps surprisingly, popular ingredient across the Channel.Pre-cooking the courgettes allows a briefer, hotter bake, which will give the vegetables a better flavour, as well as crisping the breadcrumbs we all so enjoy in Médecin and Peyraud’s recipes. Make sure the courgettes are tender before taking them out of the oven some of the recipes I try drastically underestimate the cooking time in a home oven.If you use meat, deglazing the roasting tin with white wine and stock, as Roux suggests, to make a sauce, is a nice idea, but there’s not much point with a vegetable and rice mixture. A dollop of aïoli, however, would make a very apt accompaniment.Prep 15 minCook 1 hr 30 minServes 4 as a side, 2 as a main4 medium round courgettes or 2 large long ones2 tbsp olive oil, plus a little extra1 onion, peeled and finely chopped2 medium, ripe tomatoes4 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed80g long-grain rice150ml vegetable (or chicken) stock1 large bunch fresh mint50g finely grated parmesanSalt and black pepper2 tbsp dry breadcrumbsBasil, to garnishHeat the oven to 180C350Fgas 4. Cut the tops off the round courgettes, if using, and scoop out the flesh with a grapefruit spoon or melon baller, taking care to leave sturdy walls around the outside if you’ve got long courgettes, cut them in half lengthways and scoop out the flesh in the same way. In either case, roughly chop the flesh, along with the lids of the round kind.Bring a large pan of salted water to a simmer, add the courgettes and blanch for five minutes. In the meantime, prepare a sink full of iced water and, once the courgettes are done, scoop them out of the pan and into the sink to cool down (this will help keep them nice and green).Heat the oil in a wide pan over a medium-low heat, add the onion, and cook until soft and golden. Meanwhile, cut the tomatoes in half, scoop out and discard the watery seeds, then finely chop the flesh. Add to the pan with the courgette flesh and garlic, cook until soft, then stir in the rice, add the stock, bring to a simmer and cook for about 12 minutes, until most of the liquid has evaporated. Meanwhile, pick and roughly chop the mint leaves.Stir the parmesan and mint into the stuffing mix and season to taste. Put the hollowed-out courgettes on a greased baking sheet and ide the filling between them, packing it in well, then cover with foil and bake for 20 minutes.Toss the breadcrumbs in a splash of olive oil, season, sprinkle on top of the courgettes, and bake for a further 15 minutes.

But it wasn’t long before The Royal British Legion answered that question for himNick Fleming had always wanted to be a marine. After joining the service in February 2014, and enduring eight months of gruelling training, he was devastated when his career came to end because of a knee injury. The fact that it happened while on a rugby league pitch, rather than during deployment, added insult to injury. “It was my dream job,” he says. “To have it taken out from under my feet before it even got started was a pretty tough one to take.”The 28-year-old had been posted to Plymouth as part of the Royal Marines’ 42 Commando unit and would spend two years in rehabilitation, undergoing a number of operations to try and repair the damage. Eventually, under his surgeon’s advice, he had to admit defeat and accept that he wouldn’t be able to continue as a Royal Marine . He was medically discharged in October 2017 – only three and a half years after he’d joined the service. “One of the top knee surgeons in the south west said it was time to rethink my career. I potentially could have stayed on as a clerk or in the store, but it’s not really what I joined up to do. So it was decided I’d leave.” For service men and women who leave the forces, adjusting to civilian life can be a challenge. Fleming admits he didn’t really know what he wanted to do after he left the marines. “I had no clear direction,” he says, but decided to move to London to be with his girlfriend. He had come across The Royal British Legion while in rehabilitation, attending the charity’s Battle Back Centre in Lilleshall, which supports sick and injured armed forces personnel. While there, he took part in indoor climbing and golf sessions, and completed a wheelchair basketball coaching qualification. In London, he saw a job advert for an advice and information officer at the Legion’s Pop-In Centre and applied. He now helps others make the same transition as he did, and offers welfare support to the armed forces community as needed. Working in an office has been a real culture change, but he admits he’s found the work really rewarding. “We were able to talk to him, find him accommodation, get him a deposit and kit out the property. We gave him a fresh start and took that worry off him, so he could start getting his life back together.”Many of the charity’s beneficiaries are dealing with mental health issues, often related to their time in the services. Fleming has completed a mental health first aid course with the Legion to help those who come through the centre’s doors. The other common issue is accommodation – particularly in London. Some of the men and women leaving the service won’t have a plan in place for where they’re going to live afterwards and will panic about leaving it to the last minute. The Legion can help with finding somewhere suitable, offering grants for deposits or furnishings, or with filling out benefit forms. Fleming can also signpost beneficiaries to other services, such as counselling and physiotherapy. For him, the most challenging part of his work is learning to deal with the stress and responsibility of other people’s problems. Golf, which he was introduced to at the Battle Back Centre while in rehabilitation, has become an important coping mechanism.“Not only am I coming to terms with losing my career and moving to London, trying to find somewhere to live, all of that stuff, but you’re also picking up other people’s issues, which are constantly going through your mind,” he says. “Golf sounds really boring but if I need to unwind, that’s what I’ll go and do.”To find out more about The Royal British Legion click here "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f92fe50d464ae8550985e133de5780ed8c39062/0_0_3700_2230/master/3700.jpg?w=480\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dab4ec9f0bb219a2f2a8b7d22c4ec266 480w","title":"girls more likely to be bullied than boys english schools survey finds","story":"Government study finds violent bullying down, cyberbullying and social exclusion upGirls are much more likely than boys to be bullied at school, with almost twice as many on the receiving end of cyberbullying and social exclusion by other pupils, according to a government study.The figures from a survey of 10,000 pupils at schools in England in year 11 – children aged 15 or 16 – revealed a decline in reports of bullying overall and particularly in incidents of violent bullying, which mainly affects boys.But girls reported a rise in bullying, with more than one in three telling researchers they had been affected in the previous year, while only about one in four boys said they had been victims of bullying in any form.“While violent forms of bullying have declined significantly, name calling and social exclusion have increased since 2006. The success in reducing violent bullying shows what can be achieved the challenge is to replicate this success across all forms of bullying,” the report concluded.Tom Bennett, an adviser to the DfE on behaviour policies and teacher training, said the overall reduction was to be welcomed but warned that bullying was “an evergreen problem” when students were competing for attention and status.“It’s perhaps unsurprising to see boys as more likely to experience violence, and girls to be the victims of social exclusion,” he said. “The latter is less visible, and the bruises it leaves can be intangible.“The problem this causes is that it means such bullying can fall below the radar, and schools need to be proactive in both creating cultures where students feel safe and valued, and also respond accurately and quickly to allegations.“The complexity of who is the bully and who is the bullied also often makes policing this sphere unbelievably difficult, and the inexorable move of such activities online presents huge challenges to even the most concerned teacher.”The data comes from the third wave of a longitudinal study of young people in England managed by the DfE, with the surveys conducted in 2015 and 2014. The longer-term comparison was with a similar survey taken in 2006.For girls the most common form of bullying was name calling and social exclusion, with both types having increased significantly since 2006. But the rise occurred entirely for girls, with boys reporting no increase in either types of bullying. While one in five girls reported being a victim of social exclusion, fewer than one in 10 boys did.Disabled children and children with special needs also reported much higher incidents of bullying than other pupils. The survey results also showed that pupils who were victims of bullying received lower GCSE results than their peers who hadn’t been bullied, by the equivalent of two grades in one GCSE exam.But the authors of the research said it was “important to note that this simple correlation does not demonstrate causation between bullying and lower GCSE performance there are likely to be many other factors involved”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77c66117ce13c2e4903d2161b5343ab41b371368/200_0_4083_2449/master/4083.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3808558d87bc4daba91acd248f7f1569","title":"christina nielsen le mans 24 hours","story":"Porsche’s selected driver is following in her father’s wake and this weekend will be competing for the third time at La SartheCasual observers of this year’s Le Mans 24 Hours might be forgiven for believing that despite boasting a grid of 60 cars, encompassing 180 drivers, the meeting concerns but two.Inevitably it is Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button who have caused the furore as the two former Formula One world champions attempt to add winning the world’s greatest grand prix d’endurance to their CVs. Yet, as always, this magnificent event is so much more and for Denmark’s Christina Nielsen, racing at Le Mans is almost a family affair.Nielsen is competing for the third time at Circuit de la Sarthe, having already blazed a trail with a hugely successful career. She competes for the Ebimotors team in the GTE-AM class in a Porsche 911 RSR. Porsche are the race’s most successful manufacturer with 19 overall wins and have chosen Nielsen as the first woman with whom they have an official association, with the title of Porsche selected driver.For the 26-year-old it is honour and pleasure. Her father, Lars Erik Nielsen, drove a Porsche in four of his five runs at Le Mans between 2004 and 2008. In 2007 Nielsen attended the race to watch him when she was 15. This time he will be at the track to watch her.Her ambition was rewarded in 2016 when she became the first woman to win the IMSA sportscar championship in the US in the GT Daytona class and remarkably repeated the feat the following year. The class is hugely competitive, as it will be at Le Mans, but the close racing is the attraction for Nielsen.It was Denmark’s Tom Kristensen who really put the race on the map in their home country, becoming the most successful driver at Le Mans with nine wins, but Nielsen too has made her mark and is putting it to good use. She is active in the Danish Women’s Society. “Our common goal in the organisation is to promote equality,” she explains. “So in a sport like racing, where men and women compete equally, to have those results to back me up is really important.”She has the credentials then but others still have lessons to be learned and there is some exasperation already at Le Mans. “I get annoyed when I am in a drivers’ briefing and the race director for the third year in a row continues to say: ‘Gentlemen, gentlemen, gentlemen.’ Instead of ladies and gentlemen, or he could just say ‘drivers’. I picked them up on it for the last two years but this year I didn’t because it didn’t change, so all I can do is go out and do my thing on the race track.”When Nielsen does, she knows she will not be the centre of attention and this week it has been impossible to ignore Alonso and Button. However, another former Porsche driver, Derek Bell, who won four of his five race victories for them, remembered gloriously in his new book, All My Porsche Races, believes the same principles for success apply across the grid when drivers share the car for 24 hours.“You have to work as a team,” says Bell. “You have to have total respect for your team-mates. The important thing was sitting in the car and saying: ‘We can win this bastard.’ And you have confidence your team-mates agree.”Bell drove with the great Jacky Ickx for three of his five wins, a formidable pairing indeed, but good team-mates are only part of the story. The 8.46‑mile La Sarthe circuit has unique demands but drivers must also cope with the volume of traffic and the high closing speeds between classes – all skills Nielsen possesses but ones that Alonso and Button must learn in short order.“They both have enough brains but you have to be able to analyse,” Bell says. “You mustn’t look at every gap and think it is a chance to go past and win. You have to think: ‘Will I benefit, or will it bugger up my lap?’”He is optimistic, however, that both have what it takes to prove themselves at the first attempt on the 24. “Fernando will adapt very quickly as he has been in the car already and Jenson will adapt because he knows what he has to do to win,” he says. “It’s more of a thinking race than F1 or any other.”Nielsen know all this already and brings a professional detachment to the maelstrom around the superstars. “It’s great that they are part of making it a success,” she says. “But once they are behind the wheel they are just like everyone else.”For her it is an event greater than any inidual, no matter their fame. “Le Mans is so much bigger than anything else,” she says. “Every driver leaves with the same feeling: that I hope I can be back here next year – another 364 days and I can’t wait.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/987355bc73e8973c71fc243042caf4b881dc09fc/0_175_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c0bd9f2f0b1fc5604d43a9a3d301cba","title":"england v australia first odi live","story":"23rd over: England 117-3 (Root 34, Morgan 49) Target 215 Agar returns, and Morgan greets him by raising his fifty via cut to the point fence. That’s the runs for the over sorted and more, but England still add three singles, scoring at 5.16 when the required rate is 3.50. “England’s target is 215, yet the field is pretty much the same as it would be were they chasing 415,” tweets Gary Naylor. “That can’t be right can it? Yet all teams seem to do this.”It’s a bit odd, I agree - I guess Australia are looking to get wickets from errors, but there’s just nothing prompting England to make them, 22nd over: England 117-3 (Root 34, Morgan 49) Target 215 Richardson returns and tries a short one, so Morgan tries a hook. But the ball is too close to his body and he misses - there’s an appeal for caught behind, a loud one, and they consider reviewing when the finger remains fisted, but opt not too - correctly, snicko shows. Richardson then tries a slower full toss and Morgan checks his shot, doing well to see it float between fielders and to the fence. A single follows off the final delivery, and this is all very easy for your Englands. 21st over: England 112-3 (Root 34, Morgan 44) Target 215 Stanlake continues - this is his seventh over, so Tim Paine is running out of options. Root slices a single to third man, but in general, England will simply be happy to see him off, I shouldn’t wonder. The over yields just one more single, but Stanlake only has two more left. 21st over: England 110-3 (Root 33, Morgan 43) Target 215 Maxwell has got Morgan out twice in his last 10 innings, but after Root takes a single, Morgan canes him to the fence at backward square via sweep. This is serene stuff from England, so expect a calamity in the next bit. 20th over: England 105-3 (Root 32, Morgan 39) Target 215 And here is young Billy, who was born in 1994 - how d’ya like them apples? he’s not got a slip for now, which seems strange, especially given that there aren’t any catchers in front of the stumps. Root takes a single towards fine leg, and after Morgan ducks under a short one, he toes a wide one through cover and they run two. Then Morgan twists to midwicket, Head fumbles, and they run two more, but did his hand touch the boundary advertising? Apparently not, says the replay, though I’m less convinced. 19th over: England 100-3 (Root 31, Morgan 35) Target 215 Maxi Maxwell joins the attack, and England milk him for four singles and raise their hunnert at the same time. What we’re seeing here is gross competence - for those of us who’ve grown up watching England play limited overs, this cannot be stated enough. It’s time for Stanlake, I’d say. 18th over: England 96-3 (Root 29, Morgan 33) Target 215 Agar slings down a tight one, ceding just two singles, but then Root gets down on one knee, certain where the ball is going, and tickles it over his and the keeper’s head for four. That is very pleasant indeed, and the players stop for drinks - Australia could use a stiff yin. 17th over: England 90-3 (Root 24, Morgan 32) Target 215 Root takes a single to cover and then Tye gives Morgan one on his pads ... and he doesn’t miss out, turning it fine - or is it finely - for four. Next, he drives to cover and Marsh shies, cracking the stumps, but video shows yerman was home and plenty. Ian Ward was just saying that he’d have a gully in for Root to stop him running down to third man so freely, and he does just that for a single, which allows Morgan to pull another four when Tye sends down an absolute debacle of a short one. That’s the 50 partnership and England are making this look easy now. 16th over: England 79-3 (Root 22, Morgan 23) Target 215 Agar continues quietly, which is just what England will be after. Five singles come from this latest over - the required run rate is 4.0 - and this partnership needs breaking if Australia have plans to win this game. 15th over: England 74-3 (Root 19, Morgan 21) Target 215 Root takes a single to point, then Morgan cuts hard and Maxwell, at point, es for it. He gets a hand, perhaps on the bounce, so that was probably a decent parry rather than a dropped catch. Root then bumps into the covers and they run two - he is batting perfectly for the situation. A wide then follows as Tye rolls his fingers over one - Root’s gloves weren’t far from that - and he eases down to third man for a single from the extra ball.14th over: England 68-3 (Root 15, Morgan 20) Target 215 Time for some spin, or at least some slow bowling - Ashton Agar has the ball. “No slip - you’d think he’d have a slip wouldn’t you, Stuart,” guffaws Nasser. Straight away, Morgan goes with the reverse sweep, imparting a decent knuck, but picking out the man at backward square. Four more dots follow, but Paine moves the man on the fence finer to combat the move, only for Morgan to get four through the self-same manoeuvre. Australia are back in the need a wicket zone. 13th over: England 64-3 (Root 15, Morgan 16) Target 215 Tye is into the attack and Morgan gets a single driving him to cover - no knuckleball yet. Then Root dabs a single into the off side, sets off, and Maxwell can’t gather! If he had, the shy was on, and he admonishes his oversight with suitable, er, banter. Three off the over, and the required rate is 4.08. 12th over: England 61-3 (Root 14, Morgan 14) Target 215 A single to Root, and then Stanlake serves Morgan one on his toes, so he leaps to ert it to the fence at midwicket. Then, with the final delivery of the over, Root misses his turn to leg and has a moment, the ball hitting his midriff and just passing leg stump. “Is it too early to say.... ‘and this situation is tailor-made for Moeen’,” asks David Watson. It’s never too early, I can’t wait for him to hole out with 3 runs needed off 7.3 overs. 11th over: England 55-3 (Root 13, Morgan 9) Target 215 Now Richardson appears at the opposite end to which he started from and Root capitalises immediately, driving through cover for four. The field is 7-2 off side, I think, the plan to get Morgan driving, but the way the score is, he can let the wide ones go by and does. Then, a ball he can pull, down to fine leg for one, and Root then adds a further single to cover. 10th over: England 48-3 (Root 7, Morgan 8) Target 215 Tim Paine brings back Stanlake searching for another wicket, though only allows him one slip. This might just be the decisive passage of the game, because is he can’t breakthrough, by the time this spell is over Root and Morgan will both be in. Anyway, he sends down a decent over, the final one of the powerplay, which yields just a single to Root, until Paine puts in a leg gully, encouraging him to attack Morgan’s ribs, only he offers width and the ball is duly eases to the fence round about backward point. 9th over: England 44-3 (Root 6, Morgan 4) Target 215 England can just knock this around and win - what are the chances of a magic ball from this Australia attack? I know what you’re thinking, brand, style, brand, brand, cricket brand of, and yoiu’re right, I’m an anachronism. After four dots, Root flicks one off his pads that looks destined for the fence, but Stanlake gets down really well to field. In commentary, Broad observes that Australia’s field is quite defensive, which I find slightly odd with these two busy types at the wicket, but I’m sure I’m missing the point. 8th over: England 42-3 (Root 5, Morgan 4) Target 215 So can Richardson maintain pressure ... not quite yet. A half-tracker that’s every bit as bad as his loosener allows Morgan to pull hard, and he gets fo to fine leg. And they’ve got it! Bairstow connects beautifully with a pull - he’s almost hit it too well,” says SJ Broad in commentary - except he picks out the man at square leg and he’s as furious with himself as he deserves to be. There was not the slightest need for him to play that shot, but he did. We have waselves a ball-game! 7th over: England 38-2 (Bairstow 28, Root 5) Target 215 Neser returns from the other end and Root gets off the mark with a single to midwicket. Bairstow then fiddles one more before, off the final delivery of the over, Root flicks four down the ground to long on. That was mortifyingly competent, and Australia are getting towards need a wicket territory. 6th over: England 33-2 (Bairstow 27, Root 0) Target 215 Richardson replaces Neser and his loosener is short, wide and slow, so Bairstow creams it through backward point for four. He responds with four dots, but then finds a bit of extra bounce that’s meant to bother Bairstow and with good reason ... but he simply gets up on his toes, channels his weight through the line of ball, and sends four hurtling through cover. That is a delicious shot. 5th over: England 24-2 (Bairstow 19, Root 0) Target 215 Stanlake’s natural length is suited to this pitch – ok, Sangakkara told me that - because the ball skids on without bouncing much. Bairstow edges a single off his third ball, which is the only run from the over. 4th over: England 23-2 (Bairstow 18, Root 0) Target 215 So Australia have their start. The thing is, this is a very Joe Root occasion: no one is better at keeping the score moving without taking undue risks, and 215 to win requires exactly that. But Neser sees things differently, sending down a jaffa first up that whizzes past the outside edge. Another wicket maiden.  “Re Lehmann on Broad,” emails Geraint Rodgers, “What is also forgotten when the Aussies try and justify the abuse that was directed Broad’s way is that he didn’t edge it to first slip. He feathered it to the keeper but Haddin was so immobile by then he kneed it into the slips. This became ‘Broad refused to walk despite thick edging it to slip and therefore deserves everything he gets’ but that simply isn’t true.”That whole thing was a lot. He could’ve walked, he didn’t, move on - it’s only a game, grow up. Interesting! Neser goes full and straight and Hales looks to turn him away but misses the line of the ball - by quite some way, it must be said. He’s caught on crease and pad, up goes the finger, and that’s Neser’s first wicket in international cricket so well done him - it’s an amazing feeling, take it from me. 3rd over: England 23-1 (Bairstow 18, Hales 5) Target 215 Hales sees Stanlake trying a short one outside off, so he fetches it and deposits it over midwicket for four. He looks in nice touch and drives hard towards cover for one, then Bairstow crumps four to cover point – it’s so easy for him at the moment – and then another delicious ball-bat sound, the planet racing through cover to the fence. 2nd over: England 10-1 (Bairstow 10, Hales 0) Target 215 Neser will open from the other end, bowling to two slips, and Bairstow dabs his first ball around the corner to backward square leg - they run two. Then, after a dot, Neser offers width and Bairstow guzzles it greedily, cutting hard for four, “When you’re in form, you don’t see fielders you see gaps,” says Sanga, also explaining that there’s just a feeling of body and mind being in tune. Bairstow quickly backs him up by outside for four more. He is really good at the commentary lark - who’d have guessed - and is talking about staggering slips when protecting a low total to attack without sacrificing the area in front of the wicket. I wish I could record everything he’s saying and tattoo it on my eyeballs. “Can you imagine the conversations that would go on with HR if professional sports people started raising grievances on the grounds they were being subjected to unacceptable verbal abuse by other professionals and members of the public in the course of their day-to-day working activities?” asks Phil Russell. “Can’t imagine a meeting at a competitor company where halfway through the discussions my opposite number started calling me a **** and everyone thinking it was just business as usual. Mind you I don’t work in journalism either so I may be insulated from all this.”And you’ve definitely never worked in a City law firm. 1st over: England 0-1 (Bairstow 0, Hales 0) Target 215 Stanlake is already up at 90mph, and completes a wicket maiden. “It isn’t that hard,” tweets Gary Naylor on the sledging thing. “In every other working environment, it’s not 1975. If you bully people in the workplace, you get disciplined and, ultimately, dismissed. And employers run training programmes to educate staff and root it out. Sledging  banter  bullying.”I don’t think it’s as clear as that. Sport has an edge, and in most workplaces you don’t have one person hurling a hard object at another. I don’t see the problem with a bit of patter I do see the problem with being an expletive expletive. Have a look! Stanlake is on the money immediately, his first ball pushing Roy back. And his second is even better, nipping back and spiriting through yerman’s defences like a knife through a tortured metaphor. What a start! Billy Stanlake has the nutcherryrocksphereglobe. Yeah, you’ve not played the game, so advise yourself. Right then, out come the fielders. They’ll have to go some to resolve this...The more I think about this, the easier I think it must be to know what you can and can’t say out there in the middle. Yeah, some things might get said by mistake in the heat of it all, but in general it isn’t that difficult. Langer says his team will continue to sledge, and he sledges his young daughter when playing cards. He says perhaps they’ll call it banter instead, but it doesn’t matter that much what they call it does it? Just don’t insult people’s families, and be done with it. Langer literally claims that when he was playing, people didn’t like Australia just because they were good. He really did! He then says when he heard about the ball-tampering, he “nearly died”. In Australia, he says, they’re brought up to play fair, and Hayden and Symonds played hard cricket. I don’t know, really I don’t, but I will say that in my opinion the fuss over what Smith, Bancroft and Warner did was way out of proportion to what Smith, Bancroft and Warner actually did, and I found it hard not to see what happened subsequently as motivated, in significant part, by concerns for the image of CA. Nasser is interviewing Tim Paine, who says before he took over, their “behaviours” gradually got worse. It’s kind of odd, this – Justin Langer is sat on his shoulder smiling awkwardly like some kind of boss-parrot. I’m looking forward to seeing how Billy Stanlake goes. Australia will need wickets – early ones and several of them. They’ll be looking to him to supply some. Kumar Sangakkara is unfathomably cool, as cool as a man with dub-Ks has every right to be. He is wearing white throuser! I know! My kingdom* for those shorts. “Scotland are better than Australia,” tweets Gary Naylor. “Not at football.” Ear, are you sure? “Way too much international cricket,” emails Mike Marlowe. “All it is doing is tainting the product and the touring teams lose their mystique and watchability as they tour too often. All about the money.”It’s not just the volume, though that is a thing, but what the point of it all is. I’ve no idea what anyone hopes to gain from this series beyond money, and that needn’t be so - some sort of league would at least give us some “context”. Or maybe Australia will come roaring back. The thing is, England would fancy themselves to chase 215 in a game of T20, T100, T3π5.72 – or whatever bazzing ruse the ECB are now busy preparing. It’s inconceivable that England won’t win from here, isn’t it? Afternoon all. So, One Thing We Learnt: Scotland are better than Australia. That’s how these things work, yeah? Not very good. Australia never really got going. So many starts early on, but early introduction of spin of England made a dent that the visitors were never able to recover from. Maxwell’s half-century, in a useful stand with Agar for the sixth wicket, ensured that Australia went beyond 200 but only just. Moeen and Rashid, with five between them, were the pick of the bowlers along with Plunkett who took three after coming on late to finish the job. Right, that’s me for tonight as I race to the TMS box to talk all things Australiasandpaper. Thanks for your company this afternoon. I’ll leave you with Daniel Harris. Bye!Ooooh. Plunkett whacks Tye on the front of the helmet. He’s okay but the support staff race out to make sure. It was via a top edge, watching the replay. But what a response - Tye pops him (nearly) out of the ground! By faaaar the biggest hit of the day. Just on a length he had the room to swing his arms and made wonderful contact into the new Peter May Stand. Every little bit helps at this stage. Unfortunately, though, the show is over when he nicks the last ball of the over. And that’s it! Australia dismissed three overs short of batting the full 50 overs. 47th over: Australia 214 (Stanlake 0 not out) 46th over: Australia 208-9 (Tye 13, Stanlake 0) A couple of fast yorkers from Wood to the no. 11 Stanlake but he is able to keep them out. Big Billy (I’m legally bound to call him that) isn’t known for his work with the bat. Richardson picks out Joe Root at mid-off. Tried to go long - and made decent contact - but the elevation wasn’t quite there. Not his fault Australia are in strife. Quite an elaborate wicket celebration from Wood and Root. I look forward to a replay of it in GIF form. A chesthip bump, of sorts. 45th over: Australia 207-8 (Tye 12, Richardson 1) Plunkett knows the drill bowling at the tail, at the stumps or the helmet. Hard to believe he played his first ODI against Australia all the way back in 2006-07. Indeed, that was the series where he raced through the Australian top order at Sydney with a fine spell of outswing bowling. Always felt he should have played more for England in all formats. No matter, he’s a mainstay of this side now with a World Cup to win this time next year if all goes to plan for the hosts. Just the one single from the over. Five left, if they make it to the finish line.44th over: Australia 206-8 (Tye 11, Richardson 1) Richardson does well to push one to midwicket. Tye tries to go long down the ground again but instead gets a top edge over the wicketkeeper for a couple. Slaps another, powerfully, to long-off. Richardson swings hard to the last ball but there is no contact. That’s the leggie done, finishing with 236 with the wickets of Stoinis and Agar to his name. Bowled. 43rd over: Australia 201-8 (Tye 8, Richardson 0) Tye once again straight back over the bowlers’ head! His eight runs so far have come from two very nice cricket shots. Give the strike to him, I think, Richo. Australia’s 200 up with the stroke. Plunkett, understandably, goes upstairs with a bumper in reply. Tye can’t get the last delivery away, meaning the number ten will have to face the music to start the final Rashid over.Neser attempts to whack Plunkett across the line but the top edge only goes as far as Root at mid-off on the edge of the fielding circle. Maybe a slight change of pace to bring on the error. We aren’t far away from this being over. 42nd over: Australia 197-7 (Neser 6, Tye 4) AJ Tye is the new man and smacks Rashid back over his head, one bounce four. That’ll do! It is the first boundary off his excellent bowling today. Tye misses the wrong’un, prompting an appeal, but it is turned down. Four runs and the wicket from the successful set. Oh yes, that’s out. Agar trying to slog sweep the first ball of Rashid’s new over but doesn’t make contact. The left-hander is struck on the back pad right dead in front. He’s so very out that a review isn’t seriously considered despite the fact that he’s the last recognised batsman.

Kevin Rushby shares some of his favourite city parks, heaths, wetlands and gardens The only British city to ever win the European Green Capital award (for 2015), Bristol is an urban park-lover’s paradise. Close to the centre is Castle Park, a garden with ruins that is linked across the river by the elegant Castle footbridge. There’s a good five-mile walk to be had along the river, linking gardens and the docks, including Brandon Hill Park. Climb the 30-metre-tall (105ft) Cabot Tower for a fine city view. Scattered all around the city are some great parks worthy of cycle adventures. To the south there is Victoria Park, presided over by the colourful terraced houses of St Luke’s Crescent. Nearby, a real gem is Arnos Vale Victorian cemetery, 18 hectares (45 acres) of greenery where, with luck, you can spot woodpeckers, deer and even slow worms basking on tombstones.Arriving at Glasgow Central, you might be forgiven for wondering where all the green spaces might be, given the extent to which the city’s formidable architecture dominates. Dotted around, however, are some magnificent spots: a top place to go is Kelvingrove, a park with everything for a day out – cafes (try An Clachan), a brilliant museum, monuments, and fountains (the Stewart is a good meeting point). Heading east, check out the Necropolis, last resting place of Victorian grandees. Southwards, the gem is Pollok country park, a lovely day out, even though the unparalleled Burrell Collection is currently closed (till 2020). In the west are the Botanic Gardens, with their fascinating hothouse collection.Given London property prices, you might reasonably expect the city’s green spaces to shrink, not grow. But there have been recent additions, notably Walthamstow Wetlands, a huge area of lakes with 13 miles of trails just a few minutes’ walk from Tottenham Hale station. There is great birdwatching, fishing, cycling and a decent cafe, the Engine House. Also new are the Woodberry Wetlands, a green space that had existed since 1833, but only opened to the public in 2013. Right beside Finsbury Park, it is a good inner-city birding site: you can spot red kites and even marsh harriers. Not exactly new, but renewed, is Burgess Park off the Old Kent Road in Southwark, which recently had an £8m facelift, introducing a bigger lake, new bridge and play areas. Downriver from Greenwich, there are fascinating brownfield parks.The Black Country, if you didn’t know, is actually green: Birmingham has hundreds of parks, many of them vast. Kingfisher country park, for example, runs for 11km along the river Cole, while Cannon Hill Park covers around 100 hectares (250 acres). Within that space you have lakes, tennis, golf, playgrounds, running trails and tearooms – this place really can do a full family day out. If you believe that any great park must be in search of a stately home, then try Aston Park – it has a magnificent Jacobean palace. All the above, however, are dwarfed by Sutton Park, a 970-hectare (2,400-acre) national nature reserve six miles north of the centre, which boasts 22 species of butterfly, plus a few rarities. Look out for the startling Camberwell Beauty – unseen since 1996.Holyrood Park certainly has the size (263 hectares650 acres) and the eye-catching eminence of Arthur’s Seat, but this former royal hunting park also leads through to the less well-known Dr Neil’s Garden, a lovely area created by two local GPs who used caravan holidays in Europe as plant-hunting expeditions. Other off-the-beaten track green spaces in Edinburgh include the Archivists’ Garden, one of several small city gardens tucked away from the busy streets. Also check out Dunbar’s Close, a 17th-century garden, and the roof garden at the National Museum of Scotland. About a mile north from the centre is Inverleith Park, which neighbours the magnificent Royal Botanic Garden.Few cities can boast a green space like Cardiff’s Bute Park, a vast expanse of woodland, grass, trails and playgrounds close to the city centre. Its true magic, however, is that it connects, all along the banks of the river Taff, to several other parks: across the Millennium footbridge check out Sophia Gardens – home to Glamorgan Cricket Club, plus cycle hire, horse-riding centre and cafes – then various meadows, parks and gardens all the way north to the M4. Forest Farm country park is worth a visit: the footpath along the old Glamorganshire canal is rich in birdlife, including kingfishers. Also right in the heart of the city is another, much smaller, green space: the Victorian roof garden on top of the Bute Tower in Cardiff Castle.Green may not be the first colour that pops into your mind when thinking of Liverpool, but the city is blessed with great parks. Stanley Park, a classic Victorian creation, separates the Reds and the Blues – the two football grounds of Anfield and Goodison Park. There’s a good cafe in the Isla Gladstone conservatory, plus fishing lake, playground and a red sandstone wall that inspired the Redwall series of children’s books by Brian Jacques. On the other side of the city, check out Sefton Park and Calderstones. From the latter you could walk the mile to another green space: St Peter’s church, Woolton, scene of arguably the most important musical moment in the 20th century: the first public performance by Lennon and McCartney. Also in this quiet churchyard is the gravestone that inspired the Beatles’ Eleanor Rigby."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f9afeea7cc64ae6699702782b6941394b0f4f2f/0_170_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e0c46586d4bb661aed7e40574a539ed6","title":"daphne caruana galizia top eu official flies to malta","story":"Top EU official flies to Malta as authorities accused of seeking to delay attempts to find those behind journalist’s killingThe EU’s top justice official is to fly to Malta this week to meet officers investigating the murder of Daphne Caruana Galizia after a report accused the authorities of seeking to delay and stall attempts to find those who wanted the journalist dead.Věra Jourová, the commissioner for justice, is to seek assurances and ask “difficult questions” about the criminal investigation, which has been criticised by members of the European parliament.A report from MEPs, on an “ad hoc mission” led by the German MEP Sven Giegold, has highlighted a series of concerns about the investigation, warning that the hunt for the journalist’s killers appears to be in jeopardy. Caruana Galizia’s son, Matthew, tweeted on Wednesday in response to the findings: “This is outrageous.”Jourová, the Czech Republic’s representative in the commission, told the : “The issues in Malta go beyond this island, they concern the whole of the EU. My role, as a European justice commissioner, is to sometimes ask difficult and honest questions, especially on the issues that affect all of us.“The commission expects an independent and thorough investigation to uncover who is really responsible for Daphne’s murder, we want the full truth. There is no place in the EU for the murder of journalists.”The delegation of MEPs have warned in their report that the magistrate in charge of the investigation is being promoted and moved off the case, in a development that could slow down its progress. They claim police are not following leads to discover the identity of those who ordered the car bombing that killed Caruana Galizia in 2017.It is further claimed by the three MEPs sent to Malta on behalf of the parliament’s political groups that officers have failed to “fully investigate” the witnesses who claim they saw Malta’s minister of economy, Chris Cardona, drinking with one of three suspects being held on suspicion of detonating the bomb.Cardona and his aide Joseph Gerada were suing Caruana Galizia for defamation over her claims that the pair had visited a brothel in Germany while on official government business. Her reports have been described by Cardona as “fabrications and lies”.Cardona has said that he only knew the suspects in her murder through his work as a criminal lawyer, but that he did not “recall having any discussions with any of these iniduals, and have definitely never had any meetings with them”.Last year, a pre-trial hearing of evidence against the suspects, brothers Alfred and George Degiorgio and Vince Muscat, heard that the powerful car bomb used to kill Caruana Galizia was detonated by a mobile phone signal sent from a boat off the island’s coast as part of a carefully planned operation lasting several months.The three have pleaded not guilty to charges of murder, the criminal use of explosives, involvement in organised crime, and criminal conspiracy. However, there appears to have been little progress in discovering who ordered the crime.The MEPs write: “The investigation on the assassination of Daphne Caruana Galizia is stalling. People we spoke to suspect that the plan may be to ensure the blame rests with the three suspected bombers and to eventually let them go free, after 20 months of detention.”“Magistrate Vella, who has been in charge of the murder investigation, has been offered a promotion to become a judge and should, in a few weeks, leave the case. This is interpreted by many as a way to delay and stall the investigation“The police is ostensibly not following all relevant leads to find out who ordered the assassination. Excuses provided go from lack of resources to impossibility to investigate all people exposed by the deceased who might have had a motive to silence her.“Quite shockingly, the police appeared not to have thoroughly investigated witness accounts – published by international media – that minister of economy Chris Cardona had been seen drinking with one of the suspects prior to their arrest.”A spokesman for the Maltese government said the report had been drafted “by three MEPs after a visit to Malta in a private and political capacity, and not on behalf of the European Parliament or any of its committees”. He accused the parliamentarians of making “wild allegations” which are “absolutely and completely false”.The spokesman said: “There is no evidence to support the theory that the investigation is ‘stalling’. Three people have been arrested and charged with the murder of Daphne Caruana Galizia, and the investigation in to who ordered her murder carries on at pace. “Significant Police and Security Service resources are still deployed on the case.”It is understood that Jourová is to speak to Malta’s minister for justice, Owen Bonnici, and the country’s leading judge on Thursday, before meeting the officers investigating Caruana Galizia’s murder. She is also due to lay flowers on the journalist’s tomb.Jourová said would also raise issues over Malta’s offer of passports for cash and its flailing attempts to clamp down on organised crime and money laundering. Jourová said: “I think the murder of a journalist was a wake-up call for many of us and a clear realisation that many things are related to one another. Money laundering, citizenship for sale, security, corruption are all part of the systemic threats to the rule of law and democracy as such.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bbf65932e2f3a96b9470c2d1161dbf25043147b5/0_15_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e737d215a44db2b4aa02f9a867f2526","title":"german interior minister pulls out of integration summit","story":"Horst Seehofer’s absence comes amid signs of row with chancellor over asylum policyGermany’s interior minister, Horst Seehofer, has cancelled his participation in an integration summit hosted by Angela Merkel amid increasing signs of major disagreements between them over the country’s asylum policy.The absence follows his decision on Tuesday to drop the launch of an “immigration masterplan” after the German chancellor refused to back a crucial point of the plan that would allow migrants deemed to be trying to enter the country illegally to be turned back at the German border, arguing that it would breach European law. She insisted the masterplan was still being discussed in detail.Merkel has attracted criticism particularly within her CDU party for failing to back Seehofer’s push for stricter immigration rules amid cross-party concern that German asylum policy is in disarray.Instead of attending the summit, Seehofer said he was meeting the Austrian chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, who on Wednesday said hardline interior ministers from Italy, Austria and Germany had formed an “axis of the willing” to combat illegal immigration.The claim marks a shot across the bow for Merkel, who is trying to pull together a deal for EU cooperation on placing asylum seekers.Kurz has been pushing for more stringent immigration rules across the EU, but is not fully behind Seehofer’s plan to return people to the country in which they were first registered.Merkel has steadfastly refused to sanction Seehofer’s plan, insisting on finding a European solution to illegal migration that would require enhanced controls along the external border of the EU.Before her meeting with Kurz on Tuesday, Merkel said the issue was crucial and had the potential to seriously damage Europe if a remedy was not found soon.Seehofer also made clear his anger that his speech at Wednesday’s summit was to be preceded by a speech by the Turkish-German author Ferda Ataman, who has accused the interior minister of adopting Nazi tendencies by choosing to rename his department the Heimat, or homeland, ministry. She has argued that the word “Heimat” in the context in which Seehofer has chosen to use it – namely to protect Germany – is a response to “rampant xenophobia” and plays to the “blood and soil” politics of Nazism. Seehofer has vehemently rejected the Nazi comparison.The issue is expected to continue to reveal ever deeper rifts in the young coalition government. Seehofer, the leader of Merkel’s coalition allies, the Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU), has been on a collision course with the chancellor ever since her decision to allow an influx of more than a million migrants in 2015 and 2016. Most of the newcomers arrived in Germany via Bavaria.Seehofer’s “immigration masterplan” also involves so-called anchor centres, where immigrants’ details would be registered, and huge accommodation shelters where asylum seekers could stay while awaiting news on their applications.The CSU is keen to demonstrate its toughness on the issue in the run-up to a state election in October in which it will seek to claw back support it has lost to the anti-immigrant Alternative für Deutschland.This month the CSU introduced a law in Bavaria requiring all public buildings, including schools and universities, to hang a crucifix in their entrances."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6deda3ed8d45d6db9a52ac974afa26d42274f0b/0_169_3482_2089/master/3482.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=80d0cfd6202b9e54356b3c00038aafcb","title":"populist talkshows fuel rise of far right german tv bosses told","story":"Political shows’ negative focus on Islam erodes social cohesion, says cultural councilThe head of Germany’s most powerful cultural body has called for the plug to be pulled on the nation’s multitude of political talkshows for a year, arguing that their populist agenda has helped fuel the rise of the far right.Olaf Zimmermann, who heads the German cultural council, an umbrella group for organisations from art galleries to television companies, said public broadcasters needed to step back and rethink a format that has helped cement gloom-ridden public attitudes towards refugees and Islam, and propelled the Alternative für Deutschland party into parliament at last September’s election.“I’d suggest for them, take a break for a year ... though the length of the intermission isn’t the decisive factor. What is crucial is that they return with new talkshow concepts and try to come up with more suitable contents with regards to social cohesion in our society,” Zimmermann said, arguing that the public broadcasters ARD and ZDF were obsessed with refugee-related issues, often framing them negatively.The cultural council, which is taxpayer funded, has pointed out that since 2015, at the height of the refugee crisis when almost a million refugees and migrants entered Germany, more than 100 political talk shows have put a topic related to migration at the centre of their discussion.Since September’s election, which saw the AfD enter the Bundestag for the first time, much debate has surrounded the extent to which framing an issue, or lending a topic a certain perspective, might have helped their cause.Television analysts have argued that the issue of refugees has been dealt with in a mostly negative way.TV bosses have defended their formats, admitting the intensity of the refugee debate led to the topic being far more widely discussed in 2015 and 2016 than ever before, but arguing that it was no longer a dominant theme.Even last week, however, ARD’s main talkshow Hart Aber Fair - Hard But Fair - led with the question: “To what extent is it possible to integrate young men who have fled from war and archaic societies? How unsafe is Germany as a result of them?”The programme was triggered by the murder of a 14-year-old German girl whose body was discovered in Wiesbaden last week. The 20-year-old Iraqi man suspected of her rape and murder was extradited from Iraq to Germany this week to face trial.Zimmermann said in too many cases refugees were unfairly presented as a threat to German society. The production team of Hart Aber Fair said it rejected the accusation that they had unfairly labelled all refugees as dangerous. “As journalists we find the concept of framing alien to us. We are simply trying to represent the issues which are occupying people, for what they are,” they said.A recent talkshow moderated by the veteran host Sandra Maischberger was advertised in TV listings with the title: “Are we too tolerant towards Islam?” Critics were quick to pounce on the word “we” as being problematic because it suggested “them and us”. The programme’s title was swiftly changed to: The Islam debate: where does our tolerance end?Other recent talkshow topics included ones entitled Refugees and criminality, and Beethoven or Burka?Kai Hafez, a media analyst, said that immigration was rarely presented in talkshows as anything other than negative. “The viewers get used to these negative expressions, and long-term that way the rightwing populists manage to press their points home,” he told Der Spiegel.For their part, the AfD – whose representatives are relative newcomers on the talkshow circuit, the party only having been founded in 2014 – have been deeply critical of the extent to which they are excluded from TV debates.Last week that impression was only intensified after Alexander Gauland, the party’s leader, had his invitation to appear on Hart Aber Fair withdrawn in protest at his description of the Nazi era as the equivalent of “a bird shit” in the context of “more than 1,000 years of successful German history”.AfD supporters reacted to the ban with fury on social media, calling it part of a campaign to squeeze the party off the airwaves.Typically a German talkshow concentrates on a single topic for 60 to 90 minutes. Guests invariably include media representatives, at least one member of the cabinet and opposition politicians.Many media watchers have long been critical of the extent to which the arguably tired and unimaginative format dominates German television, accusing programme makers of choosing it because it is cheap – despite Germany having one of the highest licence fees in the world – and blaming it in part for the dramatic fall in viewers in recent years.Controllers of the broadcasters have hit back. “We believe the talk shows are an enriching part of our programming,” Rainald Becker, the editor-in-chief of the ARD told Die Welt. “Of course we discuss Islam now and then, but we also have other topics such as housing, the collapse of bee colonies or the shortage of carers.“And to those who want to complain, I say to them: you know that there’s an off switch.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49d333eb902e104674ddd68922af9be7b7daf424/0_223_4724_2835/master/4724.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=63dfc234e93a13de3ab022f35424a23d","title":"poland family life photography exhibition in pictures","story":"Family Values: Polish Photography Now is the UK’s first exhibition focusing on photography from Poland and part of the Calvert 22 Foundation’s season of events examining the country’s visual culture and creative landscape.

who are counterclaiming against the Russells for around £20,000 in unpaid fees - said the blame for the delay, the walkout by the builders and the significant overspend lay with the Russells.She described their attitude as unrealistic and impractical and said late design decisions bedeviled this project, adding: The problems on this project were not of PSP\u0027s making.Peter and Linda Stone, who managed the bespoke project, arriving at courtThe Stones consistently advised and warned Mr and Mrs Russell that it was imperative that they make design decisions to enable the building works to progress and of the dangers should they fail to do so. But they were unable or unwilling to heed that advice and these are the very dangers which befell this project, Ms McCafferty told the judge.They chose to ignore that advice at the time and, all these years on, still seem unable to understand those consequences.Ms McCafferty added: This is all the more distressing for Mr and Mrs Stone because they strongly believed that they did a very good job in very challenging circumstances on this difficult project.In the witness box, Mr Russell, 62, defended the time he and his wife took in making a decision over their choice of interior fittings, telling Mrs Justice Jefford: If you\u0027d seen the house you\u0027d understand this is not some Barratt home.”He added: Dealing with curves in this way is so complex. It\u0027s very difficult to fit it together. Take our television room I don\u0027t think there\u0027s a word to describe something that has one straight line and three curves.”Mr Russell, a director at more than 20 property and finance companies in London, said it was perfectly reasonable to be concerned over the interior details. But he rejected accusations he and his wife had procrastinated over their choices..What we wanted was our house to be our house with everything we wanted. If you are building your own home, you want the design to be what you want and the quality to be what you want,” he said. I think where we live has a certain expectation of level of standard.”Luxury property and architectureComment: Even by the SNP’s standards, this was an awesome display of self-pitying victimhoodThe hidden trauma of Grenfell: \u0026#39It feels like the fire is happening all over again\u0026#39Comment: The prickly truth is that hedgehogs are dying because badger numbers are boomingPepsi shuts Mexico bottling plant over gang threats as 112th politician shot dead ahead of electionUber driver has his licence revoked after kicking out lesbian couple for kissingSorbonne launches bid to become \u0026#39French Harvard\u0026#39Parked car belonging to imprisoned man cannot be moved because of his blue badge, council saysSupermarkets selling cheap, super-size punnets of strawberries after cold spring causes a bumper cropWoman \u0026#39taped to chair\u0026#39 claims bullying was so bad she contacted DignitasSpanish king\u0026#39s brother-in-law ordered to report to prison after losing graft caseTrachoma eliminated in first sub Saharan African countryStill stuck on the damn island: what the infuriating Lost finale could mean for the end of WestworldJonathan King used fame to lure young boys into Daimler before sexually abusing them, court hearsTeacher once teased for \u0026#39looking like Chuckle brother\u0026#39 struck off after attack on schoolboyPledge to arm Philippine community chiefs sparks \u0026#39Wild West\u0026#39 fearsStorm Hector poses a threat to life with winds of up to 70mph, Met Office warnsIran arrests human rights lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh after she criticised judiciaryRussian MP warns against sex with foreigners during World CupComment: The NHS saved my life - but to survive, it must cut waste.

Only token fees are paid by French undergraduates. “We need to change that mentality and usher in a new mindset,” one lecturer said.French universities, as opposed to elite “Grandes Ecoles” and private colleges, have only been allowed to raise funds privately since 2008.Even if the Sorbonne achieves its goal, it will still benefit from less private funding than top UK universities or elite US colleges such as Harvard, which raised nearly $1.2 billion last year (£898m).Student protests at the Sorbonne in the turbulent summer of 1968The Sorbonne’s current annual budget is €670 million (£590m). Barthélemy Jobert, head of the Sorbonne University Foundation, said: “We’ve already been pledged €50 million (£44m), mainly from companies. The real challenge for us is inidual donors.”The university plans to solicit donations from successful alumni, and has a team working on identifying well-placed potential donors among its 360,000 graduates.Budget cuts have left some buildings in need of repair.“An American was ready to commit to restoring the Sorbonne chapel organ but he when he saw the state of the chapel, he backed out,” Mr Jobert said.The Paris municipal authorities are responsible for maintaining the chapel, which needs costly repairs, but have yet to agree to renovate it.Harvard attracts a great deal of investmentThe Sorbonne plans to use most of its private funding to create scholarships and inter-disciplinary faculty posts, and to buy an atomic force microscope.In January, the Sorbonne merged with the Pierre-et-Marie-Curie science university.It now has three faculties: science, medicine and arts, with 6,700 faculty members and 55,000 students.In the 10 years since the ban on private funding was lifted, 49 of the country’s 73 universities have established fund-raising foundations, according to Sophie Rieunier, a researcher at the Paris-Est-Marne-La Vallée university.Provincial universities have had more success with private donors because of their close links with local industry. Bordeaux University, for example, now works closely with the wine chateaux. Please review our commenting policyComment: Even by the SNP’s standards, this was an awesome display of self-pitying victimhoodThe hidden trauma of Grenfell: \u0026#39It feels like the fire is happening all over again\u0026#39Comment: The prickly truth is that hedgehogs are dying because badger numbers are boomingPepsi shuts Mexico bottling plant over gang threats as 112th politician shot dead ahead of electionUber driver has his licence revoked after kicking out lesbian couple for kissingParked car belonging to imprisoned man cannot be moved because of his blue badge, council saysSupermarkets selling cheap, super-size punnets of strawberries after cold spring causes a bumper cropCouple blamed for their luxury home overspend after \u0026#39dithering\u0026#39 over choice of toilet roll holdersWoman \u0026#39taped to chair\u0026#39 claims bullying was so bad she contacted DignitasSpanish king\u0026#39s brother-in-law ordered to report to prison after losing graft caseTrachoma eliminated in first sub Saharan African countryStill stuck on the damn island: what the infuriating Lost finale could mean for the end of WestworldJonathan King used fame to lure young boys into Daimler before sexually abusing them, court hearsTeacher once teased for \u0026#39looking like Chuckle brother\u0026#39 struck off after attack on schoolboyPledge to arm Philippine community chiefs sparks \u0026#39Wild West\u0026#39 fearsStorm Hector poses a threat to life with winds of up to 70mph, Met Office warnsIran arrests human rights lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh after she criticised judiciaryRussian MP warns against sex with foreigners during World CupComment: The NHS saved my life - but to survive, it must cut waste.

We always try to find ways to support them in times like this, while at the same time reducing unnecessary food waste. “British strawberries are also typically brighter in colour and tastier compared with imported varieties, meaning our customers can enjoy more of the fruit at the best time of the year.”Growers are also getting a good deal each farm will be paid the same rate per kg of produce by Aldi as they would have done without the promotion.Tesco is also running a promotion, selling two of its £2 400g punnets for £3, while Sainsbury\u0027s has reduced its 400g punnet from £2 to £1.60.The cold spring meant the fruit took longer to ripen - making it more deliciousFarmers are urging customers to get their strawberries while they are still cheap and deliciously sweet.Nick Marston, chairman of British Summer Fruits, said : February and March this year were considerably colder than in 2017. The strawberry crops develop more slowly if the weather is cooler.There is a good level of supply, and because they\u0027ve ripened more slowly they are bigger, tastier and juicier than last year.Because there is a good level of supply supermarkets have promotions in place for the next few days. These include Kilo boxes, two for one deals and all sorts. We say that customers should rush out and buy strawberries now while the offers are on the very good quality fruit!He added that while the strawberry season usually starts on May 1st, the chilly spring meant it was a week and a half late. Now, the crop is in full swing, and it is likely the season will carry on successfully until July, now it is in full swing.However, those hoping the glut will mean for a discount day out at Wimbledon are going to be disappointed.A spokesperson for the tennis competition said: The strawberries and cream at Wimbledon will once again be priced at £2.50 – the price has remained the same since 2010.Comment: Even by the SNP’s standards, this was an awesome display of self-pitying victimhoodThe hidden trauma of Grenfell: \u0026#39It feels like the fire is happening all over again\u0026#39Comment: The prickly truth is that hedgehogs are dying because badger numbers are boomingPepsi shuts Mexico bottling plant over gang threats as 112th politician shot dead ahead of electionUber driver has his licence revoked after kicking out lesbian couple for kissingSorbonne launches bid to become \u0026#39French Harvard\u0026#39Parked car belonging to imprisoned man cannot be moved because of his blue badge, council saysCouple blamed for their luxury home overspend after \u0026#39dithering\u0026#39 over choice of toilet roll holdersWoman \u0026#39taped to chair\u0026#39 claims bullying was so bad she contacted DignitasSpanish king\u0026#39s brother-in-law ordered to report to prison after losing graft caseTrachoma eliminated in first sub Saharan African countryStill stuck on the damn island: what the infuriating Lost finale could mean for the end of WestworldJonathan King used fame to lure young boys into Daimler before sexually abusing them, court hearsTeacher once teased for \u0026#39looking like Chuckle brother\u0026#39 struck off after attack on schoolboyPledge to arm Philippine community chiefs sparks \u0026#39Wild West\u0026#39 fearsStorm Hector poses a threat to life with winds of up to 70mph, Met Office warnsIran arrests human rights lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh after she criticised judiciaryRussian MP warns against sex with foreigners during World CupComment: The NHS saved my life - but to survive, it must cut waste.

He threw himself into the relationship and, the following year, with his father and her two adult siblings present, they married at the registrar’s office in Sheffield, where they both live.\u0026nbspHe put on smiles for the wedding photos because he recognised that they were expected but, as he explains: “From an inner feeling point of view, anything I do that requires an emotional response feels like a fake.“Most of my responses are learned responses. In an environment where everyone is being jolly and happy, it feels like I’m lying. Acting. Which I am. So it is a lie.”\u0026nbspHappiness isn’t the only emotion that Stephen struggles with. Excitement, shame, disgust, anticipation, even love… he doesn’t feel these, either. “I feel something but I’m unable to distinguish in any real way what that feeling is.” The only emotions he is familiar with are fear and anger.\u0026nbspSuch profound problems with emotion are sometimes associated with autism, which Stephen does not have, or with psychopathy, which he doesn’t have, either.Last year, at the age of 51, he finally learned what he does have: a little-known condition called alexithymia, a word made from Greek parts meaning, roughly, “no words for emotion”.Despite the name, the real problem for people with alexithymia isn’t so much that they have no words for their emotions, but that they lack the emotions themselves. Still, not everyone with the condition has the same experiences. Some have gaps and distortions in the typical emotional repertoire.Some realise they’re feeling an emotion, but don’t know which, while others confuse signs of certain emotions for something else – perhaps interpreting butterflies in the stomach as hunger pangs.\u0026nbspSurprisingly, given how generally unrecognised it is, studies show that about one in 10 people fall on the alexithymia spectrum. New research is now revealing what’s going wrong – and this work holds the promise not only of novel treatments for disorders of emotion, but of revealing just how the rest of us feel anything at all.\u0026nbspAfter working as a nurse for 10 years, Stephen decided he wanted to do something different. A two-year Access to University course led to a degree in astronomy and physics, and then to a job testing computer games.He built a successful career for himself, working for various companies in their computer testing departments, managing teams, and travelling around the world to speak at conferences. He had no problem conveying facts to colleagues.It was in the context of more personal relationships – or any other scenario that would typically involve expressions of emotion – that he felt things were “wrong”.\u0026nbsp“At the beginning of a relationship, I’m totally into who that person is,” he explains. “I’ve been told I’m very good at maintaining a honeymoon period for ‘longer than expected’. But after a year it takes a massive turn. It all falls apart. I’ve put myself on a pedestal to be this person which I’m really not. I react mostly cognitively, rather than it being emotions making me react. Obviously, that is not valid. It’s not real. It seems fake. Because it is fake. And you can only pretend for so long.”\u0026nbspHe and his current wife stopped living together in 2012. He saw a GP and was prescribed antidepressants. Though he was still in contact with his wife, it was clear that the relationship was no longer working. In June 2015, he attempted suicide.“I had actually been posting on Facebook and Twitter regarding killing myself and someone – I’ve never found out who – contacted the police. I was taken to hospital and treated.”\u0026nbspA psychiatrist referred Stephen for a series of counselling sessions and then a course of psychodynamic psychotherapy, a type of Freudian-based therapy that, in trying to uncover unconscious drivers of thoughts and behaviour, is similar to psychoanalysis.\u0026nbspIt was in a book called Why Love Matters by Sue Gerhardt, which his therapist recommended, that he first came across the concept of alexithymia.“I brought it up in therapy, and that’s when we started talking about how I was very alexithymic. Obviously, I’ve got a vocabulary. I’ve got words for emotions. But whether they’re the right words for the right emotion is a different point altogether… I just thought that I wasn’t good at talking about how I feel and emotions and stuff like that. But after a year of therapy, it became apparent that when I talk about emotions I don’t actually know what I’m talking about.”The term “alexithymic” dates from a book published in 1972 and has its origins in Freudian psychodynamic literature.Freudian ideas are now out of favour with most academic psychologists, as Geoff Bird, a professor of psychology at the University of Oxford explains. “Not to disrespect those traditions, but in the cognitive, neuro, experimental field, not so many people are really very interested in anything associated with Freud any more.”But when Bird read about alexithymia, he found the descriptions intriguing. “Actually, it’s really quite amazing.” For most people, “at a low level of emotion, you might be a bit unsure about exactly what you’re feeling, but if you have a strong emotion, you know what it is”. And yet somehow, here were people who simply did not know.\u0026nbspBird started his academic career studying autism spectrum disorder, empathy and emotional awareness, which led to his interest in alexithymia.In one of his first studies in this field, he linked alexithymia, as measured with a 20-item checklist developed at the University of Toronto, with a lack of empathy. If you can’t feel your own emotions in the typical way, it makes sense that you can’t identify with those of others, either.\u0026nbspBut what really drew Bird into alexithymia research were his interactions with people with autism. “There has been this perception that people with autism don’t have empathy. And that’s rubbish. And you can see that immediately as soon as you meet some autistic people.”In a series of studies, Bird has found that about half of people with autism have alexithymia – it’s these people who struggle with emotion and empathy, while the rest do not. In other words, emotion-related difficulties are intrinsic to the alexithymia, not to the autism.Bird is passionate about spreading this message. He talks with feeling about one particular autistic study volunteer who did not have alexithymia: “A lovely guy with an IQ we couldn’t measure, it’s that good. He couldn’t hold down a job. But he volunteered to work at a care home because he wanted to do something productive with his time.“They said, ‘Oh because you’ve got a diagnosis of autism you can’t do empathy, therefore you can’t look after our elderly people.’ Which is just ridiculous.”\u0026nbspBird has since run a series of studies exploring alexithymia outside the context of autism. He has found, for example, that people with the condition have no trouble recognising faces, or distinguishing pictures of people smiling and frowning.“But for a few of our really alexithymic people, while they can tell a smile and a frown apart, they have no idea what they are. That is really quite strange.”\u0026nbspMany of the people with the condition who Bird has met talk about being told by other people that they’re different, though some do recognise it in themselves early on.“I guess it’s a bit like not being able to see colour, and everybody’s always banging on about how red this is or how blue, and you come to realise there’s an aspect of human experience that you’re just not participating in.”As well as better characterising alexithymia, Bird and his colleagues have also dug into what explains it, taking what could seem to be a circular argument – Stephen has problems with emotion because he has alexithymia, which is characterised by problems with emotion – and blowing it right apart.In situations that Stephen recognises as being in theory highly emotional – like telling someone “I love you” – he experiences changes inside his body. “I feel my heart race and this rush of adrenaline, but to me that feeling is always scary. I don’t know how to react. It makes me want to either run away or react verbally aggressively.”\u0026nbspFear and anger – and confusion – he understands. “Everything else just feels all the same… it’s this feeling of, ‘Errrr, I’m not quite comfortable with this – it’s not quite right’.”\u0026nbsp“Similarly with anxiety, it might be that someone experiences an emotional response associated with a fast heartbeat – which might be excitement – but they don’t know how to interpret that, and they could panic about what’s happening in their body.”\u0026nbspThe ability to detect changes inside the body – everything from a racing heart to a ersion of blood flow, from a full bladder to a distension of the lungs – is known as interoception. It’s your perception of your own internal state.\u0026nbspDifferent emotions are associated with different physical changes. In anger, for example, the heart rate rises, blood rushes to the face, and fists clench. In fear, the heart rate also rises but blood drains from the face.It’s generally thought that these changes are not entirely specific to inidual emotions, and so context is also important: if you feel your heart racing and you’re looking at a spider, you know it’s fear that you’re feeling, not sexual arousal.\u0026nbspWhat Bird, Brewer and others have found in people with alexithymia is a reduced ability, sometimes a complete inability, to produce, detect or interpret these internal bodily changes. People with the condition have normal-range IQs.They can understand as well as anyone else that they’re seeing a spider, rather than an attractive potential partner. But either their brains aren’t triggering the physical changes that it seems are needed for the experience of an emotion, or other regions of their brains aren’t reading these signals properly.\u0026nbspIn 2016, Bird and Brewer, along with Richard Cook at City University in London, published a research paper that characterised alexithymia as a “generalised deficit of interoception”.Here, then, was an explanation for these people’s problems with emotion – but also, in effect, a manifesto stating that the perception of a range of bodily signals is important for the experience of emotion in the rest of us.\u0026nbspIt’s an idea that we already express in everyday language: in English, for an apology to mean anything, it has to be “heartfelt”. If you truly love someone, it’s with “all your heart”.When you’re really angry, your “blood boils”. Instead of saying that you’re anxious, you might talk about having “butterflies in your stomach” (thought to be caused by a ersion of blood flow away from the digestive system).While most people may not be familiar with alexithymia, there is a different disorder involving flat emotions and poor empathy that seems to fascinate us, even more than it repels us: psychopathy. Can we learn more about how we feel by understanding psychopaths?Lieke Nentjes is in her early thirties. She’s slender and softly spoken it’s hard to picture her spending countless hours in small rooms with incarcerated, unshackled psychopaths, including serially violent men who have committed murder.\u0026nbsp“Then he explained that he was at the end of his therapy and was ‘resocialising’ and no one would hire him because they were intimidated by him. He wasn’t really angry. He was frustrated.”While the nature of psychopathy is still debated, psychologists generally agree that it entails, among other things, a lack of empathy or guilt, shallow emotions, and antisocial behaviour – treating other people badly and, in some cases, engaging in criminal acts.\u0026nbspIt has certainly been suggested that the reason some psychopaths are able to torture or murder people is that they don’t process emotions properly – they don’t feel fear, for example, and they don’t recognise it in others.\u0026nbspNentjes is based at the University of Amsterdam. Here in the Netherlands, if a criminal is found to have a psychological condition that relates to the crime, he or she is deemed to be only partially responsible.Such criminals might spend a few years in a regular jail before being sent to a secure treatment centre, or they may be sent straight for treatment.\u0026nbspNentjes decided to assess a range of criminals from these centres and from jails to find out just how psychopathic they were (with particular attention to different aspects of psychopathy), to learn about their lives – their upbringing, and their criminal behaviour – and also to measure their interoceptive ability.\u0026nbsp“Emotion is very central when you look at psychopathy – or rather, lack of emotion,” she says. So could it be that psychopathic offenders just aren’t very in touch with their bodies?\u0026nbspIn the course of the interviews, Nentjes asked questions to probe their levels of empathy, and how much remorse they felt about what they had done to their victims. “Some were just completely honest, and would say, ‘I don’t care,’” she says.“Others who were psychopathic would say, ‘Oh, but I’m very empathic.’ They had learned the lingo to describe feelings very accurately and they could talk about compassionate, empathic feelings towards others – but then when you look at the crimes they have committed…” Her sentence trails off.\u0026nbsp“There is research finding that psychopathic offenders can describe emotions in terms of words, but they lack the inner experience of the emotion,” she adds.\u0026nbspSince assessing a person’s ability to detect a range of bodily signals is tricky, the most commonly used measures of interoceptive sensitivity are based on judgements of heart rate. One test involves asking participants to count their heartbeats over varying periods – 25 or 50 seconds, perhaps – multiple times.About 10 per cent of us are good at counting heartbeats, 5 to 10 per cent are very bad, and the rest fall somewhere in between.In another test, volunteers are played a series of beeps that are either in sync or out of sync with their heartbeat, and asked which it is. On this type of task, about 10 per cent of the general population can do it really well, and 80 per cent can’t do it at all.\u0026nbspNentjes brought the necessary equipment for the heartbeat synch task with her into the interview rooms, and took measures for 75 offenders. She found a clear link: the higher an offender’s score on the antisocial aspect of psychopathy, the poorer their performance on the heart-rate task.This does at least suggest that psychopaths who are poorer at detecting bodily signals feel less emotion and therefore less empathy for others.Psychopathic criminals are sometimes ided into the “white-collar” type, who tend to commit non-violent crimes such as fraud, and the violent type. In her interviews with this violent group, Nentjes was struck by one similarity, in particular, compared with the white-collar group.“That was their upbringing. Or rather lack of it. Emotional abuse. Sexual abuse. Neglect. A lot of physical abuse. I’ve heard people literally say that emotion is not of use to them. All they felt during their upbringing was fear.”\u0026nbspAs a child, Stephen suffered extreme emotional neglect. When he was six, his mother intentionally set fire to their home in Nottingham while she, Stephen, his younger brother and even younger sister were all inside. Fortunately, the children’s father, who had left for work, realised that he’d forgotten his packed lunch and came home.\u0026nbspLooking back, Stephen says it’s clear that his mother was suffering from post-natal depression. But she received no treatment, “and all I knew was anxiety and being worried”. After the fire, his mother went to prison. His father was a steelworker, who worked all kinds of shifts.“A neighbour contacted social services and Dad was told to sort it out or they’d take us away. None of my dad’s brothers or sisters wanted me or my brother because we were little shits. We were always in trouble. Robbing shops. All kinds of stuff. So we went into care.”\u0026nbspFor the rest of his childhood, Stephen was in and out of care homes. The only emotions he remembers feeling, even then, are fear, anger and confusion. “Christmas, birthdays, people out of the blue at care homes being nice to me… I never really got used to it. I always felt uncomfortable. There’s just a mess of feelings inside me that I don’t interpret properly, or respond to properly.”\u0026nbspAlexithymia is often associated with trauma and neglect from a young age, explains Geoff Bird. Twin studies have suggested a genetic component, too. And it’s also linked to certain types of brain damage, particularly to the insula, the region that receives interoceptive signals.\u0026nbspAs Rebecca Brewer notes, the kind of anxiety that Stephen experiences is common in people with poor interoception. At the University of Sussex, Hugo Critchley and Sarah Garfinkel, who have expertise in psychiatry and neuroscience, are looking at ways to alter interoception, to bring anxiety down.\u0026nbspGarfinkel has put forward a three-dimensional model of interoception that has been well received by others in the field. First, objective accuracy at perceiving interoceptive signals – how good you are at counting heartbeats, for example.Second, subjective report – how good you think you are. And third, metacognitive accuracy – how good you are at knowing how good you actually are.\u0026nbspThe third dimension is important because various studies have found that the gap between how good someone thinks they are at counting heartbeats, for example, and how good they actually are predicts their levels of anxiety.Lisa Quadt, a research fellow with the Sussex group, is now running a clinical trial with the aim of testing whether reducing this gap for people with autism can reduce their anxiety.In a pilot study, Critchley, Garfinkel and MSc student Abigail McLanachan recruited a group of students who came into the lab for six training sessions. In each session, they first did the heartbeat-counting task.The volunteer sat at rest, with a loose rubber pulse oximeter on their forefingers, and reported how many beats they’d counted. Then McLanachan told them how they’d done so that they got a better sense of how accurate they were.McLanachan then got them to do a few minutes of jumping jacks or walking fast up the steep hill outside the building – whatever was necessary to raise their heart rate, to make it easier to detect. (“Because some people really can’t feel their heartbeat at all. I can’t,” Quadt explains.)Then they went back into the lab, did the tasks again and, as before, were given feedback each time.\u0026nbspThis was just a pilot study on a general student population. But after three weeks, not only had the students’ accuracy improved on all three dimensions of interoception, but they also reported reductions in anxiety of around 10 per cent.\u0026nbspFor the main trial, volunteers diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder will complete the same tasks as in the pilot, but once at the start and once at the end they’ll do them inside an MRI scanner.This will allow the team to monitor activity in the insula, which receives heart-rate data, and look at how changes in that activity may correspond to connections between the amygdala, which detects threats, and the prefrontal cortex, which can work out whether a potential threat really is or is not dangerous and so whether anxiety is warranted.The hope, Critchley explains, is to see improved connectivity between these two regions, which previous studies have linked to reduced anxiety.\u0026nbspIn Oxford, meanwhile, Geoff Bird wants to look at the idea that there are two different types of alexithymia. People with one type don’t produce enough of the bodily signals necessary for the experience of an emotion, so would be unlikely to benefit from the Sussex group’s kind of training.People with the other type produce all kinds of bodily sensations but their brains don’t process these signals in the typical way. This second group, which includes Stephen, might benefit more.\u0026nbspBird stresses that, although people with alexithymia struggle to understand emotion, that doesn’t mean they don’t care about other people. “For the most part, iniduals with alexithymia can recognise that others are in a negative state, and this makes them distressed.“The problem is that they can’t work out what the other person is feeling, and what they are feeling, and therefore how to make the other person feel better or how to reduce their own distress. I think that’s important because alexithymia is different from psychopathy in that respect.”Stephen says that for him, this is certainly true. And in theory, an emotional training technique is something he would welcome. “I’ve got several books about emotions and feelings and they don’t make a jot of difference because they’re not talking specifically enough about what you actually feel within your body is which emotion.”\u0026nbspFor now, given the absence of available treatments for alexithymia, Stephen plans to use his newfound understanding of himself, gained through therapy, to try to move forwards. At first, he says, he hoped that therapy would fix everything.“I thought every day would be perfect, brilliant… and I’ve come to realise that’s not going to happen. I’m always going to have problems, always going to have issues.”\u0026nbspHe’s learned valuable lessons, he says. Though he and his wife are still separated, they talk regularly and now he tries not to reject her views on his anxiety. “Rather than go, ‘No,’ I will listen. I think, ‘Well, you know what emotions are about and I don’t, so I’m going to listen to you and I’ll either take it on board or I’ll find a way to deal with it’.”He’s also thinking about moving to work with people who are struggling with substance abuse, because he’d like to be back in a career where he can help people.\u0026nbspMost of all, he’s determined to use his diagnosis of alexithymia. “For me, it empowers me – now I know about it, I can read about it. I can find out more about it. And I can develop certain tools that enable me to combat it.”People without alexithymia could probably use such tools as well. Bird has led work showing that people who are more aware of their own heartbeat are better able to recognise others’ emotions, a crucial first step in being empathetic.He’s planning studies to investigate whether heartbeat training might therefore increase empathy.\u0026nbspThose who want to reduce feelings of stress and anxiety in daily life, but who either can’t or don’t want to change the sources of stress, could focus on changing the signals coming from their bodies instead.Regular physical exercise should dampen down the kinds of bodily signals (from the heart and circulation, for example) that the brain could interpret as being anxious – so it should dampen down feelings of anxiety, too.\u0026nbspKnowing that signals from our bodies underpin our emotions could be empowering for all of us.

Flat desert on either side, a few lights.\u0026nbspThe Moroccan traveller Ibn Battuta passed this way on camel back in 1326, and wrote of its emphatic wilderness: “He who enters it is lost and he who leaves it is born.”Before mass tourism ruined them for a second time, I’d travelled to the so-called “lost” cities of Petra, Machu Picchu and Angkor Wat.\u0026nbspMy destination tonight was the isolated sandstone valley eulogised by Charles Doughty, the first European to enter it\u0026nbspin 1876, as “the fabulous Mada’in Saleh\u0026nbspwhich I was come from far countries to seek in Arabia”.The prospect of following in Doughty’s flapping shadow gave me a jolt of anticipation that I hadn’t experienced since my twenties.\u0026nbspDoughty’s classic book Arabia Deserta was championed by his friend TE\u0026nbspLawrence, who later used it as a military textbook, as the greatest record of adventure and travel in our language.It begins with Doughty trying to smuggle himself into Mada’in Saleh in the guise of a poor Syrian pilgrim.\u0026nbspEven up until recently few Europeans have visited this cradle of forgotten civilisations, which, though designated a World Heritage Site in 2008, remains a blank page on the archaeological record, closed off by geography, politics, religion.“Visitors last year from abroad? I can say zero,” my guide Ahmed tells me.Mada\u0027in\u0026nbspSaleh\u0026nbspnear Al-Ula\u0026nbsphave survived for 2,000 yearsThis is set to change. Last July, under the impetus of Saudi Arabia’s progressive new Crown Prince, Mohammed Bin Salman, or “MBS” as he is popularly known, a Royal Commission took charge of Mada’in Saleh and its surrounds – “the only crown jewel of a site the country possesses,” says one of the archaeologists recruited to excavate it.In December, public access was halted first in order to survey what actually is there, next to develop a strategy for protecting it, and then to open up Mada’in Saleh to the outside world. My advance visit is aimed at providing an amuse-bouche, as it were.In the bright morning sunlight, Ahmed escorts me through locked gates, past the German-built railway-line linking Damascus with Medina, which Lawrence bombed (“there are still local tribes which call their sons Al-Orans”), to the celebrated Nabatean rock tombs.Doughty first heard about these in Petra, 300 miles north. Fifty years earlier, an awe-struck British naval commander had gazed in disbelief at Petra’s imperishable Treasury, murmuring, as many continue to do: “There is nothing in the world that resembles it.” He was wrong.If a little less rosier than her sister city, Mada’in Saleh shares her capacity to stagger.\u0026nbspOut of the flat desert, one after another, the ornate facades rise into sight, 111 of them, carved into perpendicular cliffs up to four storeys high, their low doorways decorated by Alexandrian masons in the first century AD, with Greek triangles, Roman pilasters, Persian flowers, Egyptian sphinxes, birds.“This is a twin to Petra,” Ahmed says. Except that in Petra we would be bobbing among crowds.Ahmed\u0026nbspis descended from a long line of imamsStanding in reverent silence, with the valley to ourselves, I recall how the Victorian artist who supplied the first images of Petra to the world, David Roberts, responded to that other city. “I turned from it at length with an impression which will be effaced only by death.”These tombs were carved for the Nabatean tribes who ruled this region for 300 years until the Romans annexed them in 106AD. Nomads who had settled and grown wealthy, the Nabateans controlled the lucrative spice route from the Mediterranean to the Red Sea.Then, like the civilisations they’d replaced, the Dedanites, the Lihyanites, the Thamuds, they galloped off into obscurity. Their tombs were looted: the acacia doors plundered for firewood, the marble statues melted to make lime for plaster, the porphyry urns smashed.All that survives of their caravan city, Hegra, is a flat expanse behind a wire fence: “her clay-built streets are again the blown dust in the wilderness,” Doughty wrote.The same desolation holds true for the still more ancient Biblical city of Dedan, situated on the lip of an oasis a few minutes drive way. To visit both sites is to gain the sense of a narrative even now being worked out.\u0026nbspUntil the 20th\u0026nbspcentury the story of these civilisations was scrawled on the rocks in Nabatean or Thamudic script. Ahmed leads me between two steep cliffs to the oldest inscription, written 6,000 years ago.Tombs in Mada\u0027in Saleh were decorated by Alexandrian masons in the first century with Greek, Roman and Persian symbolsThe ancient Biblical city of Dedan is situated on the lip of an oasisCliffs formed out of red and black sandstone have eroded into crazy, hallucinatory shapes such as elephants, mushrooms, and sealsAncient Dedan inscriptions.

Ahmed could be speaking of the cavity in the historical record when he says, “They were making sacrifices to one god, Dhu-Ghaibat, which means ‘the one who is absent’.”Out in the desert, the wind has chiselled its own mysterious deities and hieroglyphs. The scene is stunning. In Petra, which forms part of the same massif, David Roberts threw away his pencil in despair at being able to convey it, believing that the ruins “sink into insignificance when compared with these stupendous rocks”.It’s hard to disagree. Cliffs formed out of red and black sandstone have eroded into crazy, hallucinatory shapes: elephants, mushrooms, braying seals. If they were transcribed into music, it would be Wagnerian.They make you believe in mountain gods, I tell Ahmed, who smiles. “I never try smoking weed, but when I hear someone react, I feel like that. It makes you high, naturally.”For sheer high spirits, no one yields to the British archaeologist I meet that night. Jamie Quartermain is part of an international team employed since March to survey these sites.A surveyor who pioneered the use of drones, Quartermain says: “We’ve been wanting to get involved here, but Saudi has been a closed shop, a completely untapped reserve.The perception is that it’s big, open desert. When I tried to find out anything about it, there was essentially one book. The discovery that there are so many archaeological sites is a big shock for most people. It was a big shock for me.”Advised by the Royal Commission to expect 450 unexcavated sites, Quartermain estimates the truer number between 6,000-10,000.\u0026nbsp“The survival of the archaeology is remarkable, some of the best condition remains I’ve ever seen.

Already, what he has found is ground-breaking. “You can see all the archaeology jumping out and biting you on the bottom.”When, aged 20, I visited Petra, sleeping in one of the caves, I talked to the head of the Bdoul tribe, allegedly descendants of the Nabateans, who told me: “We have a saying that the more wealth you have, the more brain cells you need to be able to cope with it.What impresses about MBS’s plan for Mada’in Saleh is his determination to use his nation’s resources to avoid the pitfalls of Petra.“Wadi Rum is pretty disastrous,” says Chris Tuttle, an American archaeologist seconded to the project. Tuttle spent many years excavating in Petra. He saw at first hand the ruinous impact of tourism, both on the ruins and the local community.By contrast, in Al-Ula, the local town for Mada’in Saleh, there has been a concerted drive to educate the locals, giving scholarships to 150 children, but also to attract experts armed with the latest methodolOne reason for the blankness on Saudi Arabia’s archaeological map, says Tuttle, has been the resistance of conservative religious leaders to question their history. “You don’t need to study the past when you’ve been given a manual from God.”Suddenly, a multi-thousand-year-old story has become an open book, not a closed one, and the revelation it contains could be a complex of sites more significant even than Petra.\u0026nbspMy guide Ahmed Alimam is a perfect representative of Al-Ula’s past and future. He comes from a long line of imams descended from a grand tribal judge who arrived c1400 in Al Ula’s “old town”Abandoned in 1983, the year of Ahmed’s birth, this haunting labyrinth of mud houses and twisting streets replaced Dedan and Hegra.

But protoplanets of this kind cannot be found using those techniques.Though thousands of exoplanets have been discovered in the last few decades, detecting protoplanets is at the frontier of science, said Christophe Pinte of Monash University in Australia and lead author on one of the two papers.The scientists found the planets by looking out for disturbances in the gas-filled disk around the star. They looked for a particular kind of light that is emitted by the movement of carbon monoxide – which allows them to understand how the gas in the disk is churning around.If there were no planets in the disk, then the gas would move with a simple, predictable pattern. But unusual movement would seem to suggest there is some large body there.It would take a relatively massive object, like a planet, to create localized disturbances in this otherwise orderly motion, said Pinte. Our new technique applies this principle to help us understand how planetary systems form.They saw three of those disturbances, each of which is thought to be caused by a different\u0026nbspplanet.There are other potential explanations for the strange data coming back from the star. But the new findings are the strongest evidence yet that there are new worlds forming in our own galactic neighbourhood.The discovery was made by analysing images sent back from highly-powered telescopes pointing deep into the galaxy, in a way never done before.We looked at the localised, small-scale motion of gas in the star\u0027s protoplanetary disc. This entirely new approach could uncover some of the youngest planets in our galaxy, all thanks to the high-resolution images from ALMA, said Richard Teague, an astronomer at the University of Michigan and principal author on the other paper.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Since the referendum there has been hot debate over the meaning of Brexit: would it entail a full withdrawal from the existing agreement, known as hard Brexit, or the soft version in which we would remain part of a common customs area for most goods, as Turkey does?Though progress was made last year, there has still been no solid agreement on whether there should be a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.Despite protests from a small number of Conservative MPs, the Government and the EU are largely in agreement that a transitional period is needed after Brexit.47 Rights of EU citizens living the UKThe Prime Minister has promised EU citizens already living in the UK the right to live and work here after Brexit, but the rights of those who arrive after Brexit day remains unclear.57 Future trade agreement (with the EU)Despite this being a key issue in negotiations, the Government has yet to lay out exactly what it wants from a trade deal with the EU.The Government has already begun trying to woo foreign leaders into prospective trade agreements, with various high profile state visits to China, India and Canada for May, and the now infamous invitation to US President Donald Trump to visit London.Banks in the UK will be hit hard regardless of the Brexit outcome. The EU has refused to give British banks passporting rights to trade within the EU, dashing hopes of a special City deal.Labour is opposed to remaining in the EEA, with Mr Corbyn having described the option as not suitable for the UK. Instead, the party\u0026nbspsays it would negotiate a\u0026nbsp“more ambitious” bespoke deal that would give the UK “full access” to the single market, but would seek to secure exceptions on issues such as migration.Many of the party’s MPs have made clear\u0026nbspthey would not vote for any Brexit policy that would mean the continuation of freedom of movement, which they believe is a red line for\u0026nbsp their constituents.Most Leave-voting Labour supporters don\u0027t actually want a hard BrexitBoth the Tories and Labour are trying to sell us Brexit unicornsLabour seeks law change to reduce maximum deposit landlords can chargeLabour MPs say Corbyn\u0027s latest Brexit move \u0027nowhere near enough\u0027The Independent revealed earlier in the week that a number of them had\u0026nbspwritten to Mr Corbyn urging him to resist pressure from pro-EU colleagues who want a softer Brexit.They wrote: Staying in the EEA whilst outside the European Union would be the opposite of what the public voted for. There would be a huge democratic deficit, as the UK became a ‘rule taker,’ not a ‘rule maker’.”“Crucially, despite suggestions to the contrary, EEA membership would require accepting free movement of Labour. Concerns about free movement were an important factor which drove our constituents to vote Leave, and almost half of all Remain voters wanted changes to free movement. We do not believe these concerns should be ignored.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The prime minister doesn’t agree with it, but it is being discussed.”Other rebel MPs\u0026nbsprepeated warnings\u0026nbspthat if Ms May does not bring forward a plan that clearly matches\u0026nbspthe spirit of the Grieve plan, they will once again vote against the government in the coming weeks.The row was precipitated by the Lords last month passing a plan that would have given parliament the power to direct Ms May’s actions if she failed to seal a Brexit deal later this year.Ministers were demanding Tory MPs vote it out of existence in the Commons on Tuesday, but had also refused to consider the\u0026nbspmore palatable compromise proposed by Mr Grieve.It would have instead seen Ms May being tied into a strict timetable of having to set out her own proposals if she failed to seal a deal by November, and then gain parliamentary approval for them – while the stronger powers for MPs to direct her action would only come into play if a deal had still not been reached by February.Brexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

Macedonia is a candidate state for EU membership.Under the deal\u0026nbspthe country’s name would be changed to the Republic of Northern Macedonia, to reflect the existence of the Greek region of Macedonia on the other side of the border and the cultural claim Greeks see over it. The name would be used both internally by the government and externally when conducting foreign affairs.The accord was finalised\u0026nbspduring a phone call between Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and his Macedonian counterpart Zoran Zaev on Tuesday, and in return for the name change Greece would lift its vetoes on the country joining the EU and Nato.Both countries’ parliaments need to ratify the deal, and Macedonia is expected to hold a referendum on the issue. Nationalists in both countries are opposed to compromise and could yet derail the accord. The agreement is set to be formally signed on Saturday at Lake Prespa, which straddles the country’s border, and that of neighbouring Albania.There is no way back.“The name change will be implemented not only in the country\u0027s international relations but also domestically,” Mr Tsipras said in a televised press conference, while Mr Zaev, speaking separately, told his countrymen: “There is no way back.” The PM called on the opposition to back the name change and said it would guarantee access to the EU and Nato.In Greece, the right wing Independent Greeks party, which is in Mr Tsipras\u0027s governing coalition partner, has said it would oppose the agreement in a parliamentary vote – meaning the left wing prime minister will need to seek support from political opponents.Negotiations, which have been on and off for decades, have intensified in recent months under the oversight of EU, US, and German diplomats.Ancient Macedonia was the cradle of warrior king Alexander’s empire, but under the Romans the province of Macedonia was expanded to include territory ning Macedonia, as well as Bulgaria and Albania.Some Greeks have accused Macedonians, who speak a Slavic language, of appropriating aspects of Greek culture.

Macedonian authorities insist that the statue is of a “warrior on a horse” rather than the ancient Greek hero.As a goodwill gesture preceding the deal, in February of this year the Macedonian government renamed Skopje\u0027s airport, which was previously known as\u0026nbspSkopje Alexander the Great Airport, to Skopje International Airport.World news in picturesPope Francis arrives to lead the Wednesday general audience in Saint Peter\u0027s square at the VaticanUS President Donald Trump shakes hands with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during their historic meeting at the Capella Hotel on Sentosa island in Singapore.US President Donald Trump looking at a cake being brought for him during a working lunch with Singapore\u0027s Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong during his visit to The Istana, the official residence of the prime minister, in Singapore.

Addressing an audience that included the boxer Nikolai Valuev, he said the time had come to create a “permanent system” of interaction between the church and sports community.\u0026nbsp“Sport offers a way to elevate man’s physical and spiritual culture, and it should be a tool for the Church,” the head of the church said. “The task of an athlete is the same of a monk without self-control there can be no success.”\u0026nbspThe task of an athlete is the same of a monk without self-control there can be no successPriests across the country have played their part in preparing the country for the tournament. They have blessed the stadiums and the teams. They have delivered sermons on the Christian nature of team sports. On Wednesday, the Patriarch gave his own blessing to the tournament.\u0026nbspHe is expected to attend Thursday\u0027s grand opening – just as he did at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics. \u0026nbsp“The Patriarch wants to make the sports community more Christian,” press secretary Vakhtang Kipshidze tells\u0026nbspThe Independent. “The World Cup is great chance to do that, to help those new to the Church understand our spirituality.”\u0026nbspMore than 70 per cent of Russians identify as Christian, but most wear that badge lightly.If one recent survey is to believed, no more than 6 per cent actually attend mass. But having been neutered during the Soviet era, the Russian Orthodox Church is now very much a force to be reckoned with. Much of its new relevance comes from an ever-closer bond with the state.\u0026nbspUnder its current leadership, the Orthodox Church has embraced the key tenets of Putinism: nationalism, exceptionalism, traditionalism, and hostility to liberalism and gay rights.Some of its members played prominent roles in the Kremlin military campaigns in Syria and Ukraine, occasionally even blessing weapons systems.The Patriarch regularly declares his fondness for Mr Putin, and threw his weight behind the president’s recent re-election campaign. His “vivid” victory spoke of the unity of the nation, he said.\u0026nbspAt the Church of Saint Nicholas, a few blocks away, Father Alexander Shumsky is also, it seems, a fan.\u0026nbspPutin is a gift from God. And the World Cup was a gift from Putin. It is only thanks to our president, his determined efforts, that we have got the tournament in our country, thank the lord“Putin is a gift from God,” he tells The Independent. “And the World Cup was a gift from Putin. It is only thanks to our president, his determined efforts, that we have got the tournament in our country, thank the lord.”\u0026nbspFather\u0026nbspShumsky says the Russian World Cup will allow the Church to show the best of its traditional values to the world. It was only right for the Church to step in to “nourish” and “influence” the athletes. \u0026nbspThe priest, a former amateur footballer, says he is looking forward to seeing his favourite players on Russian soil. From the current crop, he likes the “traditionalist” Lionel Messi – “He’s a believer, you see it when he crosses himself after scoring a goal. A good lad, someone who loves his family.”Away from the World Cup: the secret lives of goalposts in RussiaA boy hangs from a goalpost in St. PetersburgSelf-made goalposts stand on a soccer pitch in Verkhnyaya Biryusa village, located in the Taiga area near the Russian Siberian city of KrasnoyarskA boy rides a bicycle near a goalpost in Yevpatoria, CrimeaHay fills a goalpost during the traditional Cossack games outside the village of Arkhonskaya in the Republic of North Ossetia, AlaniaA car is seen through a goalpost while driving along a road in the Siberian village of TyulkovoChildren play at a goalpost during the traditional Cossack games outside the village of Arkhonskaya in the Republic of North Ossetia, AlaniaA goalpost stands in the village of Pribrezhnoye, CrimeaPeople and dogs walk near a goalpost on the Ostrov Otdykha (the Island of Rest), located in the middle of the Yenisei RiverA boy rides a gyro-scooter near a goalpost on a football pitch in the Siberian town of DivnogorskCossacks sit on a bench next to a goalpost covered with a screen during the traditional Cossack games outside the village of Arkhonskaya in the Republic of North OssetiaA goalpost stands in front of an Orthodox church in the Siberian village of Tyulkovo Goalposts lay on the ground as people gather at a flooded beach on the bank of the Volga River in SamaraA goalpost stands in YevpatoriaA man sits on a goalpost in the settlement of Novo-Schedrinskaya, ChechnyaA participant is seen through a goalpost during an amateur football tournament at the Zenit Arena, a stadium made from straw, in StravropolA goalpost in a yard of a Stalin-era high-rise building in MoscowGoats walk near a goalpost in the village of Pervomayskoye, CrimeaA goalpost stands at a tourist centre on the bank of the Belyo Lake in the Republic of Khakassia, SiberiaA goalpost stands in the town of Dolgoprudny in the Moscow regionA man runs near goalposts on a football pitch in a settlement in Stavropol regionA dog stands near a goalpost in Ryazantsevo settlement in Yaroslavl regionChildren play with a puppy near a goalpost on a football pitch in the Siberian settlement of NovosyolovoA goalpost stands in the village of Lesnovka, Saksky district, CrimeaA goalpost stands in the village of Zhuravli, CrimeaA man rides a horse near a goalpost in the village of Bolshaya Dzhalga in Stavropol regionA goalpost stands in Sevastopol, CrimeaA cadet holds a model of a sword in front of a goalpost as he trains at the stadium of the General Yermolov Cadet School in StavropolA goalpost stands in the village of Glinka, Saksky region, CrimeaHe is not so keen on Cristiano Ronaldo – “A bit different, isn’t he, from a liberal background.”\u0026nbspFather Shumsky came to prominence during the last World Cup in Brazil, when he declared the tournament to be the work of Sodom. The basis for his judgement appeared to be because some of the players were playing in bright pink boots.\u0026nbsp“I felt it wasn’t right, blue boots are much more masculine,” he says today. “I\u0027m totally against all these rainbow images too.If official statements are to be believed, Father Shumsky will be left disappointed by this World Cup too. Organisers have promised that the World Cup will be an LGBT+ friendly event, and traditional Russian state hostility to gay rights is set to be toned down for a month. There will be no prosecutions for unveiling rainbow symbols inside the stadium.\u0026nbspThe leader of a nationalistic vigilante group\u0026nbspassociated with the Church said he hoped Russian traditions would be enough to “discipline” visitors.“Perhaps the visitors might act differently in other countries, but in Russia people are simply forced to respect our thousands of years of history and culture,” says Andrei Kormukhin, leader of the 40x40 movement.Russia would prove to be the most hospitable nation on earth – “but there will be no gays with bare bottoms out on the streets of Moscow.”\u0026nbspIn Russia people are simply forced to respect our thousands of years of history and culture ...\u0026nbspthere will be no gays with bare bottoms out on the streets of MoscowThough not actually listed among official attendees, Mr Kormukhin says his organisation was among those participating in the Church’s new sports commission. \u0026nbsp“Putin has said that by 2024, 55 per cent of Russians should be doing sport, so of course the Church needs to establish themselves in the country\u0027s sporting life,”\u0026nbsphe says.\u0026nbspGiven recent miserable form, some have joked that the full force of Russian spirituality is not yet established within the national football team.\u0026nbspOn Wednesday, Patriarch Kirill seemed to address such concerns, calling for the country to “hope and pray” that the Russian team played well.\u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

She had a friend over.SWNSVintage Cash Cow said most coins they receive are only worth their weight in metalWe sat down and asked if she was sitting comfortably and I just told her we\u0027ve got some very good news for her.There was a big gasp and her friend was smiling and then it was \u0027oh my god, what do we do now?\u0027\u0026nbspShe actually said, \u0027Is this real? Oh my good god\u0027 Then her friend said is this a joke and then the shock took over.She was very taken aback... just a typical grandmother you would go round to tea on a Friday afternoon - a very nice lady with a very nice tidy clean home.It was just in some coins that her grandfather had given to her. She had no idea whatsoever.We receive literally tonnes of coins and much of this is only worth its weight in metal.But this distinctive coin immediately stood out. Given its value, we decided to share the good news face to face with the owner and her trusted friend.Her other items were worth \u0026pound150 and I think she was already delighted with that, but thought a house visit was a little over the top.We then revealed the valuation of the Charles 1st coin and she nearly fell off her chair.SWNSAntony Charman said \u0027people are often embarrassed to take items to valuers\u0027Mr Charman, who co-founded Vintage Cash Cow said the coin was commissioned by a pastor called Thomas Rawlins in Oxford before mintage records were made.Mr Rawlins was the engraver and commissioner. He was appointed engraver of seals stamps and medals at Oxford in 1643 and was the favoured coin engraver of Charles I.Mr Charman added: We are excited to have found it for her. It shows that things don\u0027t slip through.My theory is that with her grandfather being a fisherman, he may have got it on the docks.Fishermen were notorious drunks so it may have changed hands in the pubs.We\u0027ve had things from publicans when a grandfather took it in a pub for payment for drink.Our priority now is getting the best deal possible for the owner, which means working with an auction house that will understand the prestige value of selling such a rare coin and keep commission fees sensible.A spokesman for the online valuers said: Whilst clearing out her attic she found the long-forgotten box and offered it to her children, who politely declined what they saw as worthless junk.She considered just binning the box but decided to post it, for free, to Leeds-based Vintage Cash Cow, alongside other items of costume jewellery and a silver plated tea set.Vintage Cash Cow is now organising the auction of the coin, which is likely to take place in either London, New York or Hong Kong.It is expected to fetch in excess of \u0026pound100,000, with coin collectors attracted by its rarity and exceptionally good condition.The owner plans to use the windfall to take an overseas cruise as well as helping her granddaughter, currently expecting her first child, to fund a house deposit.The coin was saved from the bin thanks to Vintage Cash Cow\u0027s no hassle, no haggle online service, said Mr Charman.He said: People are often embarrassed to take items to valuers in person and don\u0027t have the time to list multiple items on auction sites.We\u0027re addressing that by letting people send us stuff in bulk to get a free valuation. Hopefully this means more valuable items will be saved from landfill."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/1/590x/Manchester-shooting-Ashton-973824-973834.jpg","title":"london news fenchurch street c2c rush hour tickets greater anglia london underground","story":"EXPRESSFenchurch Street station was plunged into chaos on Wednesday evening following overhead line faultsChaos hit Fenchurch Street station on Wednesday evening (June 13) after a fault to lines left commuters stranded.At around 6.15pm BST, c2c - the company that operates trains towards Southend and Shoeburyness - tweeted that defective rails and damage to overhead lines had caused disruption and cancellations of services.The company also said that Greater Anglia services towards Shoeburyness via West Ham and Southend Central have also been affected.\u0026nbspThe official c2c Twitter read: Due to damage to the overhead wires causing cancellations from Fenchurch Street and Greater Anglia also experiencing disruption, customers are advised to take the underground to Upminster.If you are able to travel later on this evening, this is also being advised.This is a breaking story.

The most dangerous would be a mortal blow to the Government’s negotiating hand and could trigger a new election.Another one on Wednesday would be a giant step towards shackling ourselves forever inside an EU customs union, without any power over its decisions. That’s the worst possible Brexit, a catastrophe.Monday nights fudge between the two wings of the Tory party is still a risk — and merely postpones an inevitable showdown next month.In the end MPs must have faith in our great country, our extraordinary talent and our ability to thrive outside the EU. And, if they respect the democracy that has put them where they are, they must trust the decision we took.Todays “meaningful vote” amendment, if passed, would wreck the Government’s negotiating position in Brussels. That is already weak enough... Theresa May has made far too many compromises and is doing far too little to prepare Britain for a “no deal”. But this new move would be deadly.It would enable Parliament to reject any deal we strike with Brussels and force the Government to go back and keep negotiating. It would strip Mrs May of the power to walk away.The EU could offer us a derisory and punitive deal knowing Parliament had compelled the Government to accept it in the end. It would be like haggling with a used car salesman who knows you have to pay whatever he wants.The diehard Remainers running an orchestrated, multi-million pound campaign to keep Britain in the EU are relying on this vote to upend the process. It could trigger a second referendum or an election which Corbyn’s Marxist wrecking crew could win.Tory rebels must have nothing to do with it. It is their duty to give the Government the strongest possible hand in negotiating our exit and a future trade deal.Another vote on Wednesday seeks to push us into a restrictive customs union with the EU. That would place us permanently and powerlessly under Brussels’ control — with no say over it, nor any ability to sign our own deals around the world.Free trade with America, China, India, Australia, Canada and New Zealand? Forget it.Remain-backing MPs pretend this — and staying in the single market — represent “soft Brexit”, a compromise to reflect that 48 per cent voted Remain. But they are fatal to Brexit and they know it.Either would be a far worse deal than we have had before. They are a ruse to engineer a new vote to stay in.We get that Europhile MPs hate Brexit. But they are there to represent their voters, not advance personal agendas.For some Tories and many Labour MPs the decision should be blindingly obvious: their own constituencies voted Leave. The manifestos on which they then stood for election last year promised to leave both the single market and customs union.Do they seriously believe it right to betray their voters and their own doorstep promises?Most people are too busy to follow the daily ins and outs as the Brexit debate grinds on. Outside the London political bubble, they imagine it’s done and dusted. They just want to get on with leaving. And in full.It has barely occurred to them that many politicians never accepted the result, have waged war on it relentlessly and are closer than ever to victory.Imagine the explosion of anger if that happens. If, today or next month, Tory Remainers vote with Labour’s opportunists to defy the biggest democratic mandate in British history. If MPs, having approved the EU Withdrawal Bill once already, back wrecking amendments drafted by unelected peers bent on destroying Brexit.That rage won’t even be limited to Leavers. Many Remainers also consider it vital to fulfil the result of the vote in full. They know staying in the single market or customs union is not leaving. It is a suicidal, half-baked Brexit.Why would anyone trust our democracy again if we took such a course, in defiance of the referendum result?The Sun understands the Tory rebels’ fears for the economy and jobs post-Brexit. We believe we may well be in for a rocky ride short-term, before the longer-term benefits pan out.But everyone should read the authoritative view from ex-Aussie Prime Minister Tony Abbott — who initially backed Remain but is brimming with confidence over what he considers a golden opportunity for this country, even if we never strike any deal with Brussels.The Sun understands, too, the worries many Remainers have that Britain could become less ­liberal, less open and more prejudiced against foreign migrants after Brexit. We whole-heartedly believe that’s unfounded.Brits are becoming MORE welcoming, secure now in the knowledge we are at last about to get the same control over numbers every non-EU country enjoys.On these two ​vital days for Brexit — and further votes next month — The Sun says this to backbench Tories: Have faith in the people of Britain.They made the right decision on Brexit and they will make it work... if you allow your Government to give them the chance.THE most Eurosceptic people in Britain are calling on Theresa May to make good on her promise that Brexit means Brexit.The Lincolnshire town’s Tory MP Matt Warman was a Remainer but now advocates a “clean break” from Europe in agreement with 74.9 per cent of his constituents.Office worker Beverly Iles, 67, said: “We should have come straight out. We shouldn’t be still messing about with all this.”Retired council worker Brian Isam, 75, said: “We don’t need soft Brexit. We didn’t pay Europe a penny when we went in and we should not pay them a penny to get out.”THE people of Hull want Theresa May to wave goodbye to the Eurocrats now.In the East Yorkshire city, the leave vote was 68 per cent, although Labour MP Karl Turner was a Remainer.Happy Cakes manager Debbie Scaife, 56, said uncertainty had driven up the price of ingredients.She added: “Mrs May, I call on you to do this for us now.“The British public voted to leave. They didn’t want five years of hell.”Retailer Vicky Paddey, 37, said: “I voted for Brexit and I’m proud to say that — it was what people wanted then and they still want it now. If we end up with a soft Brexit, a lot of these shops in this city centre will not survive it.”IN the North East, some impatient voters are calling for dithering Mrs May to go.Voters in Gateshead went 56.8 per cent in favour of leaving in 2016, against the wishes of Labour MP Ian Mearns.Florist Dawn Athey, 41, said: “I think Theresa May should resign.“She’s not the person I thought she was going to be.“I think she’s scared of being the Prime Minister who’s going to take us out of the EU.”And Jude Ditchburn, 51, from Gateshead, said: “I think she is betraying the country and not doing what people want.FORMER Tory Cabinet minister Nicky Morgan is a leading Remoaner — but in her Leicestershire constituency people want to get on with Brexit.The area voted 50.1 per cent in favour of leaving the EU.Brexit backer Andrew Cooper, 56, said: “They are dragging their feet, the people have voted for this and they need to do what the people asked them to do.”Cedric Hewitt, 90, said: “I think Theresa May ought to get her finger out and get on with it. It’s what the British people wanted.”And David Greasley, 85, a former quality control engineer, said: “I voted out and simply want out.”HARD Brexit opponent and Conservative MP Anna Soubry wants Britain to be shackled with a customs union.Now, they want her party to carry out their wishes.Ray James, 82, and Elsie James, 80, said: “We think the Government are failing to get things sorted. It is taking a long, long time and no people thought it would take this long.”John Wilson, 68, said the Government was clueless on disentangling from the single market. “It has become a shambles,” he added.TOTNES MP Sarah Wollaston switched sides during the referendum campaign and became a Remainer.But she is out of step with her Devon constituency, where 53.9 per cent voted in favour of leaving the EU.Christine Williams, 64, said she was disappointed with Dr Wollaston.“I don’t know if I can now vote for her in the next election,” she added.Butcher Chris McCabe, 70, blamed Theresa May for the slow progress.He said: “This is like the Champions League final and we are at half-time.“She still has a chance but she needs to get her team in order so they can go back out and win this.”WHILE the capital was the heartland of Remain, in Bromley, South London, there was a paper-thin majority of 50.6 per cent in favour of staying in the EU. Tory MP Bob Neill is a Remainer.Gardener David Alden, 52, said: “It’s been dragged out for a reason. They know how to grind people down and tire them out. The elites want one thing and try any way to get it. They want to stop Brexit.”Retired software developer Steve Johnson, 58, said: “They are trying to come up with these fudges — ways to try to renege on the will of the people without outwardly doing so.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Endangered not only by parliamentarians who never really accepted the referendum result, but by the Government’s negotiating approach, which risks delivering an exit from the EU which fails to deliver the control Britons voted for.When, on June 23, 2016, 17.4million people went to the polls to vote for Britain to chart a new course for itself outside of the European Union, they would never have imagined that, almost two years on, Parliament would still be debating whether to keep this country as — essentially — a non-voting member of the EU.Or that their government would still not have set out a detailed blueprint for this country’s relationship with the EU once we have left. So what has gone wrong and who is to blame?There are TWO BASIC RULES of negotiation. Know what you want and do not go into a negotiation unless you are prepared to walk away.Theresa May’s government has FAILED BOTH OF THESE TESTS.Even now, the Government can not say what it wants Britain’s customs arrangements with the EU to be after Brexit. Instead, we’ll have to wait for two working groups to report back before the Cabinet makes up its mind.This failure to know what it is trying to achieve has hobbled Britain in these negotiations — and handed the initiative to the hardliners in the European Commission. Mrs May must take the blame for this.She should never have triggered Article 50, the two-year process for leaving the EU, until she had a clear and precise idea of what she wanted the exit deal to look like.It has also meant that, in the absence of clear UK aims, those conducting the negotiations have treated the whole thing as a damage-limitation exercise.As the Brexit Secretary David Davis, who has been sidelined in the talks in favour of the civil servant Olly Robbins, complains in private, the civil service is not suited to negotiating.It struggles to deal with European chief negotiator Michel Barnier’s take-it-or-leave-it tactics.But the biggest mistake has been the failure to rigorously prepare for no deal. Mrs May used to emphasise that “no deal is better than a bad deal”.But she has never followed through on that rhetoric. There has been no big national effort to get this country as ready as it could be to walk away from the talks.There is plenty of blame to go round for this. The Treasury — aided by the Chancellor Philip Hammond — has refused to make planning for no deal a priority.Why? Because it feared if there was a plan for no deal, the Brexiteers would end up using it. Better, it thought, to make minimal preparations for it to ensure the UK stayed at the negotiating table.But this got it ALL WRONG. The best way to avoid no deal was to plan for it. For WEAKNESS IS PROVOCATIVE. The EU looks at how unready Britain is to walk away and turns the screw.Would Michel Barnier’s team feel free to be so dismissive about Britain’s proposals if they thought we might simply walk out of the talks, taking our £39billion divorce payment with us?It is worth remembering that a report from the House of Lords, hardly a hotbed of Brexiteer sentiment, concluded that Britain was under no legal obligation to pay ANYTHING AT ALL to the EU on leaving.The Government risks being left with the most unpalatable of choices: No deal or stay in a customs union with the EU and the European Economic Area, leaving Britain as, effectively, a non-voting member of the EU.Senior EU figures think they can do this because they do not see any serious attempt by the UK to properly prepare for no deal.If this country had made preparations for going it alone that were so big they were visible from the other side of the Channel, the EU would be engaging in the negotiations in a far more constructive manner and Britain would be on course to secure a much better deal.Leave-supporting Cabinet ministers can not escape their share of the blame for this, either.They should have been far more assertive and pushed for serious no deal planning.They should have insisted that Cabinet was updated every fortnight on Britain’s preparedness to walk away without a deal.They should have demanded that the Government had serious and credible contingency plans to deal with disruption to cross-Channel trade. They should have told Mrs May they would resign if Hammond would not provide the funds necessary to make no deal planning a reality.But there is, as the minutes of the Brexit Inner Cabinet’s most recent meeting make clear, another reason why “EU ministers had no fear of no deal”.They “observed the UK Parliament and prominent Remainers, who had formed a cross-party alliance against Brexit, and thought there was no chance of no deal”.Too many MPs voted for a referendum on our EU membership, then were not prepared to genuinely accept the result when they lost. Too many Tories were prepared to stand at last year’s General Election on a manifesto of leaving the single market and the customs union that they were not actually committed to. That is not being straight with the voters.One of the other reasons EU ministers are not worried about no deal is Mrs May’s loss of the Tory majority in that snap election.Ever since Britain voted for Brexit, the EU has feared the emergence of an alternative economic model on its doorstep.It worried Britain might become a hyper-competitive, low-tax economy 26 miles off its coastline.They expected that Britain would respond to no deal by slashing taxes and regulation to make up for the failure to strike a trade deal with the EU. This gave the EU an incentive to come to an agreement with us.But when the Tory majority disappeared, so did this fear. It is clear this hung parliament does not have the stomach for such a course.Indeed, Mr Hammond said in Germany in January that we would change our “economic model” if we could not get a good trade deal, then took that threat off the table in a visit to France the month after the election. He, unhelpfully, told the French press we would keep up the European economic model even after Brexit.The next big British mistake has been its handling of the Irish border issue. The history of Northern Ireland meant this subject needed to be treated with care. A return to every vehicle being stopped would clearly have been a recipe for trouble.But Britain should never have agreed in December that no new physical infrastructure at the border meant there could not even be number plate recognition cameras.The decision to rule these out has made it far harder to use technology to try to solve the border issues and has been grist to the mill of those who want to use Northern Ireland as a device to keep the whole of the UK in a customs union and “high alignment” with the EU and unable to strike comprehensive free-trade deals with other countries.The Government now finds itself urging the EU to accept a UK-wide “backstop” in an attempt to try to get beyond the Irish border issue knowing that the EU will break off trade talks before they have really begun if there is not progress on this.This backstop, though, is not a good deal for the UK. It would see Britain stuck in a customs union with the EU and following all of Brussels’ rules on goods, yet with no say in making them. It would provide a trade solution for goods, where the EU sells £135billion more to us than we do to them, but not for services, where we sell £92billion more to them.In these circumstances, would the EU really be rushing to complete a trade deal with us? Of course not. It would be in their interest to drag things out, knowing that the backstop would remain in place.If the House of Commons votes for the House of Lords amendment to keep Britain in a customs union with the EU or to take no deal off the table, it will weaken Britain’s negotiating position still further.It will make it almost inevitable that the only deal Brussels is prepared to offer Britain would leave this country as, essentially, a non-voting member of the EU.The Government has made many mistakes in its handling of these negotiations. But this is no excuse for Parliament to compound these errors.MPs should reject these amendments today and the House of Lords should respect the will of the elected House of Commons when the bill returns to it.Then, the Government should get its act together.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A Brexit that leaves it half in, half out and subject to EU rules it has no say over would be a disaster but that’s what seeking a deal at any price will lead to.As one of Britain’s many friends abroad, please accept my assurance that you don’t need a customs union to prosper.Without being in a customs union with Europe, and without any free trade deal with it, Australia does nearly $100billion a year in trade with Europe.In the two years of my prime minister-ship, Australia finalised free trade deals with our three biggest export markets: China, Japan and South Korea.So my advice to Britain is: Stop fretting! It IS possible to trade successfully under the WTO rules which already govern 55 per cent of Britain’s exports and it IS possible to do good deals with your main trading partners once you are free to do so, as Australia’s experience abundantly demonstrates.Let’s say, out of spite, the EU refuses to offer Britain a satisfactory bargain.Britain already imports goods from Europe free of tariffs and quotas. Britain already recognises European standards and credentials. Just declare that you will continue to do so.Trade from Europe to Britain would be absolutely free. And even if the Europeans — in an attempt to hurt Britain that would actually damage them — apply the same tariffs to Britain as they do to the US, the fall in the Pound would make British exports at least as competitive in Europe as they are now.Britain should still be the best place from which to export to Europe or to service Europe — because it has the freest markets, a can-do culture and will no longer have EU officials trying to harmonise away its competitive advantage.No new Brussels directives will apply in the UK. British courts will no longer be subject to European ones. And Britain need no longer admit everyone with an EU passport.Importantly, Britain will be able to strike trade deals with anyone it chooses without waiting for 27 other countries to sign up too.The coming Britain-Australia Free Trade Agreement should mean a dramatic increase in trade opportunities between our two countries without disadvantaging anyone else.First, there should be no tariffs or quotas on any goods traded between our two countries — there should be no exceptions, no carve outs, nothing. And second, there should be full recognition of each country’s credentials and standards.Because Australia and Britain are like-minded countries with similar systems and comparable standards of living, there should be no need for tortuous negotiation and labyrinthine detail.After all, Brit and Australian workers enjoy similar protections in the workplace: So why should they need elaborate protections against each other?Britain and Australia have comparable attitudes to job qualifications and product and service standards, so why should British rules be insufficient for Australia and vice versa?And Britons and Australians already have more than 200 years’ experience of each other, so why not allow them more freely to travel and work in each other’s country?This could be a template for the trade deals Britain could swiftly do with New Zealand and Singapore.On a similar basis, Britain could seek to join NAFTA, (North American Free Trade Agreement) which could become the North Atlantic Free Trade Area — and perhaps open to other free market economies seeking to escape the regulatory restraints and statism of the EU.Brexit could begin a process leading to genuinely freer global trade, rather than protectionist trade blocs.Brexit is a wonderful opportunity for Britain and the wider world — if only British leaders are prepared to make the most of it.So go for it Britain, for all our sakes!Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

An endless, choking diet of documentaries, live events, lectures, news items and outright bollockings, from the BBC, all to celebrate the 100th anniversary of women getting the vote.Not one of which had as much impact as Love Island’s “Girl Power” task on ITV2, involving super-hero capes, bikinis, large items of fruit and narrator Iain Stirling explaining: “The girls will squish melons with their bums. Slowest girl to crush her melon is out of the contest.”Just part of the reason I adore a show which pricks pomposity and political correctness like ­nothing else on British television and is dedicated to no other purpose than entertaining its viewers. That’s the ideal, anyway.The reality’s been a bit more disappointing, so far, probably due to the excessive hype and sense of deja vu with contestants on either half of the gender divide.Both operate a squad rotation system, of course, but among the main players on the blokes’ side, we have painfully shy ­doctor Alex, with all the presence of a fire extinguisher, Jack who “got his teeth in Turkey”, possibly by ripping them from a feral mountain goat’s mouth, and this year’s comedy figure Niall, who’s “an investment for the future”, a bit like Betamax video tapes, and “multi-layered”, like a landfill site.Click here to play our Love Island games - and win a £10,000 holiday for you and three friendsThere’s the compulsory personal trainer, as well, of course — Adam, who seems to have the run of the females, plus strong silent type Wes and fluffy-haired Eyal, pronounced “Eeeeh-al”, “Oooh-all”, or just “Aaaah-sole”, if you prefer.Quite the ­profound one, is Eyal, forever banging on about “auras” and his spirituality while insisting: “I want to find someone here with depth.”A claim which, surely, represents the very height of human optimism given the most profound question all of the girls were asking last week was: “Where’s your head at?”In Kendall’s case, it was “literally all over the place”. One of her eyes was in Majorca, another in Ibiza and her ­forehead was somewhere in the Cote d’Azur. She’s gone though now, leaving, among significant others: Samira, Georgia, Rosie, super- manipulative Hayley and Laura, a former air stewardess who’s ­covered in more make-up than the giraffe in a theatre ­production of The Lion King.Most of the hype, however, has centred around the ­presence of Dani Dyer, the daughter of EastEnders actor Danny Dyer. But you knew that already, didn’t you, possibly because you read it in the paper and possibly because you saw her perform exactly the same big reveal on ITV2’s Survival Of The Fittest a couple of months ago. A doubling up that blows my mind, frankly.Because you expect hit shows to be copied by other fringe channels.What you don’t expect is ITV2 to abuse the basic law of ­supply and demand by copying its own format. A move that doesn’t help Love Island at all. It stops it being an event, in fact, and just makes viewers think this sort of crap is on all year.Personally, I think that’s a shame. Love Island genuinely deserves to be a huge success again. Not only is it one of the funniest and most UN-PC shows on TV, it’s also a series that can actually make you feel glad to be old and half-crippled by your medical complaints, rather than the youthful insecurity and stupidity which has gripped this bunch, who really did surpass themselves, on Friday.Georgia: “What do you think of Brexit?”Hayley: “What’s that?”“We’re leaving the EU so things like welfare and, like, things we trade with would all be cut down.”“So that means we wouldn’t have any trees?”“Cheese?” “No, trees.” “Oh.”Emmeline Pankhurst, your work here on Earth was not in vain.(Love Island, ITV2, 9pm).HAVING discovered Danny Dyer is the rightful heir to the English throne, BBC1 really should’ve knocked it on the head with Who Do You Think You Are?Until such time as one of the researchers can prove Danniella Westbrook is the rightful heir to the Romanov dynasty and the Imperial Highness of all Russia.So they must have been flipping cartwheels at HQ when they discovered the great-great-grandmother of this week’s guest, ex-Corrie star Michelle Keegan had her birth certificate signed by registrar Emmeline Pankhurst, leader of the Suffragettes.A much greater honour, in the Beeb’s book, than three wise men and some shepherds turning up at your crib, but a detail that was probably as dull as ditch water for most viewers.The far more interesting thing to emerge during the hour, I thought, was Michelle’s own staggering ignorance of life, the world and everything.She had, for instance, no idea where Genoa was and gave a genuinely staggering response when a local historian told her: “By 1940 your family will have been torn apart, like every other family in Gibraltar, at the time.”“Why?”(Pause) “The Second World War.”You wondered then if the show would ever get round to revealing if the plank gene had entered her family tree through the maternal or paternal line.Then Michelle Skyped her mum and, waving a frothy cup of coffee at the screen, said: “Guess where I am. I’ll give you a clue, I’m drinking a cappuccino . . . ”“France?”Mystery solved.Loose Women, Russell Brand, with Janet Street-Porter: “Everyone is so beautiful here.”Good Morning Britain, roly-poly Piers Morgan: “When I grew up, I loved Frosties and it never did me any harm.”And Love Island, Samira: “I can sing, I can dance, I can act.” (Bursts into song).She can’t sing.NEVER, in all its ten-series history, has ITV’s love lift been quite as badly needed as it was on Saturday’s brilliant, one-off Take Me Out special for the “over-50s”.A slightly generous description, I thought, given the 30 game old birds looked like they had the combined age of the Pyramids.The fire still burns down below, though, evidently, as a queue of lights remained on for George, the midget Zumba teacher with the wooden teeth, Lawrence, the Billy Connolly lookalike from Ibiza, and even “bouncing Bill”, the ex-policeman, above, who emerged from Paddy McGuinness’s love lift gasping for breath and telling the women: “Every night, when I go to sleep, I like to think I’ve made someone’s life better. What would your motto be?”Fingers crossed, I’d imagine.Lee Dixon: “I like Alexander-Arnold because he gives you half a goal.”Ian Wright: “Harry Kane is still getting back to where he is.”And Glenn Hoddle: “By the time the World Cup starts, today will be history.”(Compiled by Graham Wray)Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “In 1883 which luxury train service ran between Paris and the city now called Istanbul?” Alice: “The Eurostar.”Ben Shephard: “The former Labour MP Ed Balls married which politician in 1998?” Phil: “Theresa May.”The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “The plumage of what flightless bird was used as a medieval helmet decoration?” Geoff: “Eagle.”And Ben Shepherd: “How many of the eight planets in our solar system have the letter A in their name?”Harj: “I think the answer to that is one.

the populations of nine species including hedgehogs, water voles, hazel dormice and even rabbits, have declined in the last 20 years.The number of hedgehogs has fallen by up to 73 per cent to leave only 522,000.There are 287,000 red squirrels compared to 2.7million grey squirrels.Water vole populations are down to 132,000 – around a tenth of what they were in the 1990s.There is better news for some species, with the otter population rebounding up to around 11,000.Pine martens, polecats and badgers are also recovering.The loneliest mammal is the greater mouseeared bat.The report said that there was a single, ringed male, which has visited West Sussex to hibernate since 2002.Wildcats, which are down to only 200 animals, were listed as critically endangered, one step from becoming extinct in the wild as was the native black rat.Fiona Mathews, president of the British Mammal Society, which led the study, said: Its probably worse than one in five, it could be as bad as one in three species at risk of extinction.Researchers examined 1.5million records of mammals across Britain and estimated how populations had changed since previous studies in the 1990s.The study, commissioned by government agency Natural England, found that 12 out of 58 species were at risk of extinction, although a lack of data means the true figure is likely to be higher.The 12 are wildcats, greater mouse-eared bats and black rats, which are all critically endangered, the highest threat category red squirrels, beavers, water voles and grey long-eared bats, which are endangered and hedgehogs, hazel dormice, Orkney voles, serotine bats and barbastelle bats, which are vulnerable.Threats to mammals include loss of habitat such as ancient woodland, invasive species that prey on them or compete for food, and diseases introduced by humans or other animals.Tony Juniper, of the World Wide Fund for Nature, said: “Its hard to imagine Britain without hedgehogs or red squirrels, but this is the future were facing unless urgent action is taken.

She added: “With the climate that we are seeing, so many campaigns — I mean #MeToo and Time’s Up.“There is no better time to really continue to shine a light on women feeling empowered and people really helping to support them — men included in that.“It makes such a tremendous difference.

In Scotland they would no doubt call it a \"rammy\".Stunts like this succeed because the TV cameras capture it all, the MP shown the red card is pursued all over SW1 for interviews and an obscure issue that might not have been reported gets huge coverage. From my vantage point high up in the Commons press gallery behind the speaker\u0027s chair, from where I\u0027ve witnessed countless ejections and walkouts in more than 35 years reporting parliament, it was clear that the SNP\u0027s 35 MPs knew exactly what was coming.As soon as their leader was given his marching orders by Mr Bercow, they all followed him out, some of them making what looked like obscene gestures towards the speaker and the group of 13 Scottish Conservatives who sit opposite them in the chamber and goad them constantly. Amid uproar in the chamber, Joanna Cherry, a QC and a leading figure at the Scottish Bar, left making derogatory hand movements towards the speaker with her Commons papers, in a gesture and with a disdain that would earn her a long suspension from the courtrooms of Scotland, I imagine.Chris Law, Angus MacNeil and Tommy Sheppard also appeared to be shouting aggressively at the Scottish Conservative MPs.But the most aggressive of the SNP MPs as they all marched out of the chamber, perhaps not surprisingly, was Mhairi Black, who was pointing angrily and shouting at the Scottish Tory MPs as if she was challenging them to a fight. The SNP drama began after an entertaining spat between Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn. The Labour leader began their exchanges by mercilessly mocking Boris Johnson\u0027s suggestion at a dinner last week that Donald Trump should be put in charge of Brexit negotiations.But the prime minister ended their clash with a hilarious gag at the expense of Mr Corbyn over his \"LabourLive\" event, which has been ridiculed over slow ticket sales, claiming the headline act at the gig was \"John McDonnell and the magic numbers\".Then it was Mr Blackford\u0027s turn. First he asked a rather long-winded question which ended with a demand that the Commons should sit in private. Really?So let me get this right. The SNP leader wanted the Commons to sit in private to help the party\u0027s case for Scotland\u0027s case to be heard.No, me neither. Mr Bercow, who was clearly enjoying being at the centre of attention once again - TV pictures showed him grinning during his clash with Mr Blackford - told him he would allow a vote on sitting in private at the end of PMQs but not in the middle of the session.A clerk then helpfully supplied the speaker with a document showing a standing order, number 43, for him to quote to MPs.A distinguished scribbler sitting next to me in the gallery - an acclaimed author these days - thought Mr Bercow was losing control. I\u0027m not so sure about that.But when he did order him out, at first Mr Blackford sat rooted to the green bench below the gangway on the opposition side of the chamber.Strangely, the new Sergeant at Arms, Kamal El-Hajji, who hours earlier had defended Mr Bercow against his critics and claimed he is the victim of a witch-hunt, was not in his usual seat just feet away from the SNP benches.Unusually, for this PMQs the Sergeant at Arms\u0027 seat was occupied by one of his female deputies, slight in stature and no match physically for Mr Blackford.But after a few moments, Mr Blackford eventually lifted himself off the bench and walked slowly towards the Bar of the House, where these days female government whips stand in a line. Wisely, they parted to allow him to leave and then the mass exodus followed behind their leader, with the noise levels in the chamber now excessive even by the raucous standards of PMQs.Was it worth it? Five SNP MPs with questions on the order paper lost their chance to quiz the prime minister. But they won\u0027t mind that. Their stunt has ensured them far more publicity than worthy questions about Scottish fishers, crofters or RBS bank closures.The SNP, it should be said, has some form on this type of stunt. Back in 1988, Alex Salmond was thrown out and suspended for five days for \"disorderly conduct\".John McDonnell, now shadow chancellor, was thrown out in 2009 for seizing the mace in a row over Heathrow expansion. (He wasn\u0027t the first to go for this offence - Michael Heseltine grabbed it in a heated Commons flare-up in 1976).Dennis Skinner holds the record for parliamentary red cards. He has been thrown out six times, most recently in 2016 for calling then prime minister David Cameron \"Dodgy Dave\". Back in 1984, Mr Skinner was thrown out for calling David Owen a \"pompous sod\". Asked to withdraw, he withdrew the word \"pompous\". In 1994, he called Tory minister John Gummer \"a little squirt\" and a year later accused John Major\u0027s government of a \"crooked deal\".The Tories\u0027 Commons partners the Democratic Unionists have form too. I well remember Ian Paisley being thrown out in 1993 and shouting to his then deputy, Peter Robinson, to join him, bellowing: \"Come on, Peter!\"In 2013, the DUP\u0027s Westminster leader Nigel Dodds was thrown out for accusing the then Northern Ireland secretary Theresa Villiers of \"falsehoods\". How times have changed. He showers Theresa May\u0027s ministers with praise these days.Parties walking out of the chamber is not new, either. In 2006, Nick Clegg led a walkout by Liberal Democrat MPs in a row with then speaker Michael Martin over - yes - an EU referendum, and, as the SNP MP Stephen Gethins pointed out later, Donald Dewar led a walkout of Scottish Labour MPs in the 1980s. At the end of this PMQs, Mr Bercow drew attention to a baby - belonging to Labour MP Clive Lewis - in the gallery up above the benches on the Conservative side of the chamber.\"For all the turbulence and discord of today\u0027s proceedings, the little baby who has been observing them has been a model of impeccable behaviour from start to finish,\" he said, prompting MPs to applaud."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/06/2048x1152/world-cup-sky-news_4335130.jpg?20180613150135 ","title":"united states canada and mexico to jointly host 2026 world cup","story":"US soccer president Carlos Corderio said after his bid\u0027s success on Wednesday: \"It\u0027s a bit emotional for us today.\"Thank you so, so very much for this incredible honour.\"Thank you for entrusting us with the privilege of hosting the FIFA World Cup in 2026.\"The beautiful game transcends borders and cultures.\"Football today is the only victor.\"And in that spirit we wish all Russian hosts and all the teams competing here the very best of luck.\"Despite the latest setback, Morocco vowed to continue its bid to host the tournament in future.Morocco FA president Fouzi Lekjaa said: \"I would like to reaffirm the determination of my country, Morocco, to continue to work for football, to work for the youth and also to realise some day our dream to host the World Cup in Morocco.\"Russian president Vladimir Putin had earlier made a speech at the congress, during which he praised FIFA\u0027s \"commitment to the principle of sports without politics\".England, like Morocco, knows the feeling of falling short in the bid to host the World Cup.The Football Association has not hosted the tournament since 1966, having failed in bids for the 1990, 2006 and 2018 tournaments.The FA was among the first to congratulate the US\u0027 joint bid with Mexico and Canada.

If that was not apparent before it is now blindingly obvious after yesterday’s farcical scenes .   Some form of deal has been struck with the Tory rebels which they were led to believe gives the Commons a meaningful vote in the event of a no deal scenario or if the Prime Minister has failed to negotiate a deal by November 30.   The Department for Brexit last night issued a statement saying this was not the case.   We shall find out the exact situation early next week when the government tables its revised amendment for consideration by the Lords.   It is impossible to see rebels such as Dominic Grieve caving in on this when he and his colleagues know they have the numbers to defeat the Government.     The Prime Minister is aware the Tory remainers have the whip hand .   Parliament will end up having a much greater say over the final Brexit outcome, meaning a no deal is now all but dead as an option and a soft Brexit much more likely.   The question then is how David Davis reacts. Will he swallow the concessions or finally fulfil one of his multiple threats to resign?   His fellow Brexiteers will be hyperventilating but their options are limited beyond shouting betrayal in a louder and louder voice.   They could topple the PM but any replacement would have no more room to engineer a hard Brexit than the current incumbent on No 10.   There is more Brexit action in the Commons today when MPs consider the final tranche of amendments to the Withdrawal Bill.   This will provide a brief respite for ministers as the focus is likely to be on the size of the Labour rebellion on a vote to join the European Economic Area.    This afternoon we have Prime Minister’s questions and you would suspect Jeremy Corbyn will raise the first anniversary of the Grenfell Tower disaster.

The stony-faced Prime Minister stood in virtual silence for 20 seconds while her Foreign Secretary chuckled during a vintage edition of the weekly clash. Labour\u0027s leader mocked the PM over a leaked recording of Boris mocking her Brexit plan and saying there would be a meltdown. The Foreign Secretary also called for Donald Trump to be put in charge of Brexit talks because actually you might get somewhere. Mr Corbyn asked Mrs May mockingly: Did she do as the Foreign Secretary suggested and ask him to take over the Brexit negotiations? The Tory leader stood up to reply - but no reply came. As Boris tittered, Labour MPs seized the brief delay to unleash a chorus of jeers.  Ashen-faced, she glared, smoothed over her papers and stared upwards as she tried to start her sentence until Speaker John Bercow called order. When she regained her composure she accused Labour of being the party that is divided - and accused Mr Corbyn of not understanding her plans himself. She explained her backup plan for customs - which could extend EU rules to 2022 (see below) - saying: Let me be very clear about what the backstop is. But Mr Corbyn, speaking at Prime Minister\u0027s Questions, remarked: I\u0027m not really sure if it’s a backstop or a backslide she’s talking about here. And Labour MPs jeered the words of the EU\u0027s chief Brexit negotiator: Backstop means backstop!  It comes amid a Tory row after Mrs May avoided defeat in a key vote last night on her EU Withdrawal Bill. She managed to persuade Tory rebels not to ask for a meaningful vote - which could\u0027ve stopped a no-deal Brexit - by offering a compromise. But Tory Remainers and Brexiteers were in a furious dispute this morning about exactly what that compromise meant, and whether it could give Brussels negotiators the upper hand.  Speaking at Prime Minister\u0027s Questions, Mr Corbyn said Hard Brexit-backing Boris Johnson inhabited a parallel universe and questioned when the PM would publish a long-awaited White Paper with the next steps of her plan. He called on her to delay a long-awaited EU summit this month while the government decides what its position actually is. But Mrs May said there was never due to be a Brexit deal at the summit - and hinted the White Paper will be published in July. She said only the Tories would deliver on the 52% vote of the British people to leave the EU - and Labour were trying to frustrate Brexit. Jabbing her finger at Labour, she added: If he wants to talk about differences of opinion I’ll tell him what division really is.  Division is members of the Labour Party circulating instruction manuals on how to deselect all the Labour MPs. Quoting Boris, however, Mr Corbyn shot back: You’ve got to face the fact there may now be a meltdown. He added: Meanwhile, the economy is weakening and industry is increasingly alarmed at the sheer ineptitude of her Government.  How much more damage is the Prime Minister going to do to the country before she realises the important thing is to get a deal for the people of this country, not one to appease the clashing giant egos of her Cabinet?  Mrs May ended on a joke about Labour\u0027s reportedly poorly-sellling music and politics festival this weekend. I\u0027ve heard the right honourable gentleman is trying to organise a music festival, Labour Live, she mocked. I’ll pass over the fact it’s going to have a solidarity tent which obviously won’t have any Labour MPs within it. The headline acts are the Shadow Chancellor and The Magic Numbers - just about sums them up! The EU has a customs union. This means all 28 member states can trade with each other without any checks or duties on goods. Theresa May has said Britain will leave this after December 2020, so she can sign trade deals with non-EU countries. But officials have warned a new UK customs system won\u0027t be ready in time. So they\u0027ve devised a \u0027backstop\u0027 - a backup plan that will carry on some EU customs rules in the UK if there\u0027s no deal. It is designed to stop ports grinding to a halt and Northern Ireland setting up border posts, which could lead to violence. Yet Brexiteers were furious because it had no set end date. In a huge Tory row, they warned it would trap Britain half-in, half-out the EU. After frantic last-minute talks, and threats to quit by Brexit Secretary David Davis, a time limit was put in - December 2021. Yet the government only expects to follow that time limit. It is not legally binding. And the EU poured cold water on it. Britain and the EU also disagree about what the backstop will do. EU plans back in March would have kept Northern Ireland aligned with Brussels customs rules, but Theresa May rejected this because it draws a border between the province and the mainland. So she drew up Britain\u0027s own backstop, which is now being put to the EU for discussion. The UK plan is a temporary customs arrangement allowing totally tariff-free trade between the EU and the whole of the UK. So the UK would carry on being in the EU Customs Union in all but name until December 2021. But the UK also wants to sign new trade deals with nations outside the EU. Britain even wants to implement parts of these deals that don\u0027t relate to the backstop. Brussels has repeatedly said this won\u0027t be possible - so the new plan is setting up for a big battle with the EU. And as time ticks on, the backstop will become less of a Plan B and more of a Plan A. It\u0027ll turn from backstop... to frontstop."},{"url":null,"title":"5 secret tips your kids","story":"News5 secret tips to get your kids interested in cooking from the TV dietitian Lucy JonesTalking to your kids about meals, preparing to cook in advance and let\u0027s them loose with the pans is the key to getting kids more involved in home cooking says TV dietitian Lucy Jones\u0026nbspShareByLucy JonesSteve Myall18:18, 13 JUN 2018NewsLucy enjoys cooking with her kids (Image: Lucy Jones)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email    Family dinner times are so important. Time spent cooking together in the kitchen and then sharing the food you\u0027ve prepared round the dinner table has a proven track record of improving emotional wellbeing, family bonding and developing healthy eating habits that stay with us through life. Lucy Jones is a dietitian who has appeared on TV and says: “We all know how crucial it is for our children to have a varied and balanced diet, however we are often too familiar with the daily struggles of not only having a tech-free dinner but to encourage children to eat more vegetables. “Research reveals that by introducing them to the stages that they necessarily wouldn’t be involved with and letting them choose what to eat for dinner gives children a sense of autonomy and as a result are more open to trying new things. Children may need to try new foods many times before they grow to like them to providing opportunity to do this is crucial in building a healthy palate. “That said, this can only be successful if there are perimeters to work within and not allowing them to reach for the pizza, burger option. Giving them a choice of healthy ingredients and offering different ways in which they can be cooked enables them to think different and act within those limits.”  Here are her Lucy\u0027s top tips on how to get your kids interested in cooking:         1) Work together Lots of families already recognise the role of family meals and have developed their own ways of making them work by giving children the choice - like doing the week’s meal plan together which means you get everyone’s buy in for meals that they all will enjoy. Take the plunge and let them choose what the family is going to have for dinner.  I know it might sound like a risky recipe but believe me, I know from my own family experience, it really helps them to understand the importance of balanced nutritious menus. And its loads of fun!  The key is giving choice within limits rather than free reign - three different meal ideas that they can choose and switch certain ingredients to make it interesting and enjoyable. Allowing them to choose doesn\u0027t mean fast food.    2) Gamify the food shop  Set challenges in the supermarket of finding a specific herb, comparing prices for an ingredient like pasta or even finding a food they have never seen or heard of before.     3) Let them become chefs Don’t be afraid to let them be involved. Obviously, safety is paramount in the kitchen but with appropriate supervision, children can do far more than we think. My 6-year-old loves cracking eggs, helping me chop vegetables (children’s safety knives are worth the investment), weighing out ingredients and setting the table too.       4) Preparation If you know time is tight in the evening, set the alarm 15 minutes early and do some prep in the morning to help.

But it ended in a sickening story of violence and death deep in the South American jungle. A cult leader who once preached peace and equality and railed against the violence of the global nuclear arms race now urged his followers towards death. Jim Jones was found shot in the head lying among the bodies of 909 followers - including women and babies. The 1978 mass suicide was the largest ever single loss of American civilian life in a deliberate act, and remained so until the 9/11 terror attacks.  Followers of Peoples Temple Agricultural Project, better known as Jonestown, had committed mass suicide. Earlier other cult members had butchered congressman Leo Ryan, in an act that Jones ordered, after he arrived in north Guyana to investigate claims people had been held against their will. He had met disciples who begged for his help amid lack of food and a dictatorship regime. Jones feared he was about to be exposed and so ordered Ryan\u0027s death, with several of his entourage also killed. The cult leader then set in motion the plans for mass suicide he had long anticipated. He called his adopted son, also called Jim, at the cult HQ in Georgetown, the largest nearby city, and gave him an order with a terrifying secret meaning.  In a new documentary he recalls: In the early evening I went down to the radio room because my father wanted to talk to me. He says, \u0027We\u0027re going to meet Mr. Fraser\u0027. And that was code for committing revolutionary suicide, and \u0027you need to work out how you guys can meet Mr. Fraser in Georgetown\u0027. I\u0027m like, \u0027What the hell is going on, is there something else we can do?\u0027 Then my father went into a rhetoric: \u0027This is the cause that you have to stand up to, our avenging angels will protect us, and prove things right or make justice happen, but we have to meet Mr. Fraser.\u0027 Terrified about what was happening, Jim and his brothers went to the American Embassy to raise the alarm - but it was already too late. Back at the camp Jones had called a large meeting at the town\u0027s pavilion using the speaker system he often gave propaganda laden speeches over. Deadly cocktail  Meanwhile a cocktail of sedatives and cyanide  had been mixed by 30-year-old camp doctor Lawrence Schacht and flavoured with powdered grape juice flavouring.  The phrase Drinking the Kool-Aid was later born from the Jonestown suicides to mean a person or group who goes along with a doomed or dangerous idea because of peer pressure. The assembled were told it was time to die. The first to take the poison were Ruletta Paul and her one-year-old son Robert. A syringe with its needle removed was used to squirt poison into the infant\u0027s mouth, after which Paul squirted another syringe into her own mouth. Jones ordered mothers with babies to take the poison first and it\u0027s been speculated that it was to make adults more willing to die after their children were dead.  One eye-witness stated that while the poison was squirted in some children\u0027s mouths, there was no panic or emotional outburst and the assembled Temple members looked like they were in a trance. This though was contradicted when a 45 minute audio recording - known as the death tape - emerged revealing cries and screams of children. On the tape Jones could be heard ranting: I tell you, I don\u0027t care how many screams you hear, I don\u0027t care how many anguished cries...death is a million times preferable to 10 more days of this life. If you knew what was ahead of you – if you knew what was ahead of you, you\u0027d be glad to be stepping over tonight. Humble beginnings The cult leader had begun as an American evangelical preacher who was certain the Cold War of the 1970s would bring a nuclear bomb. He created a community in San Francisco, California, where he said his followers would be safe from nuclear fallout. Many of his followers were recovering drug addicts from the black community and he seemed to offer a warm welcome at a time when racial divides were strong. But the authorities started to pay extra interest to his community - called the People\u0027s Temple - and there were stories in the press from disaffected former members of the church. Then almost overnight Jones relocated to Guyana, in South America. Followers - to whom he preached about communism, socialism, the US government, the rich, economic equality and ending childhood hunger- believed he had special powers and followed him to the new planned utopia  One member of the cult who survived the massacre with his children, Jerry Parks, recalled a car journey when what he thought at the time was a miracle happened. He said: My son Dale was driving to school with Jim Jones with two or three cars. The lead car which he was in hit a duck and knocked it to the side of the highway. Jim had him pull over, open the door, got out, walked over and picked the duck up in his hand and Dale says he stroked the duck. Miracle He said he was saying something but he didn\u0027t understand what he was saying and all of a sudden the duck jumps up to his feet on the hand and flies away. That is something to this day we don\u0027t understand how to view it, what to think about it, was it real, was the duck alive, would it have happened anyway? We didn\u0027t think that way at the time, because it was too early on with Jim Jones so we believed that it was the real thing. Jerry says now that he never fully bought into Jones\u0027 hyperbole and suspected disaster was on the horizon the moment he landed in South America.  He said: I knew early on that we were going to die over there. He had backed himself into a corner that he couldn\u0027t get out of and it would soon fall in on him. He said we may have to die for this. But he didn\u0027t mean we\u0027re going to grab guns and stand out there and protect ourselves. \u0027You have to die for it\u0027 means we\u0027re gonna kill ourselves before they get us. New start In South America in the baking heat Jones and his followers built a town housing 1,000 - mainly women and children. But it was not to be a peaceful life as quickly his methods of controlling a community containing those who had begun to doubt their mission became increasingly cruel and driven by paranoia. Residents had their passports collected on arrival and any dissent was treated with brutal beatings or menial tasks as punishment. Members of the cult were forced to sign confessions to theft, abuse and terrorism as a sign of loyalty but in reality they were used to keep the members quiet. Former member Joyce Shaw told the Mirror in 1978 that Jones imposed celibacy on members, telling them he was the only heterosexual in the world but slept with both men and women. Shaw, who had been a member in the US, said: I saw beatings and physical abuse. For discipline people were publicly spanked or beaten with thick sticks. A man who confessed to being a homosexual was stripped, beaten with a rubber hose and made to march around to show his welts.  You could see that he could no longer have functioned as a man. Another man who complained about the celibacy rule was forced to perform humiliating acts in public with a woman who vomited over him. That cured his ardour. Little kids who misbehaved had to box each other, so did elderly people. Word began to leak back to the USA that some residents were being held against their will in the community - which was known as Jonestown - and relatives lobbied their elected representatives for help. Paranoia Jones believed the American Government had it in for him and was terrified he would lose control, so he ordered his brainwashed followers to conduct drills in preparation for a mass suicide. Then, in November 1978, Congressman Leo Ryan decided to visit the community after his interest became aroused when the son of a friend who was a member of the cult was found murdered days after saying he wanted to leave. It was to begin the ball rolling towards a tragic conclusion. By the time Ryan arrived on November 14, Jones\u0027 health had declined, according to survivors, and he was abusing LSD, Quaaludes, stimulants and barbiturates. His once sharp speaking voice was slurred, his eyes were glazed and he was increasingly paranoid. Ambush Ryan was initially refused entry to the town but once inside he was treated to a well-rehearsed musical show designed to show all was happy and well. In fact it would later emerge he had told an aide that he planned to report all was well upon his return to the US. Jones, though, had already decided on his deadly course. Inside the camp several unhappy families approached Ryan asking to come with him when he left, but the numbers were still small in relation to the overall population. On the evening of November 18 the departing Ryan party - along with 30 defectors - assembled at the nearby Port Kaituma airstrip to fly back to Georgetown. They had been joined by Temple loyalist Larry Layton despite the concerns of those leaving who did not trust him.  As the party waited at the airstrip a tractor and trailer appeared and hidden gunmen opened fire - Congressman Ryan, two reporters and an NBC cameraman were killed along with defector Patricia Parks, while several other people were also injured. Congressman Ryan was shot more than 20 times. Jerry Parks was at the airstrip when the shooting happened and recalls in a new Investigation: Discover documentary: I had just fastened my seatbelt and was siting right by the window and I heard the guns going off and the bullets flying and all I could think to say was \u0027my God!\u0027 I heard my mom holler \u0027look at Patty\u0027, my wife. I looked back and she was sat slumped over with the top of her head gone. Larry Layton had shot two people inside the plane but when he tried to shoot Jerry\u0027s son Dale, the gun jammed. The gunmen fled after killing the Congressman and the survivors hid in the jungle until help arrived.  Back at the camp Jones used news of Ryan\u0027s death to speed up the mass suicide telling his followers: The Congressman’s dead … please get us some medication. It’s simple, it’s simple, there’s no convulsions with it, it’s just simple, just please get it before it’s too late. The GDF (Guyana Defense Force) will be here. I tell you get moving, get moving, get moving … The poison took just five minutes to kill. When the army arrived they found a scene of unimaginable devastation with bodies littering the ground around the pavilion. A handful of cult members survived by fleeing into the jungle or hiding. Grover Davis, 79, who was partly deaf, missed the announcement to assemble on the loudspeaker, lay down in a ditch, and pretended to be dead. The children A first body count put the death toll at 400. Only when the bodies were moved was it discovered that children and babies had been murdered and their bodies lay hidden beneath the adult corpses. Plastic cups, Flavor Aid packets, and syringes, some with needles and some without, littered the area where the bodies were found. Jones\u0027 body was found with a self inflicted gunshot to the head. At the cult\u0027s headquarters in Georgetown, cult member Sharon Amos cut the throats of two of her own children and then killed herself.

Bike maintenance and accessories   Wheels  Before setting off on a cycling trip, there are a number of things you need to check to keep things safe - starting with your wheels.  If you haven\u0027t been out on the bike recently then the tyres may have deflated. To test them, inflate them , and check them after a few days. If they\u0027ve deflated, you might have a puncture.   A tyre sealant, like Slime Bike Tyre Sealant , \u0026pound9.99, can help to prevent punctures. This liquid is pumped into the tyre to prevent future holes from causing a problem.    If you have a puncture, you\u0027ll need to remove the wheel to repair the puncture using Halfords Puncture Repair Kit , \u0026pound12. If you aren\u0027t sure where to start, Halfords offer a useful video guide to puncture repair .   If you\u0027re planning a big family cycling trip then you\u0027ll also want to make sure you have a compact pump with you when you\u0027re out and about. Check out the Bikehut High Pressure Bike Pump (now \u0026pound15, save \u0026pound4).   Chain      In the unlikely event that you suffer a broken chain, it\u0027s really worth having a repair kit with you, especially if you\u0027re mountain biking. Check out the Park Tool Mini Chain Brute Tool for just \u0026pound9.98, which is ideal if you need to repair a broken chain on the road.   It\u0027s important to use chain oil or lubricant to keep the chain in good working order. The cheapest option is to use cycle oil - costing just \u0026pound4 - but you may choose to opt for a more expensive lubricant like Muc-Off , which is weather resistant.   You should clean your chain before applying lubricant - there are special cleaners to help with this.   Gears          The best way to keep your gears in check is with regular servicing , but if you do encounter a problem, it\u0027s best not to attempt to fix it yourself.  Instead, get an in-store Halfords expert to help you get your gears working again.  If your family does a lot of cycling, then taking out a Halfords Bike Care Plan Plan is a worthwhile investment. These plans are a great way to leave the dirty work to someone else, as well as providing peace of mind that your bike is being looked after by Halfords\u0027 highly trained experts.   Prices start from \u0026pound15 for kids\u0027 bikes and \u0026pound25 for adult bikes and include free fitting on parts and accessories bought from Halfords, as well as a free Silver Bike Service worth \u0026pound50.   Brakes   Every bike needs regular checks on its braking system, as you ride it\u0027s inevitable that cables stretch slightly and brake pads can wear down. It\u0027s another good reason to invest in a regular service at Halfords.  But you can, and should, test them yourself as well to ensure they stop the wheels. Inspect the brake pads regularly to make sure they’re aligned with the rims.   Bolts          The last step for bike maintenance should be to check the bolts, like those on the wheels, are well tightened. There\u0027s no need to over-tighten, as this can cause problems too, but make sure nuts are all firmly secured. A spanner set or special bike tool will be needed, but the Halfords Basic 6 Piece Allen Key Set is just \u0026pound5.99 and should cover most bike nut sizes. Lights       Make sure there are good lights attached to your bikes in case your cycle ride goes on later than planned! Halfords has a Silicone Light Set for just \u0026pound15 that attaches to pretty much any bike in seconds.   If you\u0027re off on a cycling trip, the last thing you\u0027ll want to be doing is carting batteries around, so consider investing in a Rechargeable Bike Light Set, \u0026pound25. They recharge by USB, and feature high, low, and flashing modes.   For little cyclists there are also a brightly-coloured Silicone Bike Light available for \u0026pound4 in blue, green and pink for all tastes.   Cycling clothing      Like any sport, cycling involves wearing the right kit - both to keep you visible to other road users, and to keep you safe in the event of an accident. A welll fitting helmet can seriously reduce the risk of a head injury, so you should get your kids in the habit of wearing one whenever they are out on their bikes.  Halfords stock a range of fun designs like Paw Patrol and Disney Princesses , with prices starting at \u0026pound10, while older kids might like the Purple Swirls Kids Bike Helmet which looks cool and offers excellent protection.    But the best way to encourage your kids to wear a helmet is to lead by example by wearing one yourself. The HardnutZ Stealth Hi Vis MTB Helmet is a good choice at \u0026pound35 (down from \u0026pound55), and is available in four colours. One of its key advantages is that its highly reflective under street lamps and car headlights.    Being seen is crucial for any cyclist, young or old. Grab a family pack of Halfords Hi Vis Vests for just \u0026pound11.99 and the four vests (two adult-sized and two kid-sized) will make everyone much more visible on the roads. Vests are also available individually .

The mother was accused of not taken him out for an ice cream and not getting his hair to be cut in the way that he liked in a 44-page document written by the social worker. But today a judge ruled the mother and son can be reunited. Mr Justice Mostyn said the social worker\u0027s criticisms were utterly insubstantial and obviously inconsequential. The judge said the social worker had outlined her evidence in a 44-page witness statement which was very long on rhetoric but very short indeed on concrete examples of deficient parenting. He said it was very hard to pin down within the swathes of text what exactly was being said against the woman.  Mr Justice Mostyn has made complaints in a ruling after analysing the boy\u0027s case at a family court hearing in Swansea. The judge said the boy could not be identified but said the social worker worked for Carmarthenshire County Council. A lower-ranking judge had ruled that the boy, now eight, should be taken from his mother\u0027s care and move to live with foster parents. The woman had continued to see the boy so her parenting skills could be assessed. She had then asked Mr Justice Mostyn to allow her son to return home. Carmarthenshire social services bosses had opposed her application. But Mr Justice Mostyn has ruled in her favour. He said the boy should return to his mother and his care be supervised by social services staff.

Jack Johnson said he wants a younger, fresher appearance after attempting to emulate Goldenballs, 43, for years. The unemployed 21-year-old, who appeared on ITV\u0027s This Morning in 2016, is now spending between \u0026pound350 and \u0026pound400 a week on procedures including vampire facials and thread facelifts. And he claims five sugar daddies are paying for his transformation into the retired footballer\u0027s 19-year-old son. I\u0027ve been busy finding myself over the last few months and now I want to look like Brooklyn Beckham, Jack told . David is obviously very attractive but he\u0027s getting older now and I want a younger, fresher look. Brooklyn is more in the limelight and now when I go to my surgeon or beauty therapist, I take a picture of him.  Jack sparked a major backlash after telling TV hosts Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby that he used government benefits to fund his surgery. But despite being \u0026pound30k in debt and sofa surfing between friends, he is not giving up on the dream. It is costing me a fortune and I\u0027m not working so I have about five sugar daddies, Jack explained. I don\u0027t have to do anything intimate with them, I just go out for luxury dinners and attend exclusive events by their side. It\u0027s a simple transaction - they\u0027re not really my friends.  Jack said he was forced to leave his home last year because he spent all his rent money on surgery. But he claims being a sugar baby allows him to enjoy the finer things in life. I\u0027m homeless, well, sofa surfing with friends and family, at the moment because I can\u0027t afford to live alone, he said. I was spending all my rent money on my face. My daddies make sure I can afford the surgery and they give me amazing gifts like designer handbags and clothes. I\u0027m always drinking champagne and eating nice food.  Jack is a fan of the vampire facial [Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) Therapy] which involves drawing blood from a patient\u0027s arm and extracting the plasma before spattering it onto their face using tiny acupuncture-style needles. The cosmetic procedure, which costs roughly \u0026pound750 and is loved by the likes of Kim Kardashian West, is supposed to rejuvenate the client\u0027s face. It gives my face a Hollywood shine and gets rid of wrinkles, Jack explained. The 21-year-old also gets HD eyebrows done every two weeks and fillers injected into his jawline. He undergoes regular thread facelifts and dermaroller treatments. I\u0027m booked in to go to Turkey to have my teeth done soon, Jack said. I want the veneers to be the same shape as Brooklyn\u0027s teeth but dead bright and fake looking.  Jack admits his mum is not supportive of his dream and he has struggled to find genuine friends since his newfound fame. But when asked if he is happy, he replied: 100% I\u0027ve spent roughly \u0026pound9k so far on looking like Brooklyn and the results are amazing, he said. When I look back at myself on This Morning I think I look like Mr Potato Head from Toy Story. Now I\u0027m much more comfortable and people who give me a hard time are just jealous and bitter. It\u0027s my body and I\u0027m a grown man so I\u0027m not ashamed of what I do. I want to be famous so I am working at it. Look at Rylan Clark-Neal - he wanted to be famous and now he is.

A 15-year-old boy is to be the first NHS recognised internet gaming addict .  Primary schools across Britain are warning children are damaging their education by playing the game. Teachers want lessons in online safety included in the curriculum. And so Fortnite has become the latest Pied Piper terror for parents who fear their kids are being tempted into a world they have no knowledge or understanding about. Well either that or it’s just the latest craze that’ll come and go in the way a million others have done before, from Rubik’s Cubes and Tamagotchis through to Loom Bands and Slime.  From what I can make out from my kids’ explanations, it’s a kind of Minecraft meets Call Of Duty – a brightly coloured post apocalyptic cartoon world where survivors battle it out (a bit like Love Island, but with greater emotional depth).   My eight-year-old son has played it at friends’ houses and is desperate for it. I’ve told him that is absolutely fine, and I’d be more than happy for him to buy it with his birthday money. When he’s 12. In four years time. Which is, of course, SO UNFAIR. And I’m the MEANEST mum in the WHOLE world. And EVERYONE in his WHOLE class has it apart from him. Fortunately, I like a row. Several times a day. But I totally understand how other parents have crumbled under the pressure of a nagging child and ended up thinking: “What harm can it do?” According to my friends who have given in already, it’s not so much harm as deep frustration and a lot of rows. It clearly is addictive. And it’s not just kids who need lessons about online gaming - it’s parents too. Because tackling this new threat to family life is tough.

But royal fans finally got to see the new Duchess of Sussex on the famous landmark at the weekend when she joined her new in-laws for Trooping of the Colour. Despite being a firm favourite in the last few months in the lead up to her wedding, Meghan was stood in the back for her balcony debut - behind her new sister-in-law Kate. When Kate made her first Trooping of the Colour appearance she had a lovely spot in the front row, so why didn\u0027t Meghan?   Joe Little, the managing editor of Majesty magazine, told PEOPLE : She was not as prominent perhaps as some people might have expected, but there\u0027s a pecking order.  There was no slight intended, but William being the older, more senior brother would go out [first] with his wife. However PEOPLE has another royal source with disagreed with this logic, saying Meghan would have picked her own spot on the balcony. They said: There\u0027s no one laying this out, telling her where to stand.  They also believed this year\u0027s standing arrangements would been around the kids, as there were lots of little ones there this year! As always, Prince George and Princess Charlotte stole the show at this year\u0027s event along with their cousin Savannah Phillips. The three little royals looked like they were having a great time as they stood right at the front to watch the flypast. Charlotte had a teary moment when she dropped the booklet she was reading but mum Kate picked her up to comfort her.

Karin Jones, who is in her 50s, said she started desiring sex multiple times a day after experiencing a \u0027tsunami\u0027 of events - including separation from her husband of 23 years. The former medic described sex with \u0027\u0027unavailable partners\u0027\u0027 as a \u0027\u0027few hours of unencumbered, uncomplicated bliss\u0027\u0027. She even claims that finding them in London was \u0027\u0027like walking into a sweet shop with a pocket full of cash.\u0027\u0027 Karin, who now works as a writer at Erotic Review magazine, said she met her lovers through IllicitEncounters a UK dating website for married people. All the men stipulated they only wanted sex and did not want their family lives disrupted at home. Karin, who lives in London, claimed some of her lovers had even been given permission by their wives to have affairs. She said: \u0027\u0027At 49 I separated from my husband of 23 years, began my slide into midlife, and experienced a libido surge so intense I became unhinged if I didn’t get sexual release several times a day.   \u0027\u0027This kind of horniness happens to some of us midlife women, though it’s not getting talked about much. We’re not told by our doctors to expect aching bouts of desire to accompany our hot flushes in the run-up to menopause .  \u0027\u0027Depending upon one\u0027s circumstances, this surge can be a blessing or a burden. If you have someone who is willing to have sex with you three times a day (or more) you might be fine. If not, you’ll need to get creative. When Karin split from her husband, she claimed her busy lifestyle and young son meant she didn\u0027t want a serious relationship. But while she wasn\u0027t on the hunt for a new partner, her desire for sex was intense. She eventually turned to dating sites and apps to satisfy her labido. She added: I didn’t want a relationship I was too wrapped up with grieving my marriage and taking care of my young son, who is now aged nine. \u0027\u0027But my body wasn’t letting me off the hook when it came to sex. Fortunately, I lived near London. Finding men to have sex with was like walking into a sweet shop with a pocket full of cash. I set up profiles on Tinder and OKCupid, but as a woman wanting only casual sex, the sheer volume of questionable men on those sites was intimidating.  \u0027\u0027The website that offered me the clearest route to my no-strings requirements was IllicitEncounters, a dating site for married people. \u0027\u0027Unlike other dating websites, I found a “cheaters” site to be populated by men who were more straightforward and unselfconscious about their intent. It was understood that this was about sex, not finding a relationship. \u0027\u0027It was about companionship for only a few hours. It was almost universally about experiencing a level of intimacy we weren’t getting at home. But all the men I encountered there insisted they didn’t want to disrupt their family lives. \u0027\u0027Some of these men had the permission of their wives to find sex elsewhere. Anyone on a site like IllicitEncounters is there because they don’t want to be condemned on other sites for seeking out what they need: sex. \u0027\u0027And anyone who insists we can live without sex is welcome to do so. But I can’t do it. Clearly, a lot of us can’t. Whether we can be honest with our spouses about sex is everyone’s own decision. \u0027\u0027I learned that dating sites for married people were places to interact with potential partners without the harassment and judgement they received on other sites from those who view the issue of infidelity as black and white. I see the many shades of grey around the topic.  Karin explained how it was important for her to only sleep with men who were still committed to their marriage and wanted nothing more than a sexual encounter. She added: \u0027\u0027I was cautious. After I accepted a man’s request for a conversation, I vetted each one to be sure they were still committed to their marriage, even if that commitment didn’t include sexual monogamy. \u0027\u0027I accepted that by sleeping with me they could be putting their marriage at risk. But I was fairly clear-headed with my choices. I only slept with men who told me they loved their wives and were certainly not about to leave them for me. They almost always said they wanted to have sex with their wives, but their wives wouldn’t have sex with them. Karin recalled how one of her lovers flew in from the Middle East and met up with her in London. She said: I asked him, \u0027Does your wife know how you feel?\u0027 I asked over the phone before we met. “Yes.” he said. “She even tried some of these things with me. I was so grateful to her for trying. But she’s not comfortable with it. It’s simply not possible for her to enjoy the kind of sex I do.

Claire Ashton says nothing had been cleaned and fixtures were broken when the family arrived at the holiday park in Southport, Merseyside. The 37-year-old mum, who snapped photos of the disgusting bungalow, claims her children were left terrified after witnessing a fight. She told the Liverpool Echo she was sold a holiday that was nothing like the actual place and will never return to a Pontins resort after \u0027wasting\u0027 \u0026pound775 on the getaway.    Have you had a \u0027holiday from hell\u0027 at a resort or hotel that wasn\u0027t as advertised? Send your story and photos to webnews@mirror.     The family booked in January to visit Pontins Southport Holiday Park from their home in Sheffield, but had to alter their plans when Claire needed spinal surgery after suffering prolapsed discs. Claire, who travelled with husband Matthew, 33, son Joe, 13, mother-in-law Sharon, 63, and nephews Luke and Ben, aged nine and six, was happy when she rang Pontins and was told she could upgrade to a ‘luxury bungalow’ that would accommodate her wheelchair. That change, combined with upgrading to half-board, boosted the cost of the holiday from \u0026pound269 to more than \u0026pound775.  But they were left shocked by what they found when they arrived at Pontins, owned by Britannia Hotels. She said: “It was ridden with ants, nothing was working, the cupboards were broken, the blinds wouldn’t open, nothing had been cleaned. “There were ants in our bed. I can’t even begin to tell you how horrific it was.” Claire added: The toilet wouldn’t flush when they arrived and, later in their stay, a glass shelf fell from above the sink while the children were brushing the teeth underneath it.  “We spoke to the manager about how disgusting it was. He went in and mopped it himself and said the cleaner couldn’t go in because she was scared of dogs and we had our Chihuahua with us.” Things got worse when they went for their evening meal and said despite only being allowed a half-hour slot to eat, they couldn’t find any suitable space to fit Claire’s wheelchair in. This problem continued each day, with the family often deciding it was better to eat elsewhere, pushing their total spend to well over \u0026pound1,000.  After complaining to the manager, the family said they were given a \u0026pound20 drinks voucher. Claire added: “We could have gone abroad for that much money. We were sold something by the man on the phone that was nothing like the actual place. “They didn’t cater at all for me and it was certainly not a luxury bungalow in any shape or form.”  She said people were smoking drugs from as early as 9am. She added: “I have to say security were very good and quick to get rid of anyone causing trouble. “But I’ve never seen people fighting, taking drugs in a family resort. Our children were physically scared. For people to be physically fighting in front of you is not on.

A poll of 2,000 adults found around one in six have ended up rowing with their other half when decorating or renovating their home. Sixteen per cent have disagreed over how much they should spend while almost one in five said either them or their partner was completely against getting the work done at all. As a result, 47 per cent found their home makeover \u0027stressful\u0027. Karen Lund of home improvement window specialists Independent Network, which commissioned the research, said: “We all know that home improvements can be disruptive, but we didn’t realise quite what the emotional impact could be.  “It seems women are more interested in attaining perfection, and men would rather not deal with the hassle. Researchers also found women are most likely to suggest a home improvement – with 65 per cent saying it was them who made the first move compared to just 45 per cent of men. But it’s blokes who are lumbered with getting the quotes, with seven in 10 saying the task usually fell to them. Worryingly for them, more than one in 10 adults admitted they weren’t happy with the price they paid for the work in the end. And almost one in 10 weren’t satisfied with the quality of work either. As a result, 53 per cent of people regret not taking the time to get more quotes, with more than one quarter feeling they could have had the same job done for less money if they had shopped around.  A third even admitted to blaming their partner for not spending more time to get a wide range of quotes before giving the go ahead on the work. It also emerged recommendations are the most popular way to find a contractor, ahead of simply ringing around to get some prices. But of those who did get quotes, an average of three were collected before they made their mind up. A brave 28 per cent of couples bypassed contractors and did the work themselves. A new bathroom was found to be the most common home improvement to make, followed by a garden makeover and a new kitchen.

These are the words of Matt Scooter, just hours after he watched his brave son Jackson say goodbye to his little sister. Addy was just four years old when she lost her battle with cancer. Just hours before she died her brother visited her in hospital and refused to leave her side, holding her hand and comforting her.  The two children giggled, played, looked at photos and watched videos. Speaking to  Matt, who lives in in Arkansas, USA, said: Addy was the sweetest little girl you could ever meet. She stole hearts wherever she went. She was so kind. She and Jackson were best friends. Sure, they got on each other\u0027s nerves some days like typical siblings, but they loved each other greatly and did everything together. One of her favorite parts of the day was going to get Jackson from school. They were very close.  That day at the hospital Jackson wouldn\u0027t leave her side.  We asked him numerous times if he wanted to go stay with his grandparents or his friends, but he wouldn\u0027t leave. Matt shared the heartbreaking photo of his children on social media. He wrote: A little boy should not have to say goodbye to his partner in crime, his play mate, his best friend, his little sister.  This isn\u0027t how it\u0027s supposed to be. But this is the broken world we live in. Addy\u0027s symptoms have progressed rapidly over the past day and a half.  Yesterday she woke up as her spunky playful self. While we still see short instances of our girl she can no longer eat or swallow without difficulty and she’s sleeping most of the time now and we\u0027ve admitted her into inpatient care. Most likely she doesn\u0027t have much time left. For our family and close friends if you feel you need to tell her goodbye we recommend you contact us and do so soon. Pray for Jackson. He doesn\u0027t want to leave her side and we won\u0027t make him. Pray for us. That we have the right words and can make the necessary arrangements in time.  Addy, who was diagnosed with a brain tumour in 2016, passed away just hours later at 1am. She went through 33 rounds of intense chemotherapy in her fight against the tumour. The illness affects a sufferer\u0027s muscles, nerves, heart rate and breathing.

The plucky animal captivated people around the world as updates were posted online and its anxious followers feared it would plunge to its death. There were tense scenes as the raccoon clawed its way up the side of the office tower before perching itself in front of a worker\u0027s window where it showed no signs of fear. The drama sparked pleas for experts to intervene and rescue the critter, which had apparently been trying to raid pigeon nests.  Locals said the raccoon had been without food and water for two days as it was stranded on the UBS tower in downtown St Paul, Minnesota in the US. The animal climbed up and down the pebbled concrete walls as it tried to find a way to safety, with the saga becoming the top trend on Twitter. Worried onlookers gathered on the pavement below to watch the drama, while thousands followed the unfolding situation on Twitter, where workers posted photos and videos of the astonishing scene.  The incident also spawned joke Twitter accounts. One account, calling itself \u0027The MPR Raccoon\u0027, tweeted: I made a big mistake. A local TV station set up a live stream on Periscope, and it had more than 1,000 viewers at 2.30am local time on Wednesday. The raccoon had initially been seen on a ledge on the neighbouring Town Square complex before it started climbing the UBS tower. Minnesota Public Radio reporter Tim Nelson, who tweeted updates for hours, wrote: This poor raccoon apparently got itself stranded on a ledge of the Town Square office building in downtown St. Paul, likely on an errant mission to raid pigeon nests on the skyway over 7th Street.

Canada\u0027s National Post newspaper believes a loophole in their country\u0027s laws means the new Duke and Duchess of Sussex could be made king and queen straight away.   They claim university professor Philippe Lagasse was studying the laws surrounding the royal family last year, and wrote: According to the federal government\u0027s interpretation of royal succession in Canada, we could arguably make Harry the King of Canada with a simple parliamentary statute He claims that while Canada\u0027s constitution is very clear it\u0027s vested in the Queen, it doesn\u0027t say who the Queen needs to be.

The remaining six charges were refunded.Nicola said: “I can’t believe it’s only 13 fines in 11 years.“Given how many cars come down here, you would think there would have been a lot more.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee face competition from motherwell in bid bring simon murray back to dens park","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee face competition if they are to make a move to bring striker Simon Murray back to Dens Park.Murray spent the second half of last season on loan at the Dark Blues from parent club Hibs and said he was open to a return – but only if the Edinburgh side went with another striking option.His first choice was to try to prove himself at Easter Road after an up-and- down debut campaign there.Whether he has the chance to do that is up in the air after Motherwell moved to take him to Fir Park.The Steelmen have reportedly had a bid of £50,000 turned down by Hibs for the striker as they look to add to their attack.And that’s unlikely to be the end of any interest in the 26-year-old with ’Well expected to continue their pursuit.A number of European clubs have also been keeping tabs on him since his Dundee United days.The Tangerines, too, have made advances to bring him back to Tannadice.The lure of a return to boyhood heroes Dundee on a permanent basis would be big for Murray, though whether manager Neil McCann is prepared to splash cash on the former-Arbroath man remains to be seen.In 14 games for the Dark Blues last season, Murray managed just the three goals despite some good performances. Gaffer Neil suggested Murray was just trying too hard to shine in front of his fellow-Dundee supporters and was happy with his contribution.The Dee boss is desperate to add more threat to his side and

“lucky” life but, upon retirement, decided to trace his family history. He has uncovered ties to Dundee and is appealing to anyone who may have known his mother, whose birth certificate he has not found.He believes his mum, Irene Miller or Millar, was born in Canada but grew up and worked in Dundee. Mervyn thinks his maternal grandmother travelled to Canada while pregnant, but returned to Scotland shortly afterwards.He has found a cousin, Freda, and an uncle, Raymond, who live in Dundee, but neither has been able to shed much light on the mystery. Freda’s mum also lived in Dundee and Mervyn suspects she and his mum would have hung about together.He said: “It would be a great satisfaction to know what happened to her. We just can’t find a birth certificate. In a jute mill or other factory, everyone knows everyone so there might be someone in Dundee who knew my mother.”Irene ended up in Liverpool working as a prostitute but that is where the trail goes cold.His father is even more of a mystery, but as Mervyn is mixed-race he believes a man from Pakistan, India or Sri Lanka came to Dundee for the jute industry.Born with spina bifida, Mervyn spent much of his childhood at a children’s centre in Edinburgh.

Neil told us that if he thinks young players are good enough he’ll stick them in and he’s done that.“That’s great for us and a great selling point if we’re trying to convince kids to join us rather than somebody else because you can see the pathway.”The former Livi, Coventry and Hibs man has learned plenty – good and bad – from every coach he’s come across but very much plans to be his own man.“I’ve picked up lots from the managers I’ve worked under – Chris Coleman at Coventry was great and so have Paul Hartley and Neil McCann been at Dundee.“I try to get bits and pieces from all the coaches I see, whether it’s good, bad or indifferent, and mould it all into the way I want to coach.“Being able to text guys like Chris Coleman and pick their brains is fantastic.“I’ve also seen some very, very bad things over my career and want to do the opposite!“I’ve got my own take on how I want to go about it and the way I want the game played.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"former dundee keeper malherbe secured move to greek super league","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFormer Dundee squad member Jeremy Malherbe has headed to Greece after signing for Panionios.The French goalkeeper was brought in to cover first-choice Elliott Parish at the start of January after the departure of Scott Bain.However, despite being at the Dark Blues for six months, Malherbe didn’t manage to make a single appearance as Development goalkeeper Calum Ferrie overtook him in the pecking order.The 27-year-old arrived in Dundee after leaving Dinamo Brest in Belarus and now heads for the Greek Super League.Panionios finished in seventh spot in Greece’s top flight last season, only five points off a Europa League place.Malherbe has signed a two-year deal.Meanwhile, the arrival of former Hearts goalie Jack Hamilton this summer may see Ferrie and fellow young keeper Kyle Gourlay head out on loan in the coming season to gain experience.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b1a516c449eb.jpg ","title":"jack hamilton signing a great bit of business says derek soutar","story":"\t\t\t\t\tSigning 24-year-old Jack Hamilton is “a great piece of business” according to a man who knows a thing or two about keeping goal for Dundee.Derek ‘Soapy’ Soutar had two spells at Dens Park, totalling eight years, and has seen first-hand how good Hamilton can be.After Soutar suffered an injury in his time at Forfar back in 2012, a young keeper by the name of Hamilton came in on emergency loan to cover at the age of 18.Watching his progress since, Soutar was delighted to see him arrive at Dundee.Soutar said: “I was very surprised Hearts let him go.“He came in on loan at Forfar when he was just 18. He was a great size, very athletic and a really good shot-stopper, great at one-on-ones and his distribution was excellent, too.“With Jon McLaughlin leaving I thought it would be the ideal chance for Craig Levein to put Jack in for pre-season.“He’s moved on, though, and Dundee have a great signing.“I worked with Jack, he’s a great lad and really down to earth personality.“I think it’s a great bit of business by Neil McCann.“He’s a good age with plenty of experience as well at Hearts and all the different levels with Scotland.“It’s a massive signing for Dundee – he could be there for years to come.“He will have to bide his time, though, because Elliott Parish did really well at the end of last season after Scott Bain left.“Every goalie is going to have times when it’s not going for you but Elliott got through that and didn’t do a lot wrong. He’ll take some shifting for Jack.“What it will do is push Parish to be as good as he can because he knows Jack will be breathing down his neck.”After a steady first season at the now renamed Kilmac Stadium, Parish will feel he’s the current No 1 at the club but the arrival of another senior goalie can spur both to excel – and that’s good news for the Dark Blues.Hamilton has represented Scotland at every age level from U/15 to U/21 and was called up to a squad by Gordon Strachan in May 2016.He didn’t get a first senior cap but Soutar reckons he can push his way back into the national set-up by impressing for Dundee.He added: “Not so long ago he was in the Scotland squad.“He maybe lost a bit of confidence last season at Hearts and being on the bench.“He’s very professional and will push himself to the max to make sure he’s ready for pre-season at Dundee.“He’s very level-headed, he’s not one for the big-time if you know what I mean, he’s not a flashy kind of guy.“I know the kind of level Jack can play at, I’ve worked with him and I think he could get himself back in the Scotland set-up while at Dundee.“Whatever fee was paid, he’ll definitely justify it.“Further down the line, he could even get Dundee a fee if he moves on so, for that reason, I think it’s a great piece of business.“Working with (goalkeeping coach) Rab Geddes every week, too, can only bring the best out in Jack.“A three-year deal gives him security and playing for a manager who wants him in Neil McCann will help no end.”The former Dundee and Aberdeen goalie, meanwhile, is still going strong with his Derek Soutar Goalkeeping Academy.“It’s still going really well,” he added. “That’s us had 38 goalies over seven years go on to play pro-youth and we’ve had one recently go out to the US for a scholarship.”Any budding young goalies can find out more on the academy’s Facebook page.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b1e51507a3be-564x564.jpg ","title":"james mcpake hopes to plunder us for new dundee fc talent","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee are planning to plunder the United States for top young talent to bolster their improving youth set-up.The Dundee Juniors of Central Texas has been a project running since American owner Tim Keyes and managing director John Nelms took control of the club.The set-up in Austin has been steadily growing and Dark Blues coach and former skipper James McPake is out there right now working with the youngsters.Speaking to the Tele, McPake admits he’ll be “outside his comfort zone” as he puts the kids through their paces in the strong Texan sun.He is tasked with heading a training camp over there as well as picking out some players good enough to come across and join his U/18 squad over in Dundee.He said: “Last year I spent some time over here with Tim Keyes and John Nelms just having a look at things.“The club have held camps over here every year, certainly since Tim and John have been at the club.“This time it’s a bit different because it’s an ID camp – I’ll be doing some training sessions and, hopefully, we can pick a couple to come across to Dundee and train with our U/18s.“I went last year just to have a look at what goes on but this time I’ll be coaching.“The facilities are great over there, too, it’s a great place to go to – though I’ll be needing to put on factor 500 with the heat!“We’ll be coaching in about 42 degrees instead of the minus two at Riverside with the wind in your face.”It might seem strange to some to see a whole squad of youngsters all training in Dundee kit in the middle of Texas but McPake is delighted to help “spread the name” of the club as much as possible.“The kids are all kitted out in Dundee gear and they love it,” he added.“Being part of a big club like Dundee is something they really enjoy and the club have done it really well. It’s great for them to have the affiliation but it’s also great for the club to be able to spread the name of Dundee.“You see Celtic and Man U shirts all over so it’s good to see some Dundee ones as well.”McPake accepts this week will be a challenge for him to test his skills as a young coach – particularly his communication skills.“You couldn’t say football, or soccer as they call it, is the biggest sport out here but it is really growing,” he said.“The MLS is getting bigger all the time and the national team has been quite successful, though they’re not at the World Cup this year.“The kids who are starting to choose football as their sport really take it seriously and they are desperate to learn.“I’m really looking forward to it. It is a challenge for me to get the kids to understand what I’m trying to tell them.“It’s the same language – though I struggle to speak English sometimes! – but there’s a lot of different words and sayings.“It will be a wee test for me to get my point across and then see how the players react. I’ll be out of my comfort zone and that’ll be a challenge.“Last year, we went and watched some of the age groups in training and I was really impressed with the standard of players.“As a coach, its great to work with kids like this because they are so keen to learn.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"motorhome owners due 800k as local firm goes bust","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn estimated 60 motorhome owners are owed around £800,000 by a local trader which went bust and is being probed by police.St Andrews Motorhomes was put into liquidation last week after 25 years in business.The sudden closure left those who handed over vehicles to director Christine Galloway fearing they could be left thousands of pounds out of pocket.However, liquidator Claire Middlebrook has offered assurance that she will try to recover substantial sums for everyone involved.Ms Middlebrook said: “I’m acutely aware of the anger felt by every owner at the actions of Christine Galloway’s company.“I strongly advise creditors they should hold off any legal action and allow me as liquidator to recover as much as possible of the value of their motorhomes.“I will very quickly assess the company’s remaining assets and it is then my legal responsibility to refund everyone to the highest possible value.”Clients had handed over motorhomes in brokerage deals, allowing the firm based near Cupar to sell them on their behalf.

Inverness","story":"\u0026nbspONCE-in-a-lifetime plans to transform eyesore buildings in the heart of Inverness into a major attraction will take several years to come to fruition, with discussions yet to take place ahead of any big decisions.Highland Council\u0027 announcement\u0026nbsplast week that it is to buy the notorious 1960s Upper Bridge Street buildings as part of a bigger redevelopment of Inverness Castle has been broadly welcomed.Already there have been suggestions for the site ranging from demolishing the entire block to creating a green space.But any action to redevelop the concrete carbuncles will not happen immediately as possible options have yet to be drawn up ahead of a public consultation, while tenants in some units still have several years left on the leases.They include the Scottish Children\u0027 Reporter Admin-istration (SCRA) which has stated its intentions to remain in its unit until the end of the lease in October 2025 while the Shapla Indian Restaurant is among the businesses yet to be contacted by the council on how the takeover and potential plans might impact on its future.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspRestaurant owner Shabaro Ali said this week\u0027 announcement had come as a surprise, although he welcomed the news.\"Obviously, if Highland Council is going to redevelop the site, it is good for the city, it is good for us, it is good for everyone,\" he said.With about another 10 years remaining on the lease, Mr Ali wants the restaurant to remain in its prime riverside location where it has been for the last 22 years.\"I am sure Highland Council will try to keep everyone happy,\" he said.Orkney businesswoman Judith Glue opened her shop in Bridge Street 10 years ago and although she has yet to be directly approached by her new landlord, she was not unduly worried about the change in ownership,\"I hope it will be positive for businesses to be a part of a brand new project which would be good for Inverness,\" she said. \"Until they get in touch and tell us about the plans, there is not a lot I can say.\"The SCRA, meanwhile, occupies the main concrete block nearest the river which many would like to see removed.When contacted by the Inverness Courier last week ahead of the official announcement, a spokeswoman said there were no plans to move out.\"This is where our staff are based and where we hold children\u0027 hearings,\" she said.Following discussions with the council, that position remained unchanged this week.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspScotland\u0027 rural economy secretary Fergus Ewing \u0026ndash also the Inverness and Nairn MSP and co-chairman of the steering group overseeing the castle redevelopment \u0026ndash warned the project would take time.\"I don\u0026rsquot wish expectations to be raised in that things will happen in the next year or so,\" he said. \"I think that most things worth achieving in life do take several years. That will be the case here and it\u0027 important that there\u0027 a sense of ownership of citizens in the city.\"He said the aim of the group, which had met 14 times over the last three-and-a-half years, was to create an international-class attraction which drew people to Inverness rather than being something people simply saw when in the Highland capital.LDN Architects will look at the Bridge Street site to help create a masterplan by autumn prior to public consultation. A Highland Council spokeswoman said the local authority would become the landlord of any occupants or tenants.\"There will be no changes to the buildings until consultation has taken place, apart from any minor repairs which a landlord would be responsible for,\" she said.Wednesday 13 Jun 2018 6:35 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04111000/04111987.jpg","title":"British Empire Medal recipient honoured","story":"\u0026nbspAN Inverness man has been honoured to celebrate 50 years of volunteering with the RAF Association.John Maclean (83), who was born in Inverness but now lives in Peterhead and is chairman of the association\u0027 branch in the town, has been giving up his time to help others since the end of his active service in the 1960s.He also served in a number of senior roles in the organisation, and now his efforts have been recognised after he was awarded the British Empire Medal.Mr Maclean said: \"It\u0027 nice to have your hard work recognised.\"I took out life membership when I was leaving the air force in 1966 and soon after I started volunteering with the association.\"It becomes like a big family.

People want it open more often and to accommodate all age groups. It could be based on water fountains/jets, as in an installation in Southend which includes colour changing lighting.Another option is to create a three-storey adjacent lido with open-air pool on the top floor and spa facilities on the first floor.A further option is to take over the nearby council-owned Nairn Leisure Centre pool, give it a glass roof and create a training and competition facility to complement a lido.The lido proposal was inspired by Bath\u0027 dramatic Thermae Spa.Lessees of the neighbouring links tearoom and James\u0026rsquo Caf\u0026eacute have put forward proposals to improve their facilities.Community leaders are excited but have urged sensitive handling of the initiative.Nairn River Community Council chairman Tommy Hogg said: \"That area is part of Nairn\u0027 heritage so they\u0026rsquove got to do it sympathetically or it\u0026rsquoll cause massive problems.\"A council consultation keen to include input from local schools and youth groups is expected to follow in August.Planning officers say \"the time is ripe for a development plan\".Their report suggests building on a trail around Nairn from the Links through Viewfield and along the riverside featuring various attractions for \"people to linger, to learn about Nairn, to take part in an activity and to enjoy their surroundings\".Each point would incorporate a theme and\u0026nbspa dolphin-inspired artwork has been mooted.A draft plan is currently evolving for Nairn\u0027 77-pontoon harbour and waterfront to improve the harbour basin, surrounding buildings and maximise its potential to boost Nairn\u0027 economy.Planned projects include expansion of the pontoon system, increasing capacity to 97 boats and to develop a watersports centre.Other than driving to the links, people generally walk there as there is no public transport to the beach area.The planners say \"there may be an opportunity to operate a land train type tourist train in the summer months, taking people round the links, the harbour, Viewfield and Fishertown.\"Alternatively, there may be potential to develop a miniature railway, of the type used at Whin Park in Inverness.\"Wednesday 13 Jun 2018 6:35 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04111000/04111982.jpg","title":"Stateside search for market dog answers","story":"\u0026nbspA DETERMINED local historian is hoping a letter to America may finally solve the mystery of a faithful dog that died in a catastrophic fire in Inverness in the late 19th century.Norman Newton has been delving into the poignant tale of the canine superhero that refused to leave the butcher\u0027 shop it was guarding when the inferno destroyed what is now the Victorian Market in June 1889.The story will feature in a trailblazing digital project to be launched by Highland Council at the end of this month, bringing city legends and landmarks to life \u0026ndash but despite extensive research no one has been able to discover the dog\u0027 name.Undeterred, Mr Newton is pinning his last hopes on a Scottish-born woman now living in New York \u0026ndash the great-granddaughter of the butcher who owned the dog.\"She is perhaps the last possibility for more information about the fire and the dog through family stories,\" said Mr Newton, of Blackwell Road, Culloden.\"The rational part of me says it is unlikely. But a story like that is so dramatic that surely it would have passed down through the family.\"Mr Newton managed to track down the woman by following clues from sources such as reports of the fire in newspapers including the Inverness Courier, plus help from the family historian at the Highland Archive Centre.Having identified the butchers A\u0026ampD Macdonald, along with the location of the family farm in Glenmoriston, he subsequently discovered the great-granddaughter of Alexander Macdonald had married in Dundee in 2009 but was living in America.\"I do get a bit obsessive when it comes to researching local history,\" he conceded. \"It takes on a life of its own.\"It is like being part historian and part detective. You have to follow the clues and work out what is going on.\"He has now written to her outlining the story and other details of her family history and is awaiting a reply.From researching the 1901 census, Mr Newton also discovered the dog\u0027 owner was a Gaelic speaker. He speculated the dog might only have responded to Gaelic commands, which would explain why it refused to leave its post when the fire broke out as the owner was not present.If no definitive answer is forthcoming from America, the public will be invited to help name the dog.The council has come up with a shortlist of potential names including Dileas, Gaelic for faithful. Other contenders are Mac, Market Molly and Market Morag.A new plaque at the Market will honour the dog which was the only loss of life in the fire described by the Inverness Courier at the time as the most destructive in 40 years, causing estimated losses of \u0026pound12,000 and leaving families homeless.Wednesday 13 Jun 2018 6:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04114000/04114012.jpg","title":"The street has no name six years on","story":"\u0026nbspTHE hunt is on for a name for an Inverness street \u0026ndash after a six-year wait.The road that runs through Milton of Leys has never been named.Highland Council said it was agreed as far back as 2012 that naming the street \"would not be beneficial as it was not providing access to a particular address\".But the council has changed tack after a complaint from the ward\u0027\u0026nbspNon-Aligned Highland councillor Ken Gowans.He said residents were experiencing difficulties directing delivery drivers and added: \"If you had a bad accident on that road how would you identify your position? \"That road is a main thoroughfare that goes right the way down Milton of Leys.

Therefore, we support separating pedestrians, cyclists and motorists through an expansion of the network of walking and cycling paths across Scotland.We would like to stress, however, that measures like these will not single-handedly lead to safer roads. The road mentality in Scotland still favours the motorist over more vulnerable road users, which presents a huge barrier to more people taking up active lifestyles.More needs to be done to change our road culture for people in Scotland to feel safer regardless of their means of transportation, ultimately empowering them to lead healthier and more active lifestyles.Perhaps it is time we started to beat the ‘presumed liability’ drum once again?Brenda Mitchell, Road Traffic Accident Law (Scotland) LLP, Edinburgh.Sir,Some people have difficulty getting up and down the steps on the Glasgow bus. We asked West Coast Motors about this and they gave us the answer we wanted.All Citylink buses are fitted with an access ramp, worked by the driver. A platform comes out on to the pavement, with a holding bar, and is then raised up to floor level. This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform. Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp. The telephone number is 08712 663333.Kirsty McCuaig and Patricia Crawford, Mid Argyll Buddies.Sir,The ongoing effects of weather, bureaucracy and concern for the future continue to put our countryside under pressure, with few avenues to turn to for support.This can have dramatic consequences for the rural economy and the people who live and work there.The Prince’s Countryside Fund is committed to supporting community-led projects that will re-invigorate and sustain farming networks and the countryside by providing services and amenities through its grant programme.Open for applications until June 14, grants are available for up to £50,000. If you are involved in a community-run or farming support project and think your organisation may benefit – or if you know someone who might –  visit  www.princescountrysidefund. org.uk/grants.The fund has supported a diverse range of projects, including a community transport app in Argyll and projects on Barra, Orkney and Shetland. We are proud to have distributed more than £9 million since 2010 to more than 250 projects led by these grassroots organisations.It is crucial we help rural areas during these times of change to retain a thriving countryside and encourage a sustainable farming sector in the UK and would encourage people to apply for our funding.Claire Saunders, director, The Prince’s Countryside Fund.Sir,At first sight, it seems odd that the controversy over the reported disturbance to common gulls, oystercatchers and black guillemots at the old oil depot in Ardrishaig is focused on a breeding colony of common gulls.I’m no bird expert and hadn’t realised common gulls are less common than the bigger varieties or that they’re a declining species.But among the reasons given for this are predation by mink and the loss of open rubbish dumps and both might be contributing factors in Mid Argyll.It’s surely hardly surprising that the only breeding colony along the canal is at the Ardrishaig end, where the urbanisation around the tidal flats of Loch Gilp and the Lingerton dump offer prime scavenging opportunities.I don’t know whether they lose out to the bigger gull species when it comes to local island nesting sites, or whether the old Gleaner site might offer other advantages, for example, maybe less vulnerable to mink predation – but could it be the gulls are there primarily because of man-made feeding opportunities and that they’ll find an alternative site that’s similarly convenient?Likewise, the smaller populations of oystercatchers and black guillemots, however, although they’re also both amber listed they don’t scavenge and seem to be more dependent on the sea and shore for their livelihoods.Their decline might be of more concern but they’re hopefully less swayed towards easy pickings around Loch Gilp and more evenly distributed to Loch Crinan.Perhaps Jim Dickson and Andrew Tongue can enlighten us further on just how endangered the populations of these three species are in Mid Argyll.Robert Wakeham, Lochgilphead.Sir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29.We are both keen to know this young person is alright as she appeared to be frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs.Knowing she was fine would put our minds at rest.

If she does choose to ignore the vote and force through this legislation, she will be breaking the conventions of the 20-year-old devolution settlement and imposing a power grab upon Scotland against our will.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters natures patterns","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 20/05/18, 11:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe natural world abounds in beautiful patterns, each evolved to enhance survival of a species \u0026#8211 the extravagant, iridescent peacock’s tail, which serves to attract a mate, while intricate orchid flowers entice pollinators and tigers’ stripes provide camouflage.But not all nature’s patterns are quite as showy it is the mathematical symmetries that I find most intriguing.Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci lived in 12th century Algeria when Indian numerals were introduced to the West via the Middle East.  In his book, Liber Abaci (published in 1202), he describes a numerical sequence, now called the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the previous two digits: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ad infinitum. He formulated this recurrence in relation to rabbit breeding, but it turns out to be exceedingly wide-spread in nature, from tree branching to mollusc shell growth to bee reproduction.Plant leaves are like solar panels, absorbing sunlight to power energy-providing photosynthesis.  Thus, leaves appear in a spiral around the stem, each positioned to optimise sunlight capture.  The ratio of leaves to turns is always a ration of Fibonacci numbers 3 leaves to 1 turn for hazel, 8/3 for pear and 13/5 for almond trees.  The angle between consecutive leaves is always close to 137.5o, called ‘the golden angle’ – perfect for maximising energy production.The number of petals in most flowers also follows the Fibonacci sequence: lilies have 3, buttercups 5, delphinium 8, common marigolds 13, asters 21.  But even more striking are the complex spirals of seed-heads of sunflowers, fir cones and pineapples.  In each case new seeds forming in the centre of the flower push older seeds out into mesmerising patterns of interlocking, clockwise and anticlockwise spirals.The numbers of spirals in both directions are consecutive Fibonacci numbers with 5 and 8 or 8 and 13 in pineapples, 8 and 13 in fir cones, and numbers as high as 144 and 233 recorded in sunflower heads.Why? Because these configurations pack in the most seeds.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 21/05/18, 3:33 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Some would argue it has been an eyesore that should have been knocked down long before now and replaced with a more modern building.But it\u0026#8217s sad to see the old Inveraray Community Hall crumble and rot with neglect.What makes the building\u0026#8217s current predicament all the more galling is that there was the chance, according to Inspire Inveraray, to make the building safe six years ago.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community. Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer. This can be anything from yoga, walking in the sunshine (I walk everywhere) or taking your favourite class at the gym.While you’re getting fitter and feeling healthier, you’ll be raising money to fund the highest quality research and essential information and support services that will save lives from bowel cancer.Take on the challenge and sign up at bowelcanceruk.org.uk/stepupfor30.Gaby Roslin, TV and radio presenterPICS:The common gull has been seen nesting at the disused oil depot. no_a21Gleanergull01Gulls at the former Gleaner site. no_a21Gleanergull02\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead kids get kitted out","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 30/05/18, 5:11 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowLochgilphead Soccer Centre is delighted to have taken delivery of a quality rain jacket for each of the kids associated with the centre and Red Star YFC.That’s 120 rain jackets in total.As well as making sure the kids look smart and feel part of the club they will also help keep them dry and warm when the weather is a bit wet and windy.The rain jackets have been sponsored by Mid Argyll Youth Development Services (MAYDS) and the Soccer Centre would like to say a huge thank you to MAYDS for this sponsorship and ongoing support.Five teams from Lochgilphead travelled to the Oban Football Festival on a Saturday April 28.

In fact many of the passing ferry passengers stopped to watch from the road.The new timing equipment, purchased with aid of a grant from Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust, was in full use by judge Mairi Henderson and made for more professional accuracy in timing aspects.The final Grand Prix had only two competitors but it was a masterclass of style and competence from Jojo and Katie which made it a joy to watch.As usual the event ended with some fast and exciting games and after the field was cleared there was the prizegiving in the Pony Club’s brand new blue tent.The Junior Trophy for the day was won by Louise Ralston from Campbeltown and Iris McMillan from Tayvallich took the Senior Trophy for a second year while the non-members trophy was won by Andrea McShannon.Pony Club PonyClass 11 Frazer Prentice, Firefly2 Louise Ralston, Nero3 Rory Shaw, Libby4 Jake Rowan, AliceClass 21 Willow Ryan, Ryan2 Zoe Prentice, Cowal3 Isla McShannon, ColeyClass 31 Iris McMillan, Conker2 Katie MacKay, Eva3 Josephine Boase, ValerieClass 41 Andrea McShannon, Nicole2 Julie McLeish, Eclipse3 Shelagh Oakes, Pery4 Catriona Ryan, DoneyShow JumpingStars of the Future \u0026#8211 Lead Rein1 Louise Ralston, Nero2 Frazer Prentice, Firefly3 Rory Shaw, Libby4 Jake Rowan, AliceStars of the Future1 Iris McMillan, Conker2 Zoe Prentice, Cowal3 Isla McShannon, Coley4 Willow Ryan, RyanNewcomers1 Iris McMillan, Conker2 Andrea McShannon, Nicole3 Michelle McAloon, Eclipse4 Catriona Ryan, DoneyDiscovery1 Josephine Boase, Valerie2 Andrea McShannon, Nicole3 Katie MacKay, Eva4 Michelle McAloon, EclipseGrand Prix1 Josephine Boase, Valerie2 Katie MacKay, Eva\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"springwatch spotlight on tarbert","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 07/06/18, 12:17 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowTarbert has featured on the popular BBC nature show Springwatch.An underwater segment stirred up a buzz on social media with its inside look at the colourful world just beneath the waves.Diver and cameraman Andy Jackson took to the bottom of Loch Fyne to view what he called ‘an underwater garden’ and the wonderful creatures within.The segment was aired on Tuesday June 5 and is available on BBC iPlayer for a limited period.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 07/06/18, 4:46 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.This week\u0026#8217s photograph comes from Jacqui Barker of Tarbert.

After a pit stop in the Royal Burgh it was on to Fort William, then Inverness and back home again- all to raise money for Cancer Research UK and Target Ovarian Cancer.Spokesperson for Breast Way Round, Laura White, said: ‘This year was full of fun, laughter, meeting new family members and although the daily miles are hard going, the weather and the beauty of the Scottish scenery made it that little bit easier.’As well as the sponsored trek, the bikers raised money in more traditional ways, such as bucket shaking (the men wearing bras) and hosting a raffle and auction in Caol Community Centre. The most coveted item, a patchwork quilt made by rider Cathy Anderson, went for a whopping £700.The annual trip was started in 2008 by Shirley-Ann McKnight as a last tour of Scotland for fellow biker and close friend, Alyson Porter, who was suffering from cancer. Sadly, Alyson never made it to her trip and now each year the journey is retraced in celebration of her life and all those affected by cancer.Since 2008, more than 600 riders have participated, each clad with a pink mohawk courtesy of Hairy-RS, and the team has raised £347,000 for Macmillan Cancer Support.

She died because there was no match, but I signed up because of her.\u0026#8217Brett received his transplant in October 2015 and, after a long recovery, is now healthy and well.The identity of recipient and donor must be kept confidential for two years, to protect them both, but the pair exchanged cards, giving Brett and David the chance to learn a bit about each other.Then, on Sunday June 3, the long-awaited meeting took place in Campbeltown.Brett continued: \u0026#8216I had butterflies before we met. I was a little bit lost for words but I gave David a hug and shook hands and said thank you. We had a lovely evening together with our families and the kids played together, which was great.\u0026#8216Without David, my kids would have grown up without a father.\u0026#8216The first couple of minutes were a little bit overwhelming because there was so much anticipation,\u0026#8217 said David .\u0026#8216Our kids got along really well and I see us becoming friends rather than anyone feeling like they owe us something,\u0026#8217 he continued.David now works for the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS) and is involved in its partnership with Anthony Nolan, which has now recruited more than 10,000 potential donors.Amy Bartlett, regional development manager for Scotland said: \u0026#8216The SFRS and Anthony Nolan partnership has already resulted in 28 people donating stem cells but Brett and David are the first pair who have been able to meet, so it’s an exciting moment.\u0026#8216I would encourage anyone who is aged 16-30 and in good health to consider joining the register and visit anthonynolan.org/join.

The astonishing cave-in by wobbling South Ayrshire Council came amidst a 1700-name petition signed by furious residents and businesses. The council ARE pressing ahead with fees at a third Troon car park, at Bellevue in Prestwick and Ayr Blackburn. They argued the \u0026pound2 charge would destroy much-needed trade and lead to chaos in surrounding streets in Troon The U-turn was revealed by Councillor Craig Mackay at Troon Community Council last Tuesday. He managed to finally nail down an answer from his officials, admitting: “This issue has caused confusion within the council.” There will be no charges at the car park at the Walker Hall or the Italian Gardens.  But council officers are pressing ahead with a \u0026pound2 fee at the South Beach car park next to Royal Troon. This lead to anger from Community Councillor Robert Milligan, who said: “I suggest if you are going to charge for South Beach you actually need to provide loos, even temporary between May and September, to meet demand. If people are paying for parking the least we can do is to have toilet facilities without peeing in the dunes. “People are urinating in the sand dunes and residents can see it from their houses.” At the community council police revealed Troon only gets a traffic warden once every 2.8 days. And townspeople feared cars would be abandoned on the streets rather than pay for parking. The Ayrshire Post has led the way on the issue, revealing Troon has NEVER had to pay parking fees. Councillor Mackay said: “ We were working on the basis of parking charges being introduced to three car parks in Troon.  “I had a meeting with senior officers to discuss concerns of residents and businesses, in particular at the Walker Hall. “The knock-on conserquences are complex, particularly with displacement into residential streets.” He finally got an admission the council were axing the charges in a statement from SNP party colleague Ian Cochrane. Councillor Mackay added: “I was still struggling to get full clarity. “Traffic Orders are being progressed at Royal Troon, Belevue Road in Prestwick and Blackburn Road in Ayr. “It came as a surprise to me as the statement said no other parking charges are proposed at this time and that is quite a changes from what we were looking at.” Troon council vice-chairman Dougie Graham added: “We will wait to see what happens.” Five days after being asked for a comment on the U-turn, South Ayrshire Council would only say: “We’re currently finalising plans for the introduction of charges at Blackburn Road, Bellevue Road and Troon seafront car parks – all of which will require a new Traffic Regulation Order (TRO). We’ll soon be getting the TRO process underway, which will include a period of public consultation, and further details on this will be shared in due course.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12539593.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/14478946.jpg","title":"lawrence shankland agrees new deal","story":"NewsLawrence Shankland agrees new deal to stay at Ayr United for Championship pushThe 29-goal striker has put pen to paper on a new deal at Somerset Park.\u0026nbspShareByStuart WilsonLochlin Highet13:14, 15 MAY 2018Updated13:18, 15 MAY 2018NewsShankland is staying on at Somerset (Image: Daily Record)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailLawrence Shankland insists money can’t buy happiness after he sensationally spurned a host of lucrative offers to pen a new deal at Ayr United.

Shankland, 22, told the Ayrshire Post: “It’s a great club to be a part of. The main thing for this decision is that I am enjoying my football.

But the affection he has had from our supporters has played a huge part in his decision. It’s a huge piece of business for this club.

Mhari Bryce, 27-year-old Reception Manager from Hamilton married 36-year-old Operations Manager Chris Rowe from Manchester. The pair now live in Ayr. “We met on a training course in Livingston in 2010 - Chris offered me his last jelly baby!” said Mhari. “It was after Chris moved from Livingston to Ayr that we started dating properly and have been together since.” The couple tied the knot on Sunday, April 1 at The Waterside Hotel in West Kilbride. Mhari said: “We had the perfect day with amazing weather and a beautiful sunset.  “All our closest friends and family joined us for a simple but loving ceremony carried out by Peter Clark of the Scottish Humanist Society.” The bride wore a Mori lee dress from Bijoux Bridal, Hamilton. Mhari’s veil held a special sentimental value to it. She said: “The veil is 25 years old which was worn by my aunt on her wedding day.” The groom and best men wore Grey Spirit kilts from Slaters, Ayr. The couple’s wedding party consisted of bridesmaids Sara Bryce (bride’s sister) and Lyndsey Bickerton and best men Grant Russell and Mark Rowe (groom’s brother). The newly married Mr and Mrs jetted off for a fortnight in the sun after the big day.  The couple said: “We flew to St Lucia for 2 weeks and stayed at The Royalton. “It was amazing - so relaxed, exactly what we needed after the wedding.” Adore Weddings captured the couple’s big day, with both photography and videography, leaving them with lovely memories to look back on. Mhari added: “Both Barrie and Jim were fantastic all day, with us and all the guests. “The pictures are just too hard to pick from.” Stems and Gems in Saltcoats created the bouquets, buttonholes and flowers for the centrepieces while the cake was made by a relative.  Mhari said: “The cake was made by my aunt. “It was baked in Norwich then driven all the way to Scotland and built. “All the flowers are made of icing to match the flowers in my bouquet.” Linzi of Linzi Smith Hair at Distinction styled the hair for the day while Elaine Sawyer of Lookz Mobile Makeup Artist created the makeup looks. The couple added: “We would like to thank everyone who travelled the distance to make our special day - some all the way from Texas. “Also a massive thank you to Ryan and Stacey of The Waterside - our day ran perfectly all thanks to them.” For more photos of this week\u0027s Wedding of the Week, pick up your copy of the Ayrshire Post.

Stuart Laing gets a glittering OBE for nearly 50 years hard graft in the shiny world of jewellery. And Kirsty Letton is now an MBE after more than four decades of dedication to Scottish curling. That they live within 500 yards of each other in Troon is highly noteworthy in that NOBODY else who lives in mainland Ayrshire received anything this year. Stuart,68, has been honoured not just for running the family’s firm Laings, but his foundation of a UK consortium that allowed independents to flourish. He said: “I am thrilled and delighted to speak about it . . . this has been very difficult not to mention.  “I am proud and honoured, but also very humbled as well.” In 1970 he joined the family firm which was begun 130 years earlier. He expanded it to seven branches and started the Houlden (his mother’s maiden name) buying and professional services group for independent jewellers. Stuart remains active as executive chairman of Laings, though his son-in-law Joe Walsh is now chief executive. The father-of-three and now grandad-to-five has been such an influence in the jewellery market he’s regarded by the trade throughout the world. He said: “Strengthening and creating a strong, independent retail sector and giving the UK industry a global identity has been extremely rewarding.” “But this honour is for my entire family and colleagues as a lot of people have been with me on this journey.”  Stuart and his wife Lynda have three children - son Simon and daughters Susanna Laing, and Wendy Walsh. Stuart added: “I would like to pay tribute to my wife Lynda, she has been a wonderful support, a real rock. “We have travelled the globe together representing the UK trade.” He also created the ‘Jewellers of Excellence’ brand, which is a hallmark of trust within the industry. Stuart has been involved in all aspects of the industry and was the only UK Director of SIHH (Salon International de la Haute Horlogerie), a renowned association of the best jewellers in the world, in co-operation with high-end watch houses. Curling champion and coach Kirsty Letton reckons her MBE is an accolade for the entire sport. She says: “Of course I am thrilled and proud. It was a big surprise, I must admit.”  And so are the family - husband Jimmy and children Avril, who now lives in Ascot, and Keith who is in Grenada. Superfit Kirsty - now a 77-year-old grandmother of three - is still playing on the rink as well as coaching at Ayr and manages to find the time to grab an oar for some coastal rowing. Last year she picked up a Sportscotland lifetime volunteering award. And although moving to Ayrshire 21 years ago and joining the Troon Portland club the link with her orginal Glasgow four has never been broken. The highlight of Kirsty’s playing career was winning senior silver in the World Championships in Finland in 2008. She is particularly proud of motivating South Ayrshire primary pupils to have fun on the ice, with 269 youngsters participating in her taster sessions last season.  As well as inspiring the stars of tomorrow, Kirsty instigated the strongly contested World Senior Curling Championships in 2000. She also set up the Glynhill Ladies Curling International event, which attracts world-class teams. Kirsty added: “I don’t know where I would be without curling. It has been a huge part of my life for 40 years. “Last week Ayr Curling Club got the active schools gold award for South Ayrshire and it is things like that which keep me going.” Ayrshire’s Lord-Lieutenant Iona McDonald congratulated the pair. She said: “They have made a considerable contribution to our communities and I am sure that this award comes as a great surprise, as many of them do not seek any recognition for the work that they do. •The Edinburgh-based business grandee Sir Brian Gammell Ivory, gets a CBE for his chairmanship role at Dumfries House.

The bill for absent workers comes on the back of 42,736 days lost during the last 12 months. Employees recorded an average of nine days on the sick during 2017/18. Psychological reasons (30 per cent) were cited as the leading cause for absence, followed by musculoskeletal (19 per cent) and hospitalisation (12 per cent). By far the biggest service to feel the strain was the Health and Social Care Partnership, where an average of 16 days per employee was lost. Teachers, who account for 23 per cent of the council’s workforce, were the best performing ‘directorate’ with a loss of just five days per worker.  All figures were recorded between April 1, 2017 and March 31, 2018. Council officials said trends were showing a “gradual and consistent improvement”. An average of 11.7 days were lost to absence by local government employees (all staff bar teachers) in 2010. The revised figure stands at 10.06 days for 2017/18. A council spokesman said they were “committed” to supporting staff and have a “number of policies and supports in place to maximise employee attendance”. They added: “In recent years, more robust monitoring and reporting arrangements have been introduced which have seen a steady improvement in this area, with our figures below the national average. “We continue to closely monitor employee attendance levels and take all appropriate steps to ensure appropriate standards.” "},{"url":null,"title":"Woman was almost four-times legal limit on way home from supermarket","story":"A SHOPPER who drove home from a local supermarket while almost four times the legal limit has received a 16-month driving ban at Selkirk Sheriff Court.\nFifty three year old Willow Syme had initially denied driving in various streets in Peebles with a breath/alcohol reading of 87 microgrammes - the legal limit being 22 - on the evening of Friday, March 23.\nBut at her intermediate diet she changed her plea to guilty.\nThe court was told she was spotted leaving the Sainsbury\u0027s store under the influence of alcohol and police were called.\nHer lawyer said the support worker was having relationship difficulties at the time.\nSyme of Kitttlegairy View in Peebles, was also fined \u0026pound300 in addition to the 16 month ban.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Rugby fan was five times driving limit after Earlston Sevens","story":"A rugby fan who got into her car after a drinking session following Earlston Sevens was five times the legal alcohol limit, Selkirk Sheriff Court has been told.\nAfter travelling a short distance, Leisha Lightbody of Forthill Avenue in Jedburgh, was immediately pulled over by police officers who were on duty in Earlston\u0027s High Street on Sunday, May 6.\nThe 24-year-old recorded a breath/alcohol reading of 110 microgrammes - the legal limit being 22.\nLightbody - who works at Edinburgh Airport - had her disqualification period reduced to 14 months due to her immediate guilty plea and she was also fined \u0026pound400.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Britain s Got Talent 2018 winner Lost Voice Guy to gig in the Scottish Borders","story":"HE\u0026nbspcaptured the nation\u0026rsquos hearts as Lost Voice Guy and was crowned the winner of Britain\u0026rsquos Got Talent, but before comedian Lee Ridley performs for the Royal Family, he has\u0026nbspa rather important engagement in the Scottish Borders this week.\nThe stand-up comedian, from Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, who astounded Great Britain with his hilarious comedy despite having no speech, is to perform at West Linton\u0026rsquos Annual Comedy evening tomorrow (Thursday, June 7) at 7.30pm in the Marquee on the village\u0027s Lower Green.\nThe comedy evening is part of the Border village\u0027s annual Whipman Festival week.\nLee suffers from neurological condition cerebral palsy which means he can\u0026rsquot speak, and instead pre-records his routines and plays them via a voice synthesizer on a tablet.\nThe first comedian ever to win the talent show and scoop \u0026pound250,000, plus a slot at the Royal Variety Performance,\u0026nbsphad the judges, audiences and the public in stiches with his self-deprecating brand of comedy, opening his performance with quips like \u0026ndash \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom a struggling stand-up comedian who also struggles to stand up.\nFormer Whipman Calum Murray said: \u0026ldquoThe Whipman Play Society is extremely excited to have Lee performing with us at our annual comedy evening, hosted by Over The Lynne Comedy Club.\n\u0026ldquoThis event has gown each year and is one not to be missed during the Whipman week.\n\u0026ldquoAs a fan of Britain\u0026rsquos Got Talent myself, this year was definitely one of the best, especially for comedians.\n\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos amazing for us to be able to have such a big name this year.

Immediately Jewson Campbeltown chipped in for a couple, leaving 13 up for grabs.CDJFA said a small part of this will help towards the running costs of the festival. The remainder will purchase new equipment.In June 2012, what started out as a return exchange with Lochgilphead resulted in CDJFA\u0026#8217s idea for an annual football festival. Soon teams from Oban, Islay and Tarbert attended, followed by central-belt squads.CDJFA caters for football in South Kintyre for children aged from three to 18.In February 2012, CDJFA joined Campbeltown Pupils AFC, Campbeltown Soccer Centre and educational football to form Campbeltown and District Community Football Club.It had the simple objective to bring all local football organisations under one umbrella for the first time.In August 2012, CDJFA elected a new committee which agreed to bring the soccer centre and school football under the auspices of CDJFA to avoid duplication of effort and to give children and youths as many opportunities to play football as possible.This also involved signing up to the SFA’s quality mark scheme, providing a coaching framework and a player pathway for children which leads to the  amateur football team Campbeltown Pupils AFC.In early 2013, with nearly 200 youngsters attending CDJFA sessions, it registered Campbeltown Pupils Youth FC with the SYFA and more exchanges home and away started.In August 2013, 2001s, U13s were accepted into the Dunbartonshire Football Development League (DFDL) – the first time a youth team in Campbeltown had played in a national league.In late 2013, CDJFA was awarded the SFA’s quality mark standard award in recognition of its efforts.In January 2015, CDJFA progressed to development status of the SFA’s quality mark scheme.In 2017, two 11-a-side teams were entered into the DFDL at 2005s and 2002s.Tomorrow parents and helpers will assemble at 9am on the Meadows to lay out the pitches.Kick-off for the 2006/07/08/09 seven-a-side age groups is 12.30pm with the 2010/11/12s and girls section at 1pm.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letter how dare you laugh","story":"Perhaps you shouldn’t read this. It might make you laugh.Somewhere along the line, in the last five or six years, the world seems to have developed a serious crack in its funny bone.And I do mean serious, no crack intended.And there I go again, being flippant, trying to raise a smile in one or two readers, even if it might resemble a risus sardonicus. (It’s how people on Sardinia used to grin, that’s why.)It’s a congenital condition – like my idiocy, claims my wife– that ever since I was young I made outrageous statements and people would say to me: \u0026#8216You can’t be serious.\u0026#8217 \u0026#8216Not on a regular basis, no,\u0026#8217 was my usual reply.For the greater part of my 70-odd years, while laughter was still an acceptable knee-jerk reaction to almost anything, I prospered, in a vaguely penniless way, as a freelance writer of would-be humorous journalism.Nothing too fancy, no slipping on banana skins, but not rocket science either.  (Although the rotation of the Earth really makes my day.)In retrospect, I see now that my humour wasn’t serious enough. It had no underlying message.  It had no sociological content.  It was not of the variety that allowed people to feel wise, nod wisely, and say something wise, like: \u0026#8216Very wise…\u0026#8217The mistakes of the past – of my past – included trying to make people lose control and laugh aloud, rather than just being able to smirk knowingly at my cleverness, if I ever was.We live in a much more buttoned-up, uptight and insecure society than we used to (do you feel my sociological message approaching?) and it has affected the sort of things we feel we are permitted to laugh at, or not permitted to laugh at.Scorn and ridicule can no longer be directed at certain people with impunity – the dishonourable exception being bankers and politicians, of course, who are still fair game, and rightly so, even if out on bail and technically innocent because they haven’t been charged yet.But when did you last hear a blitz of jokes from a television comedian about a small, ethnic, obese, female bishop, even if she was his mother-in-law?Don’t worry, the news isn’t all bad, and I can report that sometimes outbreaks of laughter can occur in the most unusual places – Dundee, for example – and at the most unexpected times.Not long ago I saw a funeral procession led by a slow-marching, black-suited chaplain who was laughing his head off as he walked along in front of the hearse.As I watched in amazement, his happy demeanour began to affect his slow progress, which became a sprightly strut, and it seemed at any moment he might twirl his top hat in his hands, or even produce a rabbit from it.Only when I caught sight of the wireless device attached to his ear did I guess he was probably listening to dance music on a radio earbud. Death is no respecter of parsons.Let’s hope the worst extremes of political correctness will gradually fade away, as common sense brings a return to humorous nonsense, and seriousness wilts in the face of jocularity.A life without laughter?You must be joking.David Aitken,Dundee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letter mok run thankyou","story":"The continued outstanding success of Mok Run race weekend is a reflection of the ever-increasing dedication and commitment its hard working committee, community volunteers, local businesses, enthusiastic runners and crowd supporter’s display year after year.On behalf of myself and the Mok Run committee I would like to say a massive thank you to those who contributed their free time and energy to make this happen for the 13th consecutive year.Each year we are given tremendous support from many individuals and organisations listed here and this is very much appreciated.Sincere thanks to: Campbeltown Co-op, Wee Toon Sports , McFadyens, Mach Dunes, Tunnocks, AM Transport, Argyll Bakeries, Seafield Hotel, Campbeltown Pottery, Kintyre Agricultural Society,  Jim Martin Supplies, Killegruer Caravan Site, Machrihanish Holiday Park, Glen Scotia, Spring Bank, Beinn An Tuirc, Live Argyll,  Stewart Balfour and Sutherland, Campbeltown Running Club, Jogscotland and Wee Toon Warriors.By supporting this event, you have made a concrete contribution to the greater community.I would also like to extend my grateful thanks to: all the MOK Run committee members who work tirelessly behind the scenes our race marshals \u0026#8211 without whom this event would not happen race sweepers  race day commentator Councillor John Armour Gavin Reid Johnny Durnan David McMillan Willie Ralston Barrs Clochkeil Councillor Donald Kelly Argyll and Bute Council amenities team Campbeltown Police Office Southend Scouts Campbeltown\u0026#8217s: Young Fire Fighters Coastguard Sea Cadets Police Scotland Youth Volunteers massage therapists Brass Band Kintyre Schools Pipe Band West Coast EMT Jamie G  South Kintyre Sports Council \u0026#8211 for making our legendary post race ceilidh such a success Dalintober primary pupils for their motivational posters to our photographers: John McFadyen Campbeltown Courier\u0026#8217s Mark Davey Kenny Craig and Greg and Norma Grogan for capturing the spirit of the weekend Fiona and Donna Robertson and all the Junior MOK Run volunteers and to many of our other volunteers who took the time to help on race day.Apologies if I have missed anyone.A special thank you once again goes to the residents of Limecraigs, for taking the time to decorate the street, provide well received ‘showers’ along with the local fire brigade ‘shower’ who came out in full force to cheer the runners on in the final leg of the 10K route.As one runner summed it up on our facebook page: \u0026#8216Fantastic day !\u0026#8216Thanking all the organisers, marshals, water-givers, water-hosers, sweety-givers, pipers, drummers, sandwich and pastry makers, and everyone else involved.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.

Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.

Introducing no waiting, loading and unloading at Inveresk Road, opposite Musselburgh Grammar School\u0026rsquos car park, to prevent inconsiderate parking  2. Putting waiting restrictions at the entrance to Loretto Court to control indiscriminate parking and free flow of traffic  3. Introducing waiting restrictions at the entrances into Loretto School at Linkfield Road to control indiscriminate parking and improve sightlines  4. Introducing no waiting, loading and unloading at junctions on Eskview Terrace to stop inconsiderate parking and create a loading bay in the layby at local shops  5. Removing a section of double yellow lines over a private driveway at Millhill  6. Introducing waiting restrictions on St Michael\u0026rsquos Lane to prevent vehicles from parking and causing obstructions to pedestrians accessing Musselburgh Primary Care Centre  7. Extending the existing no waiting, loading and unloading at the exit of Linkfield Court to improve sightlines and removing a section of no waiting, loading and unloading restriction on the west side to create parking space  8. Extending no waiting, loading and unloading to improve sightlines at Windsor Gardens  9. Removing a section of single yellow line on Bridge Street at The Brunton, west of the taxi rank, and replacing it with 90-minute waiting limit  10.

Plans put forward by Dears Pharmacy were turned down by Lothian Health Board at a meeting last month.  A three-person Pharmacy Practices Committee (PPC) panel, chaired by East Lothian councillor Fiona O\u0026rsquoDonnell, unanimously refused the application.  The decision notice, published on NHS Lothian\u0026rsquos website, said that there were \u0026ldquono gaps in the existing provision of services within the neighbourhood as the other pharmacies in the area could provide the full range of pharmaceutical services.  For village residents, that means a trip to Gullane or Haddington.  The report adds: \u0026ldquoThe committee also noted that consultations by telephone were offered by one of the pharmacies in the area.  \u0026ldquoIt was also noted that extended hours provision was offered by Asda at The Jewel on the east side of Edinburgh, a distance of only 13 miles.  It also stated that there was a \u0026ldquohigh level of car ownership in the village and that public transport links were \u0026ldquogood, meaning residents could travel to other pharmacies.  However, the decision has been criticised by Dears Pharmacy and East Lothian MSP Iain Gray.  He said: \u0026ldquoI supported the application for a pharmacy, both because there is none in the village and because it could help keep the Post Office.  \u0026ldquoI was very disappointed with the decision to refuse it. I understand that there are laid-down criteria to be followed but in my view they must be wrong because they led to the wrong decision in this case.  \u0026ldquoI remain convinced that the people of Aberlady would benefit from a pharmacy without having to travel to Gullane, and have promised to support the application again if there is an appeal.  \u0026ldquoI will also be writing to the chief pharmacist and NHS Lothian about my concerns that the process is flawed.  Mahyar Nickkho-Amiry, operations director at Dears, confirmed to the Courier they would appeal the decision.  He described the decision as \u0026ldquoactive discrimination against village residents, adding: \u0026ldquoIt is a slap to the people of Aberlady. Because this is an affluent area, people are being forced to drive to Gullane or Haddington, whereas if the village was less affluent they would have stood more of a chance.  He said that had the proposals been approved, the pharmacy would have brought jobs to the village.  Donald Hay, chairman of Gullane Area Community Council, also criticised the decision.  He said: \u0026ldquoCommunity responses were not taken into account and the net result is the village could end up with no banking facilities, no Post Office and no pharmacy.  \u0026ldquoIt makes bleak reading for the village for the future.  The petition has gathered more than 700 signatures online since it was created.  Those who sign are also asked to give reasons online and Gary Hitchen wrote: \u0026ldquoI find it impossible to understand how this can have been refused.  \u0026ldquoThe provision of a pharmacy in Aberlady can only be a good thing and if it also ensures the future of the Post Office that is an added bonus.  \u0026ldquoVillages are being destroyed and turned into commuter satellites by local businesses closing \u0026ndash please don\u0026rsquot let Aberlady be next.  Heather Jarron added: \u0026ldquoMany elderly residents without cars in this village would benefit greatly from having a pharmacy.

Between April 1 last year and the end of March 2018, 2,006 three-day emergency food supplies were given to local people.  Excluding holidays and weekends, it means that, on average, between eight and 10 food parcels are handed out Monday to Friday by the charity.  The number of three-day emergency food supplies distributed rose by 12 per cent from the previous year.  The figure mirrors what is happening across the UK, which has shown a 13 per cent increase in food parcels given out.  In 2017-2018 benefit changes/delays accounted for 757 East Lothian cases with 1,666 people affected, including 617 children. In addition, 595 cases were referred for emergency food due to being refused a crisis grant, affecting 937 people, of which 253 were under the age of 16.  A total of 31,604 kilos of food was given out last year by the county\u0026rsquos foodbank, with 50,292kgs donated.  Peter Dicker, foodbank manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquoll continue to provide vital support when it matters most \u0026ndash we\u0026rsquore dedicated to ensuring that people in our community with no money for food are able to access emergency support, and that has only been possible in the last year because of the incredible generosity shown by local people in donating food, time and funds.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray condemned the figures, saying: \u0026ldquoThese shocking figures underline the fact that problems with changes to the benefits system have made a significant contribution to the rise in foodbank referrals.  \u0026ldquoGovernments at Holyrood and Westminster can no longer sit back and accept the ever increasing number of people being forced to use foodbanks.

As many as 1,600 homes \u0026ndash as well as business units, a supermarket, primary school and various green spaces \u0026ndash are planned for the former opencast mine site at Blindwells.  The first housebuilder is expected to be announced this summer, with work on housing getting under way potentially by the end of the year.  In the meantime, preparatory work has been carried out on the site, which is sandwiched between the A1 north of Tranent and the A198 south of Cockenzie and Port Seton.  Now Hargreaves, which is behind the proposals, is looking to create an access to the site off the roundabout to the north of the A1 at Bankton Junction.  Iain Slater, development and estates director, said the new exit would be permanent, although it would initially be limited to construction traffic.  Other works are planned for the junction, which links the A1 with the A198.  Mr Slater said: \u0026ldquoAs part of the permission the road layout will be altered to allow for the additional cars generated from the Blindwells development.  \u0026ldquoThese works include widening of the A198 approaching the roundabout to increase capacity [as well as] the installation of a filter lane to allow cars leaving the A1 heading east to go round to Tranent without stopping at the roundabout. There are also plans for traffic lights to assist with traffic flows should the need arise.  As many as 350 jobs could be created during the lengthy building period at the site.  Construction work on the 1,600 homes could take 12-15 years, with early plans already drawn up for a second phase further to the east which could see another 1,600 homes, as well as leisure space and a cemetery."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7870497.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Tranent singer Caitlyn Vanbeck  39 s first single takes charts by storm","story":"              TRANENT singer Caitlyn Vanbeck\u0026rsquos first single flew up the charts when it was released on Monday.

The premises at Olive Bank Retail Park has a completely new layout and design, including the installation of new fascia and frontage, digital signage, LED lighting, improved in-store navigation and new checkouts that are quicker and easier to use.

It read: \u0026ldquoThe result will be a modern, bright, accessible and customer-friendly store with a focus on quality.

Plain clothes police officers joined colleagues in uniform and members of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos community warden team at John Muir Park and Lochend Woods.  John Muir Park has regularly been used by teenagers who are celebrating the end of their exams.

On Friday and Saturday, police and community wardens seized the alcohol from youngsters aged 14 to 21, with a variety of lager, cider and spirits, including 12 litres of vodka, taken.  Inspector Andrew Harborow said: \u0026ldquoEvery year around this time we are aware of youths congregating at Bullet Hill.

Jess Mackie\u0026rsquos family created the fund in her name after the Gullane youngster, who loved to sing and help others, passed away suddenly on January 2 this year.  The North Berwick High School pupil was a member of the National Youth Choir of Scotland and sang with Aberlady and Gullane Parish Churches, at care homes and for charities, and at school concerts.  Despite her young age, she had a sense of how music could help people in need.  And now the Jess Mackie Memorial Fund will \u0026ldquohelp her to keep helping others, as she had always done, and would have continued to do if she was still with us, said parents Michael and Jackie.  \u0026ldquoWe cannot let our beautiful daughter\u0026rsquos name and character be forgotten, they said. \u0026ldquoShe had so much to offer.  All monies raised will be used to provide support and comfort through music therapy at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh.  Dad Michael, long-standing chairman of Gullane Sports Development Trust, said: \u0026ldquoWhen Jess passed away, we had a memorial service for her and decided to use it to donate to the Edinburgh Children\u0026rsquos Hospital Charity. Quickly thereafter, we learnt about an initiative involving music therapy they were running with Tinderbox Orchestra in the hospital. We met with one of the trustees initially and we decided to put in place something that would allow Jess to help other kids.  The memorial service, which was held at Aberlady Parish Church, raised more than \u0026pound2,000, with money continuing to be donated by members of the public and through organised events.  Michael, 52, said: \u0026ldquoWe were approached by Gullane and Aberlady Parish Churches and they asked if they could run an event in Jess\u0026rsquo memory, which they did last Sunday.  \u0026ldquoFrom the family point of view, it was another show of overwhelming support by the village and the community. We have raised a substantial amount of money. Gullane and Aberlady Parish Churches posted on Facebook that it had raised about \u0026pound1,800 for the fund and Gullane Athletic [FC] are running an event in August in support of the fund.  Twelve members of staff at North Berwick High School also took part in the recent Edinburgh Marathon Relay.  Split into three teams, they raised more than \u0026pound1,500 for The Royal Hospital for Sick Children Jess Mackie Memorial Fund, Richmond\u0026rsquos Hope and Leuchie House.  Jess, who was in S3 at the secondary school, was, like her twin sister Lauren, a keen singer.  Her dad told the Courier Jess \u0026ldquoloved singing and tried to help people and raise their spirits through her voice.  That love of singing and trying to help people has been mirrored through the success of the memorial fund, which sits at about \u0026pound9,800.  Michael added: \u0026ldquoI think that the fund reflects Jess completely. It reflects the impact she had while only 14 years old.  \u0026ldquoIt reflects the impact she had on people that she met and what she did in terms of her church singing, singing in local care homes, school concerts, helping out at various events like for the Bethany Christian Trust and Leuchie House. I think that reflects what she did while she was here.  The project aims to ensure children and young people who are feeling vulnerable in hospital are given the chance to enjoy music, which can have an enormous and positive impact, helping ignite a spark in them and giving them back a sense of control.  Michael added: \u0026ldquoMusic is a great comforter at times and what Tinderbox do is amazing for the kids.  \u0026ldquoWe had no hesitation in supporting what they do.  Janet Anderson, who is involved with the choirs at the two villages\u0026rsquo churches, also paid tribute to the talented teenager.  She said: \u0026ldquoI could not speak more highly of Jess.  \u0026ldquoShe did not think she had a special talent, she was just the most unassuming, normal girl you would ever meet.  \u0026ldquoShe was so pretty, so kind and so thoughtful and generous and she never thought she was anything special.

Chester, from Dunbar, is one of 13 pets, including cats, dogs and even a rat, taking part in the PDSA Pet Fit Club.  Together they weigh more than 200 kilogrammes and need to shed 75kg to reach their ideal weights.  Ten-year-old Chester, who lives with the Gilmour family on Newhouse Avenue, is looking to shift 2.6kg \u0026ndash or six pounds \u0026ndash to reach his ideal weight.  Chester, who tips the scales at 7.6kg, was gaining so much weight that his owners thought he must have an underlying medical condition. But when tests came back negative, it was clear Chester\u0026rsquos appetite and lazy ways were the root of the problem.  Owner Lisa said: \u0026ldquoWe realised everyone in the house was feeding him without knowing he\u0026rsquod already being fed, so he was getting fed by all four of us every day!  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove tried to help him lose weight, even putting a collar on him that says \u0026lsquoDo not feed me!\u0026rsquo for the neighbours, but that hasn\u0026rsquot worked.  \u0026ldquoHe eats whatever he can find including crisps left on the floor by the kids. He even stole my dad\u0026rsquos cheesecake that was on the kitchen counter! Another time my son woke up to the sound of rattling and he was trying to claw his way into a box of chocolates.  Lisa, along with partner Lindsay and sons Rhys and Ryan, got Chester when he was just a kitten.  Now they are determined to do what they can to help their pet lose some weight and be happier.  Lisa, who works in the family newsagent, added: \u0026ldquoHe\u0026rsquos getting older now and his weight will play on his joints if we don\u0026rsquot do something to help him. He can\u0026rsquot be comfortable carrying all that weight around and we want him to be happier and healthier as he ages.  Chester\u0026rsquos six-month Pet Fit Club diet and exercise programme will be specially tailored and overseen by the vets and nurses at Edinburgh PDSA Pet Hospital.  He is up against seven dogs, including a Cavalier King Charles spaniel who once ate a set of false teeth, a cat too fat to fit through the cat flap, and a rat who is double his ideal bodyweight.  If crowned the winner, Chester will receive a year\u0026rsquos supply of pet food, a pet-friendly holiday and a pet hamper.  Kathryn Marshall, PDSA Veterinary Care Assistant, will be helping to oversee Chester\u0026rsquos diet.  She said: \u0026ldquoWith the help of PDSA and Pet Fit Club, Lisa and Chester are making the necessary diet, exercise and lifestyle changes to help get Chester down to a healthier weight.  \u0026ldquoWe will support them every step of the way over the next six months to ensure they succeed."},{"url":null,"title":"Log found at Yellowcraig beach transformed into stunning violin","story":"              A VIOLIN maker has crafted a violin from driftwood found on an East Lothian beach to help raise awareness about the environment and the plight of the oceans.

Dean Conner, 33, of Links Avenue, has been handed an anti-social behaviour order (ASBO) following an application by East Lothian Council.  The court was presented with details of the alleged anti-social behaviour of Mr Conner, including shouting, swearing and fighting within a property at Links Avenue, and disposing of items and bags of rubbish outwith a domestic bin within the communal garden.  The terms of the ASBO prohibit Mr Conner from behaving in an anti-social manner including shouting and swearing at neighbours and other residents in and around Links Avenue.  He is also banned from having more than two visitors to his property at any one time except those who are there in the course of their employment.  Mr Conner had received an interim ASBO earlier this year.  A council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThere is a significant history of anti-social behaviour complaints made against Mr Conner which has caused considerable alarm and distress to others.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Council, with the full support of Police Scotland, will take the strongest possible action against those who behave in an anti-social fashion.

Len Smith, 92, was conscripted at the age of 18 and was a supply lorry driver for the British Liberation Army.  He landed at Gold Beach, Normandy, where he said he was not shot at and saw little combat.  But he drove some of the first troops into Berlin in 1945 and moved supplies through a war-ravaged France, Belgium, Holland and Germany.  Despite his actions, modest Len, who went on to work in the civil service, said he had never thought of himself as veteran, never mind a hero.  He told the Courier: \u0026ldquoThere were thousands of young men like me. I never considered myself a veteran until the recent events marking the anniversary led to me looking back.  \u0026ldquoAt the time we just got on with it the real heroes are the soldiers who fought and died over there.  Mr Smith was one of eight children born in Pencaitland to local couple John and Euphemia Smith.  His sister Ellen, 97, still lives in Pencaitland and he visits the area regularly but after he was demobbed in 1947, Mr Smith moved to Longlevens, Gloucestershire, to find work.  Now a widower, Mr Smith\u0026rsquos sister sends him the Courier every week so he can keep up with local news.  His L\u0026eacutegion d\u0026rsquoHonneur medal was sent to his home in Cheltenham by post and contained a letter from Jean-Pierre Jouyet, French ambassador to the UK, which said: \u0026ldquoI offer you my warmest congratulations on this high honour, which recognises your military engagement and steadfast involvement in the liberation of France during the Second World War.  \u0026ldquoAs we contemplate this Europe of peace, we must never forget the heroes like you who came from Britain and the Commonwealth to begin the liberation of Europe by liberating France.  But Mr Smith insists he was just a young man doing a job.  He said: \u0026ldquoI didn\u0026rsquot know how the war was going, I didn\u0026rsquot read anything about the war. I was a young lad and I had no fear.  \u0026ldquoI just thought \u0026lsquoget on with it\u0026rsquo.  However, he remembers thinking about how worried his mother would be.  Len\u0026rsquos brothers James and Thomas were also in active service and James was in the D-Day landings. All three came home.  He said: \u0026ldquoWhen we came back my mum was overjoyed, she got three sons back uninjured.  Last year, Mr Smith returned to the Normandy beaches on a British Legion tour organised for veterans.

Education Scotland visited Knox Academy in Haddington at the end of 2016 and told parents that the school needed to \u0026ldquorevisit its \u0026ldquovision and values.  The inspection report, which was released in March last year, highlighted a number of areas in which the school could improve. \u0026lsquoLeadership of change\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquolearning, teaching and assessment\u0026rsquo were ranked as \u0026lsquosatisfactory\u0026rsquo, while \u0026lsquoensuring wellbeing, equality and inclusion\u0026rsquo was described as \u0026lsquoweak\u0026rsquo.  Inspectors returned to the school 12 months on from the original report for a follow-up inspection, which led to a new report being published on Tuesday.  The inspection team talked to young people at the school and worked closely with the interim headteacher Lauren Rodger, who is returning to North Berwick High School after the summer holidays.  She will be replaced by Susan Cook, currently acting headteacher at Trinity Academy, Edinburgh  Other members of staff were also spoken to, to hear about the steps the school had taken to improve on areas previously identified in the original inspection.  Education Scotland noted the following key improvements:  - The interim headteacher has provided effective leadership in taking forward work to secure improvements, including a review of the school values  - Staff have developed a range of policies to improve practice in equalities and inclusion, including a new safeguarding policy  - The recently created Pupil Support Faculty is now better placed to address the needs of young people, and those with social, emotional and behavioural needs in particular  - The school has made progress in establishing a more positive learning environment for all.  The report did note that there were still some improvements to be made.  Issues highlighted included using evidence from self-evaluation activities to ensure consistency in learning and teaching across the school reviewing the purpose of the pupil support base to ensure there was a greater focus on learning for the young people using it and ensuring there was a whole school approach to equalities and inclusion.  Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, praised staff at the school for their efforts.  She said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that Education Scotland acknowledges that Knox Academy has made important progress since the last inspection, and I would like to thank all the staff and pupils for their hard work and commitment in making these improvements.  \u0026ldquoIt is really encouraging that the positive relationships between pupils and teachers, and the fact that almost all young people recognise the value of learning in their lives, was noted.  \u0026ldquoThis is a strong basis for ensuring that the school continues to be a positive learning environment for staff and pupils alike.  And she added: \u0026ldquoWe will continue to work with the school and Education Scotland to make further improvements, and to working with Susan Cook, our new headteacher, who joins the school in August.  Education Scotland will continue to work with East Lothian Council regarding the school\u0026rsquos capacity to improve and will return to carry out another inspection within 18 months."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7898185.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Thousands oppose Dunbar town centre parking charge plans","story":"              MORE than 2,000 people have signed a petition against the idea of parking charges being introduced on Dunbar High Street.  A public consultation looking at potential parking solutions throughout East Lothian came to a close last month.  Meetings and workshops were held throughout the county by East Lothian Council, including one in Dunbar Royal British Legion.  A number of suggestions were put forward, including for a disc parking system where visitors to the busy street would set a disc showing when they had parked.  Another idea being explored is parking charges \u0026ndash but that has met with the opposition of Dunbar Trades\u0026rsquo Association (DTA).  Philip Mellor, DTA chairman, said that the group \u0026ldquostrongly oppose the introduction of parking charges.  A petition, which was put in various businesses in the town, has attracted more than 2,000 signatures.  Mr Mellor added: \u0026ldquoThe DTA feel introducing parking charges to High Street and other key off-street parking areas will have a detrimental effect on our High Street and the local economy.  \u0026ldquoThe current system since the introduction of traffic wardens has already addressed concerns around space for shoppers on High Street and it now seems counterintuitive to then introduce a measure which will drive more customers away to out-of-town developments.  \u0026ldquoWhilst parking during heavy summer visitor times can be difficult, it is very few special event days where parking is congested enough to even consider parking charges viable the majority of the time parking is available and this potential charge seems to be nothing more than a money-raising exercise at the expense yet again of already-struggling independent business owners.  A spokesman for East Lothian Council said \u0026ldquoall responses would be taken into consideration as it looked to develop a strategy.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe draft Local Transport Strategy (LTS) sets out ways in which the council can meet both national and local objectives sustainably, while supporting the local economy and environment.  \u0026ldquoOur consultation on the draft LTS recently closed and we are grateful to everyone who responded or attended one of our workshops.

John, 35, from Port Seton, won \u0026pound1 million in the EuroMillions draw on June 26, 2015, but he remained in his job as a roofer, insisting he wanted to keep working.  He took on the challenge to climb more than 4,400 feet and faced treacherous weather conditions to mark the Lottery\u0026rsquos milestone and tick off a lifelong dream from his bucket list.  It comes as new research reveals that more than half of the millionaires are now spending more on experiences rather than possessions.  Looking at their shopping trends across time, out have gone designer watches, ride-on mowers, racehorses and conservatories, and in have come protecting woodlands, paying university fees and bar/games rooms.

The new scheme offers people an opportunity to support Our Community Energy \u0026ndash a partnership between not-for-profit Scottish firm Our Power and Mongoose Energy, which manages community energy assets \u0026ndash and hopes to find investors in the county.  They say that the site at Pogbie Windfarm \u0026ndash already home to the turbines \u0026ndash will create enough energy to power 7,200 homes and believe that, when they combine it with a second site in Berwickshire, the scheme will raise an estimated \u0026pound1.9 million in surplus profit over 25 years.  Our Power said that profit from the wind turbines it takes over would then be used to keep energy prices down, helping people who are struggling with the costs.  They need to raise just over \u0026pound3 million for the project, which covers both sites, and community groups and individuals are being invited to invest in bonds and shares to raise the money needed to get the project up and running, with investments ranging from \u0026pound500 to \u0026pound100,000.  Andrew Smith, Our Community Energy acting chairperson, said: \u0026ldquoFuel poverty is a huge issue for Scotland and we\u0026rsquore proud to be launching such an important fundraising opportunity to directly tackle it.  \u0026ldquoInvesting with a social purpose is something close to the hearts of many Scots, and these bond and equity offers provide the chance to have a huge impact locally.  \u0026ldquoThese offers aim to support those who struggle to afford sufficiently heated homes, as well as providing investors with an exciting new option which not only targets a significant social impact but a positive environmental one too.  \u0026ldquoHowever with these types of investments there are some risks and funds are not readily realisable.  \u0026ldquoInvestors should note that capital is at risk and returns are not guaranteed.  A fuel poor household is defined as one which needs to spend more than 10 per cent of its income on all fuel use and to heat its home to an adequate standard of warmth.  Last year, the East Lothian Poverty Commission found that almost half of local pensioners were forced to spend more than 10 per cent of their income on energy bills.

Persimmon Homes is hoping to get the go-ahead \u0026ldquoin principle from East Lothian Council for the mixed-use development, which includes a commercial hub with hotel, retail facilities and cafe/restaurant.  Community facilities such as a residential neighbourhood centre, playing fields, changing facilities and public parks are proposed.  Also planned is the construction of a grade-separated junction on the A1, roads and foot/cycle paths, as well as improvement to the Musselburgh rail halt.  Submission of the planning application in principle follows a Proposal of Application Notice and public consultation exercise for the major scheme, which included an exhibition on the draft masterplan at The Brunton last year.  A planning statement from Holder Planning, acting for Persimmon, read: \u0026ldquoThe application site is allocated for the mixed use development proposed in the soon-to-be adopted East Lothian Local Development Plan.  \u0026ldquoThe proposed development will deliver 1,500 homes across the site. These homes will comprise a range of housing types. Twenty-five per cent of the housing provision will be affordable as defined by the council.  \u0026ldquoA primary school is proposed that will accommodate the requirements arising from residential development on the wider site. It is located centrally in the application site within walking distance of new homes via a network of paths that offer safe and convenient links. The detailed design will be in accordance with the requirements of the education authority, East Lothian Council.  \u0026ldquoThe masterplan proposes enhancing a pedestrian link under the A1 that will link the site areas together, allowing new neighbourhoods and services to the west, identified in the wider masterplan, to gain access to Musselburgh Station and services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThe proposal incorporates a significant network of multi-functional open spaces and semi-natural landscape areas, including allotments/community growing space, natural play areas, sports pitches and outdoor gym facilities, and seating. This framework of green space will contribute to the legibility of the neighbourhood\u0026rsquos spatial pattern, establishing distinct areas of new housing linked together via a network of green foot and cycle routes.  A new research and innovation quarter for East Lothian offering more than 20 hectares of new commercial space is proposed.  The planning statement added: \u0026ldquoWith strong links to the adjacent Queen Margaret University, the site offers the potential to build upon the reputation of Edinburgh and the Lothians for its research and innovation.  Barry Turner, spokesman for Musselburgh Conservation Society, said: \u0026ldquoThe issue at Craighall is that major development here will be very close to major development in Edinburgh at Newcraighall and in Midlothian at Shawfair, turning the whole area into a cross-boundary urban sprawl and effectively an extension to Edinburgh\u0026rsquos built-up area.  Predicting that the plan for 1,500 houses would be approved, given that was the number in the Local Development Plan, he added: \u0026ldquoAll that we can hope for is that conditions will be put in place to make this amount of housing as acceptable as possible in terms of layout, design, amenities and access to walking and cycling routes and to public transport.  \u0026ldquoOf note is that the secondary-age children here will have to get to Musselburgh Grammar School, which is some distance away and not an easy walk, certainly not from the other side of the A1.  \u0026ldquoThe recently promoted Active Travel Network shows no cycle link to Musselburgh Grammar School. We are worried about the prospect of increased car usage to get kids to and from school thus adding to the gradually worsening traffic problems in the town.  Jim Kirkpatrick, managing director of Persimmon Homes East Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoWe have had extensive engagement with East Lothian Council and the local community prior to the application being lodged and have generally been encouraged by the positive response to our masterplan.  \u0026ldquoThe comments of Musselburgh Conservation Society are noted and we believe the issues raised are addressed in the suite of information provided to the council.  \u0026ldquoThe application is fully compliant with the proposals contained within the emerging East Lothian Local Development Plan and we look forward to working with officers and other stakeholders during the determination process."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7918221.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"England fans dare to wear team colours in Moscow as World Cup excitement builds","story":"              England fans have begun to venture out in Moscow in team colours as anticipation builds for the opening of the World Cup.

Relations between the Kremlin and Britain have been plunged into the deep freeze since the poisoning of Russian ex-spy Sergei Skripal in March, with Theresa May pointing the finger at Vladimir Putin\u0026rsquos regime.  But the Three Lions\u0026rsquo fans said they had been pleased with the welcome they had received in the city, which they are visiting while working in the country.

Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard MSP last week met East Lothian Labour Party campaigners at Holyrood as they delivered a petition signed by more than 1,000 people to Kevin Stewart MSP.  While Councillor Lachlan Bruce, ward member for Preston, Seton, Gosford was joined by South of Scotland MSP Michelle Ballantyne, both Conservative, as they sent letters to Mr Stewart calling for the same action (see image inset).  The campaign comes after the minister called in a planning application by Inch Cape Offshore Ltd (ICOL) to build a substation \u0026ndash which would bring energy ashore from a planned offshore wind farm \u0026ndash on a large section of the site, which was recently purchased by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower.  That sparked cross-party condemnation from county politicians, who fear it could jeopardise local plans to create jobs and boost the economy on the site.  Mr Leonard added his signature to the Hands Off Cockenzie petition before it was submitted.  Iain Gray (Lab), East Lothian MSP said: \u0026ldquoMinisters claim the call-in is because the site is of national importance, but even the leader of the SNP Group on East Lothian Council has condemned the decision as unnecessary.  \u0026ldquoBy signing our petition in such large numbers, local people have sent a clear message they want East Lothian to decide on decisions about the future of the site.  Meanwhile, Mr Bruce said he had asked Mr Stewart to send the decision back to the council. He said: \u0026ldquoI think it is only right that this decision is made locally by the council on behalf of local residents. The people who are affected most are local residents and it is the people they elected, not a Government minister from Aberdeen, who should be making the decision.  A Scottish Government spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe reporter will ensure that the local development plan and the community\u0026rsquos views are taken into account prior to making a recommendation to ministers, who will make the final decision."},{"url":null,"title":"IN PICTURES  Cockenzie and Port Seton Gala 2018","story":"              IT WAS a brilliant gala day in Cockenzie and Port Seton today.

Among the extensive list of on-site facilities, which will be used by both residents and the wider community, will be: a central two-storey clubhouse, tidal pools, spa facilities, a fitness suite, multi-use spaces for community events, a clinic, a contemporary restaurant, function suites and various shops.  The proposal will incorporate the very latest in information technology to provide the highest standard of support services for residents, said developers.  The project will be the most sustainable of its kind in Scotland, with a district energy centre and heating system to provide the most environmentally-friendly power at the lowest price.  A reservoir on the site dating back to 1850 will be incorporated into the overall development with plans to create walkways around the water feature, which will be stocked with trout for fishing.

In a statement at Holyrood Further and Higher Education Minister Shirley-Anne Somerville announced that the threshold for higher education bursaries would be raised from \u0026pound19,000 to \u0026pound21,000 from 2019/20.  Bursary support for the poorest young students in higher education will be increased from \u0026pound1,875 to \u0026pound2,000 a year.  Combined the two measures will benefit 13,500 students, she said.  Support for the poorest independent students will also rise from \u0026pound875 a year to \u0026pound1,000 benefiting nearly 18,000.  Bursary support in further education will also rise to up to \u0026pound4,500 a year, with all eligible students aged 18 and over receiving a guaranteed bursary award.  The minister was expanding on steps set out by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon at the SNP conference in Aberdeen at the weekend, including more than \u0026pound21 million of investment, an increase in the bursary for care-experienced students to \u0026pound8,100 and raising the repayment threshold for student loans to \u0026pound25,000.

Tory MSP Liz Smith pointed out that bursary support for the poorest students in higher education was \u0026pound2,640 in 2013.  She also urged the government to explain why the full range of changes were not going to be made until 2021 and said she was disappointed that part-time students \"received scant mention\" in the statement.

New legislation being introduced to Holyrood would hand councils extra powers to prohibit parking on pavements and double parking.  Previous efforts to address the issue were held up by various complications, including whether the necessary powers were devolved to Scotland.  The Scottish Government\u0026rsquos wide-ranging Transport Bill also aims to give councils more flexibility in running bus services, through working with operators, local franchising or running services themselves.  It also allows for the creation of low emission zones \u0026ndash such as that proposed in Glasgow \u0026ndash which will be under civil rather than criminal enforcement.  Transport minister Humza Yousaf said the legislation would give local authorities a new model to revitalise bus services.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are also providing clearer options for authorities to pursue local franchising or provide services themselves in appropriate circumstances.  \"Beyond bus services, this Bill will allow for decriminalised enforcement of low emission zones, double parking and parking on pavements.  \"This will help transform our towns and cities into cleaner, more accessible and more pleasant spaces to travel and enjoy.  The new proposals would also strengthen the technology underpinning \u0026ldquosmart ticketing, which could eventually allow all journeys on Scotland\u0026rsquos bus, rail, ferry, subway and tram networks to be linked into one payment system.  But critics described the legislation as a \"missed opportunity\" \u0026ndash insisting many of the measures don\u0026rsquot go far enough.  Scottish Labour\u0027s Colin Smyth said the SNP\u0026rsquos plans would mean \"public ownership of bus routes can only happen in very restricted circumstances.

This was an opportunity for the government to pave the way for a public bid for the ScotRail franchise and disappointingly they haven\u0027t taken it.\"  Scottish Conservative Donald Cameron MSP said some of the proposals would \u0026ldquoexacerbate feelings that the Scottish Government has an anti-car agenda."},{"url":null,"title":"Country walks  spas and fitness suites    welcome to the perfect place to retire","story":"              IT has been billed as Scotland\u0026rsquos first purpose-built retirement community and is predicted to change the way people live in their later years when the worries of work are behind them.  Plans have been unveiled for a new village designed to cater to the needs of the over-55s, with all amenities, facilities and services they require right on their doorsteps.  Developers say the \u0026pound55 million scheme, proposed for Netherplace reservoir in Newton Mearns, near Glasgow, would be based on a \u0026ldquovision of active later living, and would be self-contained and come complete with medical services, leisure facilities and shops within its environs.  And they hope it could become the blueprint for other communities across Scotland if it is given approval when it goes before the local authority for assent later this week.  The Netherplace Retirement Development is the brainchild of property developer Shazad Bakhsh and is being taken forward by the Glasgow and Singapore-based property company Scotsbridge Holdings.  It would see the construction of 252 homes on the 17-acre former industrial site, made up of one and two-bedroom flats and cottages alongside a central \u0026ldquoclubhouse.  It would also incorporate a clinic and an 80-bed care home, as well as a fitness suite, spa, restaurant, community spaces and country walks.

Mr Bakhsh believes Netherplace could become one of the most innovative new communities for over-55s anywhere in the UK, and provide further inward investment to East Renfrewshire.  He said: \u0026ldquoNetherplace will be so much than a retirement development, it will create a vibrant new community.  Herald View: Older people need better housing options too  Scotland is facing a demographic time bomb in the coming decades, with the number of pensioners expected to soar by almost 30 per cent in the next 25 years to 1.36 million by 2039, according to official figures from the Registers of Scotland.  Meanwhile, the number of over-75s is predicted to rise from 430,000 to about 800,000, while the working population paying taxes to meet the growing cost of public services is predicted to grow by just one per cent.  This will inevitably greatly impact on council budgets and the public purse, but Mr Bakhsh said that similar retirement communities help councils shoulder the burden by having services grouped together.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe believe this project will ultimately reduce the burden on local authority care provision by providing residents with more intermediate care options.  \u0026ldquoThis is an opportunity to create a community in the truest sense of the word and tackle preconceptions of what a retirement development can be.  \u0026ldquoThe placement of these bespoke lifetime homes, with facilities which are second to none, will ensure a higher quality of living.  He added: \u0026ldquoOur professional and experienced team has a vision to modernise the sector and provide a development to both answer demand and exceed expectations.

It is also hoped that the purpose-built retirement community could help release much-needed housing stock elsewhere by allowing pensioners living in larger homes to downsize.  Netherplace reservoir, which dates back to 1850, will be incorporated into the overall design of the village and stocked with trout for fishing.  Demolition and clearance of the site, a former dye works which last operated in 2003, has already been completed to enable works to begin if planning permission is granted.

But now organisers of Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Hogmanay event are gunning for the number one spot and hope to topple the Australian city from its perch.  The capital\u0026rsquos Hogmanay celebrations attracted 165,000 people last year, and had an economic impact of \u0026pound39 million, a new report states.  However, Underbelly, in its second year running the three-day event, wants Hogmanay to be the most talked about New Year celebration in the globe.  Around 10,000 more people, from 80 countries, attended the last Hogmanay event compared to 2017, and the organisers believe there still room for Edinburgh\u0026rsquos three-day New Year festival to grow.  Charlie Wood, director of Underbelly, said: \u0026ldquoOur plans aren\u0026rsquot about increasing that number of visitors, it is about increasing how Edinburgh and Scotland are viewed internationally.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos about creating an event that is talked about, not just in the city, that notion of \u0026lsquoOh why wasn\u0026rsquot I there?\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos the goal, its about creating those images and stories, that really sell the city and the country internationally.  Underbelly said its own research shows that Hogmanay generated 37 TV news pieces reaching 89 million viewers, 201 radio pieces reaching 141 million listeners, and more than 2,000 online articles reaching more than 10 billion readers, with 360 pieces in print. These figures helped lift Edinburgh from the 17th most covered New Year event in 2017 to joint 7th this year.  However, the short term aim, Mr Wood said, is to break into the top five, with a long term aim of being the most-visible New Year event in the globe.  The research shows the top New Year celebrations being covered internationally are Sydney at no 1, followed by Seoul and Hong Kong at joint 2nd, followed by New York, Singapore, and Paris, and then London and Edinburgh at joint seventh, followed by Tokyo, and Jakarta and Kuala Lumpur, Manila and Moscow at joint 10th.  Mr Wood added: \u0026ldquoIt cannot be an exact science, but it helps build a picture about how the world looks at Edinburgh.  \u0026ldquoAnd our goal is to make sure that it beats every other city in the world as the city that everyone talks about - which is creatively we try to make it as different as possible.  \u0026ldquoThe aim is to get images and stories, about Hogmanay and about Scotland, all around the world.  The economic impact figure is 40 per cent higher than the last measurement, in 2010, of \u0026pound27.9m.  The last Hogmanay was the first staged by Underbelly for the City of Edinburgh Council, after being run by Peter Irvine\u0026rsquos Unique Events for more than 20 years.  Ed Bartlam, co-director, said: \u0026ldquoWe didn\u0026rsquot set out to throw away what was already great about the event, we kept that, Peter Irvine did so much brilliant stuff, we just wanted to turn it up a notch, and that\u0026rsquos what we want to continue doing for the next few years.  Research conducted by BOP Consulting also surveyed 5,236 attendees and found that Hogmanay was the main or only reason for visiting Scotland for 71% of attendees from elsewhere in the world, 74% of whom were attending Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Hogmanay for the first time.  Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Hogmanay is principally funded by City of Edinburgh Council.  More than one-third of Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Hogmanay 2018 income came from public sector funding and 66% was from commercial sources of revenue including ticketing and sponsorship income.  Charlie Wood and Ed Bartlam added: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore delighted by the increased economic impact of the event on Edinburgh and Scotland to be an event that both encourages people to visit and creates employment in the city to have people from 80 countries buy tickets for the event but also see a strong local audience that engages and participates.  Ticket for Hogmanay 2019 are already on sale.  Councillor Donald Wilson, the culture convener for the City of Edinburgh Council, said: \u0026ldquoUnderbelly certainly didn\u0026rsquot fail to impress in their first year producing the event and this report highlights just how much of a success the festival was with a whopping estimated economic impact of \u0026pound39.8m for Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"Minister resigns ahead of crunch Brexit votes","story":"              Theresa May has suffered a ministerial resignation ahead of crunch Commons votes on Brexit.  Remain-supporting Phillip Lee quit as justice minister, saying \"if Brexit is worth doing, then it is certainly worth doing well\" and it is \"irresponsible to proceed as we are\".  He said his main objection to Government policy was over the \"wish to limit Parliament\u0027s role in contributing to the final outcome\" - the so-called meaningful vote amendment.  His shock departure came as David Davis warned potential Tory rebels that they cannot undo the EU referendum, ahead of a tricky 48 hours in which the Government will try to get its Brexit programme back on track.  The Brexit Secretary spoke after some Conservatives signalled that they would support an amendment to the EU (Withdrawal Bill) tabled late on Monday by former attorney general Dominic Grieve giving more power to MPs.  The Commons begins two days of debate and votes on the Bill on Tuesday and Mr Grieve\u0027s amendment calls for a binding motion to be passed by the Commons, setting out how to proceed in the event of a \"no deal\" Brexit.  But Mr Davis told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme: \"A meaningful vote is not the ability to reverse the decision of the referendum.  \"We will put in front of Parliament the decision for them to vote ... after that there will be a process of primary legislation to put the actual details of it in Parliament, so Parliament will actually decide on the application of the detail.\"  Asked what would happen if they voted against the deal, he said: \"If they throw it out, well, they throw it out. We will have to go away, think about it and come back and make a statement, which is what I am saying to the House this afternoon.\"  The Prime Minister appeared to have defused a potentially explosive row over the EU customs union on Monday night as Tory pro-Europe rebels Sir Oliver Letwin and Nicky Morgan and Brexiteers Jacob Rees-Mogg and Sir Bill Cash came together to table a separate compromise amendment backing \"a customs arrangement\" with the EU.  Government sources signalled to the Press Association that ministers were set to back the move. However, the compromise is only likely to delay a full-blown showdown on the customs union until trade legislation returns to the Commons in July.  Mrs May set the tone for a tense two days as she warned Tory Remainers that if they defied her and backed Lords amendments to the landmark Brexit legislation it would weaken Britain\u0027s hand at the negotiating table.  Addressing a meeting of the backbench 1922 Committee on Monday, ahead of the key votes, she said: \"I am confident I can get a deal that allows us to strike our own trade deals while having a border with the EU which is as frictionless as possible.  \"But if the Lords amendments are allowed to stand, that negotiating position will be undermined.\"  However, Devon Tory Sarah Wollaston signalled on Tuesday morning that she would back Mr Grieve\u0027s amendment.  Dismissing the Government\u0027s compromise, she tweeted: \"Merely issuing a statement in response would make it a meaningless final vote.  \"Grieve\u0027s amendment puts that right and in a way Govt could and should accept it.\"  She said unless there was a \"meaningful vote\" Parliament would be left with \"the grim choice between a poor deal and exit with no deal at all\".

Bosses at LINK insisted they were doing \u0026ldquoeverything they possibly can to keep automated teller machines (ATMs) open in the communities where they are most needed.  But they admitted efforts to protect cash machines in remote areas would only be in place for four years and some could still close within that time.  LINK, the UK\u0026rsquos main cash machine network, is cutting the fee paid to operators from 25p to 20p per withdrawal over four years, but previously unveiled proposals to protect ATMs one kilometre or more from the next free machine.  It has led to worries that more than half of Scotland\u0027s 5,300 free-to-use ATMS could disappear.  However chairman Sir Mark Boleat admitted these measures would only plug the gap for the next few years, with \u0026ldquobigger issues looming if the number of people using ATMs continues to plummet.  He also appeared to predict widespread closures in cities, adding: \u0026ldquoThere are some city centres with 50 pay-to-use ATMs. We don\u0026rsquot think the public will be disadvantaged if that number falls to 40, or even to 30 or to 20.  Sir Mark said cash use had fallen by 30 per cent in the last 10 years, and was projected to drop by another 40 per cent in the coming decade.  And he insisted \u0026ldquofalling demand meant even protected ATMs could close in the next four years, despite a freeze on the fee paid to operators and additional financial incentives for machines in vulnerable areas.  He said: \u0026ldquoIf transactions fall by 40 per cent in the next 10 years, 30 or 40 per cent, there are bigger issues and we need to address those. Our own data shows consistently this year transactions have fallen by five per cent below last year.  In evidence to Holyrood\u0026rsquos economy committee, LINK estimated that up to 11 per cent of the UK\u0026rsquos cash machines may close as a result of the changes to operator fees. But some estimates have put the figure as high as 18 per cent.  Under questioning from MSPs, Sir Mark was unable to provide any breakdown of the impact on Scotland.  But he said 221 ATMs would be protected from fee changes north of the Border.  It came as Professor Russel Griggs, chairman of the new South of Scotland Economic Partnership, told the committee there is no evidence bank branch closures have a long-term effect on communities.  RBS is currently pushing forward with plans to shut at least 52 branches across the country, with a further 10 under review.  Professor Griggs said work he had carried out suggested that while there was initially a \u0026ldquoheavy impact, communities moved on and found other ways of doing things.  He said: \"So I think it probably has a short-term effect but the evidence that I saw as I went around and visited probably 20 or 30 places across the whole of the UK looking at this, is that it settles down again and people go back to doing what they used to do but just in a different way and it\u0027s interesting they don\u0027t tend to move banks.\"  He said that during recent consultation meetings held with hundreds of people across the south of Scotland in connection with the new economic partnership, bank branch closures had been raised only once.  Thomas Docherty, public affairs manager for consumer organisation Which?, said there was a need for more robust evidence on the long-term effects of closures.  He said: \"There hasn\u0027t been a proper study done by anybody of what those longer-term impacts would be on the rate of closures.  \"By the end of this year in Scotland more than 250 branches will have closed in the last four years.  \"I think when you start to get that scale of closures somebody should be stepping up and carrying out that proper investigation.  \"The people who are most likely of course to be affected are older customers and customers who are more vulnerable.  \"Yes, online banking is growing but only 56 per cent of customers, according to UK Finance, currently use online banking, so what is happening to the other 44 per cent \u0026ndash how are their needs being serviced?\""},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7914297.jpg?type=article-full","title":"Scientists back reintroducing wolves to Scotland","story":"              THEY were the grey shadows of the ancient Caledonian forest, powerful predators who dominated their environment but then disappeared from Scotland centuries ago as their persecutors closed in.  Popular folklore has it that the last wolf was shot by Sir Ewen Cameron in 1680 in Killiecrankie, Perthshire, in 1680 - long after they had been driven from the lowlands by deforestation.  But in recent years a loud debate has erupted over plans to bring back these top carnivores to the Highlands, and let them run free to prey on the deer herds.  Now scientists say that rewilding the wolf could be more than a pipe dream and that a sustainable population is a possibility, but only if it is kept fenced in.  Researchers from the University of Sussex and the University of Kent, concluded that 80 wolves spread over an area of 1,000 square miles - roughly 24,000 acres - would be required to \"reduce\" deer herds which have been blamed for over-grazing and preventing the return of woodland.    The Scottish Government estimates that there are around 375,000 red deer and 350,000 roe deer living in Scotland, and each year an annual cull has to be held to reduce their numbers.  Dr Christopher Sandom, lecturer in biology at the University of Sussex with a particular interest in rewilding, believes that wolves could be the answer to the problem, and that it is possible to ensure they do not cross paths with people using the land.  READ MORE:\u0026nbspShould wolves be reintroduced to Scotland?  The issue of reintroducing wolves to Scotland has proven controversial in the past, with farmers and landowners saying that they would go after sheep and could even pose a danger to hikers.  But the University study found that the idea was viable if an area was created where their paths would seldom cross with people\u0027s  Dr Sandom said: \u0026ldquoReintroducing the wolf has long been suggested as part of the solution to large deer populations but there will always be concerns about how wolves interact with people in any rewilding project like this.  \"This research shows that they could actually have an extremely beneficial impact in terms of making the rewilding process more effective.  The research, which also involved scientists from Aarhus University and the University of Oxford (WildCRU), tackled the question of how many wolves would be needed in an area to bring down the number of red deer to allow ecological restoration.  It used computer models to simulate wolves impact on the landscape, and drew on previous studies of areas were the animals had been re-introduced or were already living.    The team\u0026rsquos analyses found that a fence capable of retaining at least 75 per cent of dispersing wolves within the reserve would be optimum in allowing for rapid population growth that could lead to reduced deer numbers, without the risk of having so many predators that the red deer population would be threatened.  READ MORE:\u0026nbspConservation charity backs bringing back wild carnivores to Scotland\u0027s countryside.  However, it is unlikely any wolves leaving the area would get far if proper procedures were put in place.  In Finland, all wolves leaving an expanding wolf population into a reindeer management area were shot before being able to reproduce, while in the Bia\u0026#322owie\u0026#380a National Park in Poland, surrounding human activity has created a barrier to wolf movement patterns.  Biologists found that the wolf population of Riding Mountain National Park in Canada had limited interbreeding with other wolf populations in nearby protected areas and no successful wolf dispersal from the park had been recorded over several multi-year tracking studies over 40 years.    Dr Sandom said: \u0026ldquoFences are a common but unpopular tool in biodiversity conservation and would ideally be avoided. But where there are conflicting interests, compromise is needed.  \"Fences particularly constrain animal dispersal but as Britain is an island, this is less of a problem. A fenced reserve in Scotland could be a fantastic opportunity to return large predators to Britain, ecologically restore a large part of the Scottish Highlands, and promote tourism.  The researchers suggested that grey wolves, also known as timber wolves, would be the best candidates to be reintroduced in Scotland.\u0026nbsp  A previous experiment in Yellowstone national park in the US found that bringing back wolves to cull deer herds led to forests coming back and more biodiversity. It has since been hailed a major success story.  READ MORE:\u0026nbspLynx should be brought back to roam Scotland  Dr Joseph Bull, lecturer in conservation science at the University of Kent, said: \u0026ldquoWolves are glorious animals, and were originally natives of these shores. The idea of them returning will be thrilling for many people.  \u0026ldquoWhile our model offers insights into what is likely to happen, the crucial next step would be to test these ideas in practice \u0026ndash by creating a reserve, reintroducing wolves, and closely monitoring the system.\u0026nbsp  \"More generally and perhaps counterintuitively, barriers in some form might have a more important role to play in establishing modern wild areas than previously thought\".    Professor David Macdonald, Director of WildCRU and co-author of the study said \u0026ldquoScotland can lead Europe in thinking about how conservation, large fenced reserves and tourism can reframe rural economies.  \"The role of fencing in the conservation of big predators is globally a hot topic. So far our results are just simulations made from the safety of a desk, but they offer a highly original way of thinking about restoring nature and natural processes."},{"url":null,"title":"Pupils from armed forces families    less likely    to go to university","story":"              PUPILS whose families serve in the armed forces are less likely to go to university because of the significant disruption they face at school, campaigners have warned.  A new survey found one in four Scottish pupils from a services background attended at least seven schools as a result of parents being posted to different locations across the UK and beyond.  In one extreme case a pupil had been to 27 different schools between starting nursery and leaving secondary.  As a result of the disruption some 70 per cent said they lacked confidence, 71 per cent had experienced anxiety and 60 per cent said they had found studying difficult.  In addition, one in five said they had experienced difficulties with friendships and 44 per cent said they had felt isolated.  The Royal Caledonian Education Trust (RCET), a 200-year-old charity for armed forces children, said pupils from a military background were one third less likely to go to university than their civilian peers.  Moira Leslie, education manager at RCET, said children from such backgrounds should be considered alongside other groups who face disadvantages when they apply to higher education.  Currently, universities give preferential treatment to pupils from the poorest backgrounds to recognise the impact of poverty on attainment.  Mrs Leslie said: \u0026ldquoNot everyone is affected, but as our survey shows there can be significant disruption to the education of pupils from armed forces families, she said.  \u0026ldquoPupils in this situation can find it difficult to study, particularly if a parent or parents are serving in an active situation or because they are absent.  \u0026ldquoIf pupils have moved between schools they can find it difficult to settle in a new environment and there may be differences in the coursework or teaching they experience.  \u0026ldquoWhere they can also find it difficult is when they have an established group of friends that they have to leave behind and start all over again.  Mrs Leslie said RCET was concerned pupils who would potentially thrive at university were being denied the opportunity.  \u0026ldquoBecause of these experiences they should be encouraged and supported to include that in personal statements when they apply to university.  \u0026ldquoThere should also be a way for universities to identify these applications so they can make allowances.  Five years ago a study of Scottish children who had parents serving in Afghanistan found their levels of stress were particularly high in the build up to their deployment with their worst fears being that their father or mother would be injured or killed.  Academics from City University London, who interviewed more than 50 Scottish pupils, also found they felt apprehensive when their parents were away from home and had difficulty sleeping. Children between the ages of eight and 11 were particularly affected.  The issue was discussed at the Scotland\u0026rsquos Fair Access Conference in Perth, organised by the Scottish Funding Council (SFC).  The event focused on the mental health and wellbeing of college and university students.  A key theme was how to improve support for the increasing number of students with caring responsibilities.  Shirley-Anne Somerville, the Higher Education Secretary, said every student should have an equal chance to fulfil their potential.  \u0026ldquoAs well as supporting access to courses, it is essential colleges and universities provide appropriate support for students\u0026rsquo health and wellbeing, she said.  Luke Humberstone, president of student body NUS Scotland, added: \u0026ldquoWe need to see institutions acknowledging and tackling the barriers that prospective students can face.

The impromptu orchestra of professional musicians and students played a funeral march to highlight the ongoing battle to stop councils cutting or charging for tuition.  The protest was also held to publicise a Scottish Parliament petition on the issue which has attracted more than 6,500 signatures.  Eleven local authorities across Scotland have increased their music tuition rates in recent times with some families expected to pay more than \u0026pound500 a year.  East Lothian Council has become the latest to introduce charges with parents now facing annual fees of \u0026pound280. Glasgow does not charge families.  The increasing fees have promoted campaigners to warn that music tuition in schools will become the preserve of the well off in future.  John Wallace, chairman of the Music Education Partnership Group, who conducted the orchestra, said there would be a significant impact on the whole of Scotland.  \u0026ldquoWe are here to highlight the fact that Scottish state schools have a world class system.  \u0026ldquoThere is a great deal of support for the petition from professional musicians because this is the route that we all took and if it slides back any more then we all fear for the future.  \u0026ldquoThis is something that Scotland currently does very well and we have evidence in schools across the land with pupil orchestras, but if we continue down the path of cuts and charges then they become very difficult to run.

One hopes that this is not just to make it easier for the DUP leader, Arlene Foster, to pop across for the odd Orange march.  But we needn\u0026rsquot worry, because Boris is the kiss of death to bridge projects. As London Mayor, he presided over the ill-fated Garden Bridge, which had to be abandoned after spending \u0026pound46 million in fees. He also proposed a 22- mile bridge over the English Channel. This new Brexit bridge is about as likely to happen as Britain getting friction-free access to the European Single Market.  Two years after the referendum and we\u0026rsquore no nearer finding out what Brexit actually means, though just about everyone agrees it will be a disaster. There is a Commons majority in favour of halting this act of national self-harm by giving Westminster the power to seize the reins from Theresa May. But shell-shocked Tory MPs were persuaded yesterday (after \u0026ldquomeaningful concessions that are largely meaningless) that if they didn\u0026rsquot support the PM, Boris would likely replace her, and probably declare war on France. Well, he\u0026rsquos said he wants to emulate Donald Trump\u0026rsquos style of diplomacy.  Meanwhile Jeremy Corbyn\u0026rsquos crew are at sixes and sevens over whether or not to join EFTA/EEA/Customs Union/Single Market/all of the above. Her Majesty\u0026rsquos Opposition will collapse in a heap today in the remaining Commons votes on the Lords amendments. It is surely a first for Britain to have both Government and Opposition utterly clueless about what to do about a major national crisis. The only people who seem to know what they want are in Brussels \u0026ndash maybe we should just hand Brexit over to them.  In a sense, this is happening by default. After this week, Theresa May will press ahead with her proposal for a customs union in all but name \u0026ndash a proposal which Brussels has already rejected as unacceptable to the EU 27. She will also push her \u0026ldquomax fac solution to the Irish Border issue, which is to pretend that there isn\u0026rsquot a border at all. This has also been rejected by Brussels. Michel Barnier has said all along that there can be no \u0026ldquocherry picking of the European Single Market, and that the UK has already agreed that Northern Ireland will remain in regulatory alignment with it. The Boris bridge is partly about halting what he sees as this dastardly EU plan to break up Britain.  But his own Government is doing a very good job of that already. Yesterday it rammed through the objectionable clauses of the EU Withdrawal Bill which effectively abolish Scottish devolution for the next seven years. In that time, Mrs May will have complete power to override Holyrood over important matters like agriculture, food safety, environment and so on. Not only did she brush aside the SNP\u0026rsquos and Labour amendments, the Government didn\u0026rsquot even bother to honour its own promise to come up with an amendment of its own. Not so much a power grab as a smash-and-grab.  So, you\u0026rsquoll have had your devolution. Anyone who believes that, after seven years, normal devolutionary service will resume needs to think again. The UK Government will clearly not allow the Scottish Parliament to reverse any or all of the changes made in the \u0026ldquotransition period, since these are deemed crucial for the functioning of the new, post-Brexit UK internal market. They are for keeps. Moreover, the precedent will be established that Westminster can now over-ride any and all of Scotland\u0026rsquos devolved responsibilities whenever it considers it necessary \u0026ndash which is pretty much all the time. Home rule is over. If Mrs May was trying to make the case for an independent Scotland, she could hardly have done better.  It\u0026rsquos not quite the end of the matter, because the Supreme Court has to rule on the legitimacy of the Continuity Bill passed by Holyrood earlier this year. This is intended to counter the UK Withdrawal Bill by replicating it: by asserting that the repatriated powers continue to reside at Holyrood. Then there is the Legislative Consent Motion which Holyrood has refused to agree for the EU Withdrawal Bill \u0026ndash the first time this has happened since 1999. But the Government clearly hopes to deal with this in the same brusque manner as the Clause 11/15 issue: just bash it through Parliament on a busy news day and hope no one notices. Well, it\u0026rsquos just the Scots, after all, and they\u0026rsquore always causing trouble about something.  And so Scotland is dragged kicking and screaming out of the European Union as part of a new unitary British state in which devolution in the manner of the 1998 Scotland Act has effectively been abolished. Scots will lose their citizenship rights in the EU and the protections that go along with it as well as \u0026ldquothe most powerful devolved parliament in the world. We\u0026rsquoll be out of the single market, and the customs union while Northern Ireland will remain largely within it.  According to Philip Lee, the Tory minister who resigned yesterday over Brexit, the choice for Britain is between \u0026ldquoa bad deal and a cliff edge. That is no choice. There must be a better way. I\u0026rsquove argued against holding a second EU referendum unless public opinion swings dramatically against Brexit. But I\u0026rsquom not sure we can afford to wait much longer, while this hapless Prime Minister, bereft of any plan, damages the national interest.  The obvious course for the UK is to rejoin EFTA, which we founded in 1960 as a rival to the EEC, and then align with the European Economic Area with Norway. This means leaving the European Union but remaining in the single market. This eminently sensible solution is being rejected by a weak Prime Minister at the mercy of a cabal of right-wing Tory revolutionaries bent on Making Britain Great Again. They must be stopped.

Uddingston \u0026amp Bellshill MSP Richard Lyle was accused by a QC of giving \u0026ldquowholly unbelievable testimony in a civil\u0026nbspaction brought against his office worker, Sheena McCulloch.  The claims were made on the bruising final day of a proof at the Court of Session by Kenny McBrearty QC, acting on behalf of former North Lanarkshire SNP councillor Julie McAnulty.  In reply, Roddy Dunlop QC, for Ms McCulloch, accused Ms McAnulty of being heedless of racial sensitivities, and accused her and her key witness of lying in court.  Ms McAnulty is suing Ms McCulloch for alleging she used the word \u0026ldquoPakis in Ms McCulloch\u0026rsquos car in 2015 and saying she wanted Asian members out the local SNP.  Ms McAnulty denies making the remark.  READ MORE:\u0026nbspFormer SNP councillor denies racism in \u0026pound100,000 court case  Ms McCulloch, who the court heard had a 2006 conviction for theft, has defended the case on the grounds of accuracy, fair comment and qualified privilege.  She initially said the conversation was in late May 2015, but it later emerged she and Ms McAnulty were in her car on 20 June.  Steven Bonnar, a current SNP councillor in North Lanarkshire, testified he was in the car on that date with the two women, and heard no racist remarks being made.  After four days of evidence in April, the case resumed - and concluded - yesterday.  The court previously heard Ms McAnulty and Ms McCulloch were on rival sides of a \u0026ldquotoxic turf war within the local SNP, with two camps vying for dominance.  Ms McAnulty was allied to former Coatbridge MP Phil Boswell, who wanted reform, while Ms McCulloch was allied to Mr Lyle, whose group wanted to maintain their grip on power.

A Daily Record story three days later led to Ms McAnulty\u0026rsquos suspension by the SNP.  In his submission to Lord Uist, Mr McBrearty said Mr Lyle, who was not present in court, had been a \u0026ldquobit part player.  However he criticised his evidence, including his attempt to \u0026ldquodissociate himself from the feuding, and his claim he knew nothing about the racism complaint for three days, despite his childhood friend and employee sending it from his office.  He said it was \u0026ldquocompletely implausible that Mr Lyle, who previously denied any \u0026ldquoinput to the complaint or giving misleading evidence, had been unaware of it until it appeared in the Record.  Mr McBrearty said the email was part of a targeted campaign against Ms McAnulty that including two other damaging Daily Record stories about her and race in previous weeks.  He said Ms McCulloch could not credibly explain why she emailed 13 people, only three of whom dealt with party discipline, nor explain why she waited until February.  READ MORE: Defender in \u0026pound100,000 SNP defamation case had theft conviction  He called her evidence incredible, untruthful, illogical and absurd.  Mr McBrearty said it would make no sense for Mr Bonnar, who told the court he \u0026ldquoabhors racism, to concoct a story about being in Ms McCulloch\u0026rsquos car to help a racist.  Calling his evidence \u0026ldquostraight-forward and compelling, he asked: \u0026ldquoWhy would Mr Bonnar risk everything in giving evidence in support of someone who has made racist statements?  He said it was very difficult to think Mr Bonnar could be mistaken about being in the car, not least because the day in question was the launch of his successful by-election campaign.  However he said some of Ms McCulloch\u0026rsquos witnesses, who said Mr Bonnar may have been in a different car, were understandably mistaken in recalling small events from 2015.  Summing up, he invited Lord Uist to find Ms McAnulty did not make the remark attributed to her, and that Ms McCulloch knew the allegation to be untruthful.  READ MORE:\u0026nbspSNP MSP Richard Lyle challenged over credibility of court evidence  He said Ms McCulloch\u0026rsquos actions could not be defended on the basis of accuracy, or veritas or as qualified privilege to interested parties because they had been so widely circulated or as fair comment, as she stated as fact that Ms McAnulty had made racist remarks.  He suggested compensatory damages be set at \u0026pound100,000 if Lord Uist accepted Ms McCulloch intended the complaint to leak to the press, or would have expected it to leak, causing Ms McAnulty greater damage and upset, or at around \u0026pound40,000 otherwise.  In his submission, Mr Dunlop attacked Ms McAnulty\u0026rsquos evidence, saying problems with in it cast doubt on her whole case.  He said that at an SNP meeting in 2012 she was \u0026ldquoheedless of racial sensitivities by questioning whether a senior Asian member, Dr Imtiaz Majid, later an SNP councillor, directed the votes of other Asian members.  He said Ms McAnulty was also prepared to \u0026ldquosully the reputation of other witnesses by accusing them of perjury, fabrication and attempting to pervert the course of justice.

He also said Mr Bonnar had been \u0026ldquolying about being in the car, and that there had been no room in it for him as the back seat was full of campaign materials, and that his evidence conflicted with there being child locks on the back door.  He said it was \u0026ldquoremarkable he had waited \u0026ldquomonths after the Daily Record story about the racism complaint to tell SNP HQ that he had been in the vehicle.  He said the evidence demonstrated convincingly that Mr Bonnar had not been in the car, and that was \u0026ldquofatal to Ms McAnulty\u0026rsquos case.  He said Ms McCulloch\u0026rsquos evidence had been \u0026ldquocredible and \u0026ldquoreliable, and it made no sense for her to concoct a lie about a talk in a car if Mr Bonnar had been there too and could simply contradict her.  Mr McBrearty said that assumed Ms McCulloch was a \u0026ldquogood liar, not a bad one.  He also rejected Mr Dunlop\u0026rsquos assertion that Ms McAnulty made a racist remark in 2012, merely an ambiguous one, and denied she lied under oath in court.

Scotland\u0026rsquos information watchdog found evidence journalists have been \u0026ldquosignificantly less likely to receive information in previous years, with \u0026ldquounjustifiable, significant delays and disregard for legal timescales.  It comes amid on ongoing row over the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos handling of FoI requests and the involvement of special advisers.  Critics branded the findings \"outrageous\", and accused the SNP of meddling in the FoI process to \"stop bad news happening\".  In a\u0026nbsphumiliating intervention, the Scottish Information Commissioner Daren Fitzhenry called on the Government to end its practice of\u0026nbsptreating journalists, MSPs and political researchers differently \u0026ldquobecause of who or what they are.  His report found: \u0026ldquoJournalists, together with MSPs and political researchers, are expressly made subject to a different process for clearance than other requester groups.  \u0026ldquoThis is inconsistent with the applicant-blind principle of FoI legislation. Their requests are almost invariably subjected to an additional layer of clearance which is likely to delay consideration of the case.  In 2015/16, only 27 per cent of media requests were met with full disclosure, compared with 42 per cent of FoIs submitted by others.  When she took office, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon vowed to lead the most open and accessible government ever.  But Scottish Conservative MSP Adam Tomkins insisted the report \u0026ldquoexposes Nicola Sturgeon\u0026rsquos secret Scotland.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt reveals an SNP government which not only deliberately stands in the way of legally-binding FoI requests made by the media, but goes to great lengths to delay or influence what information is provided.  \u0026ldquoThat is completely contrary to Scotland\u0026rsquos FoI legislation. People will see this report and conclude the SNP government is trying to stop bad news happening, and its woeful performance being publicised, by meddling in this process.  \u0026ldquoThat is outrageous, and all cabinet ministers involved, and indeed the First Minister, have urgent questions to answer.  Scottish Labour\u0026rsquos parliamentary business manager Rhoda Grant called on Ms Sturgeon to \u0026ldquoaddress the findings of this report and apologise for bending the law to suit her narrow political interests.  Scottish Green MSP Andy Wightman said: \u0026ldquoThis is a damning report, and vindicates the complaints of many journalists and researchers that Scottish ministers are slow and inconsistent in how they release information that the public are entitled to.  Mr Fitzhenry launched his formal investigation at Holyrood\u0027s request after a series of complaints were raised by journalists last year.  He said that by singling journalists and researchers out, SNP ministers were offending the spirit of FoI legislation and potentially damaging trust.  The Scottish Government said it would accept the findings of the report in full, and confirmed\u0026nbspits internal guidance will be updated with immediate effect.  Joe Fitzpatrick, minister for parliamentary business Joe Fitzpatrick, said: \u0026ldquoBeing open and transparent is a priority set out in our current Programme for Government.  \u0026ldquoWe welcomed and cooperated fully with the Scottish Information Commissioner\u0026rsquos review and are happy to accept his recommendations in full to support our continued improvement.  \u0026ldquoAs the report highlights, we have already implemented a number of changes that have resulted in significant improvements to our FoI performance.  \"In the first five months of 2018 we responded to 93 per cent of FoI requests on time, exceeding the 90 per cent target set by the Information Commissioner and a 10% increase on last year.  \u0026ldquoOutside the FoI process, last year the Scottish Government responded to over 5,000 queries from journalists in a matter of hours."},{"url":null,"title":"MSPs demand urgent evidence from Mundell on Brexit","story":"              MSPs have demanded David Mundell appear before them to explain why Westminster has pushed ahead with Brexit legislation in devolved areas without Holyrood\u0026rsquos consent.  The Scottish Parliament\u0026rsquos party constitution committee has asked the Scottish Secretary to give evidence on the resulting \u0026ldquoimplications for the devolution settlement.  In a letter to Mr Mundell, committee convener Bruce Crawford invited him to appear at Holyrood \u0026ldquoas a matter of urgency.  However a Whitehall source said that, although Mr Mundell was willing to appear, it may not before the summer recess, meaning September at the earliest.  It follows Westminster agreeing a controversial \u0026ldquopower grab in the EU Withdrawal Bill, which a majority MSPs refused to endorse in May because it undermined devolution.  The Bill means 24 devolved policy areas being repatriated from Brussels at Brexit will be reserved at Westminster for up to seven years, rather than lying at Holyrood.  The UK Government says the measure is necessary to create UK-wide common frameworks to protect the UK single market through harmonised regulations.  However the Scottish Government has said such frameworks must be agreed by \u0026ldquoconsent, not imposed, something the UK Government has rejected as a veto power.  Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, told BBC Radio Scotland that Mr Mundell \u0026ldquosat back and \u0026ldquodid nothing in the Commons on Tuesday when others were raising the issue.  \u0026ldquoHe should be ashamed of himself.. and ought to resign, he said, adding it was an \u0026ldquoutter disgrace that only 15 minutes was made available to debate the unprecedented situation, and that was hogged by Cabinet Office minister David Lidington.  In response, Mr Mundell said the debate time was \u0026ldquounfortunate, but blamed the Labour Party for pursuing numerous unwinnable votes.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt would have been possible to have had much, much more time to debate the issues in question.  \u0026ldquoDavid Lidington took numerous interventions through his period. What would have been much much better would have been to have longer to have had the debate.  \u0026ldquoThe way of achieving that was for Labour not to pursue everything to a vote.  When it was pointed out the parliamentary timetable was set by the Government, not the opposition, Mr Mundell said: \u0026ldquopeople knew exactly how much time was available.  \u0026ldquoThe Labour Party knew exactly how much time there would be left to debate these issues if they took every single vote, which is what they did, and I think that\u0026rsquos very regrettable.  \u0026ldquoEven if we had had 100 hours of debate the outcome wouldn\u0026rsquot have changed because the SNP and Scottish Government position is exactly the same as it was on day one of this Bill.  Asked to characterise his handling of the matter, including an absence of previously promised amendments, Mr Mundell said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos now quite clear that it was never going to be possible to get agreed amendments because Nicola Sturgeon and the Scottish Government have a different view of devolution from everyone else.  Asked if he had considered resigning, Mr Mundell replied: \u0026ldquoI consider that what I have done is stood up for the constitutional settlement that people voted for in 2014.  \u0026ldquoIan Blackford, Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP, don\u0026rsquot like that settlement, don\u0026rsquot support it.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom not going to apologise for standing up for the settlement people voted for.  However he refused to say whether he had considered his position.  Mr Mundell has frequently given evidence to various Holyrood committees about Brexit.

The Conservatives, he later suggested, had returned to the days of Margaret Thatcher and were acting in an \u0026ldquoanti-Scottish way.  In developments that stunned MPs during Prime Minister\u0026rsquos Questions, the Nationalist leader attacked the Conservative Government, which he said was implementing, through its legislation, a power-grab against Holyrood and had not even given Scottish MPs the chance to debate it during Tuesday\u0026rsquos consideration of the Bill.    Using a rare parliamentary device, he called for a \u0026ldquoprivate sitting of Parliament, which would have removed the public from the chamber\u0026rsquos gallery.  The move appeared to take John Bercow, the Speaker, Theresa May, and others totally by surprise.  As the chamber descended into confusion, Mr Bercow hurriedly consulted the Commons lawyers and suggested a vote on Mr Blackford\u0026rsquos request be taken after PMQs. But the Highland MP insisted he wanted an immediate vote, declaring: \u0026ldquoI beg to move.  At which point as Nationalist MPs cheered, Opposition MPs jeered. The Speaker took more advice, repeating that the vote should take place at the end of PMQs. \u0026ldquoThat is the end of the matter, declared Mr Bercow, calling the PM to respond.  But Mr Blackford continued to stand as the Speaker urged him amid the roar of the chamber to sit down, insisting: \u0026ldquoNo, you\u0026rsquore not moving anything.    As the volume in the chamber rose further on all sides, Labour frontbenchers were engaged in hurried private conversations.  As the Speaker again insisted a vote could take place at the end of PMQs, SNP backbencher David Linden shouted: \u0026ldquoNow!  Mr Bercow responded by telling the Glasgow MP: \u0026ldquoI say to you in the kindest possible spirit, don\u0026rsquot tell me what the procedures of this House are. I\u0026rsquom telling you there can be a vote at the end of this session and not now.  As Mr Blackford rose again to applause from some of his SNP colleagues, the Speaker shouted: \u0026ldquoOrder. Resume your seat Mr Blackford! He then said in light of the party leader\u0026rsquos refusal to resume his seat, he ordered him to leave the chamber immediately.  At first, the Highland MP did not go. As MPs continued to shout, Mr Bercow could he heard saying to colleagues: \u0026ldquoHe won\u0026rsquot, so we\u0026rsquoll have to have the vote.  At one point, Joanna Cherry, the Nationalist MP, could be seen shouting at the Tory benches before Mr Blackford dramatically walked out followed by his SNP colleagues. Ms Cherry as she left waved to the Speaker, saying: \u0026ldquoGoodbye.  As the noise level began to subside, Mr Bercow said it was a pity as Nationalist MPs had questions down on the Order Paper.                         .bc-player-rkgvgWjWCG_default .vjs-tech { position: static !important }                       .bc-player-rkgvgWjWCG_default { height: auto !important width: 100% !important}                       .vjs-playlist-description { display: none }                       .vjs-big-play-button { top: 0pxleft: 0pxright: 0pxbottom: 0pxmargin: auto }                       .vjs-mouse.vjs-playlist { background-color: #f7f4f1color: #000min-width: auto }                       .vjs-playlist cite { overflow: initialtext-overflow: initialwhite-space: initialfont-weight: 600font-size: 16px }                       .vjs-mouse.vjs-playlist time { color: #fff }                       cite.vjs-playlist-name { text-align: left }                       .story-credits { margin-top: 20px }                       #liveMultiHide .vjs-dock-description { display: none }                       .vjs-playlist-thumbnail { margin-right: 10px !IMPORTANT }                        /* Style the overlay */                        /* Hide the overlay */                        .hide-countdown {                            display: none                        }                        .hide-overlay {                            display: none                        }                        /* Style the overlay */                        .vjs-overlay,                        .vjs-overlay.vjs-overlay-top {                            position: absolute                            top: 0px                            left: 0px                        }                        .vjs-overlay p {                            width: 100px                            background-color: #000000                            color: #fff                            padding: 10px                            margin: 0                            margin-bottom: 0                            border-radius: 0px                            text-align: left                        }                                               width=\"100%\"                            data-account=\"64298557001\"                            data-player=\"rkgvgWjWCG\"                            data-embed=\"default\"                            data-video-id=\"5797134990001\"                            class=\"video-js\"                            playsinline                            data-random-id=\"415441243\"                            controls  Earlier, in Commons exchanges, the SNP leader had pointed out that despite the declaration that Scotland would be a partner of equals in the UK, the Tory Government had pressed ahead with a \u0026ldquopower-grab in direct opposition to Scotland\u0026rsquos Parliament and had \u0026ldquosilenced Scotland\u0026rsquos voice.

Pointing to how there was just 15 minutes on Tuesday night for debate on the Scottish clause to the EU Withdrawal Bill, the PM blamed Labour for using \u0026ldquoprocedural manoeuvres in calling unnecessary votes.  Mr Blackford replied that the reality was powers enshrined under the 1998 Scotland Act were being \u0026ldquograbbed back by Whitehall and Scottish MPs were \u0026ldquonot given the courtesy of even debating it last night it\u0026rsquos a democratic outrage.

It\u0026rsquos an outrage.  He went on: \u0026ldquoWe are going to make sure we will be robust in using parliamentary devices to make sure we can hold this Government to account. We are in a situation that the Westminster Government has shown utter disrespect to the Scottish Parliament and the people of Scotland by wilfully ignoring that the fact that the Scottish Parliament has refused to give a consent motion.    \u0026ldquoThey are now acting outwith the support of the Scottish people. The Conservatives have returned to where they were before in acting in a manner that is anti-Scottish. We are not having it.  But Scottish Conservative MP Kirstene Hair decried the SNP\u0026rsquos actions.  \"This rehearsed move just demonstrated that the SNP care more about headlines than actually achieving anything for Scotland.  \"They are the masters of manufactured grievance and the people of Scotland are sick of it.  \"The SNP have played games with the constitution, played games with Brexit and now are playing games with Parliament.
