But a global outcry, including from the UN and the US, sparked a PR counter-offensive.  Foreign reporters are routinely stopped from accessing Xinjiang and are monitored          The Hotan Vocational Education and Training Center sits behind barbed wire in Xinjiang          Satellite images purported to show the internment camps where Muslim minorities are heldGovernment propaganda insisted the centres were aimed at countering the spread of separatism, terrorism and religious extremism through \u0027free\u0027 education and job training.However, an AFP examination of more than 1,500 publicly available government documents - ranging from tenders and budgets to official work reports - shows the centres are run like jails.To build new, better Chinese citizens, a document argued, the centres must first \u0027break their lineage, break their roots, break their connections, and break their origins\u0027.The centre featured on state broadcaster CCTV last week is one of at least 181 such facilities in Xinjiang, according to data collected by AFP.Participation is voluntary, according to CCTV, which showed contented \u0027students\u0027 wearing matching uniforms, studying Mandarin and learning trades like knitting, weaving and baking.The centres first appeared in 2014, the year that authorities launched a new \u0027strike hard\u0027 campaign against \u0027terrorism\u0027 after deadly violence in Xinjiang.But the buildup began in earnest in early 2017, with local governments in predominantly Uighur southern Xinjiang ordered to speed up the construction of \u0027concentrated educational transformation centres for focus groups\u0027 - a euphemism for the religious, the poor, the uneducated, passport holders, and virtually all men of military age.          Muslim trainees work in a factory at the Hotan vocational education and training centre          A Uighur man looks on as a truck carrying policemen travel along a street during an anti-terrorism oath-taking rally in Urumqi. The characters on the banner read, \u0027Willingness to spill blood for the people. Countering terrorism and fighting the enemies is part of the police spirit\u0027          China has admitted to the alleged use of internment camps for Muslim minorities in XinjiangShortly after, Xinjiang\u0027s regional government issued regulations on managing \u0027religious extremism\u0027.Extremists could be hiding anywhere, officials warned, instructing cadres to be on the lookout for 25 illegal religious activities and 75 signs of extremism, including such seemingly innocuous activities as quitting smoking or buying a tent.\u0027Detain those who should be detained to the greatest extent possible\u0027, cadres were told.Detentions surged, catching local governments unprepared.In 2017, spending by justice bureaus throughout Xinjiang exploded, driven largely by huge outlays for building and running vocational centres.The offices spent nearly three billion yuan (£334 million) - at least 577 per cent more than planned - according to AFP\u0027s calculations.Counties in the south closed the gap with a special fund earmarked for centres in the region.At least some of that money came directly from the Communist Party\u0027s Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission - the group in charge of the nation\u0027s legal authorities - budget documents showed.

Firstly, she was seen at 5.30pm by a civilian who saw two children with their bodies out of the vehicle and they were hanging onto a bar on the roof. They were six and seven.\u0027She made her way to a restaurant, Kouros Cafe then as she exited the restaurant, later, she was seen by staff and diners in the restaurant with her children sitting on the window sill of her car. As she pulls away, she is seen by a police officer and he shouts for her to stop. The police officer gets in his car and signals her to stop. He witnesses her drive about 60 metres.          Ms Oakley, pictured, was told by JP Lynn Bennison that she had seriously endangered the safety of her children\u0027He asked what she was doing and she replied it was \u0027only a bit of fun\u0027. She continued to say this in her police interview.\u0027The children are young enough to have car seats and they had them in the car. She said that previously she allowed them to do this on a campsite.\u0027She initially said it wasn\u0027t dangerous because she was driving slowly due to sheep being on the road. Though there were two incidents, I don\u0027t know if the first one was prolonged.\u0027It\u0027s clear that there is not just a small risk of injury. If she had hit a pot hole, the children could have fallen out of her car and be hit by another car.\u0027A probation report about Oakley was read to the court and it said: \u0027At the time she hadn\u0027t considered how serious they wear or what harm could\u0027ve been caused to her children. She didn\u0027t envisage the matter being followed through. She had previously let the children sit on the windowsill and hang out of the window on campsites.\u0027Since being on holiday they have pestered her to allow them to do it again. Her thinking at the time was that it would be okay and didn\u0027t consider any of the consequences. The potential harm to the children was great. If they had slipped she could\u0027ve run over her own children or if another car had clipped them the same could have happened. She hadn\u0027t thought of other vehicles or the risks.\u0027She felt extremely embarrassed about herself. Her children her partner and herself have previously lived abroad in India for a year. This may have had an influence to her thoughts as they didn\u0027t have seatbelts there. It is not acceptable to put her children in that situation however. I do not think there was any intention to cause harm.\u0027Her parenting style has not caused any issues before. She lives with her partner and two children in a rented property and has lived there for just under three years. She works one day a week at a restaurant as a waitress. Her partner works Monday Tuesday Wednesday and Friday in a local school dealing with morning and after school clubs.\u0027The children are homeschooled. She has previously been a probation officer, not since 2008 and has a strong support network of friends and her partner, and she has a good character.Her lawyer Andrew Stewart said: \u0027This is a case of bad judgement on the defendant\u0027s part. She travelled a short distance on two occasions in a rural area very slowly.\u0027On the second occasion, a police officer said he saw her drive about 60 metres from the restaurant. As soon as she is told that this is unacceptable, she stops the act.\u0027What she insists is that she was replicating behaviour from abroad. The children would hold onto the bars on the top of her car while she drives slowly.\u0027In another era, this might not have been as concerning as it is now. She thought about what she was allowed to do when she was little, and that she was stupid and didn\u0027t think of the risks.\u0027She worked as a probation officer for six years and she also worked as a young persons drug counsellor. She also volunteers for a local elderly charity. She is somebody who took time out of her career to home school her children. She is a caring mother and a valued member of the community, who organises outdoor and crafts groups for children.\u0027She is somebody who has never been in trouble before in her life.\u0027Oakley who was also ordered to complete 120 hours unpaid work told the court: \u0027I agree with everything that was said, but I don\u0027t feel like this was a bit of fun. I think it is really awful what I did. I just wanted to say I am sorry and it was really stupid. I feel terrible about putting my children in danger. I am an intelligent person but I just didn\u0027t think about the consequences.JP Lynn Bennison told her: \u0027Members of the public were so concerned that they contacted the police. Dangerous driving is so serious and the driving you demonstrated that day seriously endangered your children.\u0027Oakley was also ordered to pay £200 in costs and surcharges. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/08/06/4EEB9B5F00000578-0-image-a-46_1533704965167.jpg","title":"XXXTentacions confession grave","story":"    Rapper XXXTentacion, also known as Jahseh Dwayne Onfroy, is heard confessing to domestic violence and stabbings in an audio recording taken around the time of his arrest in 2016Rapper XXXTentacion, who was fatally shot in June during a botched robbery while awaiting trial for domestic violence, can be heard confessing to that crime as well as several separate stabbings in a new audio obtained by Pitchfork.  The rapper, whose real name was Jahseh Dwayne Onfroy, was charged with aggravated battery on a pregnant woman, domestic battery by strangulation, false imprisonment, and first degree witness tampering. He pleaded not guilty and maintained his innocence in public until his death at age 20. However, in the audio clip secretly recorded by an acquaintance shortly after the rapper\u0027s initial arrest in October 2016, he can be heard talking frankly about beating up his girlfriend, Geneva Ayala, who he says left her terrified for the rest of her life. \u0027You seen me,\u0027 he tells the acquaintance. \u0027You know what I do to people.\u0027 He discusses how he\u0027d counted on his girlfriend as his \u0027source of happiness\u0027  but it had turned sour when he began \u0027f**king her up because she made one mistake.\u0027Fourth and final suspect, 20, in the shooting death of...Florida rapper Project Youngin, 25, appears to be shot while...Share this article\u0027Now she\u0027s scared,\u0027 he continued. \u0027That girl is scared for her life.

But XXXTentacion forbade their roommates from taking her to the hospital. Instead he left her in a room for two days. She escaped while pretending to make him something to eat, running out of an open side door in the kitchen. XXXTentacion was arrested the next day and charged with aggravated battery on a pregnant victim, domestic battery by strangulation, false imprisonment, and witness tampering.But in November 2017, Ayala signed a document saying she would not testify against XXXTentacion in court. She claims she was forced to do it by the rapper because she was scared of his fans, who he would often invite to court appearances.            XXXTentacion performs during the second day of the Rolling Loud Festival in downtown Miami on Saturday, May 6, 2017  Music streaming service Spotify announced in May 2018 that it would stop promoting or recommending music by him and R\u0026ampB artist R.

But a global outcry, including from the UN and the US, sparked a PR counter-offensive.  Foreign reporters are routinely stopped from accessing Xinjiang and are monitored          The Hotan Vocational Education and Training Center sits behind barbed wire in Xinjiang          Satellite images purported to show the internment camps where Muslim minorities are heldGovernment propaganda insisted the centres were aimed at countering the spread of separatism, terrorism and religious extremism through \u0027free\u0027 education and job training.However, an AFP examination of more than 1,500 publicly available government documents - ranging from tenders and budgets to official work reports - shows the centres are run like jails.To build new, better Chinese citizens, a document argued, the centres must first \u0027break their lineage, break their roots, break their connections, and break their origins\u0027.The centre featured on state broadcaster CCTV last week is one of at least 181 such facilities in Xinjiang, according to data collected by AFP.Participation is voluntary, according to CCTV, which showed contented \u0027students\u0027 wearing matching uniforms, studying Mandarin and learning trades like knitting, weaving and baking.The centres first appeared in 2014, the year that authorities launched a new \u0027strike hard\u0027 campaign against \u0027terrorism\u0027 after deadly violence in Xinjiang.But the buildup began in earnest in early 2017, with local governments in predominantly Uighur southern Xinjiang ordered to speed up the construction of \u0027concentrated educational transformation centres for focus groups\u0027 - a euphemism for the religious, the poor, the uneducated, passport holders, and virtually all men of military age.

Countering terrorism and fighting the enemies is part of the police spirit\u0027          China has admitted to the alleged use of internment camps for Muslim minorities in XinjiangShortly after, Xinjiang\u0027s regional government issued regulations on managing \u0027religious extremism\u0027.Extremists could be hiding anywhere, officials warned, instructing cadres to be on the lookout for 25 illegal religious activities and 75 signs of extremism, including such seemingly innocuous activities as quitting smoking or buying a tent.\u0027Detain those who should be detained to the greatest extent possible\u0027, cadres were told.Detentions surged, catching local governments unprepared.In 2017, spending by justice bureaus throughout Xinjiang exploded, driven largely by huge outlays for building and running vocational centres.The offices spent nearly three billion yuan (£334 million) - at least 577 per cent more than planned - according to AFP\u0027s calculations.Counties in the south closed the gap with a special fund earmarked for centres in the region.At least some of that money came directly from the Communist Party\u0027s Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission - the group in charge of the nation\u0027s legal authorities - budget documents showed.  Xinjiang \u0027training centres\u0027 should \u0027teach like a school, be managed like the military, and be defended like a prison\u0027, said one document, quoting Xinjiang\u0027s party secretary Chen Quanguo          Police are seen across Xinjiang as they ramped up their presence in cities and villages          A UN panel says up to one million ethnic Uighurs may be held in Chinese internment campsAround April 2017, local governments began posting a wide variety of tenders related to the facilities.Some orders - furniture, air conditioners, bunk beds, cutlery - would not seem out of place at a typical Chinese university.But others resembled prison equipment: sophisticated surveillance systems, cameras for recording students in their rooms, razor wire, a system for eavesdropping on phone calls, and infrared monitoring devices.The centres also bought police uniforms, riot shields and helmets, pepper spray, tear gas, net guns, stun guns, electrified batons, billy clubs, spears, handcuffs and spiked clubs known as \u0027wolf\u0027s teeth\u0027.At least one centre requested \u0027tiger chairs\u0027, a device used by Chinese police to restrain interrogation subjects.The gear was necessary, party officials in the regional capital Urumqi argued in an emergency request for Tasers, to \u0027guarantee staff members\u0027 personal safety\u0027.Non-lethal weapons, it said, were important for \u0027reducing the possibility of accidental injury in some situations where it is not necessary to use standard firearms\u0027.           On state television, the vocational education centre in Xinjiang\u0027s Hotan prefecture looked like a modern school where happy students studied Mandarin          A police vehicle patrolling the streets near the Id Kah Mosque in Kashgar, XinjiangDespite repeated attempts by AFP, local authorities could not be reached for comment before publication.

Firstly, she was seen at 5.30pm by a civilian who saw two children with their bodies out of the vehicle and they were hanging onto a bar on the roof. They were six and seven.\u0027She made her way to a restaurant, Kouros Cafe then as she exited the restaurant, later, she was seen by staff and diners in the restaurant with her children sitting on the window sill of her car. As she pulls away, she is seen by a police officer and he shouts for her to stop. The police officer gets in his car and signals her to stop. He witnesses her drive about 60 metres.          Ms Oakley, pictured, was told by JP Lynn Bennison that she had seriously endangered the safety of her children\u0027He asked what she was doing and she replied it was \u0027only a bit of fun\u0027. She continued to say this in her police interview.\u0027The children are young enough to have car seats and they had them in the car. She said that previously she allowed them to do this on a campsite.\u0027She initially said it wasn\u0027t dangerous because she was driving slowly due to sheep being on the road. Though there were two incidents, I don\u0027t know if the first one was prolonged.\u0027It\u0027s clear that there is not just a small risk of injury. If she had hit a pot hole, the children could have fallen out of her car and be hit by another car.\u0027A probation report about Oakley was read to the court and it said: \u0027At the time she hadn\u0027t considered how serious they wear or what harm could\u0027ve been caused to her children. She didn\u0027t envisage the matter being followed through. She had previously let the children sit on the windowsill and hang out of the window on campsites.\u0027Since being on holiday they have pestered her to allow them to do it again. Her thinking at the time was that it would be okay and didn\u0027t consider any of the consequences. The potential harm to the children was great. If they had slipped she could\u0027ve run over her own children or if another car had clipped them the same could have happened. She hadn\u0027t thought of other vehicles or the risks.\u0027She felt extremely embarrassed about herself. Her children her partner and herself have previously lived abroad in India for a year. This may have had an influence to her thoughts as they didn\u0027t have seatbelts there. It is not acceptable to put her children in that situation however. I do not think there was any intention to cause harm.\u0027Her parenting style has not caused any issues before. She lives with her partner and two children in a rented property and has lived there for just under three years. She works one day a week at a restaurant as a waitress. Her partner works Monday Tuesday Wednesday and Friday in a local school dealing with morning and after school clubs.\u0027The children are homeschooled. She has previously been a probation officer, not since 2008 and has a strong support network of friends and her partner, and she has a good character.Her lawyer Andrew Stewart said: \u0027This is a case of bad judgement on the defendant\u0027s part. She travelled a short distance on two occasions in a rural area very slowly.\u0027On the second occasion, a police officer said he saw her drive about 60 metres from the restaurant. As soon as she is told that this is unacceptable, she stops the act.\u0027What she insists is that she was replicating behaviour from abroad. The children would hold onto the bars on the top of her car while she drives slowly.\u0027In another era, this might not have been as concerning as it is now. She thought about what she was allowed to do when she was little, and that she was stupid and didn\u0027t think of the risks.\u0027She worked as a probation officer for six years and she also worked as a young persons drug counsellor. She also volunteers for a local elderly charity. She is somebody who took time out of her career to home school her children. She is a caring mother and a valued member of the community, who organises outdoor and crafts groups for children.\u0027She is somebody who has never been in trouble before in her life.\u0027Oakley who was also ordered to complete 120 hours unpaid work told the court: \u0027I agree with everything that was said, but I don\u0027t feel like this was a bit of fun. I think it is really awful what I did. I just wanted to say I am sorry and it was really stupid. I feel terrible about putting my children in danger. I am an intelligent person but I just didn\u0027t think about the consequences.JP Lynn Bennison told her: \u0027Members of the public were so concerned that they contacted the police. Dangerous driving is so serious and the driving you demonstrated that day seriously endangered your children.\u0027Oakley was also ordered to pay £200 in costs and surcharges. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/24/01/5194A42000000578-0-image-m-21_1540339661919.jpg","title":"BMW swerves wildly rush hour traffic 80mph","story":"    Dashcam footage has captured the moment a \u0027fast and furious\u0027 BMW driver (pictured) swerved wildly through rush hour trafficAfterwards, said he was left shaken by the incident which could have \u0027ended in disaster\u0027.The West Yorkshire local said: \u0027It shook me up - the speed they were travelling in such busy conditions.\u0027One wrong move could have been a disaster at those speeds and with such a big powerful car.Shocking moment turning van sends an SUV flying into traffic...Hero motorist tails drug driver who mounted pavement and...Share this article\u0027I got into the left lane because my junction was coming up then I caught a flash of light in my rear view mirror and noticed the black BMW weaving in between cars in the left and right lane.\u0027A blue van was to the right of me just passing me as I saw the BMW flying up behind me.\u0027I thought it was going to go into the back of me but it swung to the right behind the van then immediately to the left - to avoid going into the back of the van.

But the writers he chose to develop four new strands to the story of Morpheus – Simon Spurrier, Nalo Hopkinson, Dan Watters and Kat Howard – admit they were a little apprehensive.“We all went into the project with an understandable amount of trepidation to colour the enthusiasm,” says Spurrier, who has joined forces with the artist Bilquis Evely on The Dreaming, “imagining ourselves politely borrowing Neil’s toys, respectfully spending a little time mucking about in his proverbial sandpit, but ultimately returning everything unmarked and unchanged.”Gaiman isn’t writing the four new books himself – he’s busy with TV adaptations of the novels American Gods and Good Omens – but having picked the creative teams he conducted a brainstorming session in New Orleans, where he outlined a vision for the interconnecting series, and encouraged the writers to enjoy themselves.“Neil’s first set of feedback to our earliest ideas was to tacitly give us permission to stop worrying so much,” Spurrier says, “to treat the toys with the sort of loving recklessness one really needs to build great stories. To add new toys and to break some of the old ones if necessary. He’s maintained an appropriately godfatherly posture ever since.”One of the flagship titles of DC’s mature readers’ imprint Vertigo when it launched in 1988, Sandman ran for eight years and 75 monthly issues. Gaiman charted the adventures of Morpheus, the personification of dreams, and his otherwordly siblings who hold sway over realms such as desire, destiny and delirium. After a hiatus of 17 years, he returned to the character in 2013 for a prequel, The Sandman: Overture, and in March 2018 Gaiman revealed he had been feeling guilty that no one was playing with a story he described as “a huge sandbox with so many wonderful toys”.DC helped Gaiman select creative teams to expand the story’s world with four monthly comics that would become a self-contained “Sandman Universe” within the wider DC continuity — House of Whispers, The Books of Magic, Lucifer and The Dreaming. But Gaiman hasn’t left the writers without a map.Sandman, which has sold more than 7m copies, was the comic book that brought a new readership to comics people who didn’t really read comics were happy to make an exception for Gaiman’s storytelling. In the 80s, its cast of characters was also notably erse. That might have been new and inventive in 1988, but surely the world – and comics – have changed for the better in the last 30 years?Kat Howard, who writes The Books of Magic, following bespectacled boy magician Tim Hunter (whose first Sandman incarnation predated Harry Potter by some time), says: “Well, I’m answering this question on a day when it’s been announced that the government of my country is trying to further strip legal rights and protections from trans people, so my short, angry response is that we haven’t come far enough. With that acknowledgement, I’m proud to be a part of a title and a comic universe that had and has stories of inclusivity, that was and will continue to be a place where people can see themselves represented on its pages.”Spurrier agrees. “When one sets out to tell stories with an ensemble cast – especially one literally made up of dreams, nightmares, myths and abstractions, set in a world which is a representation of the collective human subconscious, you’d have to be pretty tone deaf, and pretty determined to tell a mind-numbingly grey story, not to embrace variety and positive distinctions.”Whereas The Dreaming, Lucifer and The Books of Magic take existing and familiar Sandman characters, the fourth new Sandman comic, The House of Whispers, written by Nalo Hopkinson with art by Dominike Stanton, introduces a whole new realm to the universe, one populated by people of colour and infused with voodoo.Hopkinson told the website io9: “What’s wonderful is that Neil and the artists who did the original Sandman series wrote the roads into inclusivity. So, yes, it’s a white world … But the spaces are there, the sensibility is there, and the support is there. Neil knows what I’m going to bring to it. He’s read my work and my pitch. That encouragement is there.”The world of the Sandman has always been a broad church, in genre terms, and these four linked books push that even further. “Sandman has always had that postmodern element to me – infuriating or wonderful depending on your point of view – that it can absorb everything into itself,” says Watters. “Being a grand narrative on the subject of dreams, and the stories dreams allow us to tell, means that all stories can be folded into Sandman. Neil used this ability to its fullest a Sandman story can be a magical fairytale like The Hunt, grim 80s horror like 24 Hours, moving historical drama like August … or anything in between.”The release of The Books of Magic this week means the debut issues of the four comics in the Sandman Universe are now all published, their unifying theme that the Lord of Dreams is missing. But his shadow hangs over all these new storylines, just as Gaiman’s does. So is this the old Sandman come back, or a new thing entirely?“Neither? Both?” says Howard. “I definitely think new readers could pick up any of these four new stories and be perfectly at home. At the same time, Sandman is there, the Dreaming is there, it’s not as if those threads of story were severed. It’s a new thing that knows where it comes from.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d15f9a410a13b56a58bddbfefd654a7db9e6fcfd/0_275_1080_648/master/1080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=89dea75505faef782aad0f18d6c263b7","title":"tips links and suggestions what are you reading this week","story":"Your space to discuss the books you are reading and what you think of themWelcome to this week’s blog. Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.First up, EstelleMoon, who has had a disappointingly fulfilling experience:Well, as much as I’d like to say I’ve been reading something esoteric and obscure, no, I’ve been reading something incredibly popular. And as much as I’d like to say that the popular thing is overrated and bad, no, in fact, it turns out it’s incredibly popular and incredibly good.I’m talking about Elena Ferrante. I finished My Brilliant Friend a couple of days ago, and I’m now about 100 pages into Volume 2 of her Neapolitan Quartet, The Story of a New Name. They’re so vivid and rich when it comes to detailing this beautiful, frustrating and profound friendship between Elena and Lila, full of love, full of competition, full of resentment, full of life. But they’re also a portrait of a community, of a country coming from fascism, they’re about the urge to break away from the stifling world you grew up in, they’re about masculinity, about family, about politics and so much more – but all these heady themes emerge in the best way possible – ie, organically, through the story and the lives of Elena and Lila.Oh well. Elsewhere, julian6 has enjoyed Mario Vargas Llosa’s early book, The Time of the Hero:This account of the daily struggles and cruelties at a military academy in Peru has sharply etched characters and wonderfully economical descriptive work. Llosa plays with time sequences throughout, moving back and forth, slowly drawing out the painful life journeys of his characters. It is clear-eyed, unsentimental and unfailingly honest, showing its vulnerable, petty, vindictive but not entirely irredeemable protagonists in a raw uncompromising light. The translation brought out the fluency of phrasing, the choice vocabulary. These narrators - for there are many viewpoints in this work, as well as third person - know their world intimately. I was drawn in from the beginning. The sympathy that emerged was never pleaded for or crudely awakened. There is nothing cheap in Llosa’s vision - it is a naked portrayal of diminished lives caught in an unforgiving web of poverty, prejudice and pitiless power structures.A second reading of Life and Fate by Vasily Grossman has impressed Ieuan:Very similar to War and Peace (which was its inspiration – and of similar length and complexity). The manuscript was confiscated by the KGB upon writing and Grossman was told it couldn’t be published for ‘at least 200 years’. A copy was smuggled to the west in the 1980s and published here. It was hailed a masterpiece and (IMHO), it is.The Power by Naomi Alderman gets a nod from koelner:I just finished reading and it absolutely blew me away. I didn’t necessarily agree with how things developed (ie that it would really work out like that if it happened in real life) but it was just so clever, especially the letters between authors at the end. I finished it and immediately had the urge to write an essay on it like back when I was in school. I mean, I didn’t, but there was just so much to think about and comment on and discuss. It really fired my imagination. It would be such a good book to study at school. Really enjoyed it.Meanwhile, The Power and the Glory by Graham Greene has worked for scoopster35:Greene puts you exactly in his world – peasant Mexico, in this case – with no fuss, no flowery prose, just hard, clear, vivid writing.RedmonT recommends The End of Vandalism by Tom Drury:It’s hilarious. Rare indeed that I laugh out loud from a book but I have done several times already. There’s something tragic about it, too.Here’s paulburns on Richard Flanagan’s Death of a River Guide:During an expedition down the Franklin River in northwest Tasmania, Aljaz Cosini, the expedition’s guide, drowns in an attempt to rescue a punter who has fallen into the raging rapids. As he drowns he recalls not only his own life, but the lives of several generations of his relatives, one of whom is a Tasmanian Aborigine. (For those who don’t know, Tasmanian Aborigines are a different type of indigenous people to the mainland Indigenous Australians), and another a convict, whose relatives are ashamed of the ‘convict stain’. At the same time, Flanagan writes in detail and lovingly of travelling down the Franklin River (not the safest thing in the world to do) in a journey beset by tragedy. This is a fine, beautifully written book.I am reading Harry Potter again, this time with my grandson. He is the same age his mum was when the first book was published,when we found it in the library, well before it became A Thing. He pleads for another chapter each time we finish one. ‘You can read this yourself,’ I said. ‘Yes, but it’s funner having you read it so I can imagine it in my head’ he said.

Despite handing a reprieve to cash-strapped families, economists have warned that the storm clouds connected to Brexit are gathering for the UK economy.Writing in the , Andrew Sentance, a former member of the interest rate-setting monetary policy committee at the Bank of England, urged the chancellor to take decisive action to maintain business confidence.“Despite some positive economic news over the summer, we may well see some harsher economic conditions as we move through the autumn and winter and into 2019,” he said.To gauge the impact of the EU referendum outcome on a monthly basis, the  has chosen eight economic indicators, along with the value of the pound and the performance of the FTSE 100. Economists made forecasts for seven of those barometers before their release, and in four cases the outcome was better than expected.However, failure by Theresa May to agree a deal with Brussels before Britain’s formal departure date on 29 March could trigger a sharp drop in the value of the pound and other wide-ranging negative economic consequences, according to analysis published this month by the Office for Budget Responsibility, the government’s tax and spending watchdog.The UK’s trading position with the rest of the world deteriorated in August, according to the latest figures, with the prospects for global trade damaged by US import tariffs on China and the EU, with potential to trigger a broad slowdown in economic growth just as Britain leaves the EU – its largest trading partner.The latest dashboard points to potential signs of weakness for the months ahead. An abrupt slowdown in consumer spending in September has sounded the alarm that the resilience built up in the UK economy over the summer – when warm weather and the World Cup gave Britain a shot in the arm – has begun to fade.The EY Item Club forecasting group said the economy would struggle to recover in the final months of the year, with Britain on-track for the worst year for economic growth in almost a decade as a consequence of Brexit concerns among businesses and consumers.Hammond is under increasing pressure to ditch austerity after May claimed the Tories would end the deep cuts to public spending at the Conservative party conference. Economists are doubtful as this would require either stronger economic growth, higher taxes or higher borrowing in the years ahead, with an estimate from the Institute for Fiscal Studies that Hammond needs £19bn to end austerity and boost NHS spending.The chancellor may, however, have little choice but to lift spending should the British economy deteriorate further. Writing in the , David Blanchflower, another former member of the Bank’s MPC, said the conditions were “changing but not for the better”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93784ab8485a91ffea448f5d5fce98ea1380000e/0_0_4578_2747/master/4578.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=832bda51d9e65ae8c410702af48fcaf5","title":"gourmet burger kitchen to close one in five uk outlets","story":"Move puts 250 jobs at risk and comes after rival Byron also announced closuresGourmet Burger Kitchen is to close 17 of its 85 restaurants with the potential loss of 250 jobs in the latest sign of tough trading conditions on Britain’s high streets.The upmarket burger chain has asked landlords and other creditors to support a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) restructuring plan as it admitted it was struggling in a “challenging UK casual dining environment” and said its rental payments were too high.Derrian Nadauld, the firm’s managing director, said: “We are having to take tough but necessary actions to reduce our fixed-cost base and restore long-term profitability.”The chain is owned by South Africa’s Famous Brands, which also owns Wimpy and the bakery Paul. It is the latest in a series of casual dining restaurant groups to close outlets through a CVA as consumer spending slows and the cost of wages and business rates rise. Overexpansion by formulaic groups backed by private equity has also increased competition just as diners have reined in spending.The rival chain Byron closed 20 of its 67 sites through a CVA while Jamie’s Italian, Carluccio’s and Cau, part of the Gaucho group, have all used the process to shut outlets and cut hundreds of jobs this year.Matthew Richards, a director at Grant Thornton, which is advising on the Gourmet Burger Kitchen CVA, said: “The casual dining trading environment in the UK remains extremely challenging, driven by a change in dining behaviour, long-term consumer trends and increased competition.“It is important to stress that no restaurants will close immediately and employees and suppliers will continue to be paid on time and in full.”The chain said it had already taken significant steps toward restructuring the way the business operated, including reducing head office costs, the refurbishment of 30 restaurants and updating its branding."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c1568fdce67e7f6b52e20eae2d10fce2218894d/0_43_2345_1407/master/2345.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a7974dba2a4f05fe46518ccdc8b8cc4f","title":"government policing of rogue landlords labelled pathetic","story":"MPs hit out as  and ITV News investigation shows convicted landlords exploit loopholes in lawThe government’s efforts to police rogue landlords have been branded weak and pathetic after a  and ITV News investigation found convicted landlords continue to operate by exploiting loopholes in the law that is supposed to protect the most vulnerable tenants.The comments came after the  and ITV News revealed that rogue landlords are collecting rent, often funded by taxpayers via housing benefit, despite convictions for housing offences and failing to pass the “fit and proper” person tests required by housing legislation in England and Wales. Because of the way the law is written, this is usually perfectly legal.The exposé also discovered that local authorities have failed to make a single entry on to the central government’s new rogue landlord database in the six months since its launch.The government estimated before the launch of the database that there were 10,500 rogue landlords operating in England and said it expected more than 600 of the worst offenders to be entered on to the system. The contents of the database are being kept secret from the public and the government said it was “not in the public interest” to explain why.The Liberal Democrat leader, Vince Cable, said: “It is clear from this investigation that this legislation is too weak and is not being properly enforced. There’s no justification for treating rogue landlords more lightly than other people who break the law.”Labour’s David Lammy, the MP for Tottenham, said on Twitter: “This is pathetic. The government’s new rogue landlord database has failed to log a single entry. And its secrecy means that even if it had logged offenders, tenants would not know. Action and transparency is needed.”The criticisms of housing laws have been echoed by fellow MPs, who have called for the government to rework sections of the legislation.Matt Western, the member for Warwick and Leamington, said: “Shocking failure of legislation to combat rogue landlords. But good investigative journalism by ITV News and the .”Labour’s Chris Williamson, the MP for Derby North, tweeted on Monday: “Current housing law isn’t fit for purpose. It allows rogue landlords to run riot. I raised an example in parliament last week, where tenants in my constituency had been served with eviction notices in time for Christmas”.Housing experts also called for a review of the legislation designed to police the private rented sector.Julie Rugg, a senior research fellow at the University of York’s Centre for Housing Policy who co-authored a study published last month on England’s private rented sector, told the  and ITV News that the government’s legislation needed a complete overhaul: “There is a lot to be said for saying: ‘You know what, can we just start again?’”Heather Wheeler MP, the minister for housing and homelessness, told the  and ITV News on Tuesday: “Everyone deserves a decent and safe place to live, and we are reforming the private rented sector to make it fairer for all.“Through fines, banning orders and the new rogue landlord database, warmly welcomed by councils, we have provided authorities with new enforcement tools to help them crack down on the minority of landlords who exploit tenants.”The Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) said there had not been time for councils to convict rogue landlords of the offences that could result in their names being entered on the database, and that they should start to be added in the new year.The MHCLG was also “exploring further options for making information contained with the database available to prospective and existing tenants”, it said.

We asked Black Pride attendees what makes Atlanta’s scene so importantPhotography by Bita Honarvar Atlanta Black Pride Weekend (ABPW) is the largest event of its kind in the US, attracting 80,000 people to the city. Atlanta has become known as a travel destination for many black gay Americans, who feel it is one of the few places in the south where they can feel safe and free.Chloe Jordan, 39, a senior researcher at the Emory University Department of Medicine, is working on the Atlanta Lite Study, the first cohort study of transgender women and transfeminine people undertaken in the US. She says poverty and chronic homelessness plague the black LGBT community, particularly those who are trans.“Many of us are living with no safety net, so we turn to sex work to survive, which also makes us susceptible to violence,” Jordan says. She herself experienced homelessness after coming out as trans to her family, and today uses her story to advocate for LGBT rights.Bishop Clyde Allen III, 45, the founder of Vision Cathedral of Atlanta, argues that the black church doesn’t help. Once the cornerstone of the black community, it has perpetuated toxic attitudes about gay people, he says, which is particularly detrimental to the self-esteem of the many black gay people who look to the church for spiritual guidance.During the Pure Heat festival in September, hosted by the Vision Community Foundation and Traxx Girls, members of the LGBTQ community spoke candidly about life in Atlanta – the good and the bad.Her West Indian roots make Trey Anthony, Harris’ partner, more cautious about openly expressing her sexuality. “I think being Jamaican I have a different kind of sense of fear around homophobia, because I know what that can look like,” Anthony says.The two plan to get married and have children, but want to leave the south to do so.“We’re going to wait to move the west coast and have kids there,” Anthony says. “I think it would be hard for them having two moms and going to school, especially in a state that’s so religious.”“The gay community here is very close-knit, everyone knows us here and it’s OK to be ourselves,” says Kennedy.The two aspiring hip-hop artists performed at the Pure Heat festival, one of the largest events of ABPW last month.They relocated to Atlanta because of its opportunities and community for black people, which Kennedy says made the move easier.Morgan, who is single, says dating in Atlanta is a “wide playing field”: “There are no limits.”As a stylist, Christopher dresses reality stars such as Dr Heavenly Kimes of Married to Medicine and Erica Dixon of Love \u0026amp Hip Hop Atlanta. and says he’s focused on his work. “I’m dating my work, that’s what I love,” he says. “Right now my partner is styling and I’m faithful.”Originally from Birmingham, Alabama, Christopher has lived in Atlanta for about a year and a half. He says there is a stigma attached to being LGBT in the south, and that even in a place like Atlanta, with a large gay population, discrimination is still a part of everyday life.Working in the entertainment industry, Christopher says he constantly has to shoot down generalizations about gay men. “The stereotype is that gay people can be catty, extra and flamboyant, but that’s not everybody.”The Bryants didn’t have a fancy wedding. In fact, the two exchanged vows in between running errands after work one day, says Jonathan.“He said ‘Do you want to get married?’ And I said yes, so we went to the courthouse and got married and that was it,” Jonathan recalls, smiling.Both their families were against the union and so did not attend. However, they maintain a relationship with Wil’s mother, who is supportive.After the ups and downs of dating in Atlanta they were ready to settle down. “Everyone says they’re looking for someone, but they don’t actually act that way,” Jonathan says. “Dating is difficult because there are a lot of people who aren’t out or are out at different degrees.”Vaughn Alvarez is the founder of the Cr8 PR agency in Atlanta, and worked on the Pure Heat festival at Piedmont Park during ABPW.As a millennial, Alvarez says LGBT rights were embraced by his generation, so he never had to come out. “I was always just myself,” he says. Alvarez moved from Nashville to Atlanta 10 years ago because of the culture here. “There’s a sense of freedom and … community amongst the African American LGBT community here, and that makes it so unique,” he says.Originally from Los Angeles, California, Allen came to Atlanta to attend the prestigious men’s-only Morehouse College. He founded The Vision Cathedral of Atlanta to serve as “an affirming and inclusive spiritual environment”, providing a haven from the stigma associated with the LGBT community that he says is often rooted in religious doctrine.“Many people in our community grew up in theological abusive and spiritually violent churches where the teaching, preaching and the theology was anti-gay.”The Vision Cathedral is a black church and Allen’s own work focuses on issues affecting the black community. “The reason there is a church is to provide care, love, and help,” Allen says. He lives in Atlanta with his husband Rashad Burgess and their two adopted children.Ramos and McTear have been partners for almost four years. In that time, Ramos says ABPW has grown smaller. Once it offered movie screenings, fashion shows, poetry readings and conferences, but now the focus is on the parties, they say.“They used to shut down Lenox Mall because there would be so many people here,” Ramos says. “We have watched it dwindle every year. I think maybe social media has changed the way people interact – before, we had to get together.”Both Ramos and McTear lived through the Aids epidemic of the 1980s and 90s many of their friends passed away or are living with HIV. Ramos believes shame – especially that perpetuated by the church – contributes to the high rates of HIV infection in the black community.Blue and Delaney have been together for most of their lives. They moved to Atlanta from Colorado in 2012. They now live about 30 minutes outside of the city and plan to move into the center to feel more accepted as an LGBT couple.“Unless you’re in the gay community people aren’t open about it,” Delaney says. “People are more judgemental unless you’re in Midtown or Piedmont Park.”Blue is currently undergoing the process of gender reassignment and says the support he receives at the clinic is not matched when he’s out and about.“When I was at the strip club they damn near threw me out because they were mad about me using the men’s bathroom,” he says.As a star of docusoap Love \u0026amp Hip Hop Atlanta, and founder of party promotion group Traxx Girls, Scott considers it her mission to help people feel more comfortable with being out and gay. She says religion and family can often be barriers, and recalls her mother asking “What did I do wrong?” after Scott came out as a lesbian. “She just has a gay kid and a successful gay kid at that,” Scott says.Mingling within the “huge pool” of LGBT people of color, Scott often finds herself at the intersection of women’s rights, racial justice and LGBTQ rights.“However discrimination comes, it feels the same.” Cities is live in Atlanta for a special series of in-depth reporting.

They received more than 5,000 submissions and the show ultimately included 275 photos from over 100 local photographers. But the hashtag has lived on well past that show.In the years since, #weloveatl has turned into a movement, with over 1m posts to the hashtag on Instagram and 69,000 followers for @weloveatl. “If you say #weloveatl, it’s a proclamation, it’s different than identifying where you’re at, it’s saying ‘I love my city’ or ‘we love our city’,” co-founder Tim Moxley said in a 2014 interview.Co-founder Brandon Barr told  Cities #weloveatl is now registered as a not-for-profit corporation to connect, support and boost Atlanta’s photographers, online and off, with exhibitions and installations throughout the city. The aim, he said, was to support local nonprofits and promote the love of ATL.“For us as founders, it’s been exciting to give this platform to the many talented photographers in the city and be constantly surprised by the visual storytelling of this community,” Barr said. “It’s a city constantly writing its own story, and that’s pretty special.”Atlanta continues to make its mark on Instagram. Search the city’s hotspots and you’ll find gleaming high-rises and packed stadiums, signage and street art – and even urban rainbows.Lauren Holley, who founded the Atlanta Urban Photo Walkers meetup and posts herself as @graphiknation, says Atlanta flies under the radar with most international travellers, and is best known for its airport. “I think that’s kind of part of the appeal – when people end up here by chance, maybe because of a job, convention or school, they feel surprised – like they ‘discovered’ something really special about a city they never thought much of.” Cities is in Atlanta this week for a special week of journalism.

When will the government act too?For parents, there is nothing worse than worrying about the health and wellbeing of your child. Unfortunately, we have now reached the point where across the UK the air that children are breathing is damaging their health.In many areas of public health we have rightly taken action to protect children, such as guidelines on what pregnant women can safely consume or banning smoking in cars with children. But when it comes to air pollution we do not know how many of our children are being put at risk just from going to school.There is some evidence to show that many schools could be affected by illegal and dirty air. Last year it was estimated that over 2,000 schools and nurseries were within 150 metres of roads with illegal levels of air pollution. So we find ourselves in a situation where we rightly banned advertising for smoking near our children’s schools, but at the same time allow them to be poisoned by dirty air from road transport and other sources.Children are more vulnerable to breathing in polluted air than adults. For their size, they breathe more air each minute than an adult. Buggies and prams put them at the level of car exhausts. Breathing illegal and harmful levels of air pollution triggers asthma attacks and can make those attacks more severe, increasing the risk that they will end up in hospital or worse. It can also stunt their lung growth, causing further health problems as they grow up. They are at greater risk of cancer when they are older and suffer more from infections like pneumonia.Legal limits of air pollution should have been met in 2010, but government projections suggest that, without further action, this will not happen until 2028 in London and 2021 in other urban areas. Much of the UK suffers from levels of some pollutants that are over World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines that are based on the latest scientific evidence.We need to take action on air pollution and we need to do it quickly, as it affects all of us in many areas of the country. But we can and should go much faster to protect our children.That’s why we’re proud to launch the Clean Air for Children programme on Wednesday. The programme has been put together by parents across the country who have joined the Clean Air Parents’ Network. It calls for emergency measures to protect children and babies’ lungs from illegal and harmful levels of air pollution where they learn and where they play.Without delay, the government must monitor and identify all schools affected by illegal and harmful levels of pollution. Parents rightly want reliable, transparent information of a school’s exam results. It is inexcusable that we do not have the same for air pollution.But an audit must be accompanied by action. We should be bringing in traffic exclusion zones to help reduce children’s exposure to pollution. This approach has worked in places across the UK, such as Edinburgh, Solihull and Hounslow, but it needs to happen faster and in many more places.We also need to stop building schools, nurseries and playgrounds in pollution hotspots. Research suggests that in England alone over 6,000 new school places have been approved in locations that are on or near illegally polluted roads since 2012. And we need to consider new laws in the forthcoming environment bill to safeguard our right to breathe clean air with limits based on the WHO guidelines.These are practical solutions to protect our children from the harm air pollution can cause.We could do all of this with political will. This must be an alliance of local government and national government, but national government needs to step up. Just £150m could help roll out emergency measures to prioritise the health of children where they learn and where they play.This matters because the damage dirty air can do to children’s lungs may never be reversed and it could put them at higher risk of developing further health problems in later life. This is a public health emergency and it is about time we started treating it as such.• Maria Miller is the Conservative MP for Basingstoke and a former secretary of state for culture, media and sport Ed Miliband is the Labour MP for Doncaster North and is a former Labour party leader"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e434cede6abf2d020c00f4261640476f6f188a9a/0_111_3692_2215/master/3692.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=05dcbc7e13e0e4e0c44dfa9bcc19725b","title":"tories posh boy image universal credit","story":"The party fixates on its perceived poshness, when the real problem is unpopular and harmful policies such as universal creditOne of Theresa May’s first acts as prime minister was to perform a purge of the posh boys. After declaring on the steps of Downing Street that she would “make Britain a country that works not for a privileged few, but for every one of us”, the grammar-school educated Tory took immediate action to apply those words to her cabinet.With her Old Etonian predecessor David Cameron out of the picture, May ousted a host of his privately educated chums in what was seen as a sign that the sun was finally setting on the once omnipotent Notting Hill set. At the time, it was heralded by May’s allies as a new meritocratic chapter for a Tory party that had too often been associated with a lucky few.So, perhaps it’s little wonder that when news broke earlier this month that the Oxford University Conservative Association was to ban members of the Bullingdon Club – the university’s infamous all-male dining club of which Cameron was once a member – from holding positions, it was seen as a further sign of a party trying to rebrand itself for the modern day. Not so. That ban has now been overturned after a disciplinary meeting found the passing of the motion to be “unconstitutional”.While the fact that a select few can – for now – still dine in £1,200 club tailcoats and call themselves Oxford young Tories might appear somewhat small (if unhelpful) fry, the incident casts a light on the difficulties the party faces when it comes to shaking off its image problem. The very fact that the Conservative Association felt the need to distance itself from the organisation in the first place is telling. The Bullingdon Club has long been a source of embarrassment for the Tories. A symbol of privilege and excess, photos of Cameron, George Osborne and Boris Johnson in the white tie and club tailcoats from their Buller days have served as an easy way for critics to depict the Conservatives as a party out of touch with society.But as a result of all the negative publicity, the society – known for drunken impropriety – is by all accounts rather humdrum these days. Thanks to its bad reputation – and its unflattering depiction in films such as The Riot Club – any savvy would-be politician wouldn’t touch it with a bargepole. In fact, two years ago, there were rumours that the club was about to dissolve on the grounds that they were having such difficulties wooing new members. That the Tory association sought to make a symbolic point suggests they think the image of toffs behaving badly continues to haunt the party today.So, is the Conservative party still an old boys’ club? Although May used her conference speech to declare that the Tories are the party of opportunity and pointed to her ministers’ personal hardships as proof of that, a class snobbery still exists in parts of it. A number of MPs like to joke about the fact that, although May attended Oxford University, she only studied geography at St Hugh’s College – founded for women who couldn’t afford the fees at other women’s colleges. Meanwhile, defence secretary Gavin Williamson’s nickname is Poker. It’s not particularly affectionate – the purpose is to tease him over his humble beginnings as a fire salesman. Perhaps it’s little wonder then that some find it hard to take the party’s “opportunity for all” slogan entirely seriously.As for May herself, it’s not clear that she is now seen as all that different from what came before her. At the beginning of the snap election campaign, pollsters found May, generally regarded as more relatable, had better cut-through with traditional Labour voters than Cameron. However, as the campaign wore on, that changed – with her personal endorsement of fox hunting particularly damaging to her personal brand. “People began to think, ‘Oh, she is like the rest of them after all,’” remarked one insider involved in running the focus groups.But rather than worry about which public schoolboys are in the cabinet, or whether the Bullers are in control, the Tories would be better advised to delve a bit deeper and focus on the policies they are putting forward. Two years ago, back in May’s honeymoon period, the prime minister was enjoying double-figure leads in the polls with her promise to help the just-about-managing and tackle the burning injustices in society.Since then, that agenda has fallen off the radar – with reports that the rhetoric has been dropped over concerns it risked boosting support for Labour. Meanwhile, the troubled universal credit rollout is expected to make many of the most vulnerable in society worse off unless serious reforms are put in place. Rather than a class war, the best way to convince voters that the party isn’t out of touch with the needs of ordinary people is to make sure the policies actually help them.• Katy Balls is the Spectator’s political correspondent"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/261c633fc56378e47ae1356ca83e7b34a8c3e735/348_926_2683_1609/master/2683.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a0c22d10451a9072c2becb30efd9995","title":"some of the countries leading on climate change might surprise you","story":"Iran is tackling the potential water supply crisis exacerbated by climate changeCountries that may not be thought of as climate leaders are emerging at the front-lines on responding to climate change.One great example is Iran. I have the fortune of performing water-use research with a number of scientists in Iran. And I can assure you they are thinking about, planning, and taking action to reduce the impacts of climate change and ecological destruction.One example of an Iranian leader is Dr. Mohammad Taghi Sattari who is an Associate Professor of water engineering at the University of Tabriz. He recently wrote a report about an effort in Iran to handle their water availability crises. It probably doesn’t surprise people that Iranians think about water availability it is a country with limited rainfall. And the concurrence of three issues (water management, growing population, and climate change) make this is particularly challenging problem.In 2017, the Iranian government released a report from the Strategic Studies Center that showed water availability is viewed as the second-most important national issue. Statistical data from the Iranian government’s Power Ministry and from the World Bank predict that Iran is soon to enter a broad and extensive water crisis. If the crisis is not properly managed, there will be both direct and indirect economic costs, social upheaval, and security consequences.According to the published data, in 2014, the annual rainfall in Iran averaged 228 mm (less than a foot). This is 15th the world-average rainfall. As a country, Iranian’s rainfall put them in the 163rd position. Dr. Sattari believes that even though the amount of rainfall in Iran is very low, proper management could enable it to match the needs of the country.In an effort to more efficiently use water in Iran, many large dams have been built. These dams have led to an explosion in agricultural production but have also caused unintended consequences for downstream water rights and water availability. The result is that agricultural water has been made so cheap that it is being used in very water-intensive crops. The exported crops are being sold for less money than the water they hold. Simply put, Iran is exporting water via its watermelons.But there is hope. The president of Iran, Dr. Hassan Rouhani has identified water as the nation’s second-most severe threat. This means that Iran’s government is taking the problem very seriously. The country is developing a people-centered water management system that brings together administrators, economic experts, and politicians to make informed decisions.Part of the effort is through water education – teaching people how to use water most efficiently. Also, latitude is being given to people to design, adjust, and implement water resource policies. Iran is exploring different water-management technologies that will better handle the intermittent rainfall. I have seen these technologies and have worked with researchers to publish performance results. It is exciting work.Make no mistake, Iran’s water problem is a real and crises are coming. But the country is devoting the entirety of its national energy to solve the problem.I spoke to my colleague, Dr. Sattari about his work and he said,I am an associate professor at the Department of Water Science and Engineering in University of Tabriz. At my university, research on water resources management, especially in the Urmia Lake drought crisis, is one of the most important research topics. Several research teams are working hard in this area. The topics of the thesis of Msc and PHD students will be rooted in this direction and the results of this research will be published in the most reputable and specialized journals of the world. The Urmia lake basin and its salvation are the main goals of our independent research. I and my colleagues believe that we can overcome these crises and once again return the Urmia Lake to its previous state.How nice to have an optimistic view in these trying times. Working together, scientists and decision makers around the world can make this planet a better place. For the people living around places like Lake Urmia, their fate is in the hands of people like Dr. Sattari."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b968010370ce82c46b386b93d7f94fc533768b88/1_1_2424_1454/master/2424.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f6b611cea058e23f68437ecfe9ff13d2","title":"fashions quirky new silhouettes catwalks high street","story":"The catwalks were full of unexpected volume this season, and the high street has followed suit. Here’s how to dress like a lampshade, while keeping your coolThe autumnwinter catwalks were all about making statements with shape. From clothes that were mildly bulky to outright bulging, and maximalist top-halves contrasting with streamlined bottom halves, designers took the opportunity to turn up the volume. It might, at first glance, seem impractical, but think again: there are tips and tricks to be taken from the collections that fuse function with fashion. You don’t have to follow this ethos to the letter instead, it can be easily replicated, or subtly nodded to, with high-street offerings this season.This silhouette is about being cocooned up top and streamlined below. Alessandro Michele’s froufrou creation at Gucci encapsulated it best on the runway, and the look has been mirrored in myriad faux-fur and shearling options on the high street, including River Island’s cropped red jacket (now £60). The bomber jacket trend – spearheaded by brands such as Marques Almeida, Sacai and Undercover at the shows – achieves the same effect with a streetwear sensibility. Asos, Topshop and Boy London have great variations ranging from £16 to £170. Far from fluid, this silhouette is one that you can have fun with, but it will need to be balanced with simplicity below the waist – think jeans or a pencil skirt – for all the style but with none of the sting. SCWe are not suggesting you take your cue from the lighting department, rather the similar and super-flattering silhouette created by a cape. Possibly this season’s most popular outerwear trend, thanks to its throw-on-and-go credentials and a certain Duchess of Sussex wearing one on tour in Australia this week, the cape came swooping down the runways at Alexander McQueen, Fendi and Erdem. Our favourite interpretation was at Givenchy, where Clare Waight Keller morphed her take on the trend with a trench coat, which everyone knows is the most versatile item to own. \u0026amp Other Stories has a beautiful belted style for £129, which we are banking on being the most worn item in our wardrobe this winter. SCDressing like a member of the allium family might not sound desirable, but this silhouette lends itself to practical autumnal dressing. It is all about layering, perfect for peeling off in\u0026nbspfluctuating temperatures or when you are speeding from footpath to bus. The look was big at Balenciaga, where models wore oversized anoraks over faux-fur jackets and big jumpers. Comme des Garçons (ever the champion of a millefeuille) and Maison Margiela also offered its own versions. Layering like this is ideal for eking out the life of summer-y jackets (no need to put your favourite denim jacket into hibernation just yet) or for breathing new life into last year’s padded jackets – wear one under an oversized blazer or overcoat when the sun goes down.

Now he makes his cinema debut, directing an eerie film set in remote fenland Norfolk – adapted by Holness from his own short story, originally published in a 2008 collection entitled The New Uncanny, alongside work by Nicholas Royle and AS Byatt. It is deadly serious, but carries with it an echo or ghost of how this same material could have been played as ironic black comedy.Possum is an intensely English film, and like Andy Nyman and Jeremy Dyson’s recent Ghost Stories, it pays homage to a classic atmospheric creepiness that our national cinema used to give us from the end of the war to the mid-70s. There’s a little nod to Stephen King, too. Maybe it doesn’t quite make sense to talk about “folk horror” because all horror is folk horror. The genre is atavistic and anarchic. It all depends on upending what we expect of rational modernity and what is psychologically and technologically manageable. This film induces a grisly shiver, like a slug dropped down the back of your neck, and there are some amazing images. But I wondered if it was finally unfinished and anticlimactic, and whether its inexplicability might have worked better in a more compressed short film in a portmanteau collection, such as the Ealing movie Dead of Night.The scene is a gloomy provincial town out in the East Anglian bayou. Philip, played by Sean Harris, is a very strange-looking man who is arriving by train, apparently in retreat from some awful disgrace. Harris is often cast in dark and disturbing roles and this is no exception: his fierce, pained face is scared and scary at the same time, a realist Halloween mask of loneliness. He could be pretty much any age from 20 to 50. Philip is carrying a zip-up bag containing the film’s chief character: the one that gives the film its title. There are weird, hallucinatory scenes, glimpses of the future or the past, or possibly a delusional and imaginary present, in which Philip goes to secluded woodland, places the bag in an occult nexus of tree trunks and unzips it. Something deeply horrible with a worrying number of legs stirs within.Philip trudges to a squalid and dilapidated house, evidently his childhood home. Everywhere is tatty and filthy. The row of hooks by the front door has a school satchel and also a skipping rope. (Whose was that?) Yet the house is far from unoccupied. Philip’s ghastly Uncle Maurice is in residence, played with relish by Alun Armstrong, a greasy, unshaven, lairy beast of a man, and someone who was witness to all the unhappiness and bullying that Philip experienced as a child.Crucially, Maurice is a former puppeteer, and seems to have imparted some of his skill in puppetry to his glowering nephew. “Puppetry’s the one thing you were good at …” he drawls in a fenland accent. And the thing in Philip’s bag does seem to be a creation of this sort. Or is it? Soon after Philip arrives, the local press has news of a 14-year-old boy’s disappearance. Maurice wonders whether Philip has something to do with it. Philip wonders if the thing in his bag has something to do with it.Holness has shrewdly discovered some wonderfully deserted East Anglian locations for this film, lending scenes an almost post-apocalyptic quality. There are disused rail lines, crumbling bridges, huge flat marshes. These places are radioactive with weirdness. There are also disused military buildings that loom out of the soil like crashed UFOs. I loved the sheer banal grimness of Philip’s back garden, containing what looks like a plastic water butt on its side. At another stage, we visit an empty-looking railway station whose corridors have a green-and-gold colour scheme from an earlier age. Everything has that musty, gaseous English light.As for the sinister Possum, it is a very gruesome invention, which interestingly lives in Philip’s mind partly in the form of childhood rhymes that he has noted down in that well-known horror standby, the child’s obsessive scrapbook of creepy writings and drawings. Possum might have taken some inspiration here from The Babadook. However, something in me was hoping for a yet more sensational third-act performance from Possum, some more narrative progressions. After a sharp twist, Holness enigmatically breaks the story off. We are left with an oppressive ambient chill."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd4e3ec9aa703396e2c634b113392a05b3dcad4d/268_404_3578_2147/master/3578.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=890c9c2b3eeb409be6d34ba94eea4cbb","title":"instant noodles student recipes felicity cloake masterclass","story":"The classic student storecupboard staple is easy to upgrade into a properly satisfying supperCheap, filling and easy to prepare, instant noodles are the archetypal British student food, but in Asia they’re rightly acknowledged as the storecupboard stars they truly are: the perfect base for a quick and tasty dinner.

But they also make a great, protein-rich addition to any bowl of noodles. You can stick with basic fried, which always hits the spot, but if you have time, soy-marinated eggs are worth the (minimal) effort involved.Put the eggs in a pan of simmering water (I always make extra, because they keep for a couple of days in the fridge). Cook for seven minutes, then rinse under cold water to stop them cooking any further. Peel once cool. Mix the soy sauce and sugar in a small bowl, pop in the peeled eggs and leave to soak for at least an hour, turning occasionally.Asian food shops also stock a range of pickled and fermented vegetables (Korean kimchi is increasingly easy to find elsewhere). But you can make a quick version yourself by chopping vegetables into matchsticks and tossing them in vinegar seasoned with salt and sugar. They’re ready to eat at once, but will also keep in the fridge for a few days.To make your own chilli sauce, should you so desire, mash the chilli, garlic and sugar to a paste in a mortar – or use a hand blender to whizz them to a puree. Stir in the other ingredients, then taste, adding more sugar, vinegar or soy if you think it needs it. Alternatively, just use your favourite brand instead.Make the broth according to the instructions, then taste. Most are delicious, but if yours seems underwhelming, put it in a pan with a little more water and any or all flavour enhancers at the bottom of the ingredients list. Simmer gently for five minutes, strain and taste again. A spoonful of miso paste, and a dash of fish sauce, lime juice or chilli sauce at the end, are good, too.Once you’re happy with your broth, cook the noodles in it as the packet suggests. At the same time, you might want to add a few very thin slices of steak, fish, seafood or tofu. Alternatively, arrange leftover cooked meat on top just before serving – or, for a Hong Kong feel, fry a slice of spam in a little vegetable oil until golden brown instead.Noodles are a good home for any odds and ends of veg you have hanging around, too: stir a handful of baby leaves, courgette ribbons or tiny cauliflower or broccoli florets into the hot broth to wilt. Or add raw grated carrot, thinly sliced pepper or radish to the finished bowl for extra crunch. Cooked frozen peas and beans also work well.To finish, cut the eggs in half lengthways and arrange on top of the noodles and broth with any meat, fish, tofu or veg you’ve added. Slice the spring onion (both white and green parts) on a diagonal, and roughly chop the peanuts, if using. Use to garnish the noodles, and add a handful of chopped coriander. Serve with chilli sauce on the side."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5dfd59cb39be40556875e218ef504b90f6c0cb9/0_159_4351_2611/master/4351.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d559d5c9f57a6213722655983bd884d 620w","title":"manchester united shambolic investments lack grand design jose mourinho","story":"Jose Mourinho’s side were astonishingly passive against Juve but amid his post-match bluster there was the kernel of a pointThe problem with modern European football is how stratified it has become. With resources now ided so unequally, how, realistically, are the lesser sides in the group stage supposed to compete when playing the elite? Little wonder then, that plucky Manchester United, the poorest little richest club in the world, were so thoroughly outclassed by Juventus at Old Trafford on Tuesday.What’s a José Mourinho to do? As he pointed out post-match, Juventus have lots of good players. He spoked of “amazing Chiellini” and “amazing Bonucci”. That’s Giorgio Chiellini, bought for £4m in 2005, and Leonardo Bonucci, initially signed for £14m in 2010, although having been sold to Milan to for £37m in 2017, he was brought back in the summer as part of a swap deal for a notional value of £31m. That’s a net transfer cost of £12m for the pair. That’s an awful lot of bottles of You-C1000, even in the vibrant Indonesian isotonic drinks market. Little wonder United cannot compete, and are reduced to spending £60m on Victor Lindelöf and Eric Bailly.Or take Cristiano Ronaldo. For all the talk surrounding him and a return to United in the summer, there was no way that Ed Woodward was going to sanction a £103m deal for a 33-year-old. All the financial services in Kenya, Ghana, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Uganda and Tanzania conducted through AFB couldn’t pay for that. Although they did help pay for Romelu Lukaku, brought in for £75m plus a further potential £15m in add-ons, in 2017. Mourinho seems to have decided the Belgian is so valuable he’s not to be risked in match situations, and so stations him far away from the rest of the side, high up the pitch where he’s less likely to be involved in the actual action.Or there’s Rodrigo Bentancur, the clever, tough Uruguayan who controlled Tuesday’s game from the back of midfield. Brought in from Boca Juniors for £8m in 2017, he was never within United’s budget.Sbenu might sell a lot of casual footwear but South Koreans aren’t millipedes – they only have one pair of feet each. And so they were reduced to the bargain basement bucket of Paul Pogba, still the most expensive midfielder in the world at £89.3m.Absurd though Mourinho’s protestations that United cannot compete might have been, though, beneath his bluster there is the kernel of a point. As he wagged three fingers in the vague direction of the Juventus fans, you wondered exactly what point he was making. Mourinho has a lot of three-fingered gestures. Was he reminding them of the three trophies he won (if you count the Community Shield – and he does) in his first season at Old Trafford, or of the three league titles he won at Chelsea, or of the treble he won as Inter manager? Or was he reminding everybody that United only signed three players in the summer – Fred, Diogo Dalot and Lee Grant – none of whom played against Juventus?But the point, really, is less the lack of investment last summer, unhelpful though that undoubtedly was, and large though that fact clearly looms in Mourinho’s mind. It is the shambolically bad investment since Sir Alex Ferguson left the club in 2013. Old Trafford has been allowed to fall shabby, something that is as true of the scouting as it is of the facilities for fans as it is of the wifi (as Paul Pogba found to his cost during the defeat to Derby) as it is of the squad.It’s not necessarily the amount that’s been spent as where it’s been spent. What’s the philosophy behind this squad? There are expensive bits here and there, the occasional eccentric extension, but no grand design behind it. In his third season at the club, Mourinho must take some responsibility for that, but only some.Although it was only 1-0, Juve could easily have been two or three up before United, forced, as they had been against Newcastle and Chelsea, to chase the game, finally began to pose at least some threat. Perhaps to play with that level of purpose from the start would leave them too ragged over a full 90 minutes, but the current tentativeness isn’t working either.And sooner or later that is going to have an impact on the one aspect of the club that is going well. How long, after all, will the customers of Banif Bank in Malta or BIDV in Vietnam be happy to do their business in the name of a team that has won only one of its last seven games?

These five routes are perfect for those looking to take on longer rides at a gentler paceMore and more people are rediscovering cycling as a gentle way to exercise and explore new places on their own steam. Cycling lets us experience our surroundings in new ways – from the sights and smells we might miss in the car, to the simple pleasure of feeling the wind in our hair. It’s also something just about anyone can enjoy: cycling is non-weight bearing, and for many people it’s easier than walking. There are also bikes to suit most needs. With some great, flat, traffic-free or low-traffic routes across the UK that you can enjoy at a gentle pace, inspiration and adventure are just around the corner.Distance: 18 milesStart: PadstowEnd: Wenford BridgeTime taken to cycle: one-and-a-half to two hours without stopsThe Camel Trail is one of the UK’s best-loved cycle trails, not least with families, for its beautiful waterside scenery and wealth of wildlife. From picturesque Padstow it follows the Camel estuary’s shore, a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and home to little egrets, peregrines, ospreys and kingfishers. The delightful riveted Little Petherick creek bridge once served the former railway line. After an on-road section through Wadebridge it wends through wooded country beside the River Camel, past Bodmin, before briefly skirting Bodmin Moor, to Wenford Bridge.Pit stopTreats on Trikes is a traditional tea, cake and ice cream vendor on a tricycle, midway between Padstow and Wadebridge, at Penquean quarry.Distance: 13 milesStart: Sirhowy valley country parkEnd: Taff Bargoed parkTime to cycle: one to one-and-a-half hours without stopsExplore three south Wales valleys parks by bike. Starting at Sirhowy valley country park, north-west of Newport, you’ll follow a former railway line over the listed Hengoed viaduct, with its 16 towering arches, and past the Wheel o Drams, an 8-metre tall circular sculpture of mining carts. Penallta country park once housed the deepest pit in the south Wales coalfields, and now features viewpoints, wetlands, and the UK’s largest earth sculpture – Sultan the Pit Pony (above, top left). You’ll finish in Taff Bargoed park, once three pits, and now a wildlife haven perfect for a riverside picnic.

Cafe on the Rock, the Old Drift Mine, Trelewis, Treharris.Distance: 10.6 miles Start: Aberdeen station End: DrumoakTime to cycle: one to one-and-a-half hours, at a leisurely paceThe Deeside Way in its entirety follows a former railway line from Aberdeen to Ballater, of which this is a 10-mile, largely traffic-free section. Start at the Polmuir Road entrance of Aberdeen’s Duthie park, behind the Winter Gardens. One of the largest indoor gardens in Europe, it is well worth a visit, with rare plants from around the world, and the tantalising “corridor of perfumes”.Follow the leafy path past homes and parkland, and under tree canopies towards Peterculter. You’ll join a quiet country road at Coalford keep on the path until you reach an access road leading to Drumoak. There are three former stations en route, as well as the Peterculter Heritage Centre and, a short distance from the Deeside Way at Drumoak, the 13th-century Drum Castle.

The popular route, in the heart of the Peak District, is steeped in geological, industrial and rail heritage. There are six rail tunnels, four of which are around 400-metres long and lit during the day, as well as excellent views from Monsal, Headstone and Miller’s viaducts. From Blackwell Mill, just south of Buxton, head east through enchanting Chee Dale, in the Upper Wye valley. The lime kilns at Millers Dale station are imposing, fortress-like structures, cut into the rock face.Pit stop Hassop Station Cafe is in an old station building on the trail, complete with sun terrace.

From candle-lit and calming to high-powered and heated, there’s a school of stretch out there for everyoneAt its most refined, yoga means union or connection. Practically: connecting the body and breath, moving through and holding specific positions for physical and mental wellbeing.Of course, there’s a bit more to it than that, and a head-scratching breadth of different styles – each with its own approach. Some are centred on improving strength, stamina and flexibility. Some on addressing injuries and aches. Some are all about stilling the mind, or seeking spirituality. Some help you work up a sweat, or contort into a half-man-half-pretzel. Some offer all of the above. Here’s what the most popular styles promise.Note: most classes are signposted by level (all levels, level 1beginner and so on). These signposts are your friends – they’re the difference between practising happily and pulling a hamstring. Namaste.Acroyoga Best for those comfortable with personal contact (and gravity-defying leaps of faith), acroyoga is a playful acrobatics-meets-yoga style that puts you into pairs for a series of balance and bodyweight exercises. Fun and fairly vigorous, it aids (and asks for) concentration, strength and a bit of derring-do – the (infinitely Instagrammable) poster posture is “flying”.See also: aerial yoga. Another modern school that sees you contorting around silken (reinforced) scarves suspended from the ceiling. Ideal if you want adventure and personal space.AshtangaOne of the more traditional, commonly practised styles, ashtanga involves moving fluidly (flowing) through a set series of standing and floor postures, repeating sequences that link the breath to movement. A strong, mid-pace style anchored by deep, controlled breathing: think sun salutations – and lots of them. Great for strength and a good stretch.See also: mysore. Same principles, but you follow your own pace and breath.HathaThe mother of all yoga, hatha is the umbrella term for all physical yoga postures (asanas) and the base of most styles. The hatha you’re likely to meet tends not to flow, instead focusing on nailing the fundamental poses and technique. Great for those looking to learn the postures or avoid excessive movement – but don’t think the slower pace equals ease this is a strong style.IyengarIyengar is hatha and then some: a slow-paced, perfectionist’s class that’s all about precision and mastering correct body alignment – then holding it. Rather than settling for poor positioning, props such as belts and blocks are used to help align your body. Although challenging and disciplined, this is an excellent entry point style, providing a solid basis for poses while building balance, body awareness, strength and flexibility.JivamuktiA modern, vigorous yoga grounded in hatha flow that builds in chanting, readings, music and maximum joy – if that’s what you’re into (which half of Hollywood is).KundaliniAn intense, spiritual style with meditation and breathing techniques interwoven into postures, aimed at unblocking the chakras.Power High-intensity power yoga follows the flowing style of ashtanga or vinyasa but at a much punchier speed, helping yogis get a sweat on and a serious workout in. Practised at bikram-level heats and room temp, the athletic style is great for strength and endurance, but less advisable for anyone unfamiliar with basic poses.See also: rocket. Another hardcore, high-powered and fast-paced style, rocket yoga stems from ashtanga’s poses. It was devised by the Grateful Dead’s personal yoga teacher, and so-named “because it gets you there faster”.Restorative The one to look out for if you’re injured (or apprehensive). Restorative yoga focuses on a mindful, measured style for minimum strain on the body and maximum respect for its limitations. Deeply relaxing, the simple, healing poses are held for longer than other styles, supported by iyengar-type props.VinyasaA close relative of ashtanga, vinyasa is the broad term for uninterrupted, flowing movement between poses, guided by the breath (breathe in, move that there breathe out, move this here). As such, it’s a dynamic style, quite aerobic, giving a good workout and stretch, but also providing a moving meditation and a nice overview, as teachers explain each pose and transition.YinA slow-paced, meditative yoga with roots in China. Poses are held for extended periods and intended to avoid putting stress on the body. Usually passive and seated, yin leaves muscles relaxed, as gravity and time deepen the stretch. A healing and releasing style (candlelit yin yoga is so meditative it’s sedative-like)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/961b2d7870f1d69aa1d0172adc5aae5ab5b6fedf/120_339_2769_1661/master/2769.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b13365f3c7a854b7c31290ea25c401a","title":"aint no mountain fair enough how urban hiking can change the way you see your city","story":"Yes, most cities are peak-free zones, but you can still find challenging hiking conditions – all without a trip to the countryUrban hiking might sound like an oxymoron, but it’s actually a thing. There are plenty of maps, blogs and guided tours cropping up online (more about that below).So what is urban hiking? Well, it’s exactly what it says on the tin: taking on a challenging walk – perhaps at pace – in city and town settings, often with a view to racking up some considerable elevation. Much like a bracing country hike in the Peaks, Alps or Highlands, climbs and descents (either via hills or staircases) are something to be enjoyed and attacked, rather than endured.The appeal of urban hiking is obvious. It’s a great way for city folk to get more exercise without any fancy equipment, it’s a sport that enables locals to discover more about the history and background of where they live and it’s a handy way for older people to get active and to socialise. Best of all? It’s pretty much cost-free.Many of us love to ramble on a weekend away, so it’s odd that when we return to our urban lives we forget how to use our legs, hopping on the bus or tube rather than stretching our limbs. Urban hiking reverses this trend and makes sport of tackling lanes, mews and markets along the way. It can be educational too – lots of guides and maps encourage urban hikers to take in local landmarks and buildings, with notes describing their connections to the history of the area.There are plenty of ways to get involved, too. People living in towns and larger cities can simply look up walking tours aimed at tourists and join these organised treks and hikes. After all, they’re not just designed for the enjoyment of people who are new to the area. Be warned though, if you want to cover a considerable distance you’d be better off striking out alone. Urban walking tours aimed at visitors are often more focused on cramming lots of sites into shorter strolls and focusing on a particular theme or period in history, rather than packing in the miles (or hills).To take to the streets without assistance, you need a bit of preparation. But not much. Armed with a smartphone with a map app and a destination punched in, you should be fine. While a bit of pre-hike research will put you in better stead, you can easily find pre-made routes and loops online to suit your desired distance (and your appetite for hills). The website of walking charity Ramblers has plenty of maps and resources for newcomers and, once you’ve signed up for its free membership, you can get stuck into the in-depth routes and guides. You can also plot your own routes on websites such as Mapometer, which allow you to easily create maps to follow and share.One of the benefits of urban hiking is how little gear you need beyond the basics (and a bit of common sense). It’s sensible to take a small bag with essentials such as water, a sugary snack, such as an energy bar or flapjack, and a light rain jacket. If your phone’s battery is poor, it’s worth packing a back-up or charger, just in case.But beyond that, try not to weigh yourself down – you’re likely to never be too far from a shop, cafe or pub, so cut yourself loose from lugging too much garb. Oh, but don’t forget a box of plasters to treat any sore feet.Thankfully there aren’t any strict rules to adhere to when urban hiking (beyond those you’d normally comply with as a pedestrian), however, one tip is to not use the same road twice along a route. Or to put it another way, you should always aim to cover new ground and not double-back on your previous, outward passage.Other than that, you’re set. What are you waiting for? Pack your bag, pull on some comfy trainers, find a route and hit the streets. There’s a world of stairs to climb out there – last one to the top buys the ice-cream, beers or prosecco!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/78246b97099de57467d629fada08157b093f4413/0_72_5742_3446/master/5742.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b829b4fb8dfa1942377f2930a872f23b","title":"hairdressing techno making living worlds largest refugee camp in pictures","story":"In the Bidi Bidi settlement in north-west Uganda, refugees and locals are coming up with new ways to support themselves.

She talks about the real women behind the southern stereotypesIt is morning in New Orleans and Beth Ditto is getting ready for the day: plucking her chin hairs as she speaks to me over the phone, while picking out a black dress light enough for the heavy southern heat.She is in Louisiana for several months, working as an actor. Best known for the 17 years she spent as frontwoman of the band Gossip, and for 2017’s solo record Fake Sugar, her second major acting role – the one she is now filming – is in Kirsten Dunst’s new series, On Becoming a God in Central Florida. Her first reaches the UK this week, a supporting role in Gus Van Sant’s Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get Far on Foot.The Van Sant film is an adaptation of the memoir of the cartoonist John Callahan, who became quadriplegic at 21, after a day spent drinking ended in a car accident. Ditto plays Reba, a fulsome, enlightening redneck woman Callahan (Joaquin Phoenix) meets through Alcoholics Anonymous. The role of Reba has extra power in the current political climate. Ditto plays her with the full bloom of her own rural Arkansas accent, aware of many preconceptions about southern redneck culture. Even in the audition, she felt a fierce connection to the part: “She makes me think of my aunt Jannie and my aunt Linda Gail,” she says. “The description had said ‘redneck loud woman’ and I was like: ‘Oh! I was related to all those women. I can do this!’”Van Sant encouraged her contributions to the role and the script. “There’s a part where I tell the story of a titty rock, and that story really happened,” she says. (Her aunt Jannie carried a rock to use in fights with other women.) “That story is a real story from my childhood! He kept wanting to hear stories about my aunts, and one day when we were filming, he said: ‘Would you tell the story about the titty rock?’ And I said: ‘You got it!’” She laughs. “I think he liked it because it was real. I mean, it wasn’t really acting. That’s the thing, I don’t think I can act. I think I’m just really good at talking.”“The redneck women that I knew, I think people don’t see,” she continues. “They had this very butch side to them, which is very interesting in itself. And then there’s this gentle side to them that gives them empathy, that comes from putting up with the men’s shit their whole lives, from the lack of education, working hard, raising the children that the men left behind, just dealing with reality. I feel like all of my friends would say the same – that the men who were rednecks, they were the problems, but these rough-and-tumble ladies, they were the saving grace.”Many of those women are gone now – her aunt Linda Gail died earlier this year. The women of her childhood, who she remembers with their “flat-tops and slicked-back hair”, who were “domestic abuse and rape survivors”, are harder to find these days. But they are the ones she still feels attached to. “All of my family are Democrats,” she says. “My aunt Jannie and my aunt Linda Gail were avid lovers of people. My aunt Jannie specifically was very, very knowledgable about politics and she was very anti-Republican and very vocally anti-racist and anti-sexist, but at the same time she was in this relationship that was toxic and she’d been in it since she was a 14-year-old girl.”She is impassioned now. “There was all this beautiful empathy that comes along with redneck women that people don’t really see because they don’t live it,” she says. “Because there’s a stereotype and because they’re physically associated with a lot of really fucked-up movements. But at the same time, a lot of their physical characteristics have to do with poverty, with how they dress, their teeth … but poverty can come from putting your children first. It’s really interesting. So to me, it didn’t feel I was playing this person who was full of bullshit, but more that I was giving a perspective on redneck women that people don’t really see all the time.”When Gossip first found success in 2006, Ditto was a glorious shock to the mainstream: a voice like a juggernaut, 5ft 1in (1.55 metres) and 15st (95kg), queer, feminist, an advocate for body positivity who lived in Portland’s liberal bubble but hailed from Arkansas, where she was born in a trailer park and grew up with six siblings.The band’s breakthrough came with the single Standing in the Way of Control, which was first released in 2005 and reached No 7 in the UK charts two years later. Then it was a juddering call to arms, written in response to the federal marriage amendment that would have outlawed same-sex marriage in the US. Today the song has acquired a new weight, a resistant force to the many looming infringements to human rights brought about by the Trump administration.Ditto feels the new force of the song too. Around the time of Trump’s election, she was asked to play at a party for the designer Stella McCartney. In the weeks leading up to the event, McCartney’s team suggested she play Standing in the Way of Control, and Ditto declined. “Not because I don’t want to,” she laughs, “I’m a people-pleaser, I’d much rather give people what they want. That’s the difference between me and an artist – I would much rather make you happy. But I said: ‘I don’t feel like it’s going to be very relevant.’” Then the election happened. “And I thought, now that song is more relevant than ever. And that’s what blows my mind. Now it’s just really fucking weird.”The peculiar thing she noticed as she toured Fake Sugar over the past year was that, wherever she played, she always seemed to be in the wrong city to attend a march or a protest rally, “and so you feel detached from your real community and the people it’s going to affect”, she says. The exception was that on the evening of the Brett Kavanaugh hearing, she happened to find herself in Washington DC to play a show with Florence + the Machine. “It was so sweet,” she says, “because Florence said: ‘We’ll smash the patriarchy!’” She gives a rueful laugh. “There was still hope.”She has a strange relationship with Arkansas now. A few years ago, Nathan Howdeshell, one of Gossip’s founding members and one of her closest friends, returned to the state, set up home and found God again. Ditto still sounds stunned as she talks about it. “I think it’s partly straight white male privilege to be able to move back in the pursuit of happiness,” she says. “I could never do that and feel happy and fulfilled and feel my truest self. He can.” She does not talk to him about it. “I kind of see him as a distant family member now. I’ll see him at Thanksgiving and not bring things up, keep things on very surface topics. And it’s painful.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/964833052bf6f6be8430d3be4eacb0768a8b9291/355_505_3290_1974/master/3290.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=868f9610a04f4b419fcd8af20b012849","title":"ben hur royal opera house ring cycle rollercoaster brindley sherratt wagner","story":"It lasts 15 hours, has nearly 200 performers, and needs 340 props – including a crashed jet fighter. The bass singing Fafner in the Royal Opera House’s Ring Cycle tells audiences: go to the loo firstI have sung a fair few notes in lots of places, but I am a relative newcomer to Wagner’s vast Ring Cycle. This autumn, I’m singing in my first fully staged production – playing the wily old giantbuilderdragon Fafner at the Royal Opera House in London.The Ring has always been on my bucket list so I’m more than a little excited. Obviously I’ve tried to look cool and seasoned but in reality I’ve spent most of the rehearsals reminding myself to breathe in and out – because almost everything about this piece is epic.“Wagner’s vast Ring Cycle,” wrote Gustav Kobbé in The Complete Opera Book, “may or may not be the greatest event inside the form known as opera, but it is certainly the grandest.” He wasn’t wrong. A cycle of four operas totalling at least 15 hours and usually performed in the space of a week, the Ring is the Iron Man challenge of opera.It’s also the Ben Hur: this production involves hundreds of people both on, off, over and under the stage, with huge sets that do amazing twisty turny things and require huge amounts of space. Usually, the two vast rehearsal studios at the ROH are used to rehearse different operas, but with the Ring both spaces are used all the time, seven days a week, with conductor Tony Pappano and director Keith Warner hotfooting between the two.Let’s look at the shopping list. We have over 340 props (160 in the Siegfried cycle alone) ranging from a full-sized (crashed) fighter plane to an eight-metre-long sofa, not to mention several golden apples, a skinned toad and a plethora of wigs and prosthetics – including a hugely enlarged head for yours truly.Fafner is the “brains” of the two brother giants. My grisly swollen head takes over an hour to fit. It is glued in place and then the little veins are painted on. After a while it becomes quite heavy so I have a permanently stiff neck. It has a strange muffling effect on the sound of my voice in my head, akin to singing into a pillow.What about the performers? There are 31 principal singers, 77 in the chorus, 22 actors, 42 children (with chaperones), and three actors to operate the dragon. The orchestral players do alternate somewhat but there are 107 of them involved both in the orchestra pit and off stage including seven harpists (that’s a lot of space) a contrabass trombone (a lot of pipework), a bass trumpet (a small, accessorised trombone), five steerhorns for the Götterdämmerung part and 12 separate percussionists to whack, in triple time, the 12 anvils that are specifically tuned to F.The tickets for all 16 performances of this production were sold by the end of the first day, almost a year ago. It seems that rumours of horned helmets (there are none) and numb bottoms have not dimmed the Ring’s appeal. Yes, it is long, but that should perhaps not be such a hurdle, certainly to today’s younger audience members, most of whom will have binge-watched box sets or – like my son and his mates – watched the complete and very Wagnerian Lord of the Rings epics in one sitting.Some of the Ring’s audience, I know, are fascinated with the deeper themes of Norse mythology. Some just have it on their bucket list. But many will be drawn by the incredible music that fills theatres time and again. It really is overwhelming: 15 hours in this sound world will change your life.Probably our greatest British Wagnerian singer, Sir John Tomlinson, once said to me that a Wagner singer is a happy singer. This is interesting, as it’s fair to say that not many of Wagner’s characters are particularly balanced or chirpy. But I think I know what John means. Both music and text offer the singer so many opportunities to create something new and vivid – and that is fun and immensely rewarding. Also, the Ring is a team sport, all of the roles being important to the drama. It isn’t like much grand Italian opera, where the singers (and perhaps the audience) are often preoccupied with the big famous aria with the big famous (career-altering) high note.Of course, there are several more famous moments in the Ring that give the singer something to worry about – like Wotan’s taxing farewell at the end of Die Walküre or the high C at the end of Siegfried that he and Brünnhilde have to dig out when they’ve done quite enough singing – but it’s about the long game. Singing these larger roles is a marathon, definitely not a sprint, and this particular team are among the best in the world. The stamina and shove required for these Herculean roles is simply staggering. Watching the big duets from my seat in the wings is like being courtside for a Nadal v Federer five-setter. There are very few people in the world that can actually get through the ridiculously demanding tenor role of Siegfried and still be able to speak. His relentless “forging song” at the end of Act 1 is a tour-de-force of vocal strength. And that’s just Act 1 – he still has hours to go.As I’m beheaded about two hours into Siegfried, I get the chance to sit in the wings and actually natter with Siegfried and Brünnhilde before they saunter back on stage to create the exhausting magic of the final scene. Incidentally, if you could spend time backstage during a performance, you would be surprised how calm and business-like it is. I remember discussing home improvements with a colleague. He had laid the bricks for his new conservatory and I had been sanding floors. On another occasion, I was able to recommend a particular lawnmower deal at B\u0026ampQ to a fellow cast member just before the triumphal scene of Verdi’s Aida.My most recent “wings” topic – with Wotan and Alberich – was about growing your own vegetables. However, when we eventually lined up on stage for the bows, the warm tidal wave of applause was overwhelming, with over 2,000 people wanting to show us how much they appreciated what we had done.Get to the Ring. Dig out the Deep Heat. Take along a cushion. And do go to the loo before Rheingold.• At the Royal Opera House, London, until 2 November"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6986f903109f80316d992751ceeecbd96934a5ea/0_0_2317_1391/master/2317.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=426c06f11480b42c75b67b2a7b8c5600","title":"cd r generation z","story":"A young Twitter user caused consternation when she revealed she didn’t know how to burn songs on to a CD. It’s another moment where technology announces one’s mortalityI am no music format fetishist. If I ever read another piece about the warmth of vinyl, it will be too soon. Cassette Store Day is a scam. Even my local charity shop won’t take promo CDs, and I am long past the age where coasters and wind chimes made from CDs constitute appropriate homeware.But a recent viral tweet made me nostalgic for my teenage music consumption habits while also shining a stark light on the absurdity of all format nostalgia. “Maybe its the generation Z in me, but how did people burn CDs?” tweeted 17-year-old Alyssa this weekend. “Like, how did you just get a blank CD and put songs on it?” A fair question – which almost 2,000 people answered with varying degrees of detail and disgust.Songs are intangible: while there are valid arguments about streaming decreasing its perceived worth, music arriving seamlessly down a digital pipe is perhaps the medium’s most logical manifestation. Like the weather, it is just there. And so the laborious process of putting music on a CD – to play on a home stereo (in decline), a car (in decline), a cumbersome Discman (practically a collectors’ item), or as a mixtape to charm a potential sweetheart (replaced by Spotify playlists) – seems antediluvian to a generation that has never had to bother with it.Think about it: a stack of CD-Rs – single-use, easily scratched and lost – arrived on a kind of spindly plastic top hat. Like the top hat, said to have caused a riot when haberdasher John Hetherington first wore it in public in January 1797, the CD-R caused mass consternation in the music industry. If cassettes and home taping (recall how it “killed music”) were a way of making a barely audible version of your mate’s My Bloody Valentine album or some John Peel curios, then the CD-R was a way to create an identical copy of almost identical quality, a bit like the Star Trek replicator – and almost as big, though less reliable when the burner drive failed and the CD got stuck spinning in a hot, angry vortex. You borrowed friends’ CDs, copied every CD from the local library or stole music off a swashbuckling site called the Pirate Bay. Then you carried them around in a bulky wallet in case you urgently needed a change of soundtrack on the bus ride home.For a certain strain of entrepreneurial pirate, CD-Rs were a licence to print money. And boy, did they see me coming. Growing up in Cornwall in the early 2000s, I didn’t have broadband access until I was 16. My allotted 15 weekly minutes online prior to that was barely long enough to pirate a single track, let alone all the Libertines bootlegs I wanted. So I turned to eBay, spending my waitress’s wages on ripped copies of The 77 Demos, Babyshambles’ Chicken Shack Sessions and Pete Doherty’s Whitechapel Demonstrations, which took on a sentimental value far greater than the approximate 7p cost of the CD, label and plastic wallet. For a brief, naive period in 2004, I believed I had acquired the actual copy of Danger Mouse’s Grey Album bootleg off eBay. At £16 – top hat doffed to that unscrupulous seller – it probably should have been.I had just started working in what could charitably be called a failing record shop (even the staff would take CDs home to burn them, then bring them back). While fewer and fewer people were coming in to buy CDs, we did do a roaring charity in under-the-counter CD-R bootlegs of Arctic Monkeys’ Beneath the Boardwalk demos for other local fans foiled by Cornwall’s derisory dial-up speeds. We did the same, though less successfully, for Maximo Park a year or two later. I soon saved my record shop earnings to buy an iPod, one of the gadgets that was putting us out of business.It all feels so silly, funny and slightly sad to look back on. I don’t miss it: the bulk, the scratches, the ease with which your little brother could snap a beloved mixtape in two. I don’t believe that physical engagement with media makes you cherish it more – if at 15 I could have ripped streams, today’s most popular form of piracy, I’d be in faster than you could say “jewel case packaging”. “This is such a wild concept to me, I feel so young,” Alyssa replied to one patient CD-R explainer. The wild concept for me is the banal fate of every generation: to watch their youth pile up in landfill."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4fc2a1997bd3bd9fd395407c86bf262fd3944c00/0_0_3500_2333/master/3500.jpg?width=300\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=938a9c6f6c9bb74d5a859f86ace107f1","title":"long serving meps eligible transition payments european parliament uk","story":"UK’s 73 European parliament members told they must clear offices by 29 March 2019British MEPs have been given details of transition payments that could see the longest-serving eligible for six-figure sums, as well as instructions on clearing their offices before Brexit day.The UK’s 73 members of the European parliament received confirmation on Tuesday that those under pensionable age would be entitled to claim the allowance after 29 March 2019.All MEPs are entitled to a transition allowance linked to their length of service in the parliament to bridge their move into a new job. MEPs who have served one term could get a maximum pre-tax payment of €50,900 (£44,930), while an MEP in office since 1999 could receive €169,680 before tax.MEPs at the EU retirement age of 63 are not entitled to the transition payment, as they move straight on to pensions. MEPs are expected to inform the parliament and give up the transition payments once they have new jobs.One parliament source described the discussion as “a technical, logistical meeting... not a noses-in-troughs meeting”. It was attended by 30 to 40 MEPs from across the UK political spectrum.With 157 days to go until Brexit, MEPs were told they had to clear their offices in Brussels and Strasbourg before 29 March, and hand in their EU passes, voting cards and any parliament laptops and iPads. British MEPs are leaving the parliament nearly three months before the official end of their mandate in June because Brexit day falls before European elections between 23 and 26 May 2019.British MEPs’ assistants in Brussels will receive the equivalent of one month’s salary and a resettlement allowance. To help to wind down their work, British MEPs will get a reduced office allowance of €6,624 between April and June.

Asked what advice he would have for an MP thinking of sending such a letter, he said:Don’t - it would be seen as an act of inward-looking self-indulgence by people out there who know we are at am important stage of the negotiations. This is exactly the wrong time to be doing these kind of things.Asked if he thought it was too late for rebel Conservatives to seek a change of Brexit plan from May, Green, who was sacked as first secretary of state in December after admitting he lied about pornographic images on his House of Commons computer, was equally blunt:May would answer questions from MPs at the 1922 meeting and make a speech, Green said, predicting the event would be less dramatic than predicted in reports at the weekend:Experience tells me that these big events that are billed as the great showdown often turn into something of a damp squib.It’s a good chance for her to explain where we’ve got to on the negotiations, but I suspect it will be less dramatic than some have been portraying it earlier in the week.We all knew that the Brexit negotiations would get more difficult the closer to the end we got, because inevitably you leave the most difficult parts to the end of any negotiation, and we are now at that phase.New from my colleague, Jamie Grierson: Labour has said it would change rules preventing asylum seekers from working in the UK before their case is finalised.A long-term plan to reduce the size of the House of Lords by about a quarter to 600 members is exceeding its targets, the committee in charge of the operation has said, with 42 departures from the chamber so far.In all, 36 peers left in the first year of the programme, against a target of 31. The one way most peers tended to leave the house was by dying, but new rules came into force in 2014 making it easier for them to retire when they are no longer able to attend or want to concentrate on other matters.When peers go, new ones can only be appointed on a “two in, one out” system, with the parties contributing in accordance with their current proportion of members.Lord Fowler, the Lord Speaker, said it was a “pleasing result” and that he hoped to see more progress.More than half of Tory supporters do not back Theresa May’s ability to strike a good deal on Brexit, a poll has indicated.Gideon Skinner, head of political research at Ipsos MORI, said: “2018 has seen falling public satisfaction in the prime minister, her government and rising economic pessimism, and as the Brexit negotiations intensify confidence in Theresa May’s ability to get a good deal has fallen even further to a new low. “And yet the public don’t put all the blame at her door - and nor is there much evidence that they would have much more confidence in anyone else.” Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said that no-deal on Brexit may be the most likely outcome, which is “deeply concerning”.The SNP leader added that Brexit is shaping up to be the “biggest failure of government policy and handling of a situation that any of us have ever seen perhaps in our entire lifetimes.”Sturgeon said that with almost every day that passes, instead of the UK government opening up negotiating space that increases the possibility of reaching a deal, “they seem to be closing down that negotiating space and digging themselves deeper into the hole they’ve got themselves in.”She added: “As things stand just now I think no deal may actually be the most likely outcome, and that is deeply concerning.”The SNP leader said given that we are two years on from the vote, five months away from exit, it is “staggering incompetence” that the government has allowed the situation to get to this stage. Nigel Farage has denounced the UK’s Brexit negotiation team as “the enemy within”, warning that Britain faces humiliation unless Theresa May is removed as prime minister.The former Ukip leader, who remains an MEP, made the comments to the European Parliament as May prepares to face Conservative MPs amid growing unrest over her Brexit plans.The number of Tory MPs publicly committed to oppose her Chequers blueprint for leaving the European Union has now reached 50. The prime minister will meet critics at the backbench 1922 Committee in Parliament just days after one anonymous opponent suggested she should “bring her own noose” to the gathering. Home Secretary Sajid Javid said that the government condemns in the “strongest possible terms” the killing of Jamal Khashoggi.He added that there are serious concerns around the explanation around his death, given by the Saudi authorities. “With this in mind, I have decided to take action against those implicated in his death to prevent them from entering the UK,” he said.“We will always be thoughtful and considered in our response, but if the appalling stories are true, they are fundamentally incompatible with our values.”Earlier at prime minister’s questions, Theresa May waved around a book on economics edited by John McDonnell, Economics for the Many, saying it included an essay which concluded that Labour’s spending plans did not add up.Since then, Simon Wren-Lewis, an Oxford university professor of economics. has tweeted to say he believes he was the author being referred to by May – and that she got it wrong.PMQs - Verdict from Twitter: The political journalists and pundits have had their say, and they seemed no more impressed than me by that exchange.Paul Waugh from Huffington Post:Joe Murphy, political editor of the Evening Standard, notes that May’s reception was more positive than you might guess from some of the lurid headlines at the weekend:Stephen Pollard, editor of the Jewish Chronicle:And an even less impressed Tom Peck, political sketchwriter for the Independent:Once PMQs is over the SNP MP Stewart Malcom McDonald makes a point of order, asking the Speaker, John Bercow, about the news – first reported in the Sun – that the anti-Islam activist Tommy Robinson, real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, dined in parliament yesterday following a hearing at the Old Bailey over alleged contempt of court.McDonald asks if Bercow can intervene to prevent Robinson, who McDonald calls “a man who is a guilty as he is of stirring up racial hatred”, being allowed back in parliament.Bercow says he agrees with McDonald’s assessment of Robinson, calling the founder of the English Defence League street group “a loathsome, obnoxious, repellent inidual”. But, Bercow adds, it is “outside of my remit” to dictate what happens in the Lords – Robinson was a guest of the Ukip peer Lord Pearson.Bercow advises the SNP MP to instead write to the Lord Speaker, Lord Fowler, and indicates he would be happy for McDonald to mention Bercow’s view."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/943af9ea26e4f7b4c6c109213453eba346301b34/130_0_3340_2004/master/3340.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4a0b8dbb404ffa99c2b705185ed838a","title":"astronomy photographer of the year 2018 the winning images","story":"The US photographer Brad Goldpaint has beaten thousands of amateur and professional photographers from around the globe to win the Royal Observatory Greenwich’s title of Insight Investment Astronomy Photographer of the Year 2018.

No shock, perhaps, that it found more people living below the breadline than previously thought, but a degree of curiosity that the chair of the “rigorously non-partisan” body was Philippa Stroud: Tory peer, ex-adviser to the former work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith, and champion of controversial welfare reforms that many consider to be fuelling Britain’s poverty epidemic.Stroud, a former homelessness charity worker, worked closely with Duncan Smith at the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) from 2010 to 2015. While there, she helped to launch universal credit, the centrepiece of a thick bundle of reforms pushed out as billions were stripped from the social security budget. “The reason I went into government was to introduce universal credit,” she says. There were cuts to disability benefits the benefit cap was introduced in came the bedroom tax, the two-child benefits limit, and the benefit freeze. Labour’s child poverty targets were acrimoniously abolished amid accusations that ministers were trying to avoid scrutiny of the impact of austerity.She may not have been the most obvious choice as head of an independent, politically neutral inquiry into poverty. And yet the SMC report, thrashed out over more than two years by an eclectic and mainly expert group of commissioners, appears to have won over the sceptics. Its proposed measurement, offering a more sophisticated analysis of who is in poverty and how deeply, seems to have achieved a rare degree of political consensus. “The commissioners were quite honest with me. They said when we started out, ‘we weren’t sure whether to trust you or not’,” admits Stroud. We are in a light, airy basement room of the Legatum Institute, the rightwing thinktank she runs, which is based – somewhat incongruously given our subject matter – in an elegant Mayfair townhouse. “But as we went on this journey together and we really did grow in trust, we really grew to understand that everybody in the room felt as passionately about the lived experience of poverty.”The distrust stemmed not just from Stroud’s political career but from a deep ideological ide over the causes of poverty itself. While the left held that lack of financial resources was the crucial factor, for the right, poverty was driven by lived experience: family breakdown, educational failure, addiction and unemployment. Stroud says that when she was in Whitehall, both sides would privately admit the other had a point, but in public the debate about poverty measures was bitter and polarised. The commission was an attempt to cut through the impasse.“It was clear to me that if you could create a safe enough space where trust could grow, we would be able to have a really comprehensive conversation around the nature of very real poverty in the UK – and how you could capture and measure that,” says Stroud. “It just needed to be safe enough and slow enough to have that conversation.”The SMC concluded that poverty was about both resources and lived experience, although it points out that there is little data on the latter. Was this a compromise? “I don’t think anybody came out feeling they had compromised. I think we all came out feeling we had grown.”Stroud became a social activist almost by accident. As a student she expected to go into international banking. That changed dramatically when, after graduating in the mid 1980s, she volunteered for a charity working with drug addicts in Hong Kong. On her return to the UK, she set up and ran homelessness projects, an experience that was to lead her, by the turn of the century, to politics. “I started to realise that after 17 years ... I could literally give all my days to this and only have supported a handful of people. I started asking: ‘how do we start addressing the drivers of social breakdown on a national level?’”Stroud says she was not especially political at the time, although she admits she is “more naturally conservative” in outlook. Her experience on the poverty frontline was attractive to a Tory party seeking to detoxify its “nasty party” reputation and become more open to fresh thinking on social issues.Stroud set up the Centre for Social Justice thinktank with Duncan Smith in 2003. Out of that came the Breakdown Britain report (2006) – its picture of social decay was taken up enthusiastically by David Cameron – and Breakthrough Britain (2007), which challenged the left’s “simple fixation with a single ‘poverty line’” and paved the way, ultimately, for the bitter battles over child poverty measurements half a decade later.With peace now seemingly breaking out, Stroud’s vision is to make the SMC a kind of Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) for poverty: an authoritative organisation whose pronouncements will carry influence in Whitehall and in the media. In government she noticed that economic budget decisions would be informally stress-tested in a “what-would-the-IFS-say” way. “What I saw missing, says Stroud, “was the corresponding voice on the social policy side”.Stroud is reluctant to be drawn on the benefit cuts she helped oversee: “It is well-documented there were big battles behind the scenes.” It is no secret that Duncan Smith and the chancellor George Osborne did not get on. One story holds that Osborne foisted cuts on the DWP as the price of continuing with universal credit. Another is that Stroud fought bitter internal battles against huge cuts to personal independence payments for disabled people. She will only say that “you don’t get to choose the circumstances under which you do reform” – a veiled reference to austerity cuts – and that the chancellor taking the axe to £3bn of universal credit work allowances in the 2015 budget was the last straw: “The final set of cuts to universal credit in 2015 were not cuts that I supported.”On next week’s budget, Stroud is clear. She wants more money for mental health, and more investment in childcare for low-income families. But ultimately, she believes, universal credit must be properly funded: “The money that has been taken out of universal credit has caused the problems, but the structure of it is right. What it needs is some of that money back into it to make it the poverty-fighting tool that it might be.”• Patrick Butler is the ’s social policy editorFamily: Married with one son and twin daughters.Education: St Catherine’s school, Bramley University of Birmingham (BA French).Career: 2016-present: chief executive, Legatum Institute 2015–16: chief executive, Centre for Social Justice 2010–15: special adviser, Department of Work and Pensions 2004–10: founder and executive director, Centre for Social Justice 2001-04: executive director, Bridge Project, Birmingham 1989–96: founder, King’s Arms Project night shelter and hostel, Bedford 1987–89: voluntary work in Hong Kong and Macau among addict community.Public life: Made a life peer in 2015 stood as a parliamentary candidate in 2005 and 2010 general elections.Interests: Travel, film, theatre and brunch with her family."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16905b4faf21751c4e5af9a47ec1a58ca4fc8f4e/0_83_5200_3120/master/5200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d1837159965c84b7e3553acb4cb171a2","title":"spectacular diabetes treatment could end daily insulin injections","story":"Hour-long procedure that stabilises blood sugar levels of sufferers of type 2 diabetes is still effective one year on, study showsA potential medical breakthrough that could put an end to the daily insulin injections endured by people living with diabetes has been unveiled by Dutch scientists.By destroying the mucous membrane in the small intestine and causing a new one to develop, scientists stabilised the blood sugar levels of people with type 2 diabetes. The results have been described as “spectacular” – albeit unexpected – by the chief researchers involved.In the hourlong procedure, trialled on 50 patients in Amsterdam, a tube with a small balloon in its end is inserted through the mouth of the patient down to the small intestine.The balloon is inflated with hot water and the mucous membrane burned away by the heat. Within two weeks a new membrane develops, leading to an improvement in the patient’s health.Jacques Bergman, a professor of gastroenterology at Amsterdam UMC, said: “Because of this treatment the use of insulin can be postponed or perhaps prevented. That is promising.”Bergman added of the procedure that it was “amazing that people suffer very little from this”.He told the Dutch broadcaster Nederlandse Omroep Stichting: “With those people we see a spectacular improvement in blood sugar levels one day after the operation, before they even lose one kilo, which has put us on the track.“Because the question now is whether this is a permanent treatment, or whether it is something that you have to keep repeating – something that in theory should be possible. We looked at whether we could stop their insulin, which is still ongoing, but the first results are truly spectacular, with the lion’s share of patients no longer using insulin after this treatment.”The new discovery initially seems most suitable for borderline patients who already take pills but whose blood sugar level is high enough for doctors to advise that they inject insulin in the short term.Apart from dispensing with insulin injections, researchers claim that those treated could benefit from a lower risk of cardiovascular disease, kidney failure, blindness and numbness in the hands and feet.Scientists from Amsterdam UMC who presented their study at a conference in Vienna this week were said to be cautious but “jubilant” about the initial results.People with type 2 diabetes aged between 28 and 75 are now being recruited for a larger study of 100 people.Almost 3.7 million people in the UK live with a diagnosis of type 1 or 2 diabetes, an increase of 1.9 million since 1998. Type 1 diabetes is where the level of sugar in the blood is too high because the pancreas does not produce insulin.Those with type 2 diabetes are not producing enough insulin. The impact can be controlled by changes to diet, but it is a progressive disease. Most people will need to take tablets or inject insulin after living with it for five to 10 years.Nine out of 10 people diagnosed with diabetes have type 2. It is estimated that there are nearly 1 million people currently living with the condition who have yet to be diagnosed and that 12.3 million people are at an increased risk due high levels of sugar in their blood."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc7be4379eb8425f23a9009e6756b82af695fd90/205_943_2459_1475/master/2459.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=95c41feca16ccce5c9befd65bbfcfceb","title":"eoin morgan england sri lanka odi series cricket","story":"England’s ODI series against Sri Lanka brought a confident Adil Rashid, a football-related injury and one key lesson: don’t play in Sri Lanka in OctoberEoin Morgan began the tour by saying he would be prepared to drop himself during next summer’s World Cup if his form was flatlining.

But what it did do was demonstrate what the players have been saying for a while: when the ball is travelling to all parts, Morgan’s icy demeanour holds things together more often than not. In the sapping humidity, England lost their cool too easily and bickered away for what was their sloppiest fielding display for some time. Morgan’s stand-in, Jos Buttler, has stepped up well in the past. But having struggled a touch behind the stumps on tour, and gone into the match short of time at the crease, he could probably have done without it in this instance.While England already know their best World Cup batting group, a disappointment for Morgan and his head coach, Trevor Bayliss, was that none of the fringe seamers truly grabbed their chance. Conditions and lack of match action were factors, admittedly. But there are now just five ODIs remaining before the provisional squad is named on 23 April and beyond Chris Woakes (typically slick with the new ball) and Liam Plunkett (a favourite of Morgan, albeit rusty after his late arrival on tour) things are not much clearer. Tom Curran appears to relish tight situations but does he have enough quality up front? Olly Stone caught the eye with his pace but took one wicket in 16 overs and is light on experience, while Mark Wood and Sam Curran were both knocked about a bit during their one-off appearances. David Willey, ready to return after ending a solid summer with a back injury, will likely replace the latter come the Caribbean but overall, seam bowling is the final squeaky cog in what is an otherwise well-oiled machine.The true challenge on tour may yet be to come in the Test series but the value of Adil Rashid and Moeen Ali to the one-day attack is unquestionable, such that Morgan now happily describes them as “our best two bowlers” without qualifying this assertion. As regards Rashid, it had previously been said that it was a case of his wicket-taking ability mitigating some profligacy runs-wise. But here the leg-spinner was second only to Chris Woakes in terms of economy rate while remaining a constant threat. His googly should be well known to opponents by now but still it deceives, in part because it is deployed more thoughtfully. Fittingly, Rashid’s body language is unwaveringly confident at present.Jonny Bairstow’s twisted ankle gave rise to suggestions that football, as a pre-training warm-up, should be parked. But Morgan and Bayliss are having none of it (even if the latter doesn’t quite get this English obsession). During the three-years since it returned to the daily routine, Bairstow represents the sole player injured. And with tackling banned, the fact is his slip could easily have occurred when turning during shuttle runs or something equally innocuous. The squad are borderline obsessed with the sport and this tour has seen the ante upped by a fantasy scoring system in which iniduals are assigned a transfer value. The coaches may still have to rein in some over-enthusiasm at times but as a source of camaraderie, the benefits continue to outweigh the risk.The sight of the blue tarpaulin covers spread over the various outfields became pretty tedious, with all five matches affected by the monsoon rains. The England management reckoned more time was spent training than playing, hence the final selection was as much about getting players such as Jos Buttler and Ben Stokes more time in the middle. Granted there was an element of misfortune, with dry days in between, but there is a reason Sri Lanka rarely play at home in October. The ECB’s statement about the packed global schedule didn’t cut it, frankly. Boards chasing broadcast revenues create this situation, it is not handed down from above. And if you are going to chance your luck, at least have the common sense and flexibility to notice that the storms tend to arrive later in the day and switch all five games to morning starts."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad57d6cc62288282a397e8ae74d742a9d1c31619/102_179_2978_1787/master/2978.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b115d2060105ac4ec037169ca9172ad","title":"virat kohli sachin tendulkar fastest 10000 odi runs cricket","story":"Virat Kohli has broken Sachin Tendulkar’s record as the fastest batsman to score 10,000 one-day international runs.The India captain went past the 81 he needed, eventually scoring 157 not out, against West Indies to go to 10,000 ODI runs in 205 innings, beating Tendulkar who reached the mark in 259 innings.

Kerber will face Sloane Stephens in her final group match on Friday, with her qualification for the next round dependant upon the result.Meanwhile Kyle Edmund’s return to court after his maiden ATP Tour title began well as he beat Diego Schwartzman in the Erste Bank Open first round. The British No 1 won the European Open in Antwerp on Sunday for his first trophy on the main tour and followed it up with a 6-3 7-6 (3) win against the Argentinian in Vienna. It was a tough draw for Edmund, who at 14 is ranked only three places above Schwartzman, and there was very little to choose between the two. The first set was decided by Edmund’s key break of serve at 4-3 and that ended up being the only break point of the match. Both men dominated on serve in the second set until it went to a tiebreak, where Edmund’s winning mentality shone through, taking it 73 to seal a straight-sets win. It was his 11th victory from his last 13 matches and sets up a second-round meeting with Spain’s Fernando Verdasco.Kerber’s greater experience told there in the end - and it took two and a half hours to get there. Osaka has all the shots but she lacks patience, understandable for a 21-year-old, and someone who has come so far in the last few months. The three potential winners she crashed into the net when she might have saved herself were a case in point. Third set: Osaka 4-6 Kerber* (*denotes server): Can Kerber hold her serve? She forces an error for 15-0. Then Osaka gets a lucky net cord winner. Next comes another Osaka error, as she hits low into the net. Then Kerber is handed two match points by another netted shot. And another! Osaka, with a winner in her grasp, smashes it again into the net. Third set: *Osaka 4-5 Kerber (*denotes server): Osaka’s turn to look nervous, as she concedes the first point. Kerber challenges a call, and gets a point replayed, but Osaka wins the next one in any case. Kerber keeps challenging calls, and gets the next one wrong. And then a third one. Which she wins for 30-30. Osaka serves as 173mph to go to 40-30 but is then caught out and slips. Deuce. Kerber’s shot is out so Osaka has an advantage, and she serves out. Third set: Osaka 3-5* Kerber (*denotes server): Kerber needs to hold serve, which has been beyond her for too much of this match. Osaka swiftly makes it to 15-40 then misses her first chance, and then her second. Kerber holds, and then grinds out two points at deuce. Osaka must serve to save herself. Third set: Osaka* 3-4 Kerber (*denotes server): They keep missing big chances. Kerber is presented with a tap-in but misses it to go 15-0 down. Osaka is still very ragged. After both had made mistakes on 40-15, Osaka’s overhead attempt is woeful. It goes to deuce after a double fault. Kerber gets a break point, too. And claims it, wow. She has been hanging on so grimly. Third set: Osaka 3-3 Kerber* (*denotes server): Tiredness creeping in for both, with Osaka going for winners early as a means to conserve energy. Kerber concedes two double faults but battles her way to 40-30. Osaka misses the winner she required for deuce. Third set: Osaka* 3-2 Kerber (*denotes server): This feels like it will go the full distance and beyond. Kerber’s resistance is yet to be broken and Osaka’s radar has been too unreliable. She keeps at it on her serve, though, which Kerber is struggling to pick but fighting gamely on. It goes to 30-30 before a howitzer from Osaka pings it 40-30. Then Kerber keeps at it for deuce. Osakas, though, nudges ahead by holding her serve. Third set: Osaka 2-2 Kerber* (*denotes server): Osaka has a bounce in her step now, while Kerber seems a little woebegone. Defeat is not an option for either here. She begins with a double fault, but then makes Osaka chase down in vain. 15-15. Osaka, though, finds her range, with a fine winner. Then come two catastrophic misses before a wondrous shot to the corner of the corner has Kerber scrabbling. Osaka is wild on the first deuce, but then Kerber nets in error. Second deuce, Osaka hits a low, thrashing backhand winner for advantage, but misses her winner for a break. Third deuce, then, and Osaka rages as she goes far too long when the court had opened for her. Fourth deuce, though, as Osaka bullies her way back. Then, another miss. Osaka is getting angry with herself. She makes a mess again, and Kerber holds. Third set: Osaka* 2-1 Kerber (*denotes server): Osaka is starting to miss again - her shot on the first point was wild - but her serve is ferocious. She also slices Kerber repeatedly, a change of pace that catches out her opponent. Next comes the power to go to 40-15, and then Kerber nets as the final set stays on serve. Third set: Osaka 1-1 Kerber* (*denotes server): Kerber’s best chance is to tempt Osaka into going for broke. She is still rash. Kerber negotiates her way through this game when she tempts Osaka into a failed winner that hits the net. Third set: Osaka* 1-0 Kerber (*denotes server): A wild opening shot from Kerber, who is entitled to be demoralised, having served for the match and been broken to love. Osaka has all the energy, but is still struggling for precision. A chance for a winner is blown and the game goes back to 30-15. The next rally takes it to 40-15. And then a whipped forehand winner from the baseline takes the match. Osaka with the momentum, four games in a row now. Second set: Kerber* 5-7 Osaka (*denotes server): Kerber has to save herself here. Osaka is not giving this one up too easily. And Kerber begins with a wayward attempted winner and a poor drop shot. A good serve makes her back to 15-30, and then more doggedness for 30-30. Osaka moves to set point with a thrashing backhand winner. Kerber cannot hold her off and the final set approaches. Second set: Kerber 5-6 Osaka* (*denotes server): Neither player can hold their serve, which makes for a fine contest but Osaka is trying her best to do so here. She races to 40-0 and then game. Second set: Kerber* 5-5 Osaka (*denotes server): Osaka still has some dog in this fight, and fires her way to 30-0 and then 40-0. Kerber misses her first serve on the first break point but recovered to win it. Despite Kerber making it back to 30-40, she is hunted down by her opponent and it is level again. Second set: Kerber 5-4 Osaka* (*denotes server): Osaka continuing to struggle on her serve, and it’s quickly 0-30. It goes to 40-0 with a great piece of clutch play from Kerber, who booms a winner across the court. Three break points and then a double fault. Oh dear. Kerber will serve for the match.Second set: Kerber* 4-4 Osaka (*denotes server): Osaka’s coach is on, and telling her to step in on the Kerber second serve, using an iPad to do so. Modern technology, eh? Kerber makes it to 40-0 with ease, and then holds to love. Thanks a lot, Coach. Second set: Kerber 3-4 Osaka* (*denotes server): Kerber makes a great challenge to get the first point replayed her shot was just on the line. An early advantage gained, perhaps. Osaka seems somewhat distracted and a little glum. Her serve is still off and she misses a big chance to go to 40-30. In turn, Kerber goes long to leave it at 40-30 and then misses another winner. Second set: Kerber* 3-3 Osaka (*denotes server): A great winner from deep in the wilds makes it 30-0 to Kerber. That swiftly goes to 40-0 and she claims the game to love. Second set: Kerber 2-3 Osaka* (*denotes server): Osaka wanted to challenge a point but gave up on it. It was not a good decision. She goes almost instantly 30-0 down and then goes to break point down at 15-40. Then she concedes the game and the break with a wild swing. Second set: Kerber* 1-3 Osaka (*denotes server): Kerber again slow on her serve despite gaining that foothold in this set. She also gets excited on a forehand winner and misses her target to go 30-15 down, and then concedes another break point. She gets back to deuce with some typical defensive doughtiness, but then Osaka forces another break point which she claims. Second set: Kerber 1-2 Osaka* (*denotes server): Having found her feet, Osaka then loses her step again. She goes down to 15-30, and the serve has gone ragged. Her power wins her way back to 30-30 and Kerber again seems tired. A weary drop shot - she is struggling with these - fails. Kerber drills the balls down the line for deuce and then forces a break point which is conceded when Osaka hits the net. Second set: Kerber* 0-2 Osaka (*denotes server): Kerber flagging a little? Or her opponent finding her game. Osaka forces her to 30-0 with some powerful hitting. And then again for break point. Osaka takes the game having sat deep in the court to receive serve. Second set: Kerber 0-1 Osaka* (*denotes server): Osaka didn’t get to put that first set record to the test, now for a rescue job. The serve is again off-beam in the early stages though Kerber grants some grace with a missed winner and then a shot into the top of the net. An ace sees the game out. First set: Kerber* 6-4 Osaka (*denotes server): Kerber begins with a double fault and is then sent all over the court to go 3-0 down. Osaka chases down another drop shot to claim two break points. Kerber misses her first serve but then gets the luck of a let court. Osaka is walking right into the court on Kerber’s serve but is pegged back to deuce. Osaka hits a backhand winner for a third break point but gives that up with a failed forehand. Her next return of serve is excellent for a fourth break point. Kerber holds her nerve for yet another deuce, then moves to set point with a smashed forehand. The serve gives Osaka no chance. First set: Kerber 5-4 Osaka* (*denotes server): Osaka comes out fighting, really throwing the racquet at it. She is beaten well for 15-0 but then hits a winner on the next. On her second serve for the third point, she smashes into the net. Her speed of foot is revealed by chasing down a drop shot to equalise at 30-30. Kerber applauds that and then makes an unforced error on the next for 40-30. And then another. Osaka lives on. Kerber must serve for the set. First set: Kerber* 5-3 Osaka (*denotes server): A lucky winner off the let court opens Kerber’s defence of her serve. Kerber then hits an ace for 40-0 for the first ace of the tournament. Osaka challenged it but was way off beam. She recovers from that reverse by rattling back to 30-40. Kerber looks nervous on her serve again, but Osaka’s overhit shot grants her the game. First set: Kerber 4-3 Osaka* (*denotes server): Kerber fancies her chances on Osaka’s serve and runs her close, though the Japanese player does hit an ace to go 30-15 up. Then controls her opponent to go 40-15 up. Osaka then misses a glaring chance to punch a volley down the line and gets caught in two minds. Her shot hits the net. First set: Kerber* 4-2 Osaka (*denotes server): Kerber even more unsure of her serve than Osaka? It looks that way. Osaka with a pair of fine returns, but is pegged back to 30-30. A booming winner from Kerber for 40-30 but pegged back to deuce with a winner that wrong-footed her. Another booming winner down the line to go to game point. Then Osaka, wearily, smashes her shot wide and Kerber claims the game. First set: Kerber 3-2 Osaka* (*denotes server): That was a long game. Osaka still lacking in precision but she manages to overturn a decision that went against an early ace, the first of the match. Then she soon hits another for 40-15. Kerber continues to grind her into difficulties to go to 30-40 and then deuce. Osaka then utterly skews the shot to grant a break point, before going back to deuce with an angled volley at the net. A heck of baseline rally results in another error and another break. Osaka, much the more powerful, then forces another deuce. Then a smash and an ace wins it for the US Open champ. First set: Kerber* 3-1 Osaka (*denotes server): A hold, at last. It goes without saying that it is very hot out there both players drenched in perspiration. Kerber starts well with her serve, making her way to 30-0 but misses her winner on the next. Osaka long on the next, but forces an error on to 40-30. First set: Kerber 2-1 Osaka* (*denotes server): It takes until the second point of this game for one of them to win a point on their serve - the tenth overall. Osaka’s radar is off and she goes for a big winner that drifts out at 15-30. At last, a decent serve for 30-30, and then Kerber is made to work and loses for 40-30. Osaka repeatedly wild, and her shot to win the game slices wide. She does the same at deuce twice over and then clatters into the net for the third break. First set: Kerber* 1-1 Osaka (*denotes server): Two breaks to love! Osaka begins with some decent returns of service of her own, quickly firing herself to 0-30. And then 0-40. And then another break. First set: Kerber 1-0 Osaka* (*denotes server): Early break! The start of the match was somewhat delayed after Osaka took a comfort break before it had even started. Her first serve is tentative and she loses the subsequent rally after missing it. The same is repeated for her second. And the third, which results in a break to love. When she clatters a forehand into the net and then out of play, Kerber claims the game. Interesting choice to receive serve from Kerber, who won the toss, though probably owes something to service not being her strongest suit. The players are here. Osaka takes to the court with mascot in hand and Kerber does the same soon after. It’s a battle of a 30-year-old and a 21-year-old with the Japanese player the junior partner. OK, time to knock up. Over in Singapore, the arena PA is giving it big licks as we await the two players. One stat to bear in mind: Osaka has won the last 56 matches in which she won the first set. So watch out for a fast start. Kerber meanwhile, has left her best form at Wimbledon she hasn’t got past the third round in any tournament since then. It’s fair to say she favours the quicker surface. A clash of Wimbledon and US Open champions is definitely worth a watch, with an indoor environment perhaps neutralising their strengths on grass and hard court respectively. It was on the way to victory at SW19 that Kerber enjoyed the last of her 3 wins over the Japanese player in the last 32. Osaka has won just once in four attempts but that came at last year’s US Open. Kerber, the World No.2, is attempting to address a losing streak, having been beaten by Kiki Bertens at these championships in Singapore, and Shuai Zhang in the last 16 at Beijing. Osaka is on a similar streak, having lost to Sloane Stephens here and Anastasija Sevastova in Beijing. Both players need a win, or else they will not be reaching the semis."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7c3120e065809805d54a96ca08a06006728794a/0_274_4174_2504/master/4174.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b29c4cd4d204d9dd00f88a88f67a001","title":"link link by isabella rossellini review queen elizabeth hall southbank centre london","story":"Queen Elizabeth Hall, LondonA cod-scientific lecture on animal behaviour is given a comic twist in a surreal show that is too cutesyIsabella Rossellini went back to university to study animal behaviour, she tells us, as she delivers a cod-donnish lecture on everything from scientific theories on animal intelligence to the sex lives of whales.Co-directed by Guido Torlonia, it is billed as a one-woman show but is not quite that. Alongside her adorable and supremely obedient dog, Pan, there is also Schuyler Beeman, who is a silent performer, bringing stuffed animal toys or puppets on to the stage with a flourish while dressed in beekeeper’s headgear.Much of the performance veers into surreal whimsy: Rossellini is dressed like a stylish court jester as she enters the stage, after shrieking and hiding behind the curtain, accompanied by a soundtrack of clucking hens.The show comprises stories told by Rossellini in a hodgepodge of forms, including films, skits and the odd circus trick by Pan, who trots on to the stage, sometimes dressed as a chicken, sheep or lion, and rolls over or dances on instruction.He is such a natural performer that the show might have benefitted from more of Pan’s antics. The production is anchored by Rossellini’s clear and genuine passion for animals, yet its various parts are too disparate, its drama too static, its comedy too cutesy, and it never raises itself off the ground.She speaks of initially imagining the show as “a little film that went through my head … because an actress thinks films can resolve it all”. Ironically, the show has a self-consciously theatrical aesthetic and Rossellini’s intense and sultry cinematic presence is substituted for an unexpectedly zany stage persona.Rick Gilbert and Andy Byers’ stage design is a cross between a children’s nursery and a circus set, with a miniature piano, wooden toys, circus motifs and plinths featuring Aristotle, Descartes and other ancient thinkers at the back of the stage.The short films seem like homages or pastiches. Some are silent, black-and-white sequences set to piano music, in which Rossellini acts out parts such as a performer having rotten tomatoes thrown at her. More knowingly quirky are childlike film reels of Rossellini dressed as a bird or an insect against cardboard backdrops.Family photos are thrown in, too: an image of Rossellini’s mother, Ingrid Bergman, a snap of an incandescent young Isabella beside her father, Roberto Rossellini, and pictures of her dogs, pigs and beloved hens.Big questions about nature and science are thrown out, and seem ultimately aimed at proving that the animal kingdom is on the same continuum of humanity as us. As a message, this is deep and heartfelt. As a show, it does not always cohere, though it is not without its sparkly and original moments."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7188eda2bedecd74539e8987286a604ac430294c/0_0_4063_2438/master/4063.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=04c8ac5eea9acccf60385e96eae50439","title":"google pixel 3 xl review big device performance camera screen","story":"This device picks up where last year’s version left off, with smooth performance, excellent camera and fantastic screenGoogle’s iPhone XS Max competitor brings a big screen, a big notch and a big glass body, but is the Pixel 3 XL good enough to beat the phablet kings?The smaller of Google’s new Pixel smartphones is arguably the best small Android phone going, and the Pixel 3 XL shares many of its best traits.The backs of the devices are a spitting image of each other – two-tone glass, part polished, part etched. The glossy coated metal sides and glass back have a luxurious, smooth feel in the hand.The etched surface hides the mess of fingerprints usually associated with glass-backed phones, but is slightly more slippery than the polished section. After a couple of weeks it became a little less slippery, but at 76.7mm wide the Pixel 3 XL is not a small phone.Handling it one-handed is a challenge, but its lighter 184g weight helps compared with the 208g iPhone XS Max and 201g Samsung Galaxy Note 9.The 6.3in screen is beautiful. Crisp, colourful and improved over last year. It’s not quite as eye-popping as Samsung or Apple’s best, but it is very close, and the difference is now down to a matter of taste.There is, however, a massive notch containing the dual selfie camera and speaker. Aesthetic debates aside, it’s important to note that because the notch is so tall it takes up a big chunk of the screen at the top, with the area either side exclusively being used for the status bar.As such, despite being 0.3in bigger on the diagonal than the Pixel 2 XL, the Pixel 3 XL has essentially only gained a status-bar’s height on the screen compared with last year’s phone. The usable screen area therefore works out about 0.3mm taller than the Pixel 2 XL, as Android ignores the space either side of the notch in most full-screen apps such as Netflix, Amazon or most other video apps. YouTube and Google Photos are the most obvious exceptions.There isn’t enough room either side of the notch for most of the status bar icons either. If you have the battery percentage visible, the phone connected to wifi and set to vibrate, if you connect a set of Bluetooth headphones you end up with a dot in the right side of the status bar indicating there are more icons needed than can fit.The same goes for notification icons on the left, which have to fit in the small area between the time and the notch. Google is not alone in having this problem, but it is very pronounced on the Pixel 3 XL.The Pixel 3 has Qualcomm’s current top-of-the-line processor the Snapdragon 845, as used in the OnePlus 6 and most other current flagship smartphones, with the exception of the UK versions of Samsung’s S9 and Note 9 and Huawei’s phones, both of which use their own-brand chips.The Pixel 3 only has 4GB of RAM, compared with 6GB or even 8GB in some top-end Android competitors. While it might lose in a game of Top Trumps, it’s not noticeable in daily use because the Pixel 3 is simply buttery-smooth in operation, with top-notch gaming performance too.I noticed some aggressive background app handling. If you shoot 14 photos in rapid concession while listening to Spotify, the Pixel 3 XL will terminate Spotify in the background, stopping the music. I only encountered this behaviour when actively looking for it, however.Battery life was similar to the smaller Pixel 3, managing just over 24 hours between charges. Used as my primary device, sending and receiving hundreds of emails, messages and push notifications, listening to five hours of music with Spotify via Bluetooth headphones, watching 30 minutes of Netflix, and shooting about 10 photos a day, the Pixel 3 XL made it from my 7am alarm to about 7.30am the next morning.Lighter usage saw another couple of hours of battery life. Charging is fast via the included USB-C cable, and via the Pixel Stand wireless charger, but limited to only 5W via current third-party wireless chargers.The Pixel 3 XL runs the latest version of Android 9 Pie with Google’s new mandatory gesture controls replacing the traditional back, home and overview navigation buttons, and Gmail’s new Smart Compose on mobile, which makes writing dull emails less laborious.Google hasn’t made any alterations specifically for the larger 6.3in screen on the Pixel 3 XL, but Gboard supports one-handed typing mode and the gesture button is easy to reach with your thumb.There are digital wellbeing tools, including time trackers and Google’s Wind Down, which activates do not disturb and sets the screen to monochrome to dissuade you from using it.Overall this is the smoothest, most refined version of Android available on any smartphone, rivalling Apple’s iOS on the iPhone XS for slickness.The Pixel 3 XL has the exact same camera as fitted to its smaller sibling, and as such as genuinely brilliant, capturing richly detailed and vibrant images in practically any lighting condition with little to no photographic skill required.New for the Pixel 3 is Google’s Super Res Zoom, which is an enhanced digital zoom that works very well, but can’t quite beat rivals with telescopic cameras at maximum magnification. The on-device AI-powered Top Shot advisor captures multiple frames before and after you hit the shutter button and flags when it thinks it’s got a better image than you managed manually.The portrait mode is also great, despite the lack of another camera on the back. On the front there’s a dual selfie camera system, one standard and one ultra wide-angle camera, which means you can squeeze more people into a shot.For more detail on the camera performance, please see the Pixel 3 review.The Pixel Stand is an optional £69 wireless-charging stand that has two unique features for the Pixel 3 and 3 XL. The first is the ability to wirelessly charge the new Google smartphones at 10W. Third-party Qi wireless chargers can currently only charge the Pixel 3 and 3 XL at 5W, although certified Made for Google wireless chargers will be available at the later date that can charge the phones at the full 10W.The second is it turns the smartphone into a portrait Google Assistant smart display, a little like the Google Home Hub. When you put the phone on the stand with the screen off it launches Google Assistant mode, which either lights an ambient display with time, date and notifications like normal, with an added Google Assistant box at the bottom, or displays a selection of your Google Photos.It also activates the smart-speaker-like always-listening mode that waits for the wake words “Hey Google”, firing up Google Assistant barking out answers using the speakers and displaying results on the screen.It can also act as a sunrise alarm, lighting up the screen 15 minutes before your morning alarm goes off in warm red to yellow tones, and lights up with a live feed from the front door if someone rings the Nest Hello doorbell you might have.It works well enough, but is expensive for a wireless charger and I suspect few will deem it an essential purchase.The Google Pixel 3 XL is available for £869 with 64GB of storage or £969 with 128GB of storage, in a choice of black, white or pink.The Pixel 3 XL is a great smartphone, but unlike last year’s XL offering, it isn’t necessarily the best Google phone – the smaller, cheaper Pixel 3 is in many ways a better phone.The Pixel 3 XL is a slick, attractive and lovely-feeling device, but it’s also pretty big and relatively slippery, making it more difficult to handle than last year’s Pixel 2 XL. Its lighter weight is an advantage against rivals in reducing the potential hand pain caused by its size though.It’s got a cracking camera, and a beautiful screen, but the notch might put some off. I didn’t generally notice its presence except when it blocked status bar icons, which I found annoying.While £869 is definitely not cheap, it does undercut the top-end, big-screen rivals such as the Note 9 and iPhone XS Max by a little or a lot. So if you want a big screen and a super-refined Android experience, the Pixel 3 XL is the one to buy.Pros: super smooth and fluid performance, great screen, squeezable sides, Android 9 Pie and 3 years of updates, water resistant, fantastic camera, wireless chargingCons: massive notch, no expandable storage or removable battery, no headphone jack, no face recognition, quite big and slippery This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

I had a ‘holy cow!’ moment, somewhat in disbelief that it had disappeared,” said Chip Fletcher, a professor of earth sciences at the University of Hawaii. Fletcher and his colleagues were in the process of researching East Island through drone videos and taking samples of sand and corals to ascertain the age of the island and gauge its future prospects in the face of climate change.“The island was probably one to two thousand years old and we were only there in July, so for it to be lost right now is pretty bad luck,” Fletcher said.“We wanted to monitor the island so we are disappointed it has gone, but on the other hand we have learned these islands are far more at risk than we thought. I thought the island would be around for a decade or two longer, but it’s far more fragile than I appreciated. The top, middle and bottom of it has gone.”East Island was, at about half a mile long and 400ft wide, the second largest island in the the French Frigate Shoals, an atoll in the far western reaches of the Hawaiian archipelago. Until 1952, it hosted a US Coast Guard radar station.Despite its size, the island played an important role for wildlife, including the critically endangered Hawaiian monk seal, a species that numbers just 1,400 iniduals, with many of the seals raising their young on East Island. Green sea turtles, which are also threatened, and seabirds such as albatrosses, which often had their young preyed upon by circling tiger sharks, also depended on the island.“The loss is a huge blow,” Fletcher said. “Little did we know it could disappear so quickly.”If conditions align, an atoll would always be at a small risk of being erased by a powerful hurricane. But climate change is causing the ocean and atmosphere to warm, making storms fiercer, while there’s evidence that hurricanes are moving further north into the latitudes where East Island once lay.Rising sea levels are also eroding away low-lying islands, with several fragments of land in the Pacific vanishing in recent years.“The take-home message is climate change is real and it’s happening now,” Randy Kosaki, a senior official for the Hawaii monument at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, told Honolulu Civil Beat, which first reported the disappearance of East Island. “It’s not a hoax propagated in China as some folks have said.”The French Frigate Shoals sits in the Papahānaumokuākea marine national monument, which became the largest marine reserve in the world when expanded by the Obama administration in 2016. The 1,350-mile string of coral islands, seamounts and shoals feature a riot of life, including coral, fish, birds and mammals, many unique to Hawaii.A statement by the federal managers of the monument said that East Island “appears to be under water”, while the neighboring Tern island had its shape altered by the hurricane.“Monument co-managers are working to better understand the implications for cultural resources and wildlife, protected species and their habitat within the Monument,” the statement added.“We will continue to monitor the species and islands to better assess the impacts from the hurricane. Based on the data, managers will determine next steps and management actions.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f021d5d158195249562ab3c772c6589da6d2c44e/0_316_3813_2287/master/3813.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eecc7105eae582260c524015220b42b6","title":"armistice day 100 years on share your letters stories and photographs","story":"Whether your family members or friends were in active service, or in some supporting role at home or abroad, we’d like to hear their storiesSunday 11 November this year will mark 100 years since the armistice treaty was signed between first world war allies and Germany, bringing to an end four years of war in western Europe.On that day people in Britain celebrated by pouring out onto the streets and gathering in large places. Church bells were rung in towns and villages across the UK, for the first time since the war began, both as a symbolic gesture and to let people know the war was over.Though this was a joyous moment for the allies at least, the devastating loss of life affected many families and communities in Britain and across the world. Thirty nations had declared war between 1914 and 1918. Many countries along with Great Britain sided with the allies, including France, Italy, Russia, and the United States. The Ottoman Empire, Austria-Hungary and Bulgaria supported Germany.Do you have letters, diaries, photographs or even memorabilia from any relatives or friends who remember Armistice Day?

Ask them their plans, tell them about the New Zealand weather – what cold really means here, what rain really means here,” said Shepherd.“Tell them that jeans are not acceptable in any hiking situation. Let them know a torch can help save their lives. We have a collective responsibility to help care for our visitors. We need our visitors to thrive in our country not just survive.”Stacey Faire, who works for the Department of Conservation in Tongariro, said chatting with a local was the best form of advice for tourists. Visitors were far more likely to listen to warnings from a Kiwi than they were from signs or hiking guides and websites, she said.Don Bogie, the department’s visitor risk adviser, said social media shots of New Zealand tourists in dramatic locations were encouraging people to push themselves into terrain and conditions they were unprepared for. “All those really neat photos don’t really show you the hazards,” Bogie told RNZ.The cost of emergency rescues is paid by the taxpayer and rescues of hikers in peril are largely undertaken by volunteers.The most common issues for visitors hiking in New Zealand are underestimating the challenges of the rugged environment, failing to take enough warm or protective clothing, getting lost, and sudden, dramatic changes in weather.In the year to September 3.8 million tourists visited New Zealand 1.3 million more than a decade ago.This year the government announced it would introduce a tourist tax of NZ$25 to NZ$35 per visitor, which will be directed towards tourism infrastructure such as public toilets and conservation in the country’s national parks and conservation areas."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4b443c2d29e37ad9add80555b0d9feab6ab4b66/0_132_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=732551e0fd47ca43a53d529a7818df5a","title":"theresa may first raise option brexit transition period extension eu","story":"Fresh questions around Brexit strategy of PM, who claimed to be vehemently opposed to ideaTheresa May is to face fresh questions over her Brexit plans after the European parliament was informed it was the British prime minister who first raised the possibility of extending the transition period beyond 2020 with the EU’s leaders.Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, told MEPs it was May who brought up the idea at last week’s summit, despite the prime minister’s public claims that she is vehemently opposed to such a move.Tusk said: “Since Prime Minister May mentioned the idea of extending the transition period, let me repeat that if the UK decided that such an extension would be helpful to reach a deal, I am sure that the leaders would be ready to consider it positively.”Under the terms of the 21-month transition period so far negotiated, the UK would continue to live under EU rules and laws, but without any say in their design, as the country would not have any representation in the bloc’s institutions.The prime minister was already on the back foot on the issue after cabinet papers leaked to the Times revealed that the UK could be locked in a transition period lasting years rather than the few months she has promised. The documents reportedly say the plan to maintain an option to extend the transition period, known as the implementation period or IP in Whitehall, “could, in theory, lead to a long-running IP”. They say the arrangement could last for many years on a rolling basis with an annual decision point for its renewal.The former Ukip leader Nigel Farage, who remains an MEP, immediately seized on Tusk’s comments. “Mr Tusk, I want to thank you for confirming that it was Theresa May that asked for the one-year extension to the transition period,” he said.The debate in the European parliament in Strasbourg was also notable for an impassioned speech by the European commission vice-president, Frans Timmermans, who signalled his belief that the British public had the right to think again about Brexit and asked whether the Tories, “the party of Churchill”, had been “eaten by Ukip”.His comments came in response to an attack by Syed Kamall, the leader of the group in which Tory MEPs sit in parliament, on the socialist group’s leader, Udo Bullmann.Bullmann, a German MEP, had moments before broken from Jeremy Corbyn’s position and backed a new Brexit poll, leading Kamall to claim that the Nazis had been socialists.Timmermans accused Kamall of aping the language of Farage. “Is it as Churchill predicted when he talked about appeasers. The only thing you get by feeding the crocodile is that the crocodile will eat you last?” the former Dutch foreign minister asked.“Has the Conservative party finally been eaten by Ukip? I hope not. I do hope not. I say this because I will make no secret of my deep admiration and affection for the UK and everything it has achieved during its history … The European Union is an instrument to help European people solve their differences at the negotiating table instead of the battlefield.“The European Union is a guarantee that no British soldiers will have to be sent to battlefields in Europe again as they have so valiantly done in our common history. The European Union is the best guarantee for peace in Europe for the ages to come and for one of the biggest member states to leave is an incredibly sad moment and I want to say that in this house. As a democrat, indeed as a human being, who in this house has never ever changed their minds on anything? But we will leave that with the British people. That is not for us to judge.”The EU leaders’ summit last week had been intended to be a “moment of truth” in the Brexit talks that would reveal the path towards a deal. Tusk informed MEPs, however, that the British government needed more time before it could strike a deal with the EU, but that he was ready to call an extraordinary Brexit summit of leaders should there be a breakthrough in the talks. Tusk said: “Last Wednesday evening, leaders listened to Prime Minister May’s views on the negotiations.“Afterwards, the EU27 met in the article 50 format, with our chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, to discuss the state of play. It was made clear by the UK that more time is needed to find a precise solution. Therefore, there is no other way but to continue the talks. Leaders expressed their full trust and support for Michel Barnier.“President Juncker also touched upon preparations for a no-deal scenario, an outcome which we hope never to see. And, of course, I stand ready to convene a European council, if and when the union negotiator reports that decisive progress has been made. The Brexit talks continue with the aim of reaching a deal.”He also blamed Brexiters for the resurrection of tensions over the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.“We want to avoid a hard border in Ireland. but there is no guarantee that we can do it. And you know why, Mr Farage? Because Brexit is defacto a political decision to establish the border between the union and the UK. Brexit is a project to separate the UK from the EU,” he said.”The European parliament’s Brexit coordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, told the same meeting of MEPs that until the issue of the Irish border was agreed, nothing was agreed.

The museum’s keeper of Irish antiquities, Maeve Sikora said conservation staff had conducted extensive analysis and the results indicate the hoard dates to the late Bronze Age, between approximately 1200BC and 800BC.Ms Sikora explained that while the gold overlapping rings are circular in shape, it is not possible to accurately determine their use: “They’ve been described as ‘arm bands’ because of their size, but it is thought more likely that gold was shaped in this fashion as a means to store wealth,” she said.Director of the National Museum Lynn Scarff said the launch of the “Tullydonnell Hoard” exhibition was timed to coincide with the introduction of extended opening hours across the National Museum of Ireland’s four sites which offer free admission and are open seven days a week.She said the Tullydonnell hoard was “the latest addition to the thousands of rare and beautiful artefacts that we are proud to add to our national collection and exhibit at our archaeology museum on Kildare St.”Judith McCarthy curator of the Donegal County Museum said the Tullydonnell hoard was a “unique and significant find.”“We were delighted to be able to assist both the finders and the National Museum of Ireland with this discovery. Donegal has a very rich and varied history stretching back thousands of years and the Tullydonnell hoard forms an important part of this multi-faceted story,” she said.The finders of the hoard who include members of the family who farm the land at Tullydonnell are expected to be at the National Museum for the launch of the exhibition Wednesday.

Higgins, speaking during a presidential debate on RTÉ, has defended his use of the government jet to travel to Belfast to deliver a speech. Video: RTÉ\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPresidential candidates Senator Joan Freeman, MEP Liadh Ní Riada, President Michael D Higgins, Seán Gallagher, Peter Casey and Gavin Duffy ahead of the debate on RTÉ’s ‘Prime Time’. Photograph: Tom Honan for The We thought it was going to be Coyote Casey versus the Talking Tea Cosy. Michael D Higgins, dodging the hits like Road Runner, with Peter Casey stalking him like Wile E Coyote, waiting for the chance to drop an anvil on the presidential head.There was a magnificent full moon over Montrose. With any luck, one of the candidates might go doolally. This was probably the main reason people tuned in to watch the latest debate in what has been a dull and uninspiring presidential election campaign.“I can certainly say I would be one of the more interesting and exciting presidents,” carolled Casey, as his fellow candidates sniggered.In the end, the scrap between Higgins and Casey didn’t live up to the advance billing. What viewers got was a more even-handed free for all, with the TV “dragons” devouring each other and the remaining three candidates staying, mainly, above the fray.As he is so far ahead on the opinion polls, and this was “the last chance debate”, there was a feeling before the off that Michael D’s rivals had no option but to go for the jugular.At the start of hostilities, Higgins was neither president nor candidate – he was a moving target. And for the first 15 minutes of the debate, he was the focus of intense questioning. First from presenter and master of the raised eyebrow, David McCullagh – who did a ruthless job as moderator – and then from the five pretenders to his job.McCullagh landed the line of the night when Seán Gallagher, who came second to Higgins in the last election, quibbled at being called a “Dragon”, conveniently ignoring the reality television show which propelled him, and his colleagues Casey and Duffy, to the election starting gate.“Perhaps in seven years time we will have three candidates from Ireland’s Fittest Family.”The continuing row over Higgins being flown in the Government jet last May to an engagement in Northern Ireland reached its entertaining peak when the volatile Casey, following through on a crunching opening tackle from his fellow reality TV star Gallagher, looked at an angelic Higgins and shouted: “He couldn’t lie straight in the bed! He couldn’t lie straight in the bed!”A pained Higgins shrieked: “My life has been about authenticity!”We closed our eyes and swore we were hearing Oliver Callan. As he shipped a lot of flak, the president eventually declared: “there are far too many innuendos flying around.” Presumably not just in the jet.Earlier, the final podium places were decided when representatives of the candidates drew lots – a bit like Winning Streak, but without the glamour. At the outset of the campaign, positioning Higgins and Gallagher side by side in the middle of the crescent of candidates would have seemed like perfect placement for a grudge match which has been seven years in the making. But that was before the recent shake-up in the rankings.The media observers were pinning their hopes for a good brawl on multi-millionaire businessman, Casey. If he didn’t launch a rocket at the President before the end of the show there was every expectation he would at least let off a few bangers. So much so that when he walked into the foyer of the Television Centre, the waiting hacks said nothing, rendered silent by their overwhelming desire for fireworks and blood on the carpet.It was all rather awkward, Casey smiling wordlessly at the reporters and the reporters blankly staring back. After the initial piling in on Higgins over the jet, the debate settled down to what was largely a row between the three male “Dragons”.The three men, stood together wearing an interchangeable dark suit. They then indulged in an interchangeable argument and spent much of the debate savaging each other, with Liadh Ní Riada and Joan Freeman lobbing in the occasional dig and Michael D standing, presidentially, above it all.Next into the firing line was Gallagher. He should have been expecting the “what have you been doing for the last seven years” haymaker. But he walked into it anyway. In the course of a lot of huffing and puffing, the businessman said it was because he had been fighting a case against RTÉ ever since his ordeal in the final debate in 2011. He pointed to one crowning achievement as a result: “as we stand here tonight, there are no live tweets coming in”.He followed up this great revelation with the sort a bewildering reply which cried out for for the attention of Joycean scholars. Gallagher, the high flyer of the last election, was shot down in flames. When he declared, rather loftily, that he is a type of social entrepreneur “providing workspace”, Gavin Duffy pointed out “you’re a commercial landlord” while Ní Riada reminded him he was “lining his pockets”.Duffy and Casey then\u0026nbspstarted headbutting each other. By the end of the debate, the business-orientated Dragons had devoured each other. Three were left standing – Higgins, Freeman and Ní Riada.Freeman struggled to get her “vision” out. It concerns her interest in mental health.“Look, I’m the expert here,” she said, not for the first time. But she did well, showing her frustration with the bickering of the businessmen. Joan said she wants to open “wellness centres” around the country if she becomes president. An hour into the debate, and we could have done with a stint in a wellness centre.Duffy expounded again on Brexit and continued to push his plan to have a Youth Corps.McCullagh then got stuck into Liadh over her claim that, as a Sinn Féin politician, she only earns the average industrial wage. She said her error was one of “semantics really” and that she should have answered the question more clearly.The programme began with a compilation of some of the saccharine mission statements emoted by the contenders. Somebody encountering the participants for the first time might have mistaken it for the opening shots of a comedy programme.It was an entertaining debate, but despite our fervent hopes, there was no rocket from Casey, who came along with a pocket full of damp squibs. Michael D Higgins will be relieved after the programme – he suffered no major hit. The two women\u0026nbspon the ticket – Freeman and Ní Riada –\u0026nbspwere also measured and more considered in their approach. They did well.

Photograph: Cory ClarkNurPhoto via Getty ImagesAs the results rolled in on election night in November 2016, and the electoral college map began to turn from blue to red, the eyes of the country turned to Pennsylvania.The battleground state was Hillary Clinton’s final hope to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat.But shortly after 1.30am, news broke that Pennsylvania had voted for Donald Trump, securing his path to the presidency.The Keystone State, with its 20 electoral college votes, had backed the Republican nominee, part of the red wave that night that helped propel Trump to the White House.Two years later, Pennsylvania is again shaping up to be one of the most closely-watched states, this time in the midterm elections.The state could hold the key to Democrats winning back control of the House of Representatives when America goes to the polls on November 6th.Up to half a dozen seats are potentially for the taking by Democrats in Pennsylvania. This represents about a quarter of the 24 seats the party needs to win nationwide to gain control of the House.The reason for the party’s new-found optimism lies primarily in a momentous court decision earlier this year. Following a lengthy legal process, the state supreme court struck down Pennsylvania’s congressional map as unconstitutional.Pennsylvania had long been regarded as one of the most heavily gerrymandered states in the country. In the last three elections, Republicans have won 13 of the state’s 18 seats in the House of Representatives, despite the fact that the state has a relatively equal percentage of Republican and Democratic voters.Like many legislatures across the country, the imbalance was a result of redistricting undertaken by Republican-controlled states following a wave of wins by the party in 2010 – Pennsylvania’s oddly-shaped districts, which “wander seemingly arbitrarily across Pennsylvania” as the court ruling put it, were widely seen as the most egregious example of gerrymandering in the country.The newly-drawn congressional district map more accurately reflects the demographics of the state and is beneficial to Democrats. This, in addition to the fact that incumbent Republicans such as Pat Meehan and Charlie Dent are retiring, have fuelled hopes that Democrats are on track for a major victory in two weeks’ time.Democratic congressman Brendan Boyle, who represents the 13th district of Philadelphia, is confident about the party’s chances in the state. “I’m very optimistic that we will win at least four congressional seats here at state level – in fact, it is likely that we will pick up more congressional seats in Pennsylvania than any other state in the country.”While the districting changes will almost certainly benefit Democrats, the party is also hoping to tap into the female vote, and build on the anti-Trump energy that manifested itself in the women’s march shortly after the election. Remarkably, Pennsylvania has no female representation in Congress, an anomaly the party is hoping to address. A record number of women are running for elected office this November across the United States, most on a Democratic ticket.Here in the affluent suburb of Germantown in the northern outskirts of Philadelphia, Chrissy Houlahan is one of seven Democratic female candidates who will be on the Pennsylvania congressional ballot on November 6th.Houlahan (51) is running to represent Pennsylvania’s sixth congressional district. A third-generation US army veteran and mother of three, she is also an MIT graduate who has run two start-up companies and also worked as a chemistry teacher. Her Irish-sounding name is courtesy of her husband, whose family hails from Co Kerry.Like many of the female candidates in this election, she has never before run for public office. As she stops for a coffee before heading to a campaign event nearby, she explains why she was motivated this year to run.“I never expected to run for anything,” she says, “All I ever did before was vote and occasionally knock on doors. I really thought that governance and politics were for other people, and I was happy doing my job as a citizen, as a member of the military.”But then 2016 happened. Like many people across the country she was shocked by the election of Trump. In the days following the election she helped organise a bus to travel to Washington DC for the women’s march in the capital.“Fifty-three women travelled down to Washington for the day. We held a sign-decorating party the evening before, packed chicken and doughnuts and headed to the capital.” This experience was “part of the realisation that I could be helpful,” she explains, “seeing all those women, all those signs, all campaigning for issues – reproductive issues, education, the planet”.As she campaigns here in the Philadelphia area, she is keen to stress that she is not running solely on a women’s platform. “Women’s issues are family issues, they’re people issues,” she says. “It’s about ersity, about having people around the table who will represent a ersity of views,” she says, adding that it is unacceptable that Pennsylvania has no women representing the state in Congress.But while Houlahan is reluctant to cast her candidacy as aimed only at females, it is evident that both parties are increasingly eyeing the women’s vote as a potential deal-breaker in these elections, given Trump’s unpopularity among many women voters.In particular, there are signs that the GOP may be in trouble with college-educated women in suburbs from Philadelphia to Atlanta to Houston.A recent Washington Post survey found that college-educated white women in key battleground races favour Democrats over Republicans by a colossal 27-point margin.The Republican Party has been keen to shift Trump’s focus away from issues that could negatively impact on women. Following the president’s description of adult film star Stormy Daniels as “horseface” last week on Twitter, House speaker Paul Ryan, who typically tempers his criticism of the president, was unequivocal. “There is no place for that kind of language . . . he should not have said that,” he said.With women representing up to 50 per cent of the vote, Democrats hope that by harnessing the female vote on November 6th they could achieve major congressional gains.Elsewhere in the state, which ranges from urban centres such as Philadelphia and Pittsburgh to rural areas of the rust belt, Democrats are also quietly confident. They cite Conor Lamb, a 34-year-old Democrat who unexpectedly won a special election in a traditionally Republican area.As well as their hopes for the House, other races on November 6th are looking positive. One of Pennsylvania’s two Senate seats is up for grabs, and Democratic senator Bob Casey has a double-digit lead over his Republican challenger, Lou Barletta. This is despite controversy over an ad he ran criticising Republican healthcare policy which featured a woman whose twin daughters were diagnosed with cancer. Barletta’s own grandson, also a twin, is fighting cancer and the ad was deemed insensitive.In addition to the Senate race, Pennsylvania’s governor Tom Wolf, a Democrat, is also ahead in the polls.As Democrats look ahead to November 6th, they are hoping that the state that did so much to dash their hopes of a Clinton presidency in 2016 could be key to a comeback in the midterms.Will there be a backlash against Trump?

The United States Secret Service and other law enforcement agencies are investigating and will take all appropriate actions to protect anyone threatened by these cowards,” she said.CNN headquarters in New York were evacuated during a live broadcast after a suspicious device was found.“The packages were immediately identified during routine mail screening procedures as potential explosive devices and were appropriately handled as such,” the Secret Service said in statement. “The protectees did not receive the packages nor were they at risk of receiving them.”One device was addressed to Hillary Clinton, the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee, who lives with former president Bill Clinton in Chappaqua, a suburb about 60km north of New York City.The FBI’s New York field office said in a tweet that its Joint Terrorism Task Force “has engaged with our federal, state and local partners to investigate” the package sent to the Clintons.Nick Merrill, a spokesman for Hillary Clinton, said in a tweet that “nothing got to any home.”The incidents followed an earlier discovery when police on Monday “proactively detonated” a pipe-bomb found at a residence in New York’s suburbs owned by billionaire philanthropist and Democratic donor George Soros.– Additional reporting: Bloomberg"},{"url":null,"title":"picture editors 25 favourite images princess eugenies royal","story":"Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank kiss after their wedding on the steps of St George\u0027s Chapel, Windsor CastleSuspected bombs sent to Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and CNN building: White House condemns \u0026#39terrorising acts\u0026#39 as \u0026#39despicable\u0026#39Secret lives of Britain\u0026#39s spies revealed: Bake Off competitions, questions about your sex life and lying to friends and familyBrexit live: UK will \u0026#39pay the price\u0026#39 of no deal, as Theresa May considers \u0026#39long-running\u0026#39 transition - latest newsBrussels to pay out millions in golden handshakes for British MEPsFrom the front line: fight against polio stalls as cases in Afghanistan doubleMushroom picking row in New Forest as signs suggest the practice is illegalM\u0026ampS accused of trivialising alcohol addiction by selling \u0026#39stress relieving\u0026#39 wineComment: Lawyers cannot escape responsibility for unethical, oppressive gagging agreementsHundreds of schools remain shut on second day of strike action Saudi Crown Prince calls murder of Jamal Khashoggi \u0026#39painful\u0026#39 and \u0026#39heinous\u0026#39 as he vows justice will be servedCenturies old tradition of bell-ringing swans at risk of dying out Suspected bombs sent to Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama: White House condemns \u0026#39terrorising acts\u0026#39 as \u0026#39despicable\u0026#39Theresa May says some employers are using non disclosure agreements \u0026#39unethically\u0026#39The British #MeToo scandal which cannot be revealedPolice hunt Ross from Friends lookalike over shop theftCrows can make tools in discovery which shows they can mimic apes and humansParliamentary assistant reveals she was assaulted and stalked by an MP Comment: The EU won\u0026#39t just hand the PM a \u0026#39Brextension\u0026#39 – humiliatingly, she may have to beg for itUS midterm elections 2018 poll tracker: Who will win the Congress?Sir Jeremy Heywood stands down as Cabinet Secretary and defends civil service against attacks over BrexitMother-of-five missing for two weeks may have been murdered, police sayWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/10/23/TELEMMGLPICT000178641186_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqBep_n7dXteXoNWn24bfIyo8bequwqEhsP14Hyd6Vj5I.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"day press freedoms received devastating blow","story":"NDAs have become tarnished after being used by Harvey Weinstein to suppress victims’ allegations of sexual harassmentCourt of AppealLaw and orderIt was an unseasonably warm sunny September day when three of Britain’s most senior judges filed into court to ­consider The ’s case to publish reports of a leading businessman’s alleged sexual harassment and racist abuse of employees.Desmond Browne QC, the former Bar Council chairman representing the newspaper, told the appeal court judges that the arguments went to the heart of an independent media’s right to inform the public about issues of legitimate public interest.

There’s an element of hubris involved - combined with social media storms and the popularity of herbal and alternative approaches.”Most Europeans believe the MMR vaccine is safer than the flu vaccine“Soon we are going to get a very serious strain of flu that people have never been exposed to, they will need a vaccine,” Prof Larson added. “You can’t create a high level of understanding about vaccines during a crisis. We need to make sure people have that base understanding already.”She added that with antibiotic resistance rising, a lack of trust in vaccines could exacerbate an outbreak. France has the lowest confidence in flu vaccines, with just half of respondents agreeing they were safe - despite 70 per cent agreeing that vaccines in general were safe. In contrast, confidence in flu vaccines is high in the UK - with over 85 per cent of people believing that flu vaccines are safe. The report also found that in countries where GPs had a high confidence in vaccines, a larger proportion of people expressed positive vaccination beliefs. There are significant regional disparities in attitudes to vaccinesVytenis Andriukaitis, European Commissioner for health and food safety, said the study confirmed the need for EU action. “As a doctor I can honestly say that vaccination is truly one of the greatest successes of public health of our time and the most cost effective tool in our hands,” he said. “Some of the key issues we need to address are fighting misinformation and the lack of awareness in the general population on the risks posed by diseases preventable through vaccination.”Newsletter promotion -

Chief among those are a new dark mode that turns the screen black and so makes the app easier to look at.People will also be able to add custom nicknames, emoji and colours to each of their chats, which the site says will make it easier to follow inidual chats.The central part of the new app is three tabs: Chats, People and Discover. The app opens on Chats, which contains all of the messages you have sent to normal people People will include friends, stories and a list of people who are online at that moment and Discover will feature everything else, such as businesses, games and ways of following the news.The redesign has included re-writing the Messenger app from the bottom up to make its code more simple. That has made it easier to add new features – like dark mode, which will arrive in the near future – and Facebook says that more will be coming in the future, too.Facebook Messenger on the desktop – which, unlike the app, is accessible from within the main Facebook website – will not be changed for now and so will keep the current look.The new design will be rolled out gradually to users around the world, in part to ensure that the changes are not too sudden.\u0026nbspIt can take time to get used to a new way to use an app you rely on every day, which is why we\u0027re rolling out Messenger 4 in phases, the company said in a blog post.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

She also defended an incident on reality show\u0026nbspThe Real Housewives Of New York, in which\u0026nbspLuAnn de Lesseps\u0026nbspused blackface to dress up as Diana Ross. De Lesseps apologised for the costume at the time, but denied she used blackface.\u0026nbsp“There was a controversy on The Real Housewives of New York with Luann, and she dressed as Diana Ross, and she made her skin look darker than it really is and people said that that was racist,” Kelly said. “And I don’t know, I felt like who doesn’t love Diana Ross? She wants to look like Diana Ross for one day. I don’t know how, like, that got racist on Halloween.”“I haven’t seen it. I have not seen it, but it sounds a little racist to me,”\u0026nbspMSNBC correspondent Jacob Soboroff, who had joined Kelly for the segment, replied. Indeed, Kelly’s fellow panellists disagreed with her, as\u0026nbspauthor and television host Melissa Rivers said: “If you think it’s offensive, it probably is. Whatever happened to just, manners and polite society?”The segment was roundly criticised, not only for Kelly’s comments, but for the fact the panel failed to include a single non-white guest, and for the failure to discuss the brutal history of blackface.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspKelly’s note to her colleagues added: “When we had the roundtable discussion earlier today about the controversy of making your face look like a different race as part of a Halloween costume, I suggested that this seemed okay if done as part of this holiday where people have the chance to make themselves look like others.”“The iconic Diana Ross came up as an example. To me, I thought, why would it be controversial for someone dressing up as Diana Ross to make herself look like this amazing woman as a way of honoring and respecting her? I realize now that such behavior is indeed wrong, and I am sorry. The history of blackface in our culture is abhorrent the wounds too deep.”Follow\u0026nbspIndependent Culture\u0026nbspon Facebook for all the latest on Film, TV, Music, and moreShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

They found a series of signs that suggested black holes are closely orbiting each other.Before black holes fully merge together, they form what is known as a binary black hole, swirling around each other in orbit before they eventually get close and smash into each other. Scientists have spotted evidence of smaller black holes crashing into each other since 2015, by measuring the gravitational waves that are sent out into the universe.But scientists haven’t yet been able to see evidence of the bigger, supermassive binary black holes.Now scientists have examined the powerful jets that are thrown out by supermassive black holes. As the binary black holes orbit each other, the jet coming out will occasionally change direction – by mapping those as they change, scientists can confirm that those binary black holes do exist.“We have studied the jets in different conditions for a long time with computer simulations,” said\u0026nbspMartin Krause, lead author and senior lecturer in Astronomy at the University of Hertfordshire.\u0026nbsp”In this first systematic comparison to high-resolution radio maps of the most powerful radio sources, we were astonished to find signatures that were compatible with jet precession in three quarters of the sources.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But it is also clear that we will not rush a deal through at the expense of our principles or our agreed commitments, most notably on the Irish border question.Frans Timmerman: EU will not sacrifice principles to get Brexit deal“With all of this in mind we must now continue negotiating with patience, calm, and an open mind. The commission and our chief negotiator Michel Barnier received the full backing of all our leaders to do just that. It is time to deliver and we’re getting on with the job.”Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 26Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in LondonDemonstrators pass Trafalgar Square as they take part in a march calling for a People\u0027s Vote on the final Brexit deal, in central London on October 20, 2018. - Britons dreading life outside Europe gathered from all corners of the UK to London on Saturday to try to stop their country\u0027s looming breakup with the EU.Demonstrators wave Union and European flags and hold up placards as they pass Trafalgar Square, taking part in a march calling for a People\u0027s Vote on the final Brexit deal, in central London on October 20, 2018. - Britons dreading life outside Europe gathered from all corners of the UK to London on Saturday to try to stop their country\u0027s looming breakup with the EU.

Most recently the UK and EU have considered extending the transition period or setting up elements of a customs union between the UK and EU after Brexit.But any deal would also have to satisfy eurosceptics in the Conservative party, who are threatening to unseat Ms May, and her DUP allies in Northern Ireland, who have rejected a series of possible solutions on the basis that the treat the province differently to the rest of the UK.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We will take responsibility and sort out this mess with a people’s vote.”Speaking to The Independent beforehand, she said many Tory MPs were privately supportive of a second referendum amid bitter isions in the party.Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran said the sheer scale of the event showed that “confidence is growing” in the fight for a fresh vote.To huge cheers, London mayor Sadiq Khan said the march marked a\u0026nbsp“historic moment in our democracy”.Over 700,000 protesters’ call for second Brexit referendumTheresa May told she’s ‘heading for dead end’ in Brexit talksThe collective spreading cheer to Brexit-weary BritsEx-cabinet secretaries condemn Tory Brexiteers for undermining MayFinal Say: Meet some of the people marching a fresh Brexit vote He told protestors: “We’ve heard some complain that a public vote would be undemocratic and unpatriotic. But the opposite is true.“There’s nothing more democratic – nothing more British – than trusting the people to have the final say on our future.”MPs from across the political spectrum addressed the rally, including Green MP Caroline Lucas, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable, Labour’s Chuka Umunna and Tory MP Dr Sarah Wollaston, who drew huge cheers when she compared\u0026nbspBrexit to a botched operation.Christian Broughton, editor of The Independent,\u0026nbsptold the crowds: “Theresa May says that the Final Say referendum will be a politicians’ vote, not a people’s vote, but we can all remember what some politicians told us in 2016.“We, the people, can all now see what’s really coming. And from where I’m standing it looks like a people’s vote to me.”He revealed that The Independent’s petition for a Final Say had achieved more than 940,000 signatures, adding: “We have to keep on showing up and signing up.”People did show up in their thousands for the march, which was extremely cheerful, except for a handful of Ukip protestors who screamed\u0026nbsp“Losers”\u0026nbspat passers-by from outside Downing Street.An army of students, college pupils and young activists led the march in a sign of the impact of the Brexit vote on the younger generation, some 1.4 million of whom have become eligible to vote since the referendum.Femi Oluwole, from the youth group Our Future Our Choice, told The Independent: “What we are trying to do is bring people together, as nobody has any confidence in what the government is doing.”He said young people were going to be hit hardest by Brexit, both economically and in the opportunities to live and work abroad.Among the crowds was Piero Passet, a 71-year-old restaurant owner from Turin, said he was marching because he was concerned for the future of the younger generation.Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 26Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in LondonDemonstrators pass Trafalgar Square as they take part in a march calling for a People\u0027s Vote on the final Brexit deal, in central London on October 20, 2018. - Britons dreading life outside Europe gathered from all corners of the UK to London on Saturday to try to stop their country\u0027s looming breakup with the EU.Demonstrators wave Union and European flags and hold up placards as they pass Trafalgar Square, taking part in a march calling for a People\u0027s Vote on the final Brexit deal, in central London on October 20, 2018. - Britons dreading life outside Europe gathered from all corners of the UK to London on Saturday to try to stop their country\u0027s looming breakup with the EU.

This is my firm belief and this is my understanding of democracy.”Mr Bullmann’s intervention is particularly significant because EU figures have so far been reticent to call for a second vote – for fear they might be seen as interfering in Britain\u0027s\u0026nbsppolitics.But the vast show of support on the streets of the capital has apparently encouraged some in Brussels and Strasbourg to break cover and speak out.Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 26Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in LondonDemonstrators pass Trafalgar Square as they take part in a march calling for a People\u0027s Vote on the final Brexit deal, in central London on October 20, 2018. - Britons dreading life outside Europe gathered from all corners of the UK to London on Saturday to try to stop their country\u0027s looming breakup with the EU.Demonstrators wave Union and European flags and hold up placards as they pass Trafalgar Square, taking part in a march calling for a People\u0027s Vote on the final Brexit deal, in central London on October 20, 2018. - Britons dreading life outside Europe gathered from all corners of the UK to London on Saturday to try to stop their country\u0027s looming breakup with the EU.

Some have falsely accused him of being a Nazi collaborator during World War II, when he was a child in Hungary. Most recently, he has been accused by some elected Republicans of funding the migrant caravan making its way from central America into Mexico, something there is no evidence to suggest is true.The device sent to Clinton was similar to the one found on Monday at Mr Soros\u0027 home, the Times reported, citing a law enforcement official.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Ulster veteran refuses life-saving treatment to clear name                Veteran hounded by nation he served is a disgrace \u0026ndash STEPHEN POLLARDFour British veterans - three of them elderly - face trial over Northern Ireland shootings dating back to 1972 as part of investigations into so-called legacy killings.All were cleared of wrongdoing at the time.They include Dennis Hutchings, 77, who is seriously ill.The  this week revealed that the pressure has driven him to suicidal thoughts.Another 278 cases involving British soldiers in Northern Ireland also face re-investigation.Yet under Tony Blair\u0027s 1998 Good Friday Agreement, 500 terrorists were freed from prison early and about 300 suspects were given letters of comfort or on the run letters guaranteeing they would not be prosecuted.The Northern Ireland witch-hunt follows the persecution over several years of thousands of Iraq war veterans.Dennis Hutchings with MP Richard Benyon (Image: Tim Clarke)More than 3,500 claims were levelled at them, mostly by a now disgraced firm of solicitors.This led to taxpayer costs of \u0026pound60million without leading to one prosecution.There are fears that veterans of future and past conflicts such as the Falklands will be sucked into the legal maelstrom without firm action by Downing Street.The letter states: It is blatantly obvious that the current process of investigating and re-investigating veterans, for incidents which were all investigated at the time, is completely at odds with the Government\u0027s manifesto commitments and the Armed Forces Covenant. We therefore believe that this situation simply cannot be allowed to continue as it is.It adds: The Iraq Historic Allegations Team furore showed us how our judicial system can be abused and how it can damage our security services.The legacy of the Northern Ireland Troubles threatens to do just the same, and we believe it is time for the Government to act comprehensively and put it all behind us.                Army veteran completes THIS challenge for The Royal British Legion                May under pressure to END expats state pension FREEZEBeginning of letter to Theresa May (Image: NC)We call upon you as Prime Minister to work alongside the Secretary of State for Defence, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the Attorney General to ensure we find a solution to this challenging and complex problem.The letter insists that any solution must cover veterans of Northern Ireland, Iraq and Afghanistan together.The Northern Ireland Office recently closed a consultation on proposals to create a Historic Inquiries Unit to tackle \u0027legacy\u0027 killings.The plan was slammed earlier this year by Justice for Northern Ireland Veterans as paving the way to breaches of human rights laws.Signatories of yesterday\u0027s letter said the present plans as set out in the Stormont House Agreement clearly put our service and security personnel at an exceptional disadvantage.Mrs May\u0027s official spokesman said 16,000 people had responded to the NIO consultation but he did not comment on the public letter.He said: You will know that there is a consultation which has been taking place in relation to this issue. The consultation was to allow everyone a say on the proposals in the 2014 Stormont House Agreement in relation to \u0027legacy\u0027 and how we best move forward. Everyone deserves the opportunity to be heard.Second part of the letter to Theresa May with signatures (Image: NC)The Government will consider carefully all views received and provide a response as soon as we can. Overall, 16,000 people have responded to the consultation.The chief executive of Belfast-based Relatives for Justice, Mark Thompson, whose brother was killed by the Army in 1990, dismissed claims that troops were independently investigated during The Troubles.He told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme that the system was constructed in such a way to prevent justice being done.Mr Thompson said: When it comes to the British Army and the Tory Party and rule of law, they want to talk about the rule of law when it is applied to everyone else but not the soldiers.More than 3,500 people were killed including 722 members of the Armed Forces and Police during The Troubles between the late 1960s and 1998.Government figures suggest that 60 per cent of killings were caused by Republican terrorists, mainly factions of the IRA, 30 per cent by Loyalist paramilitaries, and 10 per cent by members of state forces who in almost all cases were acting within the law.From top to bottom: Julian Lewis MP, Admiral Lord West, Colonel Bob Stewart (Image: )Pledge of support from the Defence SecretaryDEFENCE Secretary Gavin Williamson yesterday vowed to support accused elderly veterans.Prime Minister Theresa May has also already told Attorney General Geoffrey Cox to find a solution.A team has been set up in the Cabinet Office, taking advice from the Ministry of Defence and the Northern Ireland Office.They will have to take into account the findings of the NIO\u0027s consultation on the legacy killings which drew 16,000 responses from the public.Recommendations are due to be sent by Christmas with an announcement in the new year. Mr Williamson is known to favour a time limit for prosecutions.He told the : We are indebted to those who served with great courage and distinction to bring about peace and security in Northern Ireland.That is why I don\u0027t want to see elderly veterans having to face repeated investigations decades after the events in question.He said the MoD has put in place a comprehensive package of support, including legal representation to any inidual accused of an offence arising from their service on operations.From top to bottom: Richard Dannatt, Richard Benyon MP, Mark Francois MP (Image: )COMMENT BY JOHN INGHAMBREXIT is far from the only political minefield Theresa May has to navigate, the Prime Minister was reminded yesterday.Providing closure over killings in Northern Ireland\u0027s Troubles is just as tough.The general election left her dependent on the Democratic Unionist Party and firmly dumped veterans in the crossfire between Sinn Fein and the unionists.She must find a solution that is legally sound but satisfies the unionists by not letting the IRA off the hook.The shameful betrayal of veterans, dispatched to Northern Ireland to keep the peace and now being hounded in their later years, has infuriated Mrs May\u0027s backbenchers.Fears persist that the Northern Ireland legal system continues to be riven with sectarianism, with avowed republicans among the judiciary.Small wonder British soldiers facing trial in the province have no confidence they will get a fair hearing.One effective option would be to give the UK Attorney General the final say on whether veterans can be prosecuted. Another is to ensure cases investigated at the time cannot be reinvestigated without significant new evidence.Terror suspects given comfort letters by Tony Blair - and who have not been fully investigated - could go to trial. This though would be fiercely resisted by Sinn Fein.An alternative is a South Africa-style Truth and Reconciliation Commission where perpetrators could detail their actions without incriminating themselves.This would give closure but stick in the craw of many.The nuclear option is for the UK to quit the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and leave its troops governed instead by the Geneva Convention.The ECHR allows lethal force only as a last resort, in contrast to the Geneva Convention, which allows it as a first resort against an enemy.Unlike the UK, the US is not governed by the ECHR. Unlike British veterans, their US counterparts do not live in fear of a knock on the door, years after returning from battle.

So is Hammond’s next door.Whoever takes over — Boris, David Davis or Jeremy Hunt — needs an emergency clear-out.The big guns of the Treasury need to be pointed at the “enemy” not its own side.After two long, wasted years, Britain is engaged in an unexpectedly desperate fight, not just to salvage Brexit but to save British democracy.Weekend crowds demanding a second referendum seem oblivious to the threat such a crazy re-run would pose to this nation’s centuries-old stability, ironically the envy of Europe.We cannot reverse the  referendum without turning Brexit into a perpetual running sore. And Britain can never rejoin the EU except on its knees.The only way to put this corrosive issue to bed is for Brexit to succeed — as it will, despite treacherous Tony Blair and Facebook hypocrite Nick Clegg.To succeed as we must we need a new chancellor as well as a new prime minister.Diehard Remainer Phil Hammond should be first out the door.It was Spreadsheet Phil who vetoed vital preparations for No Deal — now a better-than - prospect with time rapidly running out.And it was Hammond who surrendered the one negotiating weapon Brussels fears most — a thriving, low-tax Britain competing with the EU on its doorstep.Our economic fate is entirely in our hands. We can make taxes and tarfs as competitive as we like.Better investment incentives and lower corporation tax rates would trigger a flood of foreign investment in UK plc — and ensure car makers like Nissan and Toyota never leave our shores.Yet the British Chancellor of the Exchequer has ruled them out.“Phil is like those Harry Potter Dementor creatures,” says a top Tory. “He sucks the le out of any room he happens to be in.”Hammond is easily replaced. Michael Gove, an ex-future PM but a formidable Cabinet minister, has the drive and imagination to take on the Treasury “Blob”.There is no shortage of Brexit talent on the Tory benches.Just compare thundering Attorney General Geoffrey Cox QC with prissy dried-stick predecessor Dominic Grieve.Grieve is busy sabotaging Brexit. Cox finds ways to make it work.He is now “marking Number Ten’s homework” on Mrs May’s wretched Northern Ireland “backstop”.Some even tip him as a dark horse in the leadership stakes.There is one other big change needed at the heart of Britain’s Brexit team.Our next PM must have a new EU negotiator.Nobody could be worse than Olly Robbins, already reportedly eyeing up a £m-a-year golden parachute into a top City job.Lelong Europhile Robbins has led Mrs May into so many disastrous EU traps — especially her humiliation in Salzburg — he is often cast as an EU “double agent”.It was Robbins who told EU negotiator Michel Barnier that Britain might stay indefinitely in “transition” while the fantasy Northern Ireland backstop was sorted out.And pay £bn more on top of the £bn ransom for the privilege.The idea that Robbins is the “EU’s man in Whitehall” is not such a stretch when you consider his Jeremy Corbyn-style applause for Communist Russia.Kremlin leaders, he told fellow Oxford students in , “changed Russia from a backward peasant autocracy, despised by the West, into a technological giant at whom the world cowered in fear for half a century.”Everyone is entitled to youthful naivety.But can anyone imagine Olly Robbins fighting our corner for EU democracy and accountability, let alone the referendum verdict of .m Brexit-voting Brits SAUDI Arabia’s rulers must be really annoyed with dissident Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.This elderly trouble maker walked alone into his country’s Turkish consulate knowing he might never emerge alive.He was clearly looking for trouble.Once inside, using his bare hands, he attacked a gang of  innocent Saudi torturers who had just flown in for a couple of hours’ holiday armed only with a bone saw and a hypodermic syringe.Then, to the embarrassment of kindly Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, he went and hid his own body.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I didn’t reply at the time but I’m going to give Sun readers the answer now – and it’s very simple.None of this is about me. It’s all about you.That’s why, when I’m confronted with tough choices during the Brexit negotiations, I don’t think about what the implications are for me. Instead, I ask myself what it means for you, for your family and for the whole of the United Kingdom.Am I bringing back control of your money, your borders and your laws Am I protecting your jobs and making sure nothing gets in the way of our brilliant entrepreneurs and small businesses Am I protecting the integrity of the United Kingdom And, above all, am I delivering the Brexit that the people of this country so clearly voted for I need to be able to answer “Yes” to every one of these questions.Andthat means there are some dficult days in Brussels, well that’s just something I have to deal with.Because the Brexit talks are not about me or my personal fortunes. They’re about the national interest – and that means making the right choices, not the easy ones.Inevitably, that will take time. Brexit is the UK’s biggest constitutional change for generations. Unpicking more than  years of treaties, agreements and laws would be a challenge under any circumstances and, as no country has ever left the EU before, it’s not asthere’s an instruction manual for those either side of the negotiating table to follow.I know it can seem like the talks are never-ending, and that many of you have been frustrated by the endless back and forth on technical points – I certainly feel that way sometimes too.But with five months to go until we leave the EU, we have already reached agreement on the vast majority of our exit deal.What became clear at last week’s meeting in Brussels is that the very last stages of the talks are going to be the hardest of all.This includes dealing with the so-called “backstop”: making sure that, no matter what our new relationship with Europe looks like, there will be no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.I’ve been very clear that this must be achieved without creating any kind of border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK – doing so would undermine our precious Union and put at risk the hard-won peace.So I am working closely with my counterparts in Europe to explore every possible solution to the border issue.Does that mean I think this negotiation will get tougher before we reach our goal  YesDo I have some long and dficult days ahead  I’m sure I do.But what I’m thinking about is not how hard it all is today.I’m thinking about the prize that lies before us tomorrow about the great opportunities the Government will help open up for you once we clear the last few hurdles.As we enter the final, crucial phase of the talks there will undoubtedly be some unexpected challenges to which we must rise.But the finish line is in sight. And I am more determined than ever that we will get there together, with a Brexit deal that’s right for you, right for your family and right for our country.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Smoking tobacco is bad news.But vaping is dferent.You heat up a solution called an e-liquid, which typically contains nicotine, a propellant called propylene glycol and or vegetable glycerin and flavourings.What you don’t do is burn tobacco or produce tar or carbon monoxide — two of the most harmful elements of all in tobacco smoke.Sure, some vapes may contain a fraction of some of the harmful chemicals found in cigarette smoke, but they are present at much lower levels,detectable at all.So are they safe  According to all the international medically-reviewed evidence from such expert organisations as Public Health England, the Royal Colleges of Physicians and General Practitioners, the British Medical Association and Cancer Research UK, e-cigarettes are at least  per cent safer than traditional cigarettes.The American Cancer Society and the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine both agree with them.Yes, the nicotine, of course, is addictive. But so what  So is caffeine, even eating.Contrary to popular belief, nicotine does not give you cancer and it is relatively harmless generally.Apparently only  per cent of the population know this.Happily, there is no evidence of harm to other people from vaping and,used instead of nicotine replacement gum or patches, may even help expectant mums remain smoke-free in the long term.As a doctor I don’t want any young person or non-nicotine user to try vaping. Ever. Period.As it happens, regular use of e-cigs among “never” smokers is still very rare at just . per cent.But look at what they’ve done to help tobacco smokers quit.In the UK, .million vapers have quit smoking completely and more than , have given up both smoking and vaping.In fact, this is Britain’s most popular method of quitting with two-thirds stopping successfully when used alongside professional stop-smoking NHS support.In this country we have some of the strictest regulations in the world.E-cigs are subject to minimum standards of quality and safety as well as clear packaging and labelling requirements.All ingredients have to be notied, advertising is prohibited in media such as television, newspapers and magazines, it is illegal to sell them to under s and to adults intending to pass them on to under s.That is responsible regulation whichever way you look at it.This month’s national Stoptober campaign recommends using e- cigarettes as a stop-smoking aid andit helps some of the million smokers in the UK kick the habit for good then perhaps doctors like me will see fewer people in our surgeries struggling to breath or devastated by a cancer diagnosis.AndI see any ex-smoking patients of mine having a quiet vape outside my surgery door, I shall give them a heartfelt pat on the back and cherish the fact that there will be one less nasty fag end polluting the street.NICOTINE contained in e-liquids is a highly addictive substance that raises blood pressure and spikes your adrenalin, increasing the chances of having a heart attack.This is particularly worrying as we see a number of iniduals who are constantly vaping, especially as it is seen as more convenient and cost-effective than lighting up a cigarette, as well as being considered more socially acceptable to vape indoors.While vaping appears to be safer than cigarettes, the truth is that it hasn’t been around long enough for us to know the potential damage it can cause to our health.The long-term effects of the chemicals contained in e-liquids haven’t been examined.However, I have looked into ious research that has been carried out on certain e-liquids that were found to contain substances that can cause damage to the immune system and are linked to other health conditions such as cancer.Vaping isn’t great for your oral health either.It’s common for vaping to cause a dry mouth, and I’ve met a number of iniduals who have developed oral thrush, most likely caused by vaping.Although nicotine does not have a colour, it becomes yellow when combined with oxygen which could lead to tooth discolouration.As nicotine is a vasocon-strictor, it limits blood flow in oral tissue, which can cause gum disease and bad breath.As time goes on, I am reading new research which proves vaping has a negative effect on health.To what extent, only time will tell.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Why do they not get paid what they are worth to their company, and why are so many overlooked for promotion The sad fact is that for every £ men earn, women make just  pence.Just over one in ten women negotiated their starting salary, while more than half of all men haggle with their boss before they have even started work.When women do ask for more pay, they are  per cent less likely to get a raise. Andthey do receive a wage increase it will be  per cent less than men get.Sadly, it is common in business that women are often viewed as weak or unable to cope. And once we think about or start a family, we become toxic to employers.I receive hundreds of direct messages on social media from women asking: “How do I get a pay rise  How do I get noticed at work  How can I get promoted  How can I get on after maternity leave ”So now I am launching Get What You Want, a series of online masterclasses and podcasts covering everything from getting promoted to dealing with the word no, overcoming challenges, negotiating pay, writing a fantastic CV and nailing an interview.It will also cover baby-proofing careers, as well as becoming a super-mum after maternity leave.A lot of women have skills but just lack confidence. As women, we don’t shout about our wins enough for fear we will appear arrogant, even though men talk about them all the time.Here are some of my tips to winning at work.When people say: “I hate my job” I always ask: “Why are you telling me  I can’t do anything about it.”YOU have to do something. Sit down and work out what it is you don’t like about the position and set yourself a task of getting a new one.Be very dedicated and very professional and excel when you get to the interview.Many people don’t realise that when you are invited for an interview it is because they believe you can do the job.The secret is convincing them that you can do the job better than anyone .You should be able to talk about your specialist subject, which is yourself.People find it very dficult to list all the things they have done really well in a professional way to show good examples of why they can do the job.Opening a negotiation is all about knowing your worth.And knowing your value is really about your self-worth. They are totally linked.Write down all the things where you have made a big ­contribution, all the things that you have changed and made a dference, how you have added value. Put together testimonials to really back up what you have done.Then work out what more you want to do, because going above and beyond your job description is very important.Take out all the emotion, go in and lay out for your boss the facts of what you’ve contributed to the organisation.Sometimes people can be very passive. They say: “I’ll go along with what everyone  agrees with.”They want to avoid conflict. They don’t really think their opinion is as important as other people’s, so they are simply giving others a licence to ignore them.Learn to say no. Say: “I don’t really have the time butI can make the time I can do it for you.” Otherwise you become like a human sponge. Don’t let them take advantage.Employers take advantage of women’s lack of confidence, especially a mother ing from maternity leave. Many feel so grateful to have a job that they tend to put up with almost anything.Eleven per cent of new mothers report that they have been dismissed or made redundant where others in their workplace were not, or were treated so poorly they felt they had to leave.That means as many as , women are losing their jobs each year.Have a really clear plan of how you will manage at home and manage work.

Ms Knightley, who adds, “Rescue yourself,” clearly feels she is protecting daughter Edie by banning something that doesn’t concur with her own off-the-shelf, Poundland version of what feminism should be.But what she’s in danger of doing is wilfully nurturing a potential “snowflake” who, rather than develop the critical thinking skills that allow healthy debate, will simply stick their fingers in their ears and cry foul when they see or hear something that dfers from their own world view.Keira, tonight’s homework is to really readCinderella and analyse it.Look past the Disney-esque cute rodents, pretty frocks and glass slippers and instead dig a little deeper to ­appreciate the original’s narrative of how hope can turn unjust oppression into ­triumphant reward.Cinderella is a young woman who has not only suffered the loss of her loving father, but now faces a letime of abuse from an uncaring stepmother and her equally unpleasant daughters.But instead of sitting in the ashes ­waiting unquestioningly for whatever fate might have in store for her, she remains resolutely ­optimistic and decides to secretly defy her nemesis by gatecrashing a hot-ticket party to which she hasn’t been invited.Now that’s girl power.Ultimately, she “‘rescues” herself by proactively going to the ball where, instead of abuse, she experiences the redemptive qualities of love and kindness.They just happen to come in the form of a handsome prince.In the same week, Kristen Bell — who coincidentally voices Anna in the Disney film Frozen — found herself caught up in the slipstream of Keira’s PC virtue signalling after reportedly saying that Snow White gives young girls the wrong ­message about consent “because you cannot kiss someonethey’re sleeping”.Except Kristen’s comment was taken out of context and she’s got the balance right.Because what she actually said was that she reads the story with her two ­daughters, aged five and three, then asks them: “Don’t you think it’s weird that Snow White didn’t ask the old witch why she needed to eat the apple ” before starting up a conversation about the dos and don’ts of taking food from strangers.Or, “Don’t you think that it’s weird that the prince kisses Snow White without her permission ” to float an almost subliminal, age-appropriate understanding of what does and doesn’t constitute ­consent.Kristen isn’t banning tales of old, she’s using them to stimulate discussions.In other words, teaching her children the vital le skills of critical thinking — dictionary definition: “the objective analysis and evaluation of an issue in order to form a judgment” — and being able to rationally debate that judgment with someone whose view might dfer from your own.Attempting to sanitise a child’s world by airbrushing history will hinder, not help them.Instead, wield history’s lessons as a tool to educate.Cinderella was of its time and now the Disney pendulum has seemingly swung the other way to depict a world where all the central characters are feisty, opinionated young women who power-kick their way through le.But how will Keira’s daughter know how far the depiction of Disney ­princesses has comeshe’s not allowed to see where they’ve been ONE morning last week, I spent a glorious couple of hours walking around Westminster Abbey.Buried or commemorated there are, among others, more than , great Britonsincluding Sir Isaac Newton, Jane Austen, Noel Coward, Charles Darwin, the Bronte sisters, Clement Attlee, Charles Dickens, David Livingstone, Stephen Hawking and, of course, the grave of the unknown warrior, buried on November ,  “in honour of the many multitudes who during the Great War of - gave the most that man can give . . . le itself.”My mother works at the Abbey as a “blue-gowner” – the volunteer guides there to answer any questions not covered by the electronic headsets – and, while showing us the ft by ft grave of poet Ben Jonson, who is the only person there to be buried upright, she was approached by a couple of earnest-looking women in their early twenties.Amid such a rich seam of history, rigorous intellect and achievement, what did they ask “Excuse me, where did David Beckham sit for the royal wedding ”THE number of stay-at-home dads has dropped to the lowest level in five years.Experts reckon it could be due to men “growing tired” of the tough job of raising kids.Proof,needed, might be the glassy-eyed expression of Bond actor Daniel Craig,  just six weeks after we Rachel Weisz gave birth to their daughter.He never looks this knackered when he’s jumping off buildings and dodging bullets.Stay-at-home parenthood can be isolating, sometimes dull, frequently thankless and relentlessly bloody exhausting. Only the strong survive it.THANKS to Ryanair’s ­astonishing failure to act when a passenger racially abused Windrush immigrant Delsie Gayle on one of its flights, the man will likely escape prosecution because of jurisdictional issues once a plane takes off from one country’s airspace to another.Instead, he is likely only to be banned from ever travelling on Ryanair again.Which, as plenty of the budget airline’s past ­customers might tell you, could equally be regarded as a blessing rather than a punishment.COMEDIAN Seann Walsh and his Strictly partner Katya Jones have survived the dreaded dance-off to, presumably, jive another day.Because, let’s face it, since that snog, the Strictly bosses are ­rapidly running out of drearily chaste dances to give them.Last weekend it was the unsexy Charleston, ­performed in equally unsexy “Where’s Wally” outfits that virtually screamed “nothing to see here”.

Im shocked to see it go on for so long like this.It looks to me like she could have died, but Ive got no reason to think she was killed by someone - why would she be I do think she could be abroad somewhere - she has an apartment abroad.I have no idea why she would have left - no matter what happened on that Tuesday she would have wanted to take her children with her.Ronald also revealed he had been contacted by a man from Farnborough last week claiming to have been in a relationship with Sarah.But the mum had reportedly told him in June she was seeing someone new and was no longer with him.He said: He said they were messaging each other every day until she went missing - and he hasnt heard from her since.I remember her telling me in June that she and this man in Farnborough werent together anymore, but he seemed to think they were still in a relationship.It comes as Kent police said detectives from the Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate investigating as they confirmed her disappearance is totally out of character.Detective Superintendent Paul Fotheringham said: Shed just had a new job offer she was looking forward to.She has spoken to friends about looking forward to the future and, most signicantly, she has now missed one of her childrens birthdays.Her frantic family have been appealing for information after it was revealed her car was left outside her home and she has not used her phone or bank card since she vanished.Last night, her distraught dad Anthony Wellgreen, , said: “I don’t understand it at all.

Theyre friends with our grandchildren so we know each other as families.I feel so sorry for them. This is absolutely awful.Another, who spoke with Sarah the day she vanished, said: She made a joke, saying oh, you got here before me today.She was really happy and smiley, not acting strangely or like she was going to disappear.Its really out of character for her. Its weird.Cops are now asking for anyone who saw anything suspicious in the village overnight on October  to come forward.They are also urging locals to check outhouses and areas surrounding their properties for any sign of Sarah.DSI Fotheringham said: We have experts with specialist technology and forensic scientists working with us to try and find Sarah.We are particularly interested to hear from anyone with fixed CCTV cameras within a five mile radius of New Ash Green, whether this is residential or commercial CCTV to come forward.Likewise, anyone who was out on the evening of the  October to the morning of  October in that five mile area who has dashcam in their vehicle, please contact us.We are also appealing to those living and working in the area bordered by the A, M, Meopham, Cobham, Horton Kirby and Darenth to check their sheds, outbuildings and areas of rough ground or woodland for any sign of Sarah.It is believed Sarahs complicated private le may hold vital clues to her disappearance, pals say.Her and Nerf gun fanatic Ben split up following the birth of the twins but six months ago she moved back in with the cabbie.Sarah, who also has two older sons — Lewis Burdett, , and Jack,  — still worked in Portsmouth and is said to have spent time in Surrey, where colleagues believe she had found a new man through online dating.Martin Prus, , her manager at Puresun Hair and Beauty Centre in Portsmouth, told The Sun this week: “She is always in dferent locations. She is a very busy woman.“I know she had been travelling between Portsmouth, Kent and somewhere near Guildford in Surrey.“We know she was connected to at least three areas.“In Portsmouth she was with her eldest sons, and when in Kent she was with her ex-partner.“They were sharing the children, that’s what I know.Mr Prus added that Sarah, thought to have been married three times, worked at the salon full-time for around two years before going part-time when she moved back to Kent.She is also believed to own a home in Portsmouth which she rents out.On Tuesday last week, police arrested a man in his s for questioning. He has since been released pending further inquiries.One of the last sightings of Sarah — who friends describe as a “bubbly” and “friendly” mum — was on the morning she disappeared.Police have spent several days searching her home as well as trawling through social media and dating sites for clues.Officers have also used drones and dogs to search an area of woods they have cordoned off near her and Ben’s £, terraced home.Over the weekend, police also searched land and fields by a nearby private hospital and pub, and woodland in Ridley, about two miles away from where she lived.Yesterday, search teams moved to Foxborough Woods, Hartley, around a mile from her street.Despite her connections in other counties, Kent Police say no other forces are involved in the investigation.Sarah’s oldest son Lewis has put out several appeals on social media, which have been shared thousands of times.He described his mum’s disappearance as completely out of character, saying that she was “happy, with no problems”.He said that the day before she went missing, she had also found out she had got a new job, adding: “So everything was great”.If anyone has any information please call Kent Police on   , Freephone    quoting - or ring Crimestoppers anonymously on   .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Therefore there is no other way but to continue the talks.Since Prime Minister May mentioned the idea of extending the transition period, let me repeat thatthe UK decided that such an extension would be helpful to reach a deal, Im sure that the leaders would be ready to consider it positively.He added that the EU was ready to call an emergency summit as soon as the two sides are ready to sign off on a deal.But Guy Verhofstadt of the European Parliament tweeted: Progress on the #Brexit negotiations can be %, % or even %, but as long as there is no solution for the Irish border, as long as the Good Friday agreement is not fully secured, for us in our Parliament progress is %.Leading Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns has restarted her campaign to kick out Mrs May - claiming a leadership election could take just two weeks.She said: Only a leader who genuinely believes in Brexit can deliver Brexit, and we need to start playing hardball to get a better deal for Britain.The PM will tonight give a speech to the  Committee of backbench Tory MPs where she will aim to shore up her support and see off threats to her leadership.Mrs May received a boost today as Labour ex-minister Caroline Flint predicted as many as  of her colleagues could back her Brexit deal.If the PM won the support of that many Labour MPs, it would be enough to cancel out an expected rebellion from Tory Brexiteers.Jeremy Heywood stood down on a temporary basis over the summer after being diagnosed with the illness.Today he confirmed that he is leaving the civil service after  years - he will be replaced as Cabinet Secretary by Mark Sedwill, the PMs national security adviser who has been doing the job on a temporary basis.Sir Jeremy used his leaving statement to hit out at Brexiteers who have accused the civil service of trying to undermine the Governments EU policy.He said: Despite a number of recent noises off from anonymous commentators, I believe that the service is in robust health, well-equipped to provide the support the country needs over the coming months and years.Mrs May paid tribute to Sir Jeremy, saying: I am personally grateful to him for the support he has given me as Prime Minister.He has made an enormous contribution to public le in our country and will be sorely missed.The ex-Cabinet Secretary is set to become a le peer."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000444091145.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"grand designs concrete home","story":"Deep-sea er, Adrian Corrigall and his we Megan spent  months building their house in Lewes, East Sussex, entirely out on concrete.The controversial development will appear on tonights episode of Channel s Grand Designs which sees host Kevin voice scepticism, comparing the property to a car park and electricity substation, adding that it doesnt look homely enough.Adrian, , and we Megan spent £, on the plot of land and budgeted to spend an additional £, on building the property.However, the couple ran into unexpected costs, adding £, to the final bill, forcing Adrian to take deep-sea ing jobs to bring in the cash, leaving Megan to manage the building of the house solo.She said: We have had an absolute nightmare, we’ve got credit cards and god knows what up to our eyeballs.She adds: We were pushed into this position where we couldn’t do anything, we had to go and get some money.

Women told how the Tories six-in-one benefit left them with pound, childcare bills, late payment fines and even being kicked out of nursery. One mum said she was forced to turn down her dream job because it would have left her with just pound a day for food, bills, nappies and petrol. Thuto Mali, mum to a two-year-old boy, confessed: We were at the food bank last Christmas because it got that bad. It’s not that I don’t want to work - it’s just that work doesnt pay. Heres what they told MPs - and why it matters.  The four women gave evidence to the Work and Pensions Committee as UC - already rolled out to .million people, and due to hit million by December  - pushes the poor to rent arrears and food banks. Theresa May is facing huge pressure to pump more money into the benefit, which has been bundled up with billions in welfare cuts since it launched in . So far campaigners have focused on this and other problems with the benefit, like the five-week wait for payment. But today the single mums talked about a dferent side to the story - how Universal Credit affects childcare. Working parents on UC can claim back % of their nursery fees. Yet they have to pay up-front first, and claim the money back later.  The policy saddled mum-of-two Vikki Waterman with a pound, bill which she had to wait five weeks to be paid back. The -year-old was also fined pound by her nursery because a late benefit payment meant she was two days behind paying for childcare. She told MPs: We dont want to sit at home when we didnt plan to be single parents. We shouldnt be penalised for that. That is not what we are here for. We want to be able to go to work and to provide for our own families, and at the minute it seems asthere is a roadblock everywhere we turn.  Hairdresser and mum-of-three Gaynor Rowles, from Heywood, Greater Manchester, was forced to pay up-front costs for her three-year-old twins. It’s pound per week. Where do I find that money from ” she said. Describing how she was just pound. a week better off in work, I’ve changed as a person. I’m not my normal happy self. Its quite sad really. Theres more people out there who are worse off than me. Ive got good family, good friends and good support. The Mirror are demanding a halt to the expansion of Universal Credit and for a review to take place. We say there are three options:Redesign UC to be fit for purpose Axe it in favour of the old systemUC is unfixable Introduce a brand new systemSign our petition to stop the rollout of Universal Credit across Britain and to replace it with a fairer system by signing our petition. Thuto Mali revealed her little boy was even suspended from nursery. “I was paying, I think, half or three quarters of it and his dad was supposed to pay the other - it didn’t quite happen, she said. So I got whacked with an pound bill. She said she was forced to turn down a job with a pound, salary because after paying pound, a month for a full-time nursery spot for her son she would be left with pound a month to cover bills. Thats effectively pound a day, she said. Work didnt pay for us.  Nail technician Lucy Collins, from Manchester, told MPs she left her job in the police because she couldnt fit shts around her kids, aged  and . Only then did she discover the problems of being on Universal Credit. You just get passed from pillar to post, she said. It’s so complex. And to top it all off - its easier for the middle class  Astonishingly, MPs heard the system is more lenient on well-off parents than it is on people claiming benefits. People on Universal Credit must submit receipts and invoices on an online journal to ensure they get the money back. Dalia Ben-Galim, policy director at the charity Gingerbread, told MPs: Theres a very dferent burden of proof on more middle-class parents. You don’t need to submit receipts - you need to have a registered childcare provider.  The moneys in your account and you, as a parent, are able to transfer that directly. I think that is ideological - it’s an active decision that has been made. Shocked Tory MP Heidi Allen branded the double standard terrible. Committee chairman Frank Field added the whole system is middle-class management of money. It doesn’t take into accountyou have a daily wage or a weekly wage. What the DWP says  A Department for Work and Pensions spokeswoman said: We are doing more than ever before to support parents with the cost of childcare and by - we will be spending around a record pound billion on childcare support. Under Universal Credit, working parents can claim back up to % of eligible childcare costs, compared to % of costs covered under the previous legacy system. This is the highest level of support ever. Andsomeone has accepted an offer of paid work, they are eligible to be paid these costs for the month prior to starting work. This generous provision has been widely welcomed by stakeholders and is available in addition to an entitlement of up to  hours of free childcare.

But she said such agreements shouldnt stop whistleblowers from coming forward over sexual harassment. The Prime Minister was responding to reports that a leading businessman had obtained an injunction to prevent the Dailyrevealing alleged sexual harassment and racial abuse of staff. They said five employees of companies in the group had made allegations of discreditable conduct by the executive. In all five cases complaints had been compromised by settlement agreements under which substantial payments were made to the employees who had complained.  Both sides had undertaken to keep confidential the subject matter of complaints.At Prime Ministers Questions in the House of Commons, Labour MP Jess Phillips said: It seems that our laws allow rich and powerful men to pretty much do whatever they want as long as they can pay to keep it quiet.So does the Prime Minister support the Court of Appeals decision to back non-disclosure agreements which have been used to silence women who have been sexually harassed and others who have been racially abused  Mrs May replied: I cant comment on a particular case that is currently before the courts. What I will say, and what I have said previously, is that sexual harassment in the workplace is against the law. Such abhorrent behaviour should not be tolerated. She added: An employer that allows that harassment of women to go undealt-with is sending a message about how welcome they are and about their value in the workplace. So just as we wont accept any behaviour that causes people to feel intimidated or humiliated in the workplace, there must be consequences for failing to comply with the law. Non-disclosure agreements cannot stop people from whistle-blowing but it is clear some employers are using them unethically. The Government is going to bring forward measures for consideration for consultation to seek to improve the regulation around non-disclosure agreements and make it absolutely explicit to employees when a non-disclosure agreement does not apply or cannot be enforced.  Mrs Mays official spokesman later said that non-disclosure arrangements should never be used to cover up criminal activity. The Government began work earlier this year on measures to improve the regulation around NDAs to ensure that they are used in an ethical manner and for their intended purpose, said the spokesman. Further details will be revealed imminently when a consultation process is launched.A Labour spokesman said the party was committed to ensuring that it is nolonger legal to have non-disclosure agreements which prevent the disclosure of victimisation or harassment or discrimination.In August, High Court judge Mr Justice Haddon-Cave refused to gag the newspaper but the executive - identied in court papers as ABC - and managers at the two companies mounted a challenge. Master of the Rolls Sir Terence Etherton, Lord Justice Underhill and Lord Justice Henderson outlined their decision in a ruling published on Tuesday.

The new benefit has been unravelled by deep cuts to its funding by the Conservatives combined with their stubborn unwillingness to fix glaring flaws in its design. The result is a slow-motion disaster which risks failing to achieve its goals while needlessly pushing tens of thousands of households into poverty. It doesn’t have to be like this. The Conservatives’ failure to competently implement Universal Credit should not blind us to its inherent merits. The Liberal Democrats supported UC in principle because we believed in its aim of simplying our convoluted welfare system and making work pay for those on benefits.  While the current Government’s handling of UC has left it on le support, Liberal Democrats argue that with a pause followed by some major reforms, the system could yet be salvaged. The first big problem with UC is a lack of money. Though initially designed to be more generous than the system it is replacing, in the  summer Budget the Conservatives cut around poundbillion per year from UC’s funding, making it in effect less generous. Many warned at the time of the impact the cuts would have on the poorest, which are only now beginning to be felt. According to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation – where I am giving a speech today - they are likely to push around , people into poverty by .  The second problem is a number of major design flaws which the Conservatives are refusing to fix for ideological reasons. The most well-known of these are the long waits - both for first payment and in-between payments - that are pushing many desperate households into indebtedness and food bank dependency. Another is UC’s policy of making claimants responsible for their housing benefit payments, which has led to a spike in rent arrears and a growing unwillingness of landlords to rent to people on UC. The Government argues that these design features will teach people to be responsible with their finances, but instead the Government should take responsibility and end the suffering it is inflicting on society’s most vulnerable.

She had only been married  hours when she was was told she had pancreatic cancer - and had just months left to live. The only symptom she had experienced before the diagnosis was stomach pains and she was offered an ultrasound examination to be safe. Julie, who works as an Emergency Care Assistant, met Ian in the ambulance service and has helped hundreds of patients over the years. Many of them have already contributed to a fundraising page set up to help her.  She has been undergoing chemotherapy but due to the position of the tumor an operation has been deemed too risky. Julie, of Hayle, Cornwall, said she almost cancelled the ultra-sound operation as she felt completely fine. She added: After the ultrasound I got a call to say they had found a shadow. I wasnt worried. I didnt think it would be anything because I felt so good. Then, two days after my wedding, I got the diagnosis - it was pancreatic cancer. The first thing that went through my mind was that I would never get to celebrate my first wedding anniversary with Ian. It was hard. I thought I wouldnt be around for Christmases or my grandchildrens birthdays. So I actually went out and bought four years worth of cards for them all, in case I wasnt around. Every  minutes someone in the UK is diagnosed with a blood cancer, according to the non-profit advocacy group DKMS. This may be leukaemia, lymphoma or myeloma. Blood cancer is the third most common cause of cancer death in the UK. However, only one in three people with it - and in need of a transplant - will find a matching blood stem cell donor within their own family. Two in three need to look outside of this.Around  per cent of all donations are made through a method called peripheral blood stem cell . This is where blood is taken from one of the donor’s arms and a machine extracts the blood stem cells from it.The donor’s blood is then ed to them through their other arm. The outpatient procedure is typically completed in four to six hours. In  per cent of cases, donations are made through bone marrow collection. This is done while under general anaesthetic. To register as a potential donor, visit dkms.org.uk.Once youve received your home swab kit, it takes a few moments to swab. When you thenthe kit, you go on standby to help save a le. Now she is hoping that, by sharing her story so that others can be more aware, it could help more people catch the illness early and recognise symptoms. She added: They havent given me a set prognosis but the le expectancy for people with inoperable pancreatic cancer isnt long at all its about nine months.  Treliske said that due to where the tumour is, it is inoperable. So I started emailing every expert and professor I could find as I dont feel like I should be written off. I have been up to the Royal Free Hospital in London and spoken to a professor up there who has agreed to operate providing the tumour shrinks. I have contacted every clinical trial going. With Julie having to take time off work, covering the costs of travel to London, fees for any trials she gets accepted for and having also been given notice to leave her home, financial strains have taken their toll. Now, through an online fundraising page set up by one of Julies co-workers, Nicola Rashleigh, more than pound, has been raised to help Julie and her family. Donations have been made by friends, family, colleagues and people she has helped through her role as an emergency care assistant. Gran Julie said: When it snowed I was working with a paramedic and we were called out to an elderly woman, but the ambulance was a nightmare in the snow. We had to abandon it and go on foot.

But what Meghan might be finding a bit odd is that all eyes are now on her stomach, which the mum-to-be has been sweetly cradling while at events. And people were surprised when her bump seemed to miraculously grow over the course of a day when the Duke and Duchess touched down in Fiji. Meghan, who is around four months pregnant, was seen wearing an elegant white dress to land on the island, and her bump wasnt that visible.  But when she changed into a stunning blue cape gown for a state dinner that evening, social media users went wild with confusion.  Emily Andrews, the Suns royal correspondent who is following the couple on the tour, said on the night of the state dinner: I also note that Meghan’s baby bump is getting bigger by the day! I swear it was not this big last week! I think it’s the clinging nature of the dress but she’s sure looking swell! Although the fact the dress is clinging to her - and the fact she is holding her bump - might make it appear larger, one doula thinks it might be down to a biological factor. Susanna Birch told Trimester Talk: At night time, your abdominal muscles are tired from holding your bump [and they] loosen as they grow more tired, which allows your bump to sit out further and appear larger.An obstetrician also told Mamamia that it could be down to bloating from having eaten over the course of the day.But another possible cause of womens bumps being bigger at night is the hormone progesterone, which is released from the placenta.  Dr Joseph Sgroi said: One of the things progesterone does, which is the primary hormone thats secreted from the placenta, is it actually slows down gut motility, so it slows down the transit time from when you eat something to when it comes out the other end. The hormone is thought to be an evolutionary advantage for pregnant women in days when there was not as much food available - so food digestion is slowed and they absorb all possible nutrients to pass on to their unborn baby. Dr Sgroi also believes Meghans bump is likely to look even bigger by the end of the tour - which is less than a week away - given it is thought she is around four months pregnant.  After about  weeks onwards, this uterus which is predominantly in the pelvis now starts to move to the tummy or the abdomen, and thats when you start to show more and more, he told Mamamia. He added that Meghan is at a time in pregnancy where a womans uterus is expanding at great knots and the changes may not be subtle. Meghan and Harrys baby is due in Spring .

Jane Evans, , was heartbroken when she lost her first baby just  weeks into her pregnancy. But, just weeks later, the beautician discovered she was pregnant, with now -year-old Lydia, and after going for a D scan, was stunned to see two faces peering from the image. Jane believes the second face in the scan is that of her miscarried baby, who watched over her daughter during pregnancy. Incredibly, Jane from Hinckley, Leicestershire, says her two children Lydia and Jenson Randell started speaking to their big brother without ever knowing he had existed. Spooky footage even shows little Lydia dancing and saying this is what big brother does while showing dance moves to her grandad.  Now Jane is waiting to seeher third child Marty will also be befriended by their invisible big brother. Jane said: I like to think that maybe the little baby that I lost is looking over my daughter and keeping her safe for me. Seeing that other little face in there with her did make me feel a little bit sad. But at the same time,I hadnt lost the baby that I lost, I wouldnt have Lydia now. It was quite comforting to know that someone was looking out for her. There are other photos in the D scan that show that area and the face is not there so it does make you wonder. And the face is looking in a completely dferent direction to the way to Lydia.  For me, I cant explain it. If someone can, thats lovely, but I cant explain how its got there. Jane had been working as a call handler at National Grid when she fell pregnant with her first child  years ago - but tragedy struck just  weeks into the pregnancy. Jane said: I had been pregnant and lost the baby at about  weeks. We went for a scan and it was definitely gone. But a couple of weeks later I still felt quite pregnant. The doctor said it must have been left over hormones and I did a test and it was negative. But I just knew, I knew I was pregnant again so I kept testing. A few days later I did another test and it was positive. I was elated. It was the best feeling ever. It was lovely. And when I had the D scan done, even my mum said she looked like an Evans. It was so lovely being able to see her face on there and knowing that she was well and that they had done all the tests to check she was healthy inside. It was only when Jane took the D of little Lydia into work that work pals pointed out the second face.  Jane said: It was only when I showed the picture to people at work that they said whats that there. I said I didnt know. They said it looked like I had another baby in there and askedI was sure I was not having twins. Obviously I said I was just having one - and I was. They pointed at the photo and I did think it was a bit... dferent. Looking at the photo, it just looks like a face looking in a completely dferent direction to the way my daughter is looking. Little Lydia was born three weeks early happy and healthy and is now  years old. However for years the youngster would speak to her imaginary friend who she called big brother, as did Janes second child Jenson, now seven.  Now Jane is wonderingher third child Marty Gascoyne will soon start talking to his phantom brother as he is now two years old. Jane said: My daughter and my son all used to play with big brother. They were about two at the time when it first began. Lydia used to laugh and giggle and I would ask who she was talking to and she would say big brother. I always thought it was the boy that I lost. Before they even had any knowledge of the miscarriage or any badness in the world, they were talking to their big brother. They were only toddlers so I hadnt mentioned anything about the baby I lost. Its strange, both of them were always talking to their big brother so I am waiting for my youngest now to start talking to someone. Im waiting to seeMarty starts doing it as he is two now. But hes only a half brother as he has a dferent daddy so it may not happen. I dont know, well just wait and see. Jane likes to think that her little baby still watches on and is bravely sharing the photo in the hope it may give other parents who experienced the same thing some comfort.  Jane said: My partner at the time said he thought it was a reflection but I dont know what it would be a reflection of in someones stomach. I just dont think he liked to think that way, but Ive always thought that way. Ive always pointed it out to people like my sisters and so on and they always thought it was strange that Lydia used to do that. But then Jenson started doing it aswell. To strangers and friends and things, it was just a normal kid chatting away to anybody. Ive always felt Ive got a little somebody following me around andits true then it is lovely. It brings some comfort to know that the baby is still there with us. If its not true, it doesnt matter as Ill never know either way anyway. Its just nice to think that.

Stefanie Oakley, a former probation officer, was stopped by police after passersby spotted the children perched on the back window sills of her Skoda Octavia. Neither of them were wearing seat belts, and were hanging on to the roof rack while hanging out of the car. Oakley, , who home schools her children told officers she was only driving slowly and also suggested the incident would not be concerningit was another era. She and admitted previously letting the children hang out of the windows whilst their legs were inside the vehicle during a camping holiday. But Oakley, who regularly organises art and craft groups for children in the rural town of Chapel-Le-Frith, Derbyshire, was charged with dangerous driving - an offence which has a maximum sentence of two years in jail. Prosecutors said the children could have fallen out of the car into the path of oncoming traffic or under the wheels of her own car simplythe Skoda had hit a pothole.  The youngsters, aged six and seven - thought to be a boy and a girl - were unharmed in the incident. At Stockport Magistrates Court Oakley, who lives in the village of Hathersage, Derbyshire, admitted dangerous driving and driving while her children were not wearing seatbelts - but was given a  weeks jail suspended for a year. The incident occurred at .pm on July  after Oakley decided to take her children to the Kouros Meditterean cafe. Prosecuting Sonia Alford, said: This defendant was seen by police and civilians on, not one, but two occasions, driving through Chapel-en-le-Frith in Derbyshire. Firstly, she was seen at .pm by a civilian who saw two children with their bodies out of the vehicle and they were hanging onto a bar on the roof. They were six and seven. She made her way to a restaurant, Kouros Cafe then as she exited the restaurant, later, she was seen by staff and diners in the restaurant with her children sitting on the window sill of her car. As she pulls away, she is seen by a police officer and he shouts for her to stop. The police officer gets in his car and signals her to stop. He witnesses her drive about  metres. He asked what she was doing and she replied it was only a bit of fun. She continued to say this in her police interview.  The children are young enough to have car seats and they had them in the car. She said that previously she allowed them to do this on a campsite. She initially said it wasnt dangerous because she was driving slowly due to sheep being on the road. Though there were two incidents, I dont knowthe first one was prolonged. Its clear that there is not just a small risk of injury. If she had hit a pot hole, the children could have fallen out of her car and be hit by another car. A probation report about Oakley was read to the court, which said: At the time she hadnt considered how serious they wear or what harm couldve been caused to her children. She didnt envisage the matter being followed through. She had previously let the children sit on the windowsill and hang out of the window on campsites. Since being on holiday they have pestered her to allow them to do it again. Her thinking at the time was that it would be okay and didnt consider any of the consequences. The potential harm to the children was great. If they had slipped she couldve run over her own children oranother car had clipped them the same could have happened. She hadnt thought of other vehicles or the risks. She felt extremely embarrassed about herself. Her children her partner and herself have previously lived abroad in India for a year. This may have had an influence to her thoughts as they didnt have seatbelts there. It is not acceptable to put her children in that situation however. I do not think there was any intention to cause harm. Her parenting style has not caused any issues before. She lives with her partner and two children in a rented property and has lived there for just under three years.  She works one day a week at a restaurant as a waitress. Her partner works Monday Tuesday Wednesday and Friday in a local school dealing with morning and after school clubs. The children are homeschooled. She has previously been a probation officer, not since  and has a strong support network of friends and her partner, and she has a good character. Her lawyer Andrew Stewart said: This is a case of bad judgement on the defendants part. She travelled a short distance on two occasions in a rural area very slowly. On the second occasion, a police officer said he saw her drive about  metres from the restaurant. As soon as she is told that this is unacceptable, she stops the act. What she insists is that she was replicating behaviour from abroad. The children would hold onto the bars on the top of her car while she drives slowly. In another era, this might not have been as concerning as it is now. She thought about what she was allowed to do when she was little, and that she was stupid and didnt think of the risks. She worked as a probation officer for six years and she also worked as a young persons drug counsellor. She also volunteers for a local elderly charity. She is somebody who took time out of her career to home school her children. She is a caring mother and a valued member of the community, who organises outdoor and crafts groups for children. She is somebody who has never been in trouble before in her le. Oakley who was also ordered to complete  hours unpaid work told the court: I agree with everything that was said, but I dont feel like this was a bit of fun. I think it is really awful what I did. I just wanted to say I am sorry and it was really stupid. I feel terrible about putting my children in danger.I am an intelligent person but I just didnt think about the consequences.JP Lynn Bennison told her: Members of the public were so concerned that they contacted the police. Dangerous driving is so serious and the driving you demonstrated that day seriously endangered your children. Oakley was also ordered to pay pound in costs and surcharges.

Given that the Queen wore one at the Fijian state banquet on her tour their in , royal fans speculated that this would be wear Meghan Markle made her tiara-debut. However, Meghan went for a more low-key look and did not wear any jewels on her head at the event. She looked stunning in a floor- blue gown and topped off her look with a dazzling pair of earrings.  Meanwhile, Kate Middleton wore a tiara last night at the Dutch state banquet. It was a beautul diamond-encrusted tiara Kate has worn several times before, the Cambridge Lovers Knot tiara, which once belonged to Princess Diana. So, why did the Queen and Kate wear tiaras at state dinners but Meghan didnt  It turns out that royal protocol regarding tiaras actually has nothing to do with the Duchesses royal ranks - so its not because Kate is closer to the crown.  The choice of whether or not to wear a tiara is determined by the dress code of the event, as well as personal preference. In this case, the event was evidently black tie - so a tiara is not necessary. Another important factor is that state dinners are less formal than state banquets, which could have been one of Meghans reasons for going tiara-free. She may also have been advised not to travel with the expensive jewellery.A royal source told Hello magazine that there was no expectation for the Duchess to wear a tiara at the event, but said she was suitably attired for a state occasion."},{"url":null,"title":"school run mum run over","story":"NewsSchool run mum is run over by her own car in Tesco car park as kids watch in horrorAn eyewitness claimed the mum was struck by the silver Citroen as she checked her cars battery in Batchley, West MidlandsShareCommentsByDaniel BirdToby Meyjes:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT NewsThe horror incident took place while the mum was on a school run with her kids, it was claimed \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email A mum became trapped under her own car with her kids inside in a horror incident outside a Tesco store, an eyewitness claimed.The woman, thought to be aged in her s, was struck by the silver Citroen shortly after .am outside a Tesco Express in the Batchley area of Redditch, West Midlands.

She dazzled in a tiara weve seen her wear many times before, the Cambridge Lovers Knot, which was a favourite of Princess Diana and was ed to the Queen after her orce from Prince Charles. But people might be wondering why she was wearing an unusual yellow brooch, which could be seen as clashing with her pale blue dress. The prestigious accessory is actually the Royal Order of Queen Elizabeth II.  Its an honour the Queen bestows on female members of the British royal family and is only worn on formal occasions. The brooch features a miniature portrait of Her Majesty, surrounded by diamonds, on a yellow silk bow. Editor of Majesty magazine, Joe Little, claims it is the second time the Duchess has worn the Royal Order. According to Little, she also wore it at the Diplomatic Reception in December  at Buckingham Palace.  Her brooch cant be seen in photos of the Duchess arriving at the event. Given that the Royal Order has been bestowed years after Kate married William, it shows how much she is classed as a key fixture in the royal family. He also revealed that the Duchess order, unlike others in the family, has been made from glass rather than ivory.  Prince William has long been a patron of Tusk Trust, a non-profit organisation set up in  to protect African elephants. The Duke of Cambridge has spoken out against the ivory trade passionately for years and a campaign he backed saw victory this year when Michael Gove announced the UK will be installing a tough ban on ivory sales. Kate and William were filmed exiting a helicopter on Tuesday at Kensington Palace holding their six-month-old baby, Prince Louis.

Daria Blazejak, , ly claimed she was pregnant on three occasions, and told her family she felt alone. In April of this year, she also texted her boyfriend saying she was bad before being found dead at her home by her lodger in Middleton, Greater Manchester. Tests showed she had taken an overdose. The tragedy occurred a month after Polish-born Miss Blazejak, a warehouse data management operative, had been admitted to hospital following a previous overdose. Speaking at the Heywood hearing through a Polish interpreter, Miss Blazejaks sister, Marietta Zajac, said: Daria and I would speak from time to time, sometimes more than others. She had anxiety as well as severe back pain.  Sometimes she felt bad and sometimes she felt good, but many times she said that she wanted to die. About half a year before she died, her flatmate called me to tell me she had collapsed, and she needed to go to hospital. In January she rang me crying saying that she felt alone, that she didnt have any children and she didnt want to live anymore. In March, she rang my mum telling her that she wanted to hang herself. But afterwards, she didnt want to talk about it anymore. She would usually ring me after she had drunk alcohol. On two occasions, she rang me to tell me that she was pregnant, but she wasnt really. Miss Blazejaks ex-partner, Dominic Bradley, said: We first met about  years ago at work as friends. We worked at a storage warehouse and she was data management operative.  We started a relationship in January this year and there were a lot of highs and lows. I knew she was taking quite strong painkillers and on March  this year, she contacted me in the morning at am. I askedshe was OK and she said no and that she was a bad person and that she wanted to die. I asked hershe had taken something and she said yes, so I picked her up and took her to A+E. She had a mental health assessment at the hospital, but she said she didnt want to have one. She left hospital without taking the assessment. I found out and went around to her flat. I tried to encourage her to go back to hospital, but she refused. We had a disagreement after that and she blocked my number. On April , she told me that she wanted to move to London and I wished her good luck. On the following Saturday morning, at am, she rang me crying. She said she wanted me to pick her up from London. So, I went down later in the day and drove her back home. On April , she sent me a text message saying she was pregnant and she lost the baby and that it was my fault. I asked her to talk about it with me, but we didnt. I dont knowshe was pregnant or not. On Friday April , I messaged her, and she said she was bad. Then, on the Sunday I text her and I got nothing back.  In a statement, Miss Blazejaks GP, Dr Ritwik Raychaudhuri said: Daria was diagnosed with depression in  and was on medication in relation to that. Det Con Linda Senior said: There were no suspicious circumstances and no third-party involvement. I did some background checks and there was a lot of history between her and previous partners of turbulent relationships. But there was nothing suggesting any problems with Dominic. Recording a narrative conclusion, coroner Peter Sigee said: There was an incident where she appeared to take too much of her medication and her partner took her to the hospital where she had treatment. But she didnt say that she took that medication with the intention of taking her own le.

Despite continual visits to hospital , it wasnt until March  that Keith was diagnosed with undferentiated soft tissue sarcoma and doctors removed cancer-ridden parts of his body in gruelling surgery.He also went through four courses of radiation and chemo but the cancer ed each time. In May this year, doctors found it had spread to the skull, left shoulder, lower part of his spine, his pelvis and his liver.

They’ve put the big sign up, but there’s also a collage of photos of Tracey in the corner, which is lovely.“It’s not a temporary thing either – it’s going to permanently be the Besty Lounge.“It’s a great tribute to Tracey and it was quite emotional seeing all the pictures. It was amazing to see just how loved she was and what high regard she was held in.”Greg is in the process of setting up a charity using the “besty” name to help local people with health problems. He will be a trustee along with Tracey’s mum, Pat, and other family members and friends.With some funds still in the coffers from the fundraising, Greg and the other trustees are looking to donate money to Perth youngster Lily Douglas.The -year-old was due to start cancer treatment in Spain on Monday. She was diagnosed with an aggressive form of lung cancer last month.She received the devastating news after being given the all-clear from stage four Ewing’s sarcoma, a rare form of bone cancer, having endured  rounds of chemotherapy.Mum Jane has now taken Lily to Spain where she will receive an alternative treatment to chemotherapy.Greg added: “Sending her abroad for pioneering treatment, which is what we did for Tracey, made it feel close to home.“I know what they are going through.“To be able to help them would make me feel so much better.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/10/5bcee1f8093d1-e1540285944998-785x564.jpg ","title":"george cran roles reversed as pressure now on dunfermline and allan johnston as dundee united look to gather momentum","story":"With the first quarter of the season behind them, it’s fair to say it’s been a bumpy ride so far for Dundee United.Often coaches will use this point of the campaign as the first real chance to assess how things are going as they prepare to meet sides for the second time in the league.For the Tangerines, though, a report card right now can’t possibly tell the whole story with Csaba Laszlo not even lasting to this marker in charge of the team.And to judge his replacement Robbie Neilson after just two matches in charge wouldn’t be fair.However, comparing the fortunes of their next opponents Dunfermline since they met on the opening league match of the season makes for interesting reading.That’s because the atmosphere around Allan Johnston’s Pars since they finally overturned a -match winless run against the Tangerines to continue a lightning-fast start to the campaign has flipped almost completely.While the Tangerines struggled and stumbled under Csaba’s reign at the start of the season, Johnston was enjoying seeing his side inflict a - win at Tannadice to make it five wins from five games played after a % record in their Betfred Cup group.That was with an impressive  goals scored and included a deserved - win at Premiership Dundee.Now, though, Johnston faces a new man in the other dugout with intense scrutiny from fans now on him rather than his opposite number.After their perfect start to the campaign, it took Dunfermline another five matches to register a second victory in the Championship and have only racked up eight points from eight matches since.In the process they only managed six goals, conceding  and being dumped out of both the League Cup and Irn-Bru Cup on penalty shoot-outs.Going into Saturday’s game at East End Park, the Pars sit adrt of the play-off places, four points behind United in fourth place.Another poor result, after their - home defeat to Queen of the South at the weekend, will leave them well behind in the race for the top four, heaping all the pressure on Johnston and his side.And the contrast with Neilson, his United players and the atmosphere among the support is stark.After kicking off his reign with a - victory at Partick Thistle, the new gaffer led the Tangerines out for the first time at Tannadice at the weekend.Despite not managing to make it two wins from two, drawing - with Inverness CT, the players were boosted by the biggest home crowd of the campaign.The belief that Neilson can repeat the feat of promotion to the Premiership he achieved at Hearts is clear among the United support.Optimism throughout the stands has been almost completely absent over the past couple of seasons but the hope is now with former chairman Stephen Thompson having departed, and Neilson taking the reigns, good times might be on the horizon.And the ideal time to fuel that fire is now with games against sides below them in the table coming up – Dunfermline this weekend and then Queens the week after.With both the sides coming up in indferent form, points are a must to keep the good feeling flowing.Because what Dunfermline did show the last time the teams met, despite what’s happened since, is they can actually beat their bogey side United.What Neilson can’t afford now is to let the early momentum slip away, something that happened with both Ray McKinnon and, more obviously, Csaba Laszlo.Preventing that could well show the fans’ early optimism is justied come the season end."},{"url":null,"title":"jim mcintyre expected to make first dundee signing ahead of celtic clash","story":"Dundee boss Jim McIntyre is swtly set to bolster his options by adding free agent Martin Woods to his squad.The former Ross County midfielder has been without a club since leaving Partick Thistle after their relegation last season and is set to be re-united with his former gaffer.McIntyre signed Woods twice while gaffer in Dingwall, the first a month after taking charge before the -year-old had a spell down south with Shrewsbury before ing north.Woods has been training with the Dark Blues since last week and was present at last night’s -

If the police had more capacity and resources they would be able to have the visual impact they want but with budget cuts it can be dficult.“Speed cameras are not the complete answer to a speeding problem.

Speed limit compliance levels in excess of % are generally achieved.“Those detected speeding to date are either not paying sufficient attention to the task of driving or have clearly made a conscious decision not to comply.”Road Policing Sergeant Stuart Lawrence said: “It goes without saying that travelling at high speeds can have catastrophic consequences and is totally unacceptable.

What’s more, eventhey don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in , a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now,  years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 37","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Sir,It is always a delight when a letter awakens a landowner.James F Lithgow#s insult about ‘blow-ins’ is a typical trait. I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13470760.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_AMP_SDR_150718_TRUMP0013JPG.jpg","title":"ayrshire dad who blocked president","story":"NewsDaft dad in the dock after blocking Donald Trumps motorcade while he popped into the Co-op for milkPeter Goudie was stunned to be confronted with armed cops when he came out of the Maybole supermarket with his shopping.ShareByStephen Houston:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT NewsPeter Goudie came face-to-face with armed cops when he held up the Trump motorcade when he popped into the Co-op for milk \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHe had dashed out to buy some milk from the Co-op.

And Peter Goudie, , came face to face with officers, including armed police, who were twitchy that his Volkswagen Golf was in the way.  Donald Trump had already touched down at Prestwick in Air Force One and his cavalcade was heading to Maybole, en route to a weekend of golf and talks at Turnberry. And the convoy of the most powerful president on earth wasn’t going to be impeded by a naughty parker. The astonishing tale unfolded at Ayr Justice of the Peace Court last week. Goudie’s lawyer Peter Lockhart just managed to keep his client on the road, and he left with eight penalty points on his driving licence and a pound fine. Goudie, of The Loaning, Maybole, admitted stopping on a zig-zag line at a pelican crossing, having no insurance, taking his we’s car without permission and not having a full licence.  Depute fiscal Ed Sheeran told the Justice on the bench that at around pm on Friday, July  there was a major police operation on-going on the A. He said that it was part of a management plan due to the visit of the president of the United States of America. The court was told that there was a large police presence in Maybole High Street and that they had noticed the grey Golf was stopped on the zig-zags. They found Goudie inside the shop and the offences unfolded.  Mr Lockhart told the court Goudie’s we was out and he had decided to pop down to the Co-op to get some milk. The solictior added: “My client had not noticed the high police presence. “He was alarmed when he was approached by the police in the shop and even more alarmed when he came out and saw more police, including armed police in the vicinity.” Mr Lockhart explained that it had been a costly exercise as the police had removed and impounded his car. He added: “His we was furious when she found out as it cost pound to get the car back the following day. “He was in the dog house for his stupidity.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnEd SheeranVolkswagenJusticePrestwickDonald TrumpAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"bus chiefs issue another safety","story":"NewsBus chiefs issue another safety warning on Ayrshire bus routeIt has been reported that children have been “cycling in a dangerous manner” in front of buses travelling through the Patna scheme.ShareByPippa Smith:,  OCT NewsStagecoach bus route  as it passes through Patna \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBus services through Patna are at risk - for the second time in less than a year.

RoundThe Pupils never really got going in this cup-tie, ending the game as second best to a moderately talented visiting side.Kinross were fortunate to be confronted by a uncharacteristically tame performance from the McFadyen sponsored home favourites.Lacking the key elements of drive, determination and quick controlled possession, the home side, playing with a threadbare squad due to injury and call-offs  used the long ball far too often in the first half.During the first twenty minutes the Pupils had territorial advantage, but were never able to string enough passes together to make a telling impact on the game.With the visitors hardly an attacking force, the home crowd was shocked when Kinross unexpectedly grabbed the lead shortly before half time.It’s ironic given that the Pupils back four seemed to be on top of their game, that one mistake should prove so costly.There seemed little danger, but the ball was lost in a crucial area and turned across goal for the incoming forward to score with the visitor’s only shot of the whole first half.The second half began disastrously for the home side, a through ball exposing the last line of defence whose first real action was to pick the ball out of the net.Given what went before, it was unimaginable that the Pupils were two goals behind at this stage the visitor’s ‘smash and grab’ tactics a complete contradiction to their earlier failure to attack.With the confidence of an unexpected but comfortable two goal cushion, the Fe League side turned the screw by controlling possession from the back.Mistakes had cost the home side dear, and, for the first time in the match the visitors looked like a team heading for the next round of the Scottish Cup!The home side tried desperately to retrieve the situation, but gaps appeared at the back as they threw caution to the wind.The keeper, young Alastair Ferguson, saved the day by fisting clear inside the six yard box, a timely intervention which kept the Pupils in the game at a crucial stage.Almost immediately, the home side were awarded a penalty kick on the back of a wild challenge in the box, and Gary Grumoli drove the ball into the net.Sensing blood, the Pupils powered forward at last using the ball to good effect with some fine possession football.However, it proved a  dawn and only a prequel to another defensive mistake which resulted in the visitor’s restoring their two goal cushion via a poacher’s finish from point blank range.In a breathtaking finish, the Pupils gained a second penalty with minutes remaining however, resisting the urge to change the kicker, Gary Grumoli placed his second effort to the keeper’s opposite side, only to see his kick saved dramatically.It was the final act of an uninspiring, but ultimately exciting game.The Pupils will try to put the cup disappointment behind them when they travel to play old foes, Hillington, in a league fixture tomorrow.Ellis Robertson played a solid game in the centre. _cpupilsvkinrossRyan

My wee daughter wanted to have an ldquoapple shower and so we stood under the trees. The mere touch of a branch resulted in a cascade of fruit. It was a wonderful ritual of autumn and I loved my kidsrsquo joy in it all, but within me there was a nagging feeling. As Irsquove got older, the oncoming of winter has had a depressive effect on me.Is it a process that affects us more as we get older, with each autumn marking the slow closing of yet another year To be sure, autumn is a beautul time of year and many people tell me it is their favourite season. I can understand that. The woods are magical, the sunsets seem more spectacular than at other times and itrsquos a time of harvest and forage. Our house is full of conkers, apples and colourful leaves collected on walks.Another part of the magic is the migrating birds. I heard the geese above me the other day, honking and flying in formation as they headed for Aberlady. They arrive at this time of year with winter on their tails. The assembly of pink-footed geese there at this time of year is a truly spectacular sight and sound. Tens of thousands of them gather at Aberlady Bay during their migration south.It almost has the atmosphere of an airport countless numbers of honking birds arriving from Iceland and Greenland, joining an already crowded bay. There are thousands of excited geese mingling together, sharing flight stories and looking forward to the next stage of their journey. Many feed in nearby fields before taking off once again to venture further south.As they fly over us their honking sounds like cackling witches. I often hear them when in the woods, as I did the other day. I looked up to see them through the branches of balding autumn trees, flying in their characteristic V flight formations. It seemed their honking was warning me of something: ldquoWinter is cominghellipwinter is coming.Some people of course follow the example of the geese and head for a kinder climate as winter approaches. But for most of us itrsquos a case of ritual and preparation. Hallowersquoen, really a later development of the Celtic Samhain festival, is one such ritual.But for me now, despite my love of autumnrsquos display, it cloaks my senses with a sense of melancholy which I find increasingly dficult to throw off.I spend as much time outdoors as possible in the other seasons but the darkness of winter forces me to retreat into my home. Hence we will soon be decorating our wee house with cosy and colourful lights to ward off winterrsquos dark blanket. But this dark blanket can cover our emotions as well, not so easily warded off.Many people I know likewise dread winter because of its depressive effect on their mental health. They wish that, like the geese, they could find a way of escaping the worst of it. I have often wished I was a bear who could hibernate away the winter months.But we are not bears or geese, and in my own battles with the oncoming of winter I have come to understand more than ever the importance of social connections and preparing for them. The truth is winter can be a time of flowering and rebirth, just like spring but in a dferent way ndash the flowering of friendship and rebirth of social connections perhaps lost or waned in the flurry of summer activities.In the past it was so self-evident. People huddled in each otherrsquos homes around the fire, keeping each other company. Like so many things these traditions have now been commercialised, yet the simple antidote of social connection in the approaching dark times remains as powerful as it ever was for us.It should be a time for visiting and getting together making time for friends and coming together in defiance of the darkness. And thinking especially of those for whom the cold and dark becomes an enforcer of confinement because of age or vulnerability.Winter should be a time of visiting and welcoming. This, I think, is an antidote to that depressive winter effect. Maybe thatrsquos why the geese honk so much.

The remains of the castle are ancient and the oldest part is called Goblin Ha. It is partly underground, and its name means Goblin Hall.According to legend, a wizard named Hugh de Gford made a deal with the Devil nearly  years ago, and inan army of goblins swarmed up from hell and built Yester Castle for him. Goblin Ha is the part of the castle dating from that time and thatrsquos how it got its name.It is said goblins lurk in the shadows of the ruins, and especially in Goblin Ha itself. At sunset, when night falls, they come out of their hiding places and crawl about in the darkness.One autumn day quite recently a dad decided to take his two children on a trip to find Yester Castle. He worked long hours during the week so he kept weekends for his children.His daughter Suzie had just turned  and his son Jake was eight. Jake was mad about Harry Potter and wizards, and when he discovered there was a castle nearby made by goblins for a wizard he begged his dad to take him. Suzie was given the choice to stay at home with her mum, but at the last minute she decided to come.It was sunny when they set off. ldquoA perfect day to explore a castle made by goblins, said the dad jokingly. They parked at the golf course and walked towards the woods.ldquoMaybe the goblins play golf, Suzie joked to her wee brother.ldquoYou shouldnrsquot make fun, they might hear you, he said.They finally reached the edge of the wood and peered into it. Suzie found the bridge over the ravine that led to the ruins but then Jake ran ahead very excited, looking for goblins.It was dficult to imagine what the castle had originally looked like because it was so ruined. Jake said it reminded him of the ancient ruined temple in The Jungle Book movie. But one thing was for sure: it had an eerie atmosphere. As they explored, the dad walked under an archway and suddenly felt a shiver down his spine. He turned round and saw something move in the shadows.For a moment they stood absolutely still. Then a bird flew out, giving them a fright. The dad and Suzie burst into laughter.ldquoJust a stupid bird! said Jake, disappointed.After a careful search they found the entrance to Goblin Ha. It was a small entrance leading to a low, dark passageway. Jake bravely led the way, with his sister and dad close behind.A cold and damp atmosphere hit them as soon as they entered the chamber. Although it was dark, two windows above gave just enough light to see.ldquoSo all this was supposed to have been made by goblins  asked Suzie.ldquoYeah, said Jake, who was still getting over the excitement that he was actually in Goblin Ha, ldquoand they came from hell up that stairway. He pointed to the dark steps in the corner.All three stood peering into the dark stairway which plunged deep into the ground.ldquoAccording to the legend, this stairway was made by the Devil after he had done a deal with the wizard and it leads to hell. But itrsquos blocked up now, explained Jake. He looked at his father: ldquoCan we go down dad, please!ldquoSeems a bit dangerous to me son.ldquoAw, come on dad, said Suzie, ldquowe canrsquot come all this way and then not go down the stairway to hell.ldquoVery well, but Irsquoll go first and wersquoll use the torches on our phones, said the dad.Slowly they began to climb down the stairs. The light from their mobiles lit up the old walls and ancient worn steps as they descended. Suzie took photos in the darkness, although the flash wasnrsquot powerful enough to light up everything.Eventually they reached a point where great stones blocked the way so they couldnrsquot go any further. ldquoThey were put there to keep out the goblins, said Jake. His sister was now feeling a bit uneasy: ldquoCan we go now, dad  Itrsquos too spooky down here.ldquoScared of the goblins are we  her wee brother mocked.ldquoYes, letrsquos go back up, said the dad. Jake led the way up to Goblin Ha. ldquoItrsquos time we should be going, wersquove found the place so mission accomplished. Itrsquoll be dark soon, letrsquos go now while therersquos still good day light.So they left the ruins and walked back across the golf course, laughing and talking and admiring the beginnings of a sunset and a full moon in the darkening sky. They were at the car when Suzie realised she didnrsquot have her mobile phone.ldquoIt was in my back pocket, it mustrsquove fallen out, she insisted.ldquoAw no Suzie, it could be anywhere, her dad said, annoyed.ldquoDad, we have to go back to get it, please. I know I had it in Goblin Ha, it might have even fallen out there. The dad wasnrsquot happy but the mobile was expensive and so reluctantly he agreed.They retraced their steps all the way back to the castle. It had only been  minutes since they had left the ruins but the atmosphere in the dim twilight was very dferent.Finally they reached the entrance to Goblin Ha.ldquoYou go first, dad, said both children at the same time.And so the dad put on his torch and entered. His children followed close behind.When they emerged into Goblin Ha it was dark so the dad shone his torch on the ground, searching. ldquoWhere could you have left it  he asked Suzie.ldquoAnywhere, she replied, shrugging her shoulders.They couldnrsquot phone it as there was no reception, so they kept searching.It was Jake who heard it first: a faint sound coming from the dark stairway. He lted his head and looked in its direction but it was too dark to see anything. There it was again, it sounded like breathing.Jake froze in real terror. ldquoDadhellip he whispered, ldquodad, therersquos something there.ldquoStop it you wee bam, said his sister, ldquoyoursquore just trying to spook us. But then she heard it too. It was louder this time, a strange breathing sound. It was definitely coming from the stairway.Intrigued, the dad shone his light down the steps, although the mobilersquos torch wasnrsquot strong enough to completely light up the dark.Then suddenly a pair of red eyes appeared, staring back at him.The dad screamed, making his two children scream as well, and they instinctively ran for the exit. But it was dark and they couldnrsquot see the way.ldquoDad, for Godrsquos sake shine it over here, cried Suzie, now completely terried.The dad shone the torch and they ran through the passageway in a total panic. Once outside there was more light, from the full moon.ldquoWhy did you scream, you scared the hell out of me! Suzie shouted angrily at her dad.ldquoIrsquom sorry Suzie, it just gave me a fright, I didnrsquot mean to scare you, he said.ldquoWhat gave you a fright, what did you see dad  asked Jake, who was now scared himself despite his earlier bravado.ldquoNot sure really, I thought I saw, erhellipldquoYes, yes what  asked Suzie stretching out her arms impatiently.The dad hesitated, then said: ldquoWell it looked like eyes.ldquoI am now officially freaked out, said Suzie, ldquoplease letrsquos just get out of here, never mind the sodding phone.ldquoIrsquom sure it was some kind of animal, maybe a fox or even an owl, said her dad, trying to reassure her, ldquobut yes itrsquos too dark now, we should go back to the car and maybe we can come back tomorrow in the light to look for your mobile.Jake was suddenly distracted. He saw something in the passageway.ldquoDadhellip dad, whatever it is, itrsquos coming after us, look!The shadow of some creature was in the passageway, moving towards them.Both Suzie and Jake were now in a state of complete terror and they ran.ldquoNo, no, itrsquos dangerous, therersquos a steep fall there, donrsquot run! called out the dad.The kids stopped just in time. In the moonlight they could see they were standing on the edge of a steep fall. Their dad caught up with them and took their hands. They walked together carefully with hearts racing through the trees towards the bridge that led to the golf course.Behind them, a dark shadow came out of the entrance and crawled into the wood.They were just past the arched wall when they saw the dark shadow move in front of them, blocking the way. The dad shone his torch directly at it, and for a split second he saw it before it vanished into the darkness. He looked shocked.ldquoWhat the hell was that, dad  shrieked Suzie.ldquoI honestly donrsquot know, he saidWhatever it was, it was still in the woods, moving in the darkness. Then it came towards them once again, this time making strange noises.Jake suddenly yelled out: ldquoOur father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come thy will be done, in heaven as it is on earthhellip Whatever it was made a sound like a scream and retreated back into the dark wood towards Goblin Ha. Jake continued the prayer and finished with a loud ldquoamen.ldquoLetrsquos get out of here, said the dad. All three ran in the moonlight out of the shadows of the wood onto the golf course. They kept running until they reached the car park, legs aching and completely breathless.The dad fumbled for his keys while the children stared at the golf course, looking for a moving shadow.Finally the dad found his keys and they were in the car and away as fast as possible.Suzie was the first to speak: ldquoI ask again, what was it ldquoI think the dark was playing tricks on us, said her dad, ldquoit was an animal of some sort.ldquoBut what about that horrible scream  she asked.ldquoFoxes can make a strange screeching noise at night, Suzie, thatrsquos what I think it was, said her dad, trying to reassure her.ldquoIt was a goblin, wasnrsquot it dad  asked Jake.ldquoAye right, replied his sister sarcastically, ldquoyou read too much Harry Potter. And what was all that praying about  That was just weird.ldquoIt was a redcap goblin, said Jake, ldquoyou canrsquot outrun them and the Lordrsquos Prayer is the only thing that will stop them. I had memorised it before our visit, just in case.ldquoHowrsquod you know that  asked SuzieldquoI read about it, said Jake.Suzie was just about to say something when her dad winked at her and interrupted: ldquoWellit was a redcap then the prayer seemed to work. He hoped this would stop them arguing. And it did. Jake smiled and put on his earphones.ldquoIrsquom sure it was a fox, whispered the dad to his daughter, ldquoor maybe a big rat, but just let Jake think it was a goblin.They got home with a story to tell their mum!In a quiet moment, when the children were busy, she asked the dad: ldquoSo what was it you saw He hesitated to answer the question, ashe wouldnrsquot be believed.ldquoTo be honest, I donrsquot know, he said. ldquoI told the kids it was a fox because I didnrsquot want to spook them, but I really canrsquot say.Who knows the truth of it all  If Suziersquos phone is ever found, the photos she took in the dark stairway might reveal what was really hiding in the darkness on that day."},{"url":null,"title":"be-prepared-for-next-beast-from-the-east-says-council-emergency-planner","story":"Severe weather is the biggest risk to people living in East Lothian, according to Sandy Baptie.And he has issued advice ahead of a one-day workshop to help communities prepare for any future emergencies.It includes going back to old-fashioned handsets in a time when more people rely on mobile phones.Mr Baptie, East Lothian Councilrsquos emergency planning, risk and resilience manager, has been visiting community councils and groups in the wake of the lsquoBeast from the Eastrsquo snowstorm, which brought much of the country to a standstill in February and March this year.Heavy snowfalls and strong winds caused chaos on the roads and left many people stranded in their homes.It also saw a surge in community spirit, with tales of people helping neighbours and looking after the more vulnerable people.Now Mr Baptie is hoping that spirit will help all communities prepare a Community Resilience Plan which they can use in case another severe weather front hits the county.And he has issued some advice for people to prepare in their own home for what could happen.He said: ldquoSevere weather is the biggest risk to East Lothian.ldquoBeing prepared for it is important and people can do things themselves, such as keeping an old-fashioned phone in their house in case mobile signal is lost, having a torch to hand in case power goes.ldquoIt is also important to stock up on food when warnings that severe weather is on its way are issued.More than  people are expected to attend the community resilience workshop at The Brunton, Musselburgh, on Saturday.The one-day event, which is being funded by EDF Energy and the Scottish Government, will bring together representatives from community councils, groups and schools.Advice on a range of aspects of drawing up community resilience plans will be available, including ensuring groups who take on responsibility are covered by insurance.It will also inform people of services they can sign up to with energy companies to ensure they receive a phone callpower goes out.North Berwick Community Council, which already has a plan and implemented it successfully during the Beast from the East, will be there to talk about how they did it and what worked.Mr Baptie hopes the event will result in community plans from across the county, with each one appointing a Single Person of Contact or SPOC.He said: ldquoThe idea of a SPOC is that there is one point of contact between each community and the council so we can get information to them and they can let us know what is happening, for examplepower has gone out in one area.ldquoThe plans are about drawing up lists of vulnerable people in the community, finding out who has a x and can get medicine to people or take them to hospital or the doctor.ldquoIt is about being prepared.

The report says their careers are often hindered by sexual harassment, a lack of opportunities for progression, or discrimination related to pregnancy.Meanwhile gender pay gaps show ldquoshocking levels of inequality in how womenrsquos work is valued, the Commission said.Disabled people are twice as likely to be jobless, and are seeing the gulf between their pay and the rest of the workforce grow wider, while ethnic minorities are twice as likely to be unemployed or living in poverty.Young people are most likely to be unemployed and are disproportionately in insecure jobs.Lesley Sawers, Scotland Commissioner for the EHRC, said the review showed limited progress in some areas since the previous review in , but this was slow, and neither consistent nor widespread.She added: \"Despite efforts made by the Scottish Government and many others the same problems which have been highlighted in previous reviews are still apparent.\"The stark reality of inequality in Scotland today is that too often people are unable to realise their full potential, are excluded from positions of influence, and experience prejudice and discrimination in daily le.\"The report draws on public data to assess what progress is being made in a range of areas.In the workplace, it warns women, disabled people, young people and ethnic minorities are still not being treated fairly. As well as being more likely to be out of work, women are more likely to be in part time work.Just days after local authority care workers in Glasgow go on strike over the failure to resolve their equal pay claims, the EHRC report will warn that the gender pay gap has changed very little in recent years.Women continue to be under-represented in the senior ranks of many workplaces, even in education, health and other areas where they account for the majority of the workforce, it says.The commission claims such discrimination has a direct impact on levels of poverty, which is getting worse on nearly all measures.The majority of children living in poverty are now from working households, it points out , while women and disabled people are most at risk from the worst poverty.People with mental health problems and people from ethnic minority backgrounds are also more likely to be poor.The report says the UK Government should take much of the blame for the poverty which \"blights the lives\" of too many Scots. \"Unfairness is hardwired into the UK Government tax and spend policies, with some groups ndash black women, Bangladeshis and disabled people ndash suffering disproportionately,\" it says.On sexual harassment, the report claims says a lack of research means we dont know how many people have been sexually harassed in Scottish workplaces, but ious surveys suggest anything between one in three and one in ten workers have experienced sexual harassment, with one study suggesting  per cent of women and six per cent of men believe they have been sexually harassed at work.While nearly all employersclaimed to agree that it was in the interests of their organisation to support pregnant women and those on maternity leave, nearly three-quarters of mothersreported having a negative or possibly discriminatory experience when they were pregnant, on maternity leave, or ing to work from maternity leave.The EHRC says the UK Government should introduce a right for all workers to request flexible working, from the day employment starts, to help reduce the gender pay gap and support more disabled people into work. Currently people who have been employed for less than  weeks have no right to ask to work flexible hours.But it also says Scottish ministers could do more.While praising the Scottish Governments commitment to a fair and inclusive jobs market, and increased government-funding for early learning and childcare, the report concludes more can be done.It calls for the government to require Scottish Councils and other public authorities to publish action plans about how they are monitoring ethnicity and disability, and how they relate to employees chances of being recruited, staying in work and progressing up the career ladder.To tackle workplace harassment, the report says the UK Government should introduce a mandatory duty on employers to take reasonable steps to protect workers from harassment, sexual harassment and victimisation in the workplace and should extend the time limit for bringing cases to employment tribunals for discrimination and harassment to six months.A Scottish Government spokesmansaid:ldquoEquality is at the heart of our vision for a fairer Scotland and despite equalities legislation being largely reserved, we continue to take decisive action on this issue.\"Our Programme for Government makes clear our determination to improve the position of women in the workplace.

This would be more similar to the experiences of people in the workplace where assessment is focussed on how iniduals can learn from that point forward.Dr Janet Brown, chief executive of the SQA, said examiners would study the report, but did not give a commitment to reduce the frequency of essay writing.She said: ldquoItrsquos appropriate that we engage fully with young people and take on their views as they have a very signicant stake in how qualications and assessment need to change to reflect our future society and economy.ldquoOur qualications and assessments are part of the le experience of all young people in Scotland, but this le experience is changing in ways that were dficult to predict only a few years ago, and will continue to change with consequences that we cannot yet foresee.Ms Brown said the SQA would develop a new approach to assessing competence in wider skills as a result of the report and would continue to consult with young people in future.Louise Macdonald, chief executive of Young Scot, said: ldquoWersquore very pleased the SQA is taking on board the thoughts, feeling and experiences of young people from across Scotland on such an important issue."},{"url":null,"title":"neil-mackay-inclusion-can-only-work-if-it-is-properly-funded-and-staffed","story":"This newspaper recently ran a front page story highlighting the , assaults carried out against public sector staff each year. The teacher who I know is just one statistic among the many parking attendants punched or nurses harassed.However, what complicates the issue for the teacher is that the child who routinely assaults her suffers from autism ndash and displays extreme behavioural problems, including physical aggression to staff and pupils.The experience of the teacher raises an issue which is almost taboo within the worlds of education, government and politics ndash the abject failure of the policy of inclusion in its present form in Scotland.The concept of inclusion is simple and laudable ndash that all children regardless of physical or learning disabilities should be educated in mainstream schools. However, in practice, the policy is inoperable with the current level of funding and staffing.Teachers know this to be true, and so does the Government. Only recently, an anonymous letter to education secretary John Swinney, from a primary school teacher, went viral. In the letter, the teacher laid out what was wrong with inclusion ndash one passage described how pupils had to be evacuated while a child ldquotrashed the classroom ndash and explained that the letter had to be anonymous as they feared consequences for saying the unsayable.ldquoNow that there are very few specialist schools, they wrote, ldquoteachers are feeling the effects of inclusion on a daily basis. This policy, whilst admirable in intention, does not work as it is drastically underfunded. In my school, it is fairly common for teachers to be physically assaulted by children whose needs cannot be met due to the inadequate level of funding. The teacher nailed the cause too, blaming a ldquolack of resources and support from government.Inclusion highlights a recurring theme in modern Scottish society: the idea that you can build utopia without hard work thatyou just think good thoughts and say good words, that good things will happen. Utopia, however, costs money.Letrsquos leave utopia aside for a moment, though, and get into the dystopia that is modern schooling in Scotland when it comes to inclusion. One teacher told me that at their school they have not had additional support needs stafffor the last  years. These ASNs are school staff trained to deal with all manner of ldquobarriers to learning ndash whether itrsquos cerebral palsy, dyslexia, or autism.So, as a nation, wersquove decided ndash rightly ndash that all children, no matter what dficulties they face in le, will be educated in a mainstream school. However, we are not paying for the essential staff needed to make the policy work. One cannot say ldquobuild me a house and expect a house to appearno bricklayers are hired.In most schools, support for learning staff ndash what was once called classroom assistants ndash are filling in the aching black hole caused by the lack of ASNs. Classroom assistants, however, are meant to help teachers in all sorts of ways ndashthey are not there just to paper over the cracks in the inclusion policy.Letrsquos take this example of what is happening in schools: therersquos a class with about  pupils ndash itrsquos in a poor inner city area. One child has severe behavioural problems, one child has dyslexia, and one child has minor physical disabilities ndash problems with balance and walking. There are also at least six children in the class for whom English is a second language, including pupils who are refugees and have experienced war. There are eight other classes in the school, with a roll of around  ndash all with pretty much the same makeup. There are four classroom assistants ndash support for learning workers ndash and no ASNs.In this scenario, everyone loses: the majority of pupils have to put up with disruption and are starved of staff time the pupils with special needs, but not behavioural problems, come second in line to those children who are disruptive and the disruptive pupils with behavioural problems are simply managed by untrained staff, not truly helped by those with the skills to better their educational experience. Meanwhile, the staff ndash both teachers and support workers ndash are run ragged by a policy that sounds great on paper for a politician but is hell on earth when put into practice.When asked, most teachers seem to agree that inclusion is good in theory ndash they want schools to be inclusive of all children ndash but it is a disaster in practice because there is not enough money or staff to resource it and make it work. There are therefore only two solutions: abandon the policy, or fund it properly.To abandon the policy would be extremely expensive ndash new specialist schools would need to be built, new specialist staff would need to be trained and hired. Given that many schools have no money for specialist staff, one would imagine that an entire new programme of building specialist schools might also be out of reach. Scrapping the policy would also send out a cruel message: that mainstream schooling is not for those with any form of special needs. No politician would risk that PR disaster.This then leaves us with the only possible solution: fund schools properly. Central and local government need to stop the sleight of hand. You cannot advocate a policy such as inclusion and then not fund or staff it. To preserve the status quo fails pupils, parents and teachers alike, and exposes as phoney the claim that this country really cares about all children and their education."},{"url":null,"title":"margaret-taylor-focusing-on-politics-does-equal-pay-women-no-favours","story":"Take Glasgow: primary schools across the city are currently in shut down while care services are being severely disrupted after thousands of female workers downed tools in protest at the local authorityrsquos apparent lack of progress towards honouring an equal-pay settlement they were promised would be made by the end of this year. Caterers, home carers and cleaners have all walked out for  hours, with , of them taking part in what is being dubbed the largest equal-pay strike ever to take place in the UK.While it is clear that the women have widespread public support, much of the debate around the strike has centred on why their trade unions - the GMB and Unison - have chosen to help them stage their walk-out now. With the first equal-pay claim against the council being lodged  years ago, the suspicion is that the Labour-supporting unions are out to make trouble for the SNP, which has committed to resolving the issue after inheriting it from Labour following last yearrsquos local elections.It is an easy case to make. After all, the unions could have helped organise a walk-out  years ago, when it was clear that a new pay structure adopted by the then Labour-run council valued male-dominated jobs more highly than those done mostly by women. Or at numerous points since, as Labour politicians persisted in mounting what now seems obvious was an unwinnable legal challenge to the councilrsquos equal-pay obligations.Claims from the trade unions, which are by nature deeply political organisations, that there are no politics at play here are a little hard to swallow, especially as one of the GMBrsquos most vocal equal-pay campaigners - regional organiser Rhea Wolfson - is standing as a Labour candidate at the next General Election. The SNP made settling equal pay a key plank of its Glasgow manesto, which helped win Susan Aitken, a self-professed feminist who speaks eloquently about supporting her cityrsquos female workers, her role as council leader. Likewise, helping to organise a strike that will undoubtedly be painted as the ground on which this battle was won, will do Ms Wolfsonrsquos political ambitions no harm.Yet compelling as these arguments are, the problem with focusing on political machinations is that it risks ignoring the real driving force behind the industrial action: the women themselves. For them this strike isnrsquot about scoring political points or furthering political careers, it is about showing that they will no longer take being discriminated against because they are women, regardless of the form that discrimination takes.Indeed, while at its heart this dispute is about the iniquity of supposedly feminine jobs being deemed less valuable than masculine ones, it is also about the lack of options female workers have for staging a protest. While a strike by refuse collectors or gravediggers would be viewed as nothing more than an inconvenience, it has historically been seen as beyond the pale for carers or classroom assistants, whose jobs demand that feminine traits like empathy and compassion be on display at all times, to engage in such actions.Home carer and Unison member Amanda Green spoke movingly on that point yesterday when she told BBC Radio rsquos Womenrsquos Hour programme that the women of Glasgow have been made to feel that because of the type of jobs they do they do not have the right to go on strike. Viewed like that, perhaps the reason the women have not taken action before now has less to do with the unions not wanting to go up against the Labour Party and more to do with the workers themselves feeling duty bound not to walk out on the people they tend to on a daily basis.Now they have taken action, the question is where do things go from here. While the strike has allowed the women to finally take a stand - and has ensured their plight is known well beyond the confines of Glasgow political circles - from the councilrsquos point of view it will not make any dference to the way their settlement is handled. Making the authorityrsquos case on Womenrsquos Hour, Ms Aitken stressed that the action ldquowonrsquot change the outcome of negotiations between the two sides, with the council preparing to pay a fair settlement ldquovery soon.Yet unless all parties can get round the table to have the ldquomeaningful negotiations the womenrsquos representatives have been calling for, that process will stall and the claims - all , of them - will end up back in the Employment Tribunal to be settled on a case-by-case basis. Given theof time that would take to complete, such an outcome can be in nobodyrsquos interests.The strike has allowed both sides to flex their muscles, with the women demonstrating that they are prepared to do whatever is required in order to be treated on a par with their male counterparts and the council showing that it will hold its ground regardless of the cost. Now everyone knows where they stand, is there any reason this matter canrsquot be settled once and for all "},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8851655.jpg?type=article-full","title":"thousands-of-council-workers-march-through-glasgow-in-equal-pay-strike","story":"More than , Unison and GMB members walked out on Tuesday in a -hour strike - believed to be the biggest of its kind.Around , workers, mostly women, are proceeding with claims against the council following a Court of Session ruling last year.The council said the strike was unnecessary and it hopes to reach a settlement in the coming months and start paying out in the next financial year.Read more:Hundreds of schools shut and care services cut in equal pay strikeMany strikers manned picket lines around the city on Tuesday and later joined a march from Glasgow Green to George Square for a rally, chanting \"equal pay or we walk away\".Glasgow City Council said all early years establishments, additional support for learningschools and mainstream primary schools would be closed on both days, though all mainstream secondary schools would remain open.Home care services for around , people are affected by the industrial action.Workers on the picket line at The Mitchell Library hope the strike will put pressure on the council to speed up the negotiation process.Anna Murray, a cleaning supervisor at the library who has worked there for  years, said: \"Weve waited  years for equal pay and the council doesnt seem to be doing anything to pay it so weve gone out on strike in support of getting our equal pay paid.\"We hope that the council speed things up and gets equal pay for the people that are waiting for it.\"Read more:Margaret Taylor: Focusing on politics does equal-pay women no favoursAnnette Tompson, another cleaning supervisor at The Mitchell, where she has worked for  years, added: \"It has been taking a long long time, weve been to the employment tribunal, to the court, to the Court of Session and they have found in our favour and and the council are still not paying us.\"They know we are due the money but it is really dragging on.\"Unions said members regret the action but hope people understand they have waited a long time for equality.Unison regional organiser Mandy McDowall said: \"This strike comes at the end of ten years of litigation through the courts.\"Last year the courts agreed with us that the councils pay scheme was unequal and invalid and we were sent back to negotiate a new pay scheme and settlement of equal pay claims for thousands of women across Glasgow.\"In ten months and  meetings of negotiations we have got nowhere.\"There is no detail on the table that allows us to have confidence that the council will meet the deadline of December that was equally set.\"The local authority said it had explored all options to avert the strike.Glasgow City Council leader Susan Aitken told BBC Radio Scotland: \"The strike will have a devastating impact and theres no need for it.\"They won their case the day that the SNP was elected to lead Glasgow City Council and we have been working ever since then to deliver them justice.\"We are extremely close to it and I am confident that they will get the settlement that they are entitled to and we will start paying out in the next financial year.\"First Minister Nicola Sturgeon retweeted a tweet from Scottish Labour Richard Leonard in which he said he sent \"solidarity to the thousands of Glasgow women who are striking in their fight for justice.\"While I wish the strike wasnrsquot happening, I have nothing but admiration for the women involved.

Once the provider of a fth of the worldrsquos ships thanks to yards such as Fairfields and Stephens on the Southside, Connels and Yarrows to the north, and John Brownrsquos at Clydebank, almost all but a few pockets of marine engineering on the Clyde would eventually fall silent.The Clydersquos proud history as one of the worldrsquos greatest sources of passenger liners, naval vessels and steamers slipped away to yards in Japan, Korea and China. Where those th and th century yards spewed out around , ships during their letimes, emerged new industries of financial services, tourism and media, and the Clydersquos quaysides became home to flats and shopping malls.Now, however, therersquos fresh hope that the Clydersquos proud marine heritage could be reborn for a modern era.The banks of the Upper Clyde ndash once home to yards like Napier and Miller which in the  built passenger ships and Great Lakes traders for American, Canadian and Norwegian companies before crumbling during the Great Depression ndash are set to reunite with the water, in the shape of a major new marine lsquoincubatorrsquo hub.The ambitious plan to restore marine manufacturing and support industries to the Upper Clyde ndash and with them, around  jobs ndash has been revealed by Glasgow-based marine engineering company Malin Group, which itself can trace its Clydeside roots to the Victoria era.The Scottish Marine Technology Park, planned for at Old Kilpatrick in the shadow of the Erskine Bridge, will be developed on -acres of derelict land which once housed the Carless oil storage facility. Wounded during the Clydebank Blitz when Nazi bombers left its tanks seeping oil into land.Unsuitable for housing, the brownfield site is one of the few of its kind remaining from dozens of shipyards and industries which once lined the river. That, along with direct access to a deep-water channel via an -metre long deep-water quayside berth with heavy lt facilities, means the site is ideally placed to help position the Clyde once again as a marine pioneer.As well as construction works, there are plans for the site to become a vibrant base for a wide range of modern marine industries, which could include radar developers and marine technology start-ups, to large scale developers of hydro-electric and renewable energy structures.Malin Group managing director John MacSween said: ldquoThe heritage of the Clyde is something of which we should all be rightly proud.ldquoWe have been working in the shipping industry for over  years and have a passion for the river and its history, but there is a need to be looking to the future to ensure the long-term success of the Clyde as a maritime centre of excellence.ldquoWe want to create a Marine Technology Hub which brings together providers of research, skills development, design, manufacturing and practical marine operational and logistics experience in a location that has complementary facilities backed by direct access to the deep-water channel of the River Clyde.As well as restoring the Clydersquos links with its proud marine heritage, itrsquos hoped the Old Kilpatrick site will help stem a drain of talent that sees Scottish university-educated marine architects and highly-trained marine researchers quit Scotland for overseas roles.Itrsquos also hoped that bringing together marine-based technology and construction companies in one location will creative an innovative spark to help create a new golden age of marine industry on the Clyde.ldquoBusinesses have struggled to find industrial land next to the river to allow them to work on marine-related issues, Mr MacSween added. ldquoItrsquos a sad state of affairs where there was once  miles of quayside along the Clyde, and now itrsquos down to just three or four.ldquoGlasgow has become a cosmopolitan city, with flats and retail parks along the river. But perhaps thatrsquos gone a bit too far, and the city is missing an opportunity to attract some of the marine-based businesses back.He said while BAE Systems and Ferguson Marine are keeping the Clydersquos shipbuilding heritage alive, more needed to be done to nurture marine-based talent.ldquoTraining and ship-management are very well represented and the Department of Naval Architecture at Strathclyde University is a world class centre for research and learning in the marine sector.ldquoWersquore known around the world for producing scientic talent, but most go overseas because they canrsquot find work in their field closer to home.ldquoWersquove been sending a signal that because of a dearth of space we are not open for business, and marine specialists canrsquot come to the Clyde because therersquos no opportunity to set up even though they are right next to the sea.ldquoNow therersquoll be a site that offers just that opportunity.The development, which is in an advanced stage of planning with West Dunbartonshire Council, will see a poundm remediation and regeneration of the contaminated land that is a legacy of the past oil refinery.Preparation works have already uncovered signs of the arearsquos shipbuilding past trenches have revealed an old slipway and signs of a harbour wall which appear to pre-date the oil depot. The structures could be linked to Napier and Miller, based at Old Kilpatrick from , and which built over  ships before falling victim to the Depression.Malin will move its own fabrication company, which currently builds workboats for the aquaculture industry and other marine fabrications at Renfrew, to the site to kick start the development.The construction phase of the project will see over  additional short-term jobs created, while itrsquos hoped that eventually the marine incubator could create  jobs and contribute pound.m annually to the local economy.Mark Newlands, Regional Head of Partnerships at Scottish Enterprise, said: \"We welcome Malinrsquos ambitious plans to revitalise this site and create much needed jobs in the West Dunbartonshire area. We look forward to working alongside the company to support its growth aspirations.ldquoWhat wersquore planning will never be on the same scale as in the past, but therersquos more to marine manufacturing than just shipbuilding, added Mr MacSween.ldquoBut therersquos a lot of exciting technology that needs to be built and sent off around the world.ldquoAnd therersquos potential for Glasgow and the Clyde to once again be at the forefront.ENDS"},{"url":null,"title":"teach-mandarin-urdu-and-arabic-to-save-language-learning-says-report","story":"But a new report argues our population now speaks more languages than ever before thanks to the establishment of communities from across the globe.There are now  languages spoken by Scottish pupils at home with the most common after English including Polish, Urdu, Punjabi, Arabic and Chinese.The report by the Reform Scotland has called on schools to harness the language expertise in such communities to lead a revolution in language learning.The findings come as figures from the Scottish Qualication Authorityshow entries in traditional languages have decreased over the last  years.Entries for Higher French are down by more than  per cent while entries for Higher German dropped by nearly  per cent.Reform Scotland called for an end to distinctions between so-called ldquocommunity languages and other modern languages.Chris Deerin, director of Reform Scotland, said: ldquoIf we want to see genuine growth in language skills rather than just paying lip service to the idea we need to rethink our approach.ldquoThere is a danger the languages currently on offer within the education system are not keeping up with Scottish or global society.ldquoWe need to think much more freely -

I believe that this amendment will help transform the landscape of residential and economic development in Scotland.ldquoMost crucially, this will enable more houses to be built, more communities to be created andmore people will have more opportunity to own their own home.Mr Wightman added: ldquoWith average house prices seven and a half times the average salary we must take every opportunity we can to help people afford to buy or rent a home.ldquoGiving local councils the power to buy land at existing use value rather than the inflated value caused by planning permission is an important tool in the box.ldquoA classic example is the Waterfront in Edinburgh where there are swathes of vacant land that have been allocated for housing for years. Developers have been biding their time while the land value rises and the cityrsquos housing crisis worsens.ldquoThis land should be available for the council to buy at its current value so it can get on with the job of building affordable housing for ownership and rent."},{"url":null,"title":"farmer speaks out after bse discovery","story":"The farmer of the herd found with BSE in Aberdeenshire has issued a statement following yesterdays announcement.Thomas Jackson, of Boghead Farm in Lumsden, said: \"This has been a very dficult time for myself and my we and we have found the situation personally devastating.\"We have built up our closed herd over many years and have always taken great pride in doing all the correct things.

It is a neurological disease which results in changes in animals# mental state, abnormalities of posture and movement and of sensation. The clinical disease usually lasts for several weeks and it is characteristically progressive and fatal.According to The World Organisation for Animal Health statistics very few cases of BSE — fewer than  each year since  — are reported in the UK.Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing said: “Following confirmation of a case of classical BSE in Aberdeenshire, I have activated the Scottish Government’s response plan to protect our valuable farming industry, including establishing a precautionary movement ban being placed on the farm.“While it is important to stress that this is standard procedure until we have a clear understanding of the disease#s origin, this is further proof that our surveillance system for detecting this type of disease is working. Be assured that the Scottish Government and its partners stand ready to respond to any further confirmed cases of the disease in Scotland.”Chief Veterinary Officer Sheila Voas said: “While it is too early to tell where the disease came from in this case, its detection is proof that our surveillance system is doing its job. We are working closely with the Animal and Plant Health Agency to answer this question, and in the meantime, I would urge any farmer who has concerns to immediately seek veterinary advice.Ian McWatt, Director of Operations in Food Standards Scotland said: “There are strict controls in place to protect consumers from the risk of BSE, including controls on animal feed, and removal of the parts of cattle most likely to carry BSE infectivity.“Consumers can be reassured that these important protection measures remain in place and that Food Standards Scotland Official Veterinarians and Meat Hygiene Inspectors working in all abattoirs in Scotland will continue to ensure that in respect of BSE controls, the safety of consumers remains a priority. We will continue to work closely with Scottish Government, other agencies and industry at this time.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Veterans, army and sea cadets and other groups will muster at the Royal British Legion, setting off shortly afterwards to form up on Broad Street.A short service led by the Salvation Army captain will lead to a two-minute silence at am, before a special Armistice Service takes place in the cathedral.In the afternoon, volunteers will begin to create a large-scale portrait in the sand at Scapa Beach, of an Orcadian soldier killed during WWI as part of Danny Boyle’s - NOW commission, Pages of the Sea. It was previously reported in last week’s The Orcadian that the event would take place at Waulkmill Bay, but this location has since changed to Scapa Beach.The artwork — one of  across the UK and the Republic of Ireland — will signy both the departure of the soldier from the county to serve in the war and, as the tide washes their image away, the loss of their le and those of many others.At pm, Orkney’s young people join forces with Orkney Rocks! Choir and others to remember those lost, and the impact the war had on those left behind, in a special concert at the Orkney Arts Theatre.Admission will be free and there will be an opportunity to make a contribution to the charity, Help for Heroes. Tickets for the concert will be released on Monday, October , and will be available at the council’s customer services points in School Place, Kirkwall, and Warehouse Buildings, Stromness.At .pm, a lone bugler at St Magnus Cathedral will join , inidual buglers from across the UK and oversees territories in sounding the historic ‘Last Post’.This will be followed by the lighting of a beacon on the St Magnus Cathedral kirk green at pm as part of the national Beacons of Light event which will see beacons lit across the country, symbolising an end to the darkness of war andto the light of peace.St Magnus Cathedral will remain the focus as, at .pm, the bells will ring alongside , others across the nation and beyond.Between pm and pm, the short film specially commissioned by the Kirkwall Townscape Heritage Initiative for the centenary of the armistice will be projected onto the cathedral for the last time.The convener of Orkney Islands Council, Harvey Johnston, said: “We are grateful to everyone who has worked with us so far to ensure we have a fitting programme of events here in Orkney for people to mark this momentous occasion and pay their respects to forbears who suffered so much.

Inkson, have been fondly remembered down the years and credited with greatly boosting the French linguistic capabilities of those involved.As well as sowing the seeds for lasting friendships, one of the exchanges also led to the eventual marriage of Alistair Swanson of Dingwall and Belgian Marie-Anny De Landsheer. Alistair lived next door to Marie-Annyrsquos Scottish exchange partner, Sandra, daughter of the late Sandy and Lilly Macrae.With some of those attending a th anniversary meeting in Dingwall now in their s and s, there was much to catch on. One of those present, George Robertson, said the stark contrast between the new and old Dingwall Academy buildings amazed those present.\"The day began with a guided tour of Dingwall Academy, graciously hosted by rector, Mrs Karen Cormack and two equally charming assistants, Ceitidh Petrie of fth Year and head girl, Anna-Maria Stewart of sixth year. We were amazed by the change in the Academy mdash from the grim corridors with its memories of rooms with formal rows of desks, piles of jotters and frequent administrations of summary justice mdash with the lsquoLochgelly Specialrsquo mdash to the cosy, student-friendly comfort of modern classrooms, sumptuously equipped with digital projectors and interactive whiteboards.\"Gone are the dingy cloakrooms, in the corners of which, stressed-out procrastinators struggled furiously to finish their homework on time! Gone too, are the endless, uncouth nicknames we used to give our teachers, Pirrac, Froggy, Daisy-lugs, Kate Stew, Inky, Willie the War, Kramer, Horace, Scabbac, Sinkie, Snottery Tom and so on.\"He added: \"We soon realised that Dingwall Academy is a much happier, kinder place than the strictly regimented establishment, where we learned, suffered, cried, laughed and fell in, and out, of love! The old school, however, was not all bad, because we had the good fortune of being taught by many caring, brilliant teachers who inspired and challenged us, and whom we still remember with great fondness. J.K.Inkson was one of those par excellence, but kind and modest, despite his many gts.\"After welcome refreshments in the Academy cafe, the group enjoyed a tour of Dingwall Museum.Mr Robertson said: \"The culminating highlight of our day was, without doubt, the get-together and dinner in the Royal Hotel, Cromarty. We were able to catch up with more of our old friends and former schoolmates. We were formally welcomed by Sandra Collardand by Marie-Anny, who addressed us in flawless English. The dinner was a splendid affair, with a host of gastonomic delicacies, all excellently prepared.\"The old friends recalled the lasting benefits of their exchanges down the years. Mr Robertson said: \"We were particularly glad to have a representative of the Inkson family with us, in the form of J.K.rsquos daughter, Helen, and we were pleased to hear a message of greeting from his son, Kerr, who lives in Auckland, New Zealand.\"Kerr wrote of his pride in the job his father had done, developing and managing the exchanges. He also wished us all a happy evening together. We remembered with fondness, all those who were no longer with us, and especially J.K.Inkson himself, to whose memory all drank a fitting toast.\"Warm thanks were also expressed to Sandra Collard who helped maintain contacts and organise the event and Marie-Anny who \"emulated mdash and surpassed mdash her fictional compatriot, Monsieur Poirot, in locating so many of our Belgian friends\".Although Marie-Anny was the only surviving Belgian veteran who felt able to undertake the long journey to Ross-shire, Mr Robertson said: \"There has been a great exchange of email addresses, and it looks like the ether will be buzzing with electronic correspondence between old friends in Britain and Belgium.\"Well done, Marie-Anny and Sandra, for giving us one of the most memorable days of our lives, and thank you Alistair, for your magical photographic memories of this wonderful occasion!\"Wednesday  Oct  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The ersion could then reopen to traffic shortly after a train clears the other side.Ross, Skye and Lochaber MP, Ian Blackford has been campaigning for the revised system with support from Scottish Transport Secretary, Michael Matheson.Mr Blackford said: \"This has the potential to be great news and work now must be put in place to make these plans a reality. I would like to put on record my gratitude to Network Rail for listening to concerns of the local community and of representatives like myself.\"Despite matters relating to Network Rail being reserved to Westminster, I knew the best hope was for the Scottish Government to try and make clear that the sorry state of affairs that we have all witnessed, couldnrsquot be allowed to continue. Let me be frank, these changes would not have been possible without the intervention of the Scottish Governmentrsquos Transport Secretary, Michael Matheson MSP.\"The local communities deserve a huge amount of credit as well. Local representatives have campaigned tirelessly and have sought to keep people informed when information wasnrsquot always forthcoming from Highland Council.\"I hope now that we can move forward from what has been an extremely trying situation for local communities.\"Network Rail confirmed the new system is something it is actively looking into, but that it was not yet in a position to proceed and had no specic start date for its introduction.But a spokesman added that the system was similar to one that was introduced on the same stretch of track in  after another serious landslide, so the idea is feasible.Wednesday  Oct  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

LoLThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.Based on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the th anniversary of the Milne Cup.Sadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.Many supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.While it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.But despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The - scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.Molloy’s introduction  minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubtanyone  in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.But the damage had been done in the first half – at - down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.Some have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.I felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.Two years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a - defeat in Kirkwall.There is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s th birthday.It’s just a pity we have to wait a whole  months until a chance of revenge.: : : : : : : :A couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.There are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.A score of - was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.The Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.A few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.I would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.: : : : : : : :Orkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening#s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John CouttsThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over  guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.Unfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.The speeches which followed,anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.It was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.Sinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous  game when he hit the back of the net five times in the - victory.: : : : : : : :And finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.On Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.Helped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.Robert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did -odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.The others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.The final score was a - win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate - football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"big turnout to welcome the eighth serene to whalsay ","story":"The latest Serene arrives at the pier at Symbister.

The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

There would be an impact in the short term of the dry ski slope.\"Whether it will ever be an attraction in its own right and generate signicant income, who knows, but that is not a consideration of the planning process.\"In effect it is a ersication of business in this area and therefore acceptable andit was to strengthen the stability of CairnGorm Mountain then thats a good thing.\"He said there were some hefty planning conditions attached to control the development.CairnGorm Mountains representative said some  per cent of total visits to the resort were in just three winter months of the year.Mr Gough had told the committee Natural Retreats had explored several options in depth to remove the reliance on winter income including mountain biking and zip-wiring but this plan was the most viable at this time.He said it was imperative the attraction can provide year-round employment in order to retain its best staff. This site was the most sheltered for the ski slope and close to other facilities without impacting on other slopes, he said. It could also be used for tubing and other activities.Mr Gough acknowledged the clamour for better ski uplt at CairnGorm which has been overtaken as Scotlands most popular ski resort.He said: \"We would like nothing more than to be able to upgrade ski infrastructure to improve the snowsports experience for everyone but this has to be a long term process built on solid commercial foundations.\"He said the slope could be in operation for  per cent of the year outwith winter and ice would not be a problem as it was easy practice to break it up.ABA secretary Alan Brattey said history showed articial slopes at Scottish resorts including the Lecht, Glenshee and Glencoe had not worked.He also said a bright green Snowflex slope would stand out like a sore thumb and no consideration had been given by the operator to an alternative by market leader, Neveplast, which could be camouflaged.He said that of just over  votes on Facebook on the application,  per cent were against it.Tessa Jones, of the Badenoch and Strathspey Conservation Group, asked the committee: \"What are you going to say to the world about this peatland destruction \"Committee member Dave Fallows moved the application be refused and he was seconded by Carolyn Caddick.He said he appreciated the efforts to mitigate against the ski slope but said: \"It cant possibly soften in the long term the impact that this makes on the area.\"Mrs Caddick said: \"We are going to see it for miles and miles around.\"Peter Argyle had moved in favour of the application saying he had faith in the planning officers conditions but was not supported.Mr Brattey said after the vote: \"This was very much the right decision and wed like to congratulate the planning committee for deciding to reject this planning application against the advice of their planning officials.\"We very much hope that common sense will now prevail and that the plans for the Ptarmigan Building will be dropped.\"We are left to wonder just exactly why HIE allowed their tenant to take such a madcap plan all the way to the CNPAs planning committee who were very decisive in their rejection of it.\"He said HIE should ert the pound million to new uplt. \"The hill business requires to be funicular proofed as soon as possible,\" said Mr Brattey.Wednesday  Oct  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118063.jpg","title":"Green light for Dalwhinnie quarry work","story":"Gavin MusgroveA quarry operator has said that measures are in place to allay concerns that their excavation plans could lead to a surge in speeding lorries in a Badenoch village.Leithshas been given the green light by the Cairngorms National Park Authorityrsquos planning committee to recommence operations at the site at Carn Dhomhnuill Bhain on the doorstep of Dalwhinnie.The company has said that it is not contingent on winning a contract to supply aggregate to the dualling of the A but that the produce will be used for housebuilding and other local construction projects.The firm was granted temporary permission for  yearsatthe CNPArsquoslatest planning committee meeting at Boat of Garten Community Hall.Production will be stepped up dramatically at the quarry around one mile north of Dalwhinnie by the A.It was previously in operation up to .But now Leiths has permission to extend the site from two to  hectares.

Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale. But it is the definition of a leline service, with , passengers last year, many of whom found themselves unable to squeeze onto an overbooked #Loch Seaforth#.We should be told how and why one of our biggest and most important ferries came to be owned by Lloyds Bank.We should be toldJim McColl is going to deliver two badly-needed ships at the third time of asking.It is not enough to say, as does transport minister Michael Matheson, that building CalMac#s ferries is #providing vital support to our shipbuilding industry#The way things are going, building and rebuilding CalMac#s ferries will keep Scottish shipbuilding alive well into the next decade.

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €. Like Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. If the film ‘Black ’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In  the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘KilkennyModerator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” The recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.Students of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. The book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of , rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties -’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester. This is a beautully produced book anda credit to the publishers Lilliput Press and of course to theauthor.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27481  ","story":"• Mícheál Mac Donncha and Robert Ballagh Mícheál Mac Donnchaby Robert Ballagh published by Head of Zeus. back in the late s. For anartist of his stature this was courageous, dependent as he was, tosome extent, on commissions from people who, to say the least, wouldnot be subscribers to our paper. But this was an artist who went hisown way in art and who acted as a citizen with a conscience in anIreland where State-imposed censorship distorted not only politicaldebate but also national self-image. For Robert Ballaghcreative work and active citizenship have gone hand in hand all hisle. This is depicted in his double self-portrait ‘Upstairs No.’,one of the many illustrations of his work in this superbly writtenand beautully presented book. It is not a standard autobiographywith chapters set out in chronological order beginning with genealogyand ending with this week’s news. As you would expect from Ballagh,he takes a dferent approach, starting towards the later years andcircling through his days in no particular order before coming backto the present. More than that, he weaves narrative, anecdote andreflection together seamlessly and conversationally showing a skillwith words akin to his skill with brushes. He has a story to tell ofa very ied le, from his unusual family background to his time asa showband guitar player, through his unorthodox beginning as apainter and his development as an artist and an activist. Withfrankness and clarity he tells us how he learned and matured as anartist and his brief commentaries on many of his works areilluminating both of how they were made and the concepts behind them.It makes the reader want to look again and more intensely at thepictures. The Prologue isessentially a dedication to Robert’s late we Betty, his lelonginspiration, mentor and most important critic. The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings. Butthis does not cast a shadow over the book, as her positive presenceis felt throughout, and is celebrated by the author. These days I rarely getthat urge immediately to re-read a book when I reach the end, but Idid with this one. Thankfully the chapters are so well defined thatthey can be read as stand-alone essays or stories. Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’. I cannot recommend thisbook highly enough. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview  Ruairí Doyle“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TDSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. Teachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home. We need togive people the opportunity to raise their families at home, so that they canget through le and reach their opportunities and reach their potential athomethat’s what they wish.” test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27483  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinWe are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit. In other words an agreement endorsed by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island. That is the big challenge for our generation. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27484  ","story":"• RUC unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons Mícheál Mac DonnchaCivil Rights campaigners in Derry had been pressing for a march in their city which had long been a byword for unionist sectarianism and discrimination.Using gerrymandered electoral boundaries and a corrupt voting system which allowed wealthier citizens to have multiple votes in local elections, the unionists maintained a majority of members on the council in a city with a nationalist majority.Nationalists lived in very poor housing conditions and were affected disproportionately by the % unemployment rate in the city.Unionists had long regarded the old walled town as a citadel that could never be surrendered and their dominance was symbolised by the walls towering over the crumbling th century terraced streets of the nationalist Bogside. The last time nationalists had attempted to hold a parade inside the walls was on St Patrick’s Day  – when they were batoned by the RUC.Housing was a massive issue in Derry and the Derry Housing Action Committeeprovided the focus for leadership as the Civil Rights campaign took off. The DHAC had organised a James Connolly commemoration in the city in July  which was banned by the unionist government.The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Associationagreed to hold a march in Derry on  October. The loyalist Apprentice Boys organisation immediately announced a counter-demonstration with the purpose of forcing the unionist government’s hand to ban the Civil Rights march. But the regime at Stormont did not require forcing because the Home Affairs Minister was ultra-unionist William Craig, who promptly imposed the ban.NICRA held an emergency meeting with the DHAC. Many on the NICRA Executive and some Derry nationalist figures, including John Hume, wanted to cancel the march, but the majority of Derry activists were determined to defy the ban. They won out and the march was to proceed as planned.It was a relatively small march, beginning on Craigavon Bridge with several hundred people. The objective was the Diamond in the city centre.The march was stopped in Duke Street by the RUC. A meeting was held with speakers including Gerry Fitt, Betty Sinclair, Eddie McAteer, Ivan Cooper, Austin Currie and Eamonn McCann. Three Westminster Labour MPs were also present.After the meeting, the marchers found themselves hemmed in on all sides by the RUC. They could not disperse and after a tense stand-off the RUC, oblivious to the presence of TV cameras and photographers, unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons, boots and fists. Water cannons were then used.Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, then a young People’s Democracy activist, recalled:“Quite deliberately, they hosed in the upstairs windows and shopfronts, and they went right across Craigavon Bridge, hosing all the onlookers. The police just went mad.”The RUC attack in Duke Street brought the Civil Rights struggle in Ireland to a world audience for the first time. It was a complete eye-opener to many people in the  Counties and in Britain. But most profound was its effect on young nationalists.Derry man Mickey Devine , the last of the ten Hunger Strikers to die in the H-Blocks of Long Kesh in , recalled:“Like every young person in Derry, my whole way of thinking was tossed upside down by the events of  October . I didn’t even know there was a Civil Rights march I saw it on television.“But that night I was down the town smashing shop windows and stoning the RUC. I developed an intense hatred of the RUC. As a child I had always known not to talk to them or to have anything to do with them, but this was dferent.The RUC attacked the Civil Rights march in Duke Street, Derry, on  October .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27485  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering and pain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contested narratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.- Declan KearneyThis week the NIO consultation on dealing with the legacy of thepast in the north of Ireland closed.It will inform a legislative process and bringforward future legacy legislation.Failure to deal with the past remains one of the most signicantimpediments to political progress here.It is a barrier to the development of a comprehensivereconciliation and healing process in this society.British state policy has been the primary factor in preventinglegacy issues from being addressed or resolved.Powerful sections of the British military and intelligence systemhave never embraced the peace process. They remain psychologically andpolitically locked into a conflict mind-set even twenty years after the GoodFriday Agreement was signed.The role of British State forces and their agents, a refusal toacknowledge and be accountable for their actions, combined with a disregard forsuccessive binding court rulings, has defined the British state’s approach tolegacy matters.That has been reinforced in recent times by a cynical and narrative, including interventions by the British Prime Minister Theresa May,and British Secretary of State in the north, Karen Bradley, to suggest thatonly state forces were being made subject to legacy investigations.These statements are offensive and wrong, and are an egregiousdemonstration of the partisan nature of British policy towards dealing with thepast.They are consistent with the British practice of denying wrongdoing, concealing the truth, and preventing accountability.This poses a major challenge to ensuring that a robust,independent, and impartial facilitation of the legislative process will emergefrom this consultation on addressing the legacy of the past.All sides suffered, and caused suffering to each other during theconflict.There are multiple narratives regarding our tragic past. There isno single narrative despite the attempts of the British state and politicalunionism to assert otherwise.The past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering andpain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contestednarratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.The Stormont House Agreement, , , set out an agreedframework of legacy mechanisms which provided an unprecedented opportunity tocomprehensively deal with the past in all its aspects.Subsequent draft legislation reneged on the British government’sobligations under the SHA by introducing a national security veto, which hadthe effect of blocking a way forward on the issue of legacy.Full implementation of the SHA on a human rights compliant basispresents the best opportunity to deal with the legacy of our past and guaranteea framework which is victim centred.Facilitation of any future legislative process will require thatthe British government must ensure all victims are treated with equality,respect and dignity that the legislation reflects the policy intent of theAgreement and, that the legacy architecture is fully independent, human rightscompliant, and properly resourced and funded.The following key principles should be central to the operation offuture legacy legislation and mechanisms.-          Allprocesses should be victim centred-          Allprocesses must secure the co-operation of all relevant parties to ensuresuccess-          Allprocesses should be based upon equality, respect, and dignity-          Allprocesses must be free from political interference and be absolutelyindependent-         Acknowledgement should be central to the operation of the legacy framework-          The aim ofthat framework should be to enable reconciliation and healing within widersocietyIf there is to be a collective and comprehensive engagement withthe past in a human rights compliant manner, there can be no hierarchy ofvictimhood or humanity.There must be no change to the definition of a victim.High-quality services should be provided to all victims at thepoint of need.This should extend to the immediate provision of a pension for allseriously and psychologically injured during the conflict.The British Government should also immediately release therequired funding to resource the Lord Chief Justice’s inquest plan, as aseparate distinct process from any new legacy mechanisms.The Office of the Police Ombudsman should be adequately andimmediately resourced.Any attempt by the British state to introduce a statute oflimitations to protect its forces and agents would be a violation of the SHA and must be opposed.Full participation and unfettered disclosure by British stateforces and its agents with the legacy mechanisms will be essential to achievefull public confidence in their ability to deliver on behalf of all society.Periodic reviews should be carried out to inform the extent offunding requirements and necessary timeframe, for all legacy mechanisms.Legacy processes should not be limited or impeded by closedmaterial proceedings. In addition, for future legacy mechanisms toasintended, it is essential families are given full access to legal aid.The legacy legislation which ultimately emerges from theconsultation must comply with the policy intent of the SHA by:-          Promotingreconciliation-          Upholdingthe rule of law-         Acknowledging and addressing the suffering of all victims and survivors-         Facilitating the pursuit of justice and information recovery-          Beinghuman rights compliant-          Beingbalanced, proportionate, transparent, accountable, fair, and equalThe full implementation of that Agreement representsthe best potential and opportunity to address the legacy of our politicalconflict and the suffering experienced by everyone during the conflict inIreland, Britain and beyond. So, it is now time to finally deal with the past.  It is time tobuild for the future.

think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster. They had abolished the veto of the House of Lords and Home Rule was due to be implemented in . The Tories seized on the issue of Home Rule as the most effective weapon to bring down the Liberals. Leading members of the British landed aristocracy, capitalists and senior military figures jumped on the bandwagon and backed up Unionist leader Edward Carson with threats of civil warHome Rule was brought in.Amidst the political frenzy there were very few Protestants in Ulster who were prepared to oppose Carsonism. But there were some and among them was the Reverend J.B. Armour of Ballymoney, County Antrim. A minister of the Presbyterian Church, Armour stood out from most of his co-religionists in advocating self-government for Ireland. In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism. Banners in the hall proclaimed “No provisional or provincial government for us” and “Ulster for Ireland and Ireland for us”.The resolution stated that the meeting of Protestants of Ballymoney and the protests in The Route“against the claim of Sir Edward Carson and the self-constituted Provisional Government of Ulster to represent the Protestant community of north-east Ulster” and “disputes the narrow claim that dferences of creed necessarily separate Irishmen and women into hostile camps”. Among the speakers at the Ballymoney meeting were JB Armour himself, historian Alice Stopford Green, Jack White, son of a British Army general and later a leading figure in the Irish Citizen Army, and Roger Casement, who was executed in . This was Casement’s first appearance on a political . With his Antrim family background, Casement regarded the occasion as hugely signicant and in his speech he denounced any notion of partitioning Ireland. The meeting was a once-off and failed to turn the tide of Carsonism but it did show that a signicant minority of Protestants in the North-East were still prepared to stand up for Irish unity and self-government. The meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney in support of Irish self-government was held on  October ,  years ago this week. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27489  ","story":" Michael McMonagleThirty years ago today the British government, fearful of the growth of Sinn Féin, introduced the broadcasting ban to stop Sinn Féin representatives being heard on television and radio. The ban was introduced by the British governments Home Secretary, Douglas Hurd on October , . The ban was brought in an attempt to halt the growth of Sinn Féin in the north and to prevent a wider audience hearing a republican analysis of the ongoing conflict at the time. It prevented Sinn Féin representatives from appearing on television and radio interviews. When it was first introduced many broadcasters were unsure of how it should be implemented and effectively blocked all republicans from the broadcast media, even those who were not members of Sinn Féin. Broadcasters and journalists unions disliked the ban because of the disruption it caused and some sought ways to get around it, the most well known being the actors voice compromise where actors were brought in to speak the words of Sinn Féin representatives. This led to the bizarre situation where viewers could see Sinn Féin representatives on their screens but could not hear their voices. Several actors who went on to have successful stage and screen careers started out by providing the voices for Gerry Adams, Martin McGuinness and others. Of course, this was not the first time Sinn Féin representatives had been banned from the airwaves the Irish government used a similar tactic  years earlier. Section  of the Broadcasting Act, introduced in , banned Sinn Féin representatives from the media. RTÉ went further and extended the ban to all expressions of republican opinion, including popular ballads. As the peace process progressed the ban appeared more and more ludicrous, forcing the British government to abandon it in . Following the lting of the ban, Raymond McCartney became the first Sinn Féin representative to have his own voice heard in a  television interview. test"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1102539.jpg--.jpg?1540218300000\n","title":"agency staff in council roles receiving raw deal","story":"AGENCY workers in roles within the Council have been expressing their frustrations that they have not been offered permanent employment.Bannside TUV Councillor Stewart McDonald said: Several hardworking people came to me expressing their frustration that they have been unable to obtain steady employment with the council after working through an agency for a considerable period. For some time now I have been concerned about the Council’s policies when it comes to the employment of agency workers.“In order to establish the facts last month I tabled a series of questions to the Council which have done little to remove my fears that agency staff are getting a raw deal from Mid and East Antrim Council.I have established that although  agency staff are employed by the council not one has transferred to become council staff in the past year.Councillor McDonald continued: One of the agencies used by the council charges % of annual salary as a feean agency worker becomes a member of council staff proper.“The averageof time an agency worker has been employed by the council is . years with one agency worker employed for  years and pound. million has been spent on agency workers in the year   - an average weekly cost of pound,.“The council could not advise me how much of that weekly cost of pound, ends up in the pockets of workers and how much of it is taken by the agencies. “Mid and East Antrim Council recently hired three new directors.They didn’t go to agencies to get them.He added: “I am concerned that staff are receiving a raw deal from these arrangements.While agency work doubtless suites the needs of both the council and the employee in some cases I know that there are many agency workers who would welcome the additional benefits and security which would come with obtaining a position with the council proper.With the average agency worker in post for almost three years it is clear that many have been providing invaluable service to the council with no need to swap and change employees.  “I believe the people of Mid and East Antrim want to see happy staff paid as they should be with the proper security of employment we would like for ourselves and our families.I will continue to press this issue from within the council chamber and committees.”Council statement A spokesperson from Mid and East Antrim Council said: Mid and East Antrim Borough Council is a multi-award winning council with a reputation for innovation, dynamism and leadership at a regional level.“Since the creation of the new council in , our entire team at Mid and East Antrim has had a truly transformational impact in creating what is now widely regarded as one of region’s best-performing councils, across many areas.“We continue to lead the way as Northern Irelands top performing council for planning and the achieving of job targets for business start-ups, and currently rank second out of all  councils in the region in relation to the percentage of household waste sent for recycling. “Like all Northern Ireland councils, we are continuing to deliver the transformation of local government structures and ensuring our organisation is best fit for purpose, working closely with our elected members and trade unions.“The use of agency staff is often the most effective solution to ensuring the delivery of essential services, particularly during periods of short-term upsurges in workload. “However, we expect that the use of agency workers covering these type of posts on a temporary basis will reduce, moving forward.”  "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1106582.jpg--.jpg?1540373104000\n","title":"allen s meats moves to larger premises in cullybackey","story":"AFTER  years serving the people of Ahoghill Allens Meats has moved to larger premises to meet the demands of the growing business.The butchers shop has relocated to Cullybackey to take over the former Lamont Butchers at  Main Street in the village.Allens Meats needed to acquire larger premises and decided to make the move to Cullybackey after David Lamont retired.Lamont Butchers has been based in Cullybackey since  and Derek Allen and his team will continue to provide the same excellent customer service and top quality produce.Derek said: “The business is growing and we needed more space to enable us to offer a wider range of products.“We would like to thank all our customers in Ahoghill for their support over the last  years.

Founded in , VisPa is run by local Kenyan staff. The charity has an orphanage, a nursery, a primary school and a secondary school which care for and educate almost  children every year, as well as supporting young people through university. The aim of the Everest trek was to raise funds for a new Primary School at Vispa Emmanuel School and Orphanage in Kisumu, Kenya, which will benefit over  needy children from that area.Arriving at the base camp is no easy achievement.Richard and the team took several days to trek and had to overcome many dficult journeys while adjusting to the ever changing altitude pressures along the way.Their first big ascent was to ,ft for the stunning views of the surrounding peaks.Getting up to this height gave their bodies the chance they needed to acclimatize to the low levels of oxygen, which helped prepare them for their destination of Everest Base Camp a few days later.After taking some rest, the team trekked to Lobuche .The trail from Tukla started steeply to climb up beside the glacier moraine. However, after a six hour trek they arrived tired, but safely at Lobuche.Rest and recovery was key in the mission, however most days started early and included long periods of walking, often along tricky terrain.The next main trek was to Gorak Shep which took three hours to complete. After taking a short break they were off again for a further four to five hours to reach their destination of Everest Base Camp.Finally reaching the Everest Base Camp at ,ft was a huge achievement.The team were able to get up close and personal with the highest mountain on earth and were able to go to the edge of the icefall, and see the start of the climbing route up Mount Everest and Lhotse before making their way back to Gorak Shep to stay the night.They then started the ascent of Kala Pattar to see a beautul sunrise view of Everest and the Khumbu icefall. They then ed to Pheriche for the night before they started their final descent.Congratulations!Speaking on social media, Friends of Vispa said the achievement was: “Absolutely amazing! Praise God! So proud of every member of the team who took part in this challenge! WELL DONE!“This great achievement by the team will change the lives of many children at Vispa School and Orphange, Kenya.”Richard’s we, local music teacher Sylvia Burnside, has also been involved with the Friends of Vispa charity.Over the Summer, she travelled to Kenya and to the Emmanuel School to do music and singing with the children there.With a big heart for the children, Sylvia said: “I’m so very proud of Richard for completing this challenge.“He’s always been a great support to me and has stayed at home to let me go to Kenya and do music with the children.“So now that it’s his turn, I’m so proud of what he has achieved.”Friends of Vispa is committed to putting Christian faith into action in the provision of education, food, clothing, healthcare and spiritual guidance to highly vulnerable children and young people in Kenya .If you would like to donate to the Everest challenge, please go to the Just Giving page: www.justgiving campaign vistaeverest "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1104319.jpg--.jpg?1540283951000\n","title":"remembering the 1978 vumba massacre","story":"FORTY years have passed since the Vumba Massacre in former Rhodesia which resulted in the death of  Elim missionaries including Cullybackey man Roy Lynn, his we and their three week old baby.Royand Joyce Lynnand their daughter Pamela were killed by Rhodesian black nationalist guerrillas at the Eagle School in Vumba on June , .Twelve people died in the brutal attack, including four children, whilst one missionary was found alive but sadly passed away in hospital six days later.In tribute to the “martyrs of Rhodesia” performing arts expert Richard Hasnip has written a moving play which is being showcased across Elim churches this year. The play is part of a collaboration with Elim Sound and Elim International Missions entitled A Call to Mission which includes worship, preaching and drama.A Call to Mission took place at Cullybackey Elim Church on October  which remembered the  missionaries who lost their lives including Roy Lynn and his family.The event is part of a special tribute to mark the th anniversary of the massacre which shocked the world.General Superintendent Elim Pentecostal Churches, Chris Cartwright said: “Ordinary people, some single, others married with small children, from Elim churches all over the UK and Ireland obeyed the call of God to serve people of that stre-torn land. They were motivated not by politics or the rights and wrongs of the cause, but by the cause of Christ. “They served primarily as medics, nurses, teachers and educators. They started small fellowships, taught the scriptures and helped and encouraged local indigenous churches.”Robert JohnLynn , the eldest of four children studied at Ballymena Technical College and worked as an apprentice motor mechanic at General Motors. Roy, along with his siblings and parents, attended Trinity Presbyterian Church in Ahoghill. With some of his young friends he enjoyed the fellowship at Cullybackey Elim Pentecostal Church and it was from there he left to study at Elim Bible College in Capel, Surrey.Following college Roy was inducted as the pastor of Brookeborough Elim Church and in  he responded to the request of Elim International Missions to travel to Rhodesia to help at Katerere Mission Station.It was at Katerere that Roy met the young woman that was later to become his we, Joyce Pickering from York. Roy married Joyce, a highly skilled nurse and midwe, in the UK on July , .During this time Rhodesia was in conflict and the situation was becoming increasingly more dangerous. Despite this every one of the Elim missionaries bravely and unstintingly opted to stay in Rhodesia to continue with their work. It was agreed, however, that they would move from Katerere to Vumba on July ,  as a safety precaution.Whilst there, Joyce Lynn opened four clinics in nearby areas while her husband Roy preached and ministered to the men. The couples daughter, Pamela Grace, was born on June , , just three weeks before her tragic death. She was killed along with her parents and  others when a group of about  Rhodesian black nationalist guerillas turned up at the school. The murders took place after the guerrillas had given political talks to  pupils.Roys brother Geoffrey first heard about their deaths the day after the massacre when a man from their local church conveyed the news to him.In tribute to all those who died in the Vumba Massacre a memorial garden has been opened at Elims headquarters in Malvern.Pastor Chris Cartwright said: “For many who visit the garden, they will know something of the events that happened on June , . It is very much part of a deeply ‘personal’ Elim story and certainly a story that the immediate families of the missionaries will vividly remember.”It is in memory of Peterand SandraMcCann their children Philipand SharonPhilipand Susanna Evansand Rebecca EvansRoyand JoyceLynn and Pamela GraceWendy WhiteCatherine Pickenand Mary Fisher who died on June , .

Myself and other volunteers would prepare Sunday dinner, talk to those using the centre, after the centre moved to Divis we still take it in turns to prepare, serve and wash up after Sunday dinner.“I asked the Bishop and he has agreed for me to start a new chaplaincy to the homeless and the idea of that is to find out what the spiritual needs of the homeless are and I really want to take the lead on that. As a deacon we are available to go to wake houses, visit with the sick and assist at the altar.”The -year-old described the ordination ceremony on Sunday as one he “enjoyed every minute of”.“I have a lot of friends who are Presbyterian, Protestants and everyone said how much they enjoyed it too, that they had never seen anything like it in their lives. There were four Bishops there and beautul music from Louis McVeigh, the Cathedral was packed and we had a ball. It lashed all day Saturday and the sun came out on Sunday, it was great after four years to finally get it done.”Gregory – whose first job at  was selling the Andersonstown News around the Norfolk area – said the deacons intend to make a really good dference in their parishes and act “as an extra pair of hands across a iety of ministries”.“In my view, the homeless, the poor, the sick, whether mentally or physically are the aristocracy of the Church and I say that word very deliberately. Pope Francis is saying it all the time now.“We have got to take people seriously when they lose someone, whether they are aged  to  in terms of their grief, give our resources, our time, this is what the Church is for.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"sailortown tribute","story":"A TRIBUTE afternoon is to take place in Sailortown this weekend to remember two men who died in a UVF sectarian shooting,  years ago.Gerard ‘Coke’ Grogan,  and Thomas ‘Tucker’ Osborne,  were killed in the shooting at their workplace, Casey’s Bottling Plant in Millfield on October , .

We are pleased that  years after their brutal murders they will be publicly recognised in a respectful way.“Thomas and Gerard’s friends were all around the same age, lived a few streets apart, schooled together, worked together and in a special childhood bond, both were baptised in St Joseph’s Church.“We never got the chance to grow old with Thomas and Gerard. The least we can do now is to pay proper respect and where better to site the tribute than St Joseph’s in Sailortown.”The book also includes a tribute story to StephenBegley who is widely regarded as the fth victim of the Casey’s atrocity.

Were their experiences to be replicated in our constituencies I think we would be very upset indeed.”The absence of ministers capable of taking decisions for nearly two years was, he said, a “signicant part of that piece”.The DUP’s Gavin Robinsonwent further, saying the Bill was an “opportunity missed” as it failed to “compel decision-making” in Northern Ireland.He told the Commons: “It’s not ambitious, it doesn’t deliver good governance in Northern Ireland, it doesn’t compel decision-making in Northern Ireland, it provides no legislative vehicle for issues that require legislation in Northern Ireland.“But we do understand and accept the position that the Secretary of State finds herself in – the constitutional barrier that she is wrestling with – but she knows that we are of the view that this place should be taking a much more interventionist approach into the affairs of Northern Ireland and that in that sense this Bill is an opportunity missed.”"},{"url":null,"title":"chinabuilt titanic ii to set sail in","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The company behind the plan, Blue Star Line, said the new ship will include all the latest safety and technical equipment to make it fit for the st Century seas. Originally the Titanic was owned by the White Star Line.Reports claim there will be nine decks and  staterooms that can accommodate , passengers and  crew members, the same as the Belfast original.First, second, and third class tickets will be available, just like the original and there will be a swimming pool, gymnasiums, and Turkish bath.However, the engines will be diesel-powered rather than coal fired but the iconic smoke stacks will remain. Clive Palmer, the Autralian business man behind the project said the maiden voyage will take travellers from Southampton to New York on the same route as the ill-fated  voyage. Then it will cruise around the world from Dubai hoping to \"enchant\" passengers with the style of the old world mixed with the new.It has been rumoured the ship will first lt anchor in , however, the company has said it is still in the early stages of planning and due diligence for the plan. “Millions have dreamt of sailing on her, seeing her in port and experiencing her unique majesty. Titanic II will be the ship where those dreams come true,” Clive Palmer said, thereported. A computer generated graphic of the new Titanic II.“The ship will follow the original journey, carrying passengers from Southampton to New York, but she will also circumnavigate the globe, inspiring and enchanting people while attracting unrivalled attention, intrigue and mystery in every port she visits.\"Speculation over the project has gathered pace over recent weeks after a series of announcements from Blue Star Line. On Tuesday it announced it would base its European office in Paris as opposed to London which will open in March .The photograph shows bodies in sacks piled three high on the deck of the CS Mackay Bennett, before being tipped overboard as the ships priest conducts a service. Photo issued by Henry Aldridge and Son.“It is of little use having a European headquarters outside Europe,’’ Mr Palmer said.Mr Palmer confirmed discussions were underway between project’s World Director and suppliers and consultants world-wide to get Titanic II underway as soon as possible.And last week the company announced the appointment of a European director - who had originally been part of the project in  - for the project who will be responsible for commercial negotiations, recruitment and training for Titanic II, the company said. At the end of September, the company released a new technical specications update in a YouTube video. Palmer was a former elected member of the Australian parliament and has announced he is standing again for election under the slogan \"Make Australia Great Again\". He has a dinosaur theme park in Australia and the Titanic project plan has been described as his \"pet project\". A second Titanic II is also being built in a theme park in China. However it will remain docked and not take on sailings.

I applied five times to get a disabled parking space for my husband due to his health dficulties and we couldn’t even get one.“I was sent a letter and they said there was ample parking on Academy Road, they told me that when I was bringing my husband home from hospital appointments that I could park outside and take him into the house, then go find another parking space. “There’s no ample parking, they just didn’t want to do it. I know in my heart of hearts that I should’ve highlighted it at the time.”She continued: “That was the start of my crusade, and I thought how dare they not get me a parking bay. And I’ve told people that outside my house is not a car park.“It has got to the stage now where it’s getting out of hand, people are parking on footpaths and you can’t see when you’re coming out of Northland Way on to Academy Road. \"It’s a wonder there hasn’t been an accident at this stage.”googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshDorothy said people park their cars and walk to North West Regional College and she knows of residents on Duncreggan Road who experience the same issues with students from Magee University.My suggestion would be to put bollards at the corner of the footpath to stop people parking there which would at least keep those areas clear.“A lot of the students also park behind the fire station, along Northland Way and Northland Crescent. \"The other day I seen cars parked the wrong way in a one-way street, it makes it very hard for other people to get through, they’re being completely inconsiderate of other road users.“It’s making it dficult and dangerous for people and that’s why the community is angry and fed up. We’re sick and tired of it and it’s time we started a petition.”Car parkShe made the point that NWRC and Ulster Universityneed to invest in extra car parking spaces for their students and even suggested that a large car park could be built at the Fort George site to ease parking congestion in the city. Dorothy added that the college and university will say the same thing about advising students to park safely, ‘but they need to come up with solutions.’Residents shouldn’t have to ‘suffer’ because of a lack of foresight and planning from the authorities, Dorothy added.Both NWRC and UU have said they will work with residents to deliver a satisfactory solution to the problem.A spokesperson for North West Regional College commented: “We are aware of the current issues regarding car-parking in this particular area, and it is our intention to continue being part of any discussions which will be aimed at finding a speedy resolution for everyone concerned.”Meanwhile, a Ulster University spokesperson said: “We are working closely with PSNI and the Aberfoyle and Duncreggan Residents Association and have advised all students and staff to park legally and considerately. \"We understand that the PSNI and the Residents Association will also communicate this to the general public who may also park in the area.”"},{"url":null,"title":"universal credit leading people derry rely local food banks support","story":"SDLP Mark H Durkan MLA, has voiced his growing concerns amid the ‘disastrous’ consequences of Universal Credit, adding that the increased reliance on food banks locally is only a part of the worrying story of welfare reform.Mr Durkan said:\"Lessons should have been learnt from the disastrous roll-out of Universal Credit in England which saw emergency food supplies delivered to over a million people in crisis last year. \"But these lessons were ignored and the rollout of the scheme here is beginning to spiral-with an increase in the number of people using food banks, a number which is expected to soar in the coming months and years.\"Constituency offices and advice centres have become ‘Universal Credit support services’ in the last year and that doesnt look likely to change any time soon. \"We have people from all sections of society struggling to make ends meet as a result of Universal Credit and are having to increasingly direct people to Foyle food bank and other charities to help them survive. \"googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh\"Poverty is here, its happening on our doorstep.

When we have reached that point, urgent intervention can’t be merely a suggestion but a requirement.\"\"We should expect to see many more cases like these. But it cant by any means be accepted as the norm.

During the summer of  the team won all eight games to win the Kilmore and District Summer League.Things improved signicantly in the   season as they were promoted as runners-up in Division  and also won the Enterprise Cup, which was played on a league basis, beating Saintfield AYC ndash in the replay after a - draw in the first match.The Swts were formed for the   season and they played in the Willowfield League recording their first win against Saintfield United on October , .Having been promoted to Division  of the Newcastle  District League, they won it at the first attempt and with the Swts moving to the Newcastle League for the   season, both teams performed a unique double by winning Divisions  and  while United reached and lost the Harry Clarke Cup final.United went to the Northern Amateur Football League for the   season and were promoted from Division B and they also reached the Irish Junior Cup only to lose to Moyola Park. They won the Division A title in  In the   season they lost the Irish Junior Cup final to st Bangor Old Boys while the Swts were probably the first reserve team to reach the Harry Clarke Cup Final which they lost after a replay to Downshire Hospital.Consecutive Cochrane Corry Cup finals were lost in   and  , as well as a second County Antrim Junior Shield final in .Manager Billy Hamilton, who had guided the team through the s so successfully, stood down at the end of the   season and then went on to become secretary of the County Antrim Football Association for a number of years. The playing strength within the club led to the formation of the Albion, in .In the mid s Ballynahinch Recreation folded. United took over the Millbridge playing fields and undertook signicant development work which led to it being admitted to Division C of the Northern Amateur Football League.Under the management of Bobbie Reid, they played their first games at intermediate level in the   season while the Swts switched to the NAFL reserve section, However the Albion remained in the Newcastle League.Success came quickly when Brian McKibbenrsquos team won the Border Regiment Cup in the   season after extra-time and penalties. Brian stood down as manager in  and through the efforts of Gerry McCormick and Cyril Lennon mid-table league positions were achieved.Under the leadership of club chairman Campbell Allen, great strides were being made with improvements to the drainage of the pitch, erection of tubular steel fencing around the pitch, construction of new dugouts and the erection of floodlighting to the training pitch with the clubhouse being substantially refurbished.For the   season Noel Dean was recruited as manager and he steered the team to their first and only promotion at intermediate level when they moved from Division B to A as runners-up to Dromara Village.The following season a mid-table position was achieved together with a memorable midweek Irish Cup replay defeat of Harland  Wolff Welders at Millbridge.Dean stepped down during the season and he was replaced by Michael Savage, who led the team to the final of the Clarence Cup which they were awarded as a result of Knockbreda Parish fielding an ineligible player.That same season the Swts, under manager Geoffrey Smith, lost the Purdy Cup final while Davy Teggartyrsquos Albion won the Bignian Cup and were also promoted to Division  as runners-up. Sadly, this team broke up and there followed a decade of struggle during which managers Eamon Wilson, Norman McCullough, Davy Teggarty and Alan Brown worked tirelessly to halt the downward trend.The occasional bit of encouragement came along with the Albion reaching two successive Shimna Cup finals in   and   only to lose out in penalty shoot-outs while in   the Albion won the Donard Dairy Shield defeating Castlewellan IIIs ndash.Campbell Allen stepped down due to business commitments and the current chairman Gilbert Cromie took over.In May  the club were awarded the honour of hosting the Britton Rosebowl International between the NAFL and the Scottish Amateur League at Millbridge.Nigel Neale managed the team for the   season, but resigned with ten matches remaining. Experienced first teamer Alan Stevens took over, assisted by John Jones, and they led the team to one of their highest finishes in years.Former manager Cyril Lennon came in for the   season and United enjoyed their highest league position for years. Stuart Buchanan came in as manager of the Swts and led them to the Newcastle  District League Division A title.The following season United again narrowly missed out on promotion, as well as reaching the quarter-finals of the Intermediate Cup when they were defeated by Harland  Wolff Welders at Millbridge. The Swts re-entered the Northern Amateur League and were promoted as runners-up in Division E to Bangor Rangers.Much to everyonersquos disappointment, Cyril Lennon stepped down and Steven Bell took over along with John Jones and they led the team to a very respectable fourth place in Division B. United were awarded the North East Referees Association Merit Award for Fair Play at the AGM of the NAFL.The Swts continued their good form to finish runners-up to Downpatrick IIs in NAFL D, but manager Stuart Buchanan stepped down due to study commitments.In the summer of  the club celebrated its th anniversary which a special former playersrsquo night and a friendly match against Irish Premier League side Lisburn Distillery. The Albion managed by Johnny Reid won Division  of the Newcastle  District League.In   the club was awarded a % grant from the IFA to undertake an upgrading of its facilities to meet new Intermediate regulations.Steven Bell stood down in January . A new management team of Colin Murray and John Jones took over the role and they guided the first team to a fourth place finish on goal dference. Much to the clubrsquos disappointment the Albion had to be withdrawn from the Newcastle League due to a reduction in the clubrsquos player pool.In the   season the club embarked on its usual Irish Cup campaign little knowing that it would reach the fth round for the first time and be drawn against Premier Division side Coleraine. This brought about a wonderful adventure during which the club was able to garner a massive support which necessitated the ordering of two double decker buses for supporters as well as a bus for the team.Everything was done as professionally as possible and despite a heavy defeat, although the score was - at half time, the players and their management gained enormous respect.In more recent times the team has been managed by Keith Hamilton, Scott Brashaw and Ross Hayes as caretaker managers, Alan Davis and Paul Allison. In the current season, former player Glynn Robinson and Dale Davidson have taken on the role and have made a promising start with good results in both league and cup competition.Over the last  years the club has been involved in a number of proposed amalgamation initiatives involving Ballynahinch Recreation, Ballynahinch Olympic and Temple Rangers, but none materialised.One amalgamation that did happen was with Ballynahinch Youth Football Club, which now means that the club includes male and female from age six years forward and a ladiesrsquo senior team. This fits in superbly with the clubrsquos ethos of being inclusive to all within the local community which has been something that is reflected in its history from day one.It also brought to the club an outstanding group of coaches and administrators which has invigorated the club.No club could everwithout committed iniduals being involved in its organisation and the club has had a cadre of them over five decades.The passing of the clubrsquos elder statesman, Billy Hamilton senior, in December  brought to an end outstanding service not only within the club as a player and administrator, but also within the leagues and governing bodies.Billy was no stranger to working hard on the ground, putting up nets and marking the pitch both at Feersquos Field in Dromara and Millbridge, aided and abetted by club president Winston Brown, who works away in the background and has done so for  years.Jimmy Brown has toiled tirelessly and selflessly for well over  years, keeping Millbridge well-manicured as well as using his building, plumbing and plastering skills to maximum effect.In addition to Billy senior, the Hamilton family have made an outstanding contribution with Billy junior managing for over a decade. Graham scored hundreds of goals over those early years while Wilson mdash better known to all as Chico mdash played for all three teams and continues to serve as a committee member to the present day.We can never forget the contribution that Sally Hamilton has made as she continues to attend the home matches and has made the sandwiches served to visiting teams at the Millbridge for decades. In addition to managing the team and being involved administratively with the club, Bobbie Reid has served as the clubrsquos Newcastle League representative for many years. Last, but not least, there is Davy Teggarty, who has fulfilled every role possible.While all of these iniduals and others have helped over the years we are most fortunate to have a new generation who have stepped forward and will see the club move forward for which we are extremely thankful..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Peace lantern walk marking WWI end 100th anniversary  ","story":"A UNIQUE peace lantern walk is to be held in Killyleagh to mark the th anniversary of the end of the First World War.The lantern will be carried in a relay chain from Shrigley to Killyleagh, and through its main streets, before a flame from it is used to light a gas beacon at the front of Killyleagh Castle on Remembrance night.A Killyleagh veteran, who is one of Northern Irelandrsquos last RAF survivors from the Second World War, has been given the honour of carrying the lantern on the final relay before the Beacon of Light is lit.Martin lsquoTinarsquo Charters, who is aged  and who survived more than  bombing missions as a rear gunner in Halax and Lancaster bombers in the Second World War, will light the beacon to mark the moment the guns finally fell silent in  after four years of the world at war.The Bomber Command veteran who still walks up to six miles a day and is one of Killyleaghrsquos most instantly recognisable residents, will be joined in the final relay of the cross-community walk by local schoolchildren and  unsung heroes from the local community.The Killyleagh Beacon of Light will be among the first of around  bonfires and beacons to be lit across Northern Ireland at pm at the end of Remembrance Sunday, as part of the Battlersquos Over commemorations on Sunday, November .Chris Hagan, the chairman of the Killyleagh Remembers the Great War project, revealed that an original candle and lantern, used on the th anniversary of the start of the war, will be used as part of a chain to light the beacon.ldquoWe extinguished a candle lantern in August  to mark  years from the beginning of the war, he said. ldquoIn remembrance of the end of the war and the millions who were killed or came home dreadfully wounded, the lantern will be lit again.ldquoThere were two bonfires lit in Killyleagh on the night the war ended at the Castle Square and at the Cross.

Armagh were largely at full strength with influential number  Neil Faloon passed fit.Armagh took an early lead with a penalty from promising young out-half Cormac Fox.The game then became entrenched around the halfway line with both sides either unwilling or unable to put any width on the ball due to the conditions.Armagh edged the possession and territory, but with defences well drilled on both sides it looked like only a mistake would provide any try-scoring opportunity on either side.There were a few fumbles from speculative kicks on both sides but defences were able to scramble into place and snuff out any chances relatively comfortably to leave the half-time score at -.The second half brought more of the same. Ballynahinch had to withstand a period of sustained Armagh possession, but did so without any major alarms.However, they were unable to stamp any real authority of their own on proceedings and as the match drted into its later stages it seemed that Armagh had done enough to escape with a famous win.Former Armagh man Richard Reaney had other ideas and he converted a penalty in the final minute to earn the home side a draw.Armagh will be happier with the result, but the Ballynahinch players and coaches will take the two points and move on to the tricky trip to Old Belvedere next week.The final round of the Celtic Cup took place last weekend, freeing up Ulster squad members for club rugby, but it remains to be seen how soon they become available.

A number of parked cars have also been damaged.It is being reported that some shops have closed early to protect staff, while residents who live near the historic Grove area in the shadow of Down Cathedral have revealed they have been verbally abused.Representatives from residentsrsquo groups in Stream Street, Bridge Street, Russell Park and Lynn Doyle Place have been invited to attend the meeting which they hope will result in an action plan being devised to tackle a problem caused by what some have described as ldquoferal youths.Grove Shopping Centre caretaker Peter Smyth, said businesses were frustrated that nothing is being done to address the problems and wanted local police to do more.ldquoBusinesses have had to pull down shutters either temporarily or shut early to protect staff in the St Patrickrsquos Square area, he said.ldquoWhile the trouble is largely centred on area between the Grove, the Saint Patrick Centre and the Downpatrick and Co Down Railway, it radiates out to town centre neighbourhoods and last week a number of young people climbed on to the roof at the nearby bus station.Anthony Trainor, of the Stream Street Residentsrsquo Association, said local people, including those who work in the town centre, have had their cars deliberately damaged.ldquoResidentsrsquo groups are telling us that there have been assaults on adults and children.

A bomb had damaged Enniskillen Townhall, and for a while the Council moved out to the Ardhowen.Pardon the pun, but there were times when Council meetings were ldquoas good as a play, as my granny used to say. Reporting the meetings for the paper was enjoyable, and I remember on one occasion two Councillors had a, er, lively exchange of views and we all held our breath as John Joe McCusker marched down the chamber to confront Jim Lunny.Of course it all ended amicably. The two men, both Nationalists and both with a mischievous sense of humour, were very dferent characters ndash genuine characters and not the fictional types which would tread the boards later at the same venue. I got to know them both and enjoyed their company.Jim Lunny was a great campaigner for retaining townland names, and John Joe fought his corner for his area. I recall them both having a sense of community, and not only would they do their best for Fermanagh in their day, both were also conscious of the need to pass things on to future generations.So they were very supportive of the then Chief Executive, Gerry Burns, a public servant with real vision, when he was the driving force to transform the Ardhowen into the beautul ldquoTheatre by the Lakes. And the architecture-award winning building became the envy of many places at home and abroad.Pardon the clicheacute, but the ldquojewel in the crown was an apt description, but more than just being a beautul building in a beautul setting, the Ardhowen under the dedicated and expert guidance of people like Eamonn Bradley and others, gave a real boost to the arts and entertainment.Enniskillen, and indeed Fermanagh generally, has a fine tradition in amateur drama and itrsquos gratying to see the likes of Adrian Dunbar and Ciaran McMenamin go on to have distinguished careers. About four years ago, I had the pleasure of chairing the Xchange summer school at the Ardhowen when Adrian spoke of his passion for the arts and as a regular visitor to his home town he still boosts the arts here. As does Ciaran, who engaged locals at such events as the film club. The range of activities at the Ardhowen is ied and we are, indeed, fortunate to have such a venue.Itrsquos starting to show its age, though. Even so, I cannot imagine that the people who got the theatre project up and running  years ago would have expected that already the Council is undertaking an exercise to look at the future of the theatre. Some of the options include an upgrade or extension, but worryingly another option is to build another theatre on another site.All this has been well reported by Colm Bradley in this newspaper.The situation has led to a number of people expressing doubts about the future of the Ardhowen, and Fermanagh Film Clubrsquos Jules Caithness wrote about ldquograve concern at the fog of uncertainty over the theatre which he said had been ldquohorribly neglected.The Council attempted to downplay this by saying they have ldquono plans to sell the Ardhowen site.No plans  Whatthey go for the option of a new theatre on a new site  What happens to the Ardhowen site then  Irsquod have preferred a straightforward, no wersquore not selling it. Itrsquos a uniquely beautul site and wersquod be mad to sell it.Irsquom told a meeting was held in August of ldquostakeholders which unsettled some of those present, and that no Councillors were present.Irsquom wondering how the succeeding Councils over the years allowed the building to get into such a state of repair, to the point where they now need to spend a large sum of money.So much money, in fact, that it exceeds the threshold that an ldquoeconomic appraisal is required.Irsquom sure some bean counter will weigh it all up but how do you place on a balance sheet the richness of cultural experience which the Ardhowen has brought to Fermanagh over three decades, and the reputation our centre of excellence has across Ireland In the current climate, I think the way we are governed isnrsquot as ldquoopen and accountable as it should be. There is certainly a massive disconnect between the people and those in authority at Stormont, though one would expect thatany public body would have the ear of the public it would be the local Council.Some decisions have implications for years to come. I still get annoyed when I walk past the old ldquostreets area opposite the police station in Enniskillen and see a lot of public sector buildingswhere once stood a thriving community of people living in homes on the island.OK, housing conditions were awful, but homes should have been built there instead of what the planners did with the area.So, please members of Fermanagh and Omagh District Council, consider carefully what you do with the Ardhowen. Itrsquos not really yours, and itrsquos not totally a matter of money.Part of the problem, apparently, is a lack of car parking.

It was a conflict in which his uncle, Charlie Dunbar had been persuaded to volunteer for ldquoto fight for his religion.But the experience of what Charlie saw left a deep scar and changed him forever.Adrian was the focus of the ldquoWho Do You Think You Are  on RTE on Sunday evening, and it was a fascinating watch.As we all get a little older, many of us seem to have an increasing interest in our own past, especially our own family history. In Ireland, family is still a powerfully symbolic and emotive part of our DNA, and the programme often reveals some interesting context for inidual celebrities.As Adrian said: ldquoAll of us are interested in our backgrounds where we come from and what yoursquore born into. Those things shape who you are.Therersquos no doubt that we will have been particularly interested in Dunbarrsquos journey into his background after all hersquos one of our own.But the interest in the programme went much deeper and much more meaningful. With several little vignettes showing the complexity of identity in Ireland.A word used frequently these days in all sorts of context is binary, meaning only two parts or ision into two groups. Itrsquos particularly apt to the world view of Northern Ireland. Protestant equals Unionist British, Catholic equals Nationalist Irish, would be the perception.It isnrsquot the case, of course, and shouldnrsquot be. But the troubled th century in Ireland, particularly the last quarter of it, saw both groups driven further into a silo mentality.Irsquove always felt that there was a certain irony in the fact that a violent Republican campaign to achieve Irish unity did, actually, create more ision.Now, the current circumstance of changing demographics in the north combined with the Brexit crisis are focusing on identity as we go forward.Adrian Dunbar is a clever inidual and, indeed, a perceptive one and the story of his family background in the programme was punctuated with comments which should evoke some thought about the past, present and future.Adrian was brought up in Enniskillen in a mainly Nationalist area, though for a few years the family moved to Portadown, Garvaghey Road in fact, where he recalls loyalist paramilitaries parading close by in a show of strength to people in Nationalist areas to know their place. The memory of two communities living apart is eloquently described by Adrian as ldquosocial engineering to suit sectarianism. While Enniskillen was much less hostile, the time, the place and the neighbourhood environment where he and his siblings grew up were far from ideal recruiting ground for the British military.And yet, on his mother Pauline Camplingrsquos side, there is an incredibly strong link and a history of service going back three generations.Adrian visited St. Michaelrsquos Church where Frankie Roofe was able to give him intriguing detail of his great-great-grandfather coming to Enniskillen as a soldier from England and converting from Church of England to Catholicism.Recounting some of the history of the Inniskilling Fusiliers, when the regiment ldquoheld the line for Wellington at Waterloo about half of the  men were killed, Adrian himself pointed out that about a third of the men spoke only in Irish. Itrsquos a quirk of how history develops that hundreds of years later the native tongue of men who died serving the British Army is somehow portrayed controversially as anti-British.Adrianrsquos grandfather, Walter Campling served in the Inniskillings, and three of his sonshad distinguished service in the British military in world war.The programme shows Adrian coming home to Enniskillen to discuss this with his brother Liam.Interestingly, though, Liam said that because they were brought up in Nationalist areas they didnrsquot go round talking about their ancestorsrsquo British military service. And Adrian himself said that the idea that he and his siblings would have followed the tradition of their three previous generations had gone.Such service to the British military by Catholic Nationalist families was common, as a look at the names of both communities on the Enniskillen War Memorial show.Yet, it was a feature not talked about in recent history and illustrates the complexities of identity that weave their way through our communities.Conversely, of course, the perception suggests that all Protestants consider themselves ldquoas British as Finchley and thatrsquos just as much an oversimplication. Surely the two identities donrsquot slot handily into their own homogeneous monolith There were a couple of telling moments, I thought, in the Dunbar programme.His uncle Charlie, whom Adrian remembers fondly dishing out sixpences, had been convinced in the late s to join the Irish brigade fighting for the fascist Franco in the Spanish Civil War under the guise of fighting to preserve the Catholic religion against the evils of Communism.On hearing some of the shocking atrocities that his uncle witnessed, Adrian reflected: ldquoPeople do a lot of things in the name of religion, donrsquot they  Sadly, as we know only too well in the north.And he added: ldquoThe combination of religion and politics is not a good one.And there was another line which struck me. Adrian was shown a photo of Queen Victoriarsquos state visit to Dublin in  when the city was still under British rule.He was shown the regimental band, including his grandfather, and considering the protest and fight for independence in Ireland which was about to change everything, Adrian referred to his grandfather and other comrades as being ldquoon the wrong side of history.A century on from that Royal visit, the country saw a war of independence, a civil war, decades of conflict in this part of the island and more recently more Royal visits by the current Queen both north and south of the Border.And now itrsquos a pertinent question to ask what side of history the ious identities are on now.The confusion and uncertainty over future membership of the European Union has thrown the subject of identity to the forefront, and there is the suggestionthat the issue of Irish unity is firmly on the agenda.To be honest, I donrsquot think evena Border poll was held that it would result in unity just now.But herersquos a thing. On Sky News last week, journalist Adam Boulton was interviewing Scottish Deputy First Minister, John Swiney and his opening question was: ldquoWhat do you think is more likely to happen first, a united Ireland or an independent Scotland The fact that he asked it seriously is telling, as is Swineyrsquos serious reply which began, ldquoItrsquos a close run thinghellip.In the current political climate, the DUP say they are engaged in a ldquobattle for the Union. Aside from the fact that all politics here seems to boil down to that, in this case the DUP may well be right.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I have been moved to tears by so many honest and heart-wrenching accounts.I canrsquot even begin to imagine the pain of losing a child at any stage of le it is inconceivable for those who have never suffered such a loss. But sadly, itrsquos more common that we imagine.It is estimated that one in four pregnancies in the UK ends in miscarriage, defined as a loss of pregnancy up to a gestation of  weeks and  days. A loss after that is considered stillbirth and in  there were , stillbirths ndash thatrsquos nine babies stillborn every day ndash and , neonatal deaths.As part of baby loss awareness week, bereaved parents, along with their families and friends have been coming together, joining with others across the world, to commemorate their babiesrsquo lives.The campaign was started  years ago and yet the fact remains that in our society, it is really only in the last couple of years that we have started to talk openly about baby loss.Indeed it remains a subject that few of us feel completely comfortable navigating. I will admit that before I became a mother three years ago, I had conversations with women who lost their baby during pregnancy and I know I didnrsquot handle those conversations very well.Maybe there isnrsquot a right thing to say, but I recognise now that that I, like so many of us do, shied away from much,any, conversation. Despite knowing that the phrase ldquoIrsquom so sorry was lacking, I refrained from empathising any further or asking questions because I felt I didnrsquot have the right words, I was afraid of saying too much, of saying the wrong thing, of being insensitive, and most of all I was afraid of upsetting that mother.But what I have learned since is that many women ndash and men ndash who have said goodbye to a child in pregnancy or during birth, want to talk about the loss. They donrsquot want you to cross the street to avoid them. Many want you to askthat baby had a name, or when his or her birthday would have been. Of course, itrsquos hard to know any of this unless we have the opportunity to have open and transparent conversations about such a sensitive and dficult issue.Talking about the subject of death is still quite taboo in our society, particularly when it is the death of a baby. But we shouldnrsquot underestimate the importance of talking about baby loss. Not only does it help those who are grieving, helping them to process what has happened, to stop blaming themselves and feel less alone in what can be an emotional and physical rollercoaster, it also gives us all the opportunity to develop the tools and language to discuss this emotive subject with greater understanding, helping to normalise something that is common - and indeed normal - but not talked about enough.Itrsquos ironic and perhaps a cruel reality of social norms that women are encouraged not to tell people about pregnancy until after the first trimester when sickness abates and the risk of miscarriage is greatly reduced. Surely the early stage is when pregnant women need compassion and understanding. The expectation to remain silent during the first  weeks of pregnancy means many couples faced with loss are left to grieve without the support that they need. After all, it doesnrsquot matter whether the loss of a baby is at eight weeks gestation or  weeks, the trauma felt by those who loved and wanted each child are the same. They had imagined their new family they had probably considered whether that baby was a boy or a girl and all sorts of other exciting plans.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This campaign is aided and supported by a number of the Prime Ministerrsquos own Conservative Party members.Sadly, what we are witnessing from many sections is an anti-British position rather than a debate based on any sound principles as to why there are not more pragmatic positions on providing a good deal for everyone involved.As someone who voted to remain within the EU I am extremely disturbed at the antagonistic stance being displayed by the European Union towards the democratic wish of the majority of the citizens of the United KingdomThis has brought me to thinking thatthis is their attitude in general to the UK, then we are better out of this vastly over regulated group. What is even more surprising is the attitude of the Irish Government. They are our near neighbours and have signicant trade with the UK, but are certainly making no attempt to have a conciliatory attitude to finding a positive deal.Given the potential economic loss to the Republic of Ireland, Irsquom curious as to why they are not attempting to use their influence, by their public utterances and in discussions with other EU members, to provide a more assuaging attitude to the situation. This I feel would be more conducive to sustaining beneficial trading relations between the two nations post Brexit.Thankfully the United Kingdom has a strong economy which has supported and assisted many smaller nations, including the Republic of Ireland in the EU for many years.It is hugely positive that Northern Ireland is part of the UK, the fth largest economy in the world.

implement an Irish language act in Northern Ireland.As parliament debated legislation regarding decision-making powers of civil servants at Stormont, Plaid Cymru MP Liz Saville-Roberts asked Karen Bradley: “Will the Minister uphold its commitment by introducing an Irish Language Actpower-sharing institutions are not restored within six months ”From her bench directly in front of DUP MPs, she began her address with a statement in Irish, which Speaker John Bercow asked her to translate.Offering a translation, Ms Saville-Roberts said: “Language rights are human rights and the Irish speaking community are entitled to equality.”In response, the Secretary of State said that while she supported “statutory underpinning” for other indigenous languages, she stressed that any move to introduce such legislation in NI was a matter for the Stormont Assembly.Mrs Bradley added: “I am sure that shewould not want to see this House undermining the constitutional devolution arrangements that exist across the UK and cherry picking those points that members may feel very strongly about.”Irish language group Conradh na Gaeilge welcomed Ms Saville-Roberts’ contribution and said it was the first time an MP had addressed the Commons in Irish.Advocacy manager Ciarán Mac Giolla Bhéin said: “As the Irish language historically echoed around the House of Commons we hope the message ‘language rights are human rights’ will be to the forefront in the mind of the British Government and MPs present.” of Portaferry. \"   of Portaferry. \"  PSNI identy murdered NI man Coremetrics  Coremetrics

The previous day’s paper had reported that the earl had been killed by a cannon ball, but news moved slowly in the s and was uncertain.

The Reward of CovetousnessBELFAST. Last Tuesday the Right Honourable the Lord Viscount Hillsborough waited on the Rev. Presbytery of Bangor,in Order to have a dissenting Minister, whom his Lordship recommended to the Presbytery, settled at Hillsborough: It is not doubted but that the Presbytery will do what they reasonably can to graty his Lordship.[Trevor Hill, who was the first Viscount Hillsborough, died within four years of this report, while still only aged in his s. His son and heir Wills Hill later became a key British statesman as Secretary of State for the Colonies shortly before the July , American Declaration of Independence, which was reported on the front page of the News Letter in August of that year. A man who would become a founding father of the United States, Benjamin Franklin, visited Lord Hillsborough at Hillsborough Castle in . Later suggestions that the pair did not get on, helping precipitaterupture between Britain and the colonies, are disputed, and Franklin is said to have recorded that he was warmly treated by his host] The first two surviving News Letters from October  are the only early copies between September  and December .

Former DUP minister Simon Hamilton yesterday faced intense scrutiny regarding the incident The emails were anonymously posted to the News Letter, the BBC and Andrew McCormick, the permanent secretary in Mr Hamilton’s department, at the height of the storm around the RHI scheme in January and February , arriving with this newspaper in two batches in an envelope delivered by Royal Mail.Last week it emerged at the inquiry that the chief executive of the Ulster Farmers’ Union , Wesley Aston, had forwarded those emails to Arlene Foster’s former special advisor Andrew Crawford about six weeks before they were leaked.For a time the emails took the focus off the DUP, by showing that some civil servants had been openly briefing the industry about looming cost controls ahead of a spike in RHI applications and that farmers had been lobbying the department to delay cost controls.Yesterday Sir Patrick Coghlin’s inquiry heard how on January  , Dr McCormick sent Mr Hamilton an email to tell him that he had received the emails, some  days before they arrived with the News Letter.   John Robinson today at the RHI Inquiry However, what Dr McCormick did not know was that Mr Hamilton was already aware of the emails – and they had been sent to him on Mr Hamilton’s authority by his special advisorJohn Robinson.When asked by David Scoffield QC yesterday whether he knew who had sent the emails to Dr McCormick, Mr Hamilton said: “I do.”He said that he believed he first became aware of the emails in late December but he is unsure whether he actually saw them before they went to Dr McCormick.He said that he was not aware until the inquiry’s work “of the original source” of the emails, the UFU chief executive.He said he could see that “these are not unhelpful, shall we put it like that, to Dr Crawford and the argument – the unfair attacks that I believe he was under at that time – that they had passed through his hand”.Mr Hamilton said he became aware of the emails through his Spad, Mr Robinson, who “had got a copy of them”.He said: “From my perspective, from the party’s perspective at that stage, this is pretty signicant because there are many charges that are being levelled against us and one of them is that issue, in terms, that ‘your Spads were meddling with things in  and that’s what caused the spike’.RHI Inquiry: Sinn Féin used ‘super Spads’ to flout law banning killer advisersCows bring traffic to a standstill Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“This is evidence that, while not completely refuting that, it cast a signicant shadow of doubt on that accusation because ... the dates on these emails [were before a submission had even gone to the then minister Jonathan Bell and a decision was delayed].”Mr Hamilton said that he believed that he had two conversations with Mr Robinson about the issue. He stressed that “these are not confidential emails – these are not emails coming from inside the system or anything like that”.He said he took the view that “this is pretty explosive” and that although it “needs to be dealt with properly”, doing so by handing it formally to Dr McCormick would see it “get bogged down in a process – properly so”.Mr Hamilton said he had no concerns about Dr McCormick failing to take the matter seriously or burying it, but he suspected there could be a bureaucratic delay which would have meant that “it would never have necessarily seen the light of day”.Mr Hamilton said that after discussing it with Mr Robinson they talked about how “this would be usefulit was in the public domain” and that the following time they discussed the issue, “John is telling me that he has sent it to Dr McCormick, this is anonymously, in an envelope, and also sent it to a journalist and I think one other as well”.Inquiry  member and former senior Whitehall civil servant Dame Una O’Brien said with a degree of incredulity: “To your own permanent secretary ”Mr Hamilton said: “Yes.”Dame Una said: “Anonymously ”Mr Hamilton replied: “Yes.”Dame Una said: “I just wanted to be clear that I heard that.”Mr Hamilton said that he had acquiesced in a process whereby the emails were leaked due to the “febrile atmosphere” of the time and said that in other circumstances he may not have acted as he did.The DUP minister faced intense questioning from the inquiry  as to why as minister he had allowed his Spad to act as he had done.Mr Hamilton said: “I accept that this is highly unorthodox.”However, he went on to say: “I would set it in the time that we found ourselves in where we are getting – we being the party – are being assailed on all sides ... and there isn’t much to fire back, there isn’t much to combat some of these allegations with. Here is something that is very dferent to anything we’ve had before ... [it was] pretty straightforward to understand hence we did what we did.”Mr Hamilton said he took the view that “it is of little use to the party in defending itself against these accusations”it was not released publicly.Inquiry  member Dame Una O’Brien highlighted that the DUP was aware of the immense mental strain which Dr McCormick was feeling at that point, where others were concerned for him given his distress at the knowledge that he had been secretly recorded by former DUP minister Jonathan Bell.Mr Hamilton said the move was not intended to undermine him or put pressure on him.But Dr Keith MacLean, the inquiry’s technical assessor, asked: “But what was it going to do  You’re wanting to take pressure off you by putting out information which is pointing the finger at somebody .”Sir Patrick Coghlin said: “What you are doing is using the cloak of anonymity to take the pressure off a Spad ... and place it on officials who are full-time civil servants for whom you are responsible as minister.”Mr Hamilton said: “There probably wasn’t much thought given to those sorts of issues at the time.”try catch     .               ..

Many moons ago I did diddle off and leave a dining room wall a third painted and the job to someone  to finish because I got bored and this has turned in to, ldquoWell, you see, Alison, you donrsquot do DIY. Well, fasten my tool belt and hand me a power drill because I now do do DIY.I unscrewed and moved a shelf just yesterday as it needed doing and no one  was doing it anytime soon.

I agonised about whether I would do a good job and whether I would do the brilliant project idea, justice.

I am immeasurably proud and it is turning in to something that I am beyond giddy to be involved with.With lsquoback to schoolrsquo upon us and that feeling in September forever associated with change, next steps and new challenges, it got me thinking about all the children set to start St. Cyres and Stanwell, primary schools, Universities, colleges and the like and how many times we are all guilty of telling ourselves that we canrsquot, we shouldnrsquot andwe do, we wonrsquot be any good.This is my appeal to all students, be they tiny tots taking first steps in to Reception, tweenagers embarking on lsquobig schoolrsquo or those with a bit more experience, but often no fewer anxieties heading to further and higher education - go for it, try it take advantage of the chance to learn and the opportunities it opens up.Le is short and it is certainly too short to listen to voices that limit you or put you down. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community.

To date the  Accelerators have raised more than pound, for UK charities between them.The guests were given a tour of the House of Commons before the main event, hosted by Luton MP Gavin Shuker. Stonegate chief executive, Simon Longbottom, commended the graduates and the Stonegate development team.He said: ldquoPeople are at the heart of what we do. Wersquore delighted to able to recognise the achievements of our incredibly hard-working Accelerators here at the House of Commons.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops. People are very amenable and love being part of Gemrsquos education. We have the Esplanade, beaches and country parks, and wersquove even taken her to Ikea.\"People are very interested in the puppy and we rarely go on a walk without someone enquiring about what we are doing. Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

When I woke up whenever and potted and mooched and just saw what the day would bring.Like most people, the demands of work, family, friends, errands and the general stuff of le, mean that at any given moment we can be doing one thing, planning something  and thinking about many more.I get in to grasshopper phases where it feels like there is so much on my lsquoto dorsquo list that I flit and fly between myriad things and sometimes few of them get completed how Irsquod like or indeed completed at all and for those that that do get sorted and sewn up with aplomb, there is no time to take any satisfaction or pride because it is time to crack on with the next thing folks.I read a while ago about a concept that affects your brain around scarcity.The idea that when we feel that something is scarce, be that time, money or something  that we feel is in short supply, it can make us act with less focus and rationality thanwe had an abundance of such.So, in my case, when I feel time is pressured, I am more likely to try to do more with the result that I feel I have less time and my scarcity suffering brain is more likely to forget, to misplace to mess up.And so, knowing this, I am going to set aside the lsquoto dosrsquo and the lsquoshouldsrsquo and curl up on the settee with my utterly wonderful friend and eat and chill and know that with every mouthful of delicious cake, I am doing myself some good. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In particular the achievement of . bn boe depends substantially on the development of  new fields of which no less than  are in the category of technical reserves.ldquoThe development of these fields is by no means certain even though they pass the stipulated investment hurdle.ldquoThey are not yet at the planning stage.

Ulster Business speaks to Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI and some of those burgeoning firms it has developed strong relationships with over the decades Long-term support is very much at the heart of the decades of partnership between Bank of Ireland and its business customers.And whether it’s offering a wide range of financial assistance, growth support or general advice, the bank has formed le-long partnerships with companies from right across the sectors, and from the large to the very small.It’s been there for three of its longest-running customers – with a combined almost -year history – from the start, and played a key role as a partner in each of their own growth stories.Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI at Bank of Ireland UK, told Ulster Business:“We base our business on a relationship management model – we spend a lot of time with the businesses, we know the owners and their management teams, their growth objectives and ambitions and understand the businesses.“That enables us to provide the right suite of products – challenging business plans, providing funding and help. There’s also the chance to introduce them to potential customers, signpost to expert advice, and become a partner to that customer, rather than just be a funder. It’s very much a partnership approach.“We provide lending facilities to business from the very small micro firm, right through their le-cycle, their growth phase, and scaling up to small and medium-sized businesses.”And for Gavin, it’s all about offering a range of services and assistance “under one roof”.“We have the ability to lend up to £m for business customers. There is the consistency to our approach, and that’s really important in the Northern Ireland market.”Partnership is a phrase that continues to raise its head in Bank of Ireland, regarding both its relationships with business customers, and the longevity and generational nature of the companies it’s developed long-term relationships with.“We would have many instances where a mother and father have built a business, and now the second generation is taking on the management,” Gavin said. “We are involved across both generations, and we are very privileged to be part of that family and business development.”“It’s in our interest that the company continues to grow and thrive and we have been very important in that role.”Nowhere is that more evident than with the hugely successful family-owned McKeever Hotel Group.What started out as a family restaurant business in Randalstown, Co Antrim back in , has blossomed into a burgeoning food and hospitality business boasting five hotels across Northern Ireland and Donegal.And the McKeever Hotel Group is still very much a family affair. In the last  years, the breadth of the business has grown to include Corrs Corner in Newtownabbey, the Dunsilly Hotel in Antrim, Ballymena’s the Adair Arms, Dillons in Letterkenny, and its latest hotel, the Dunadry in Antrim.Today, Eugene McKeever, along with his we Catherine, daughter Bridgene and son Eddie, run the thriving hotel empire which employs around  part-time and full-time staff.“The family business started in  when my parents opened the first restaurant in Randalstown – my dad was a chef and mum was teaching,” Bridgene, who is marketing director, said.“They then bought Corrs Corner. That’s when Bank of Ireland really become involved in the company and helped us out.“We have been supported by Bank of Ireland in a number of ways.”That includes the multi-million pound funding for the refurbishment of the Dunadry Hotel, in addition to funding support provided for the acquisition in .“Bank of Ireland has been with the company during its entire history. In , with the Adair Arms, we were one of the few people back then who were buying, due to the recession,” she said.“There has always been trust and the faith with the bank. My dad has always said – speak to your bank manager, and be honest with them.”The McKeever Hotel Group’s single biggest investment has been with the -bedroom Dunadry.Gavin says that one of Bank of Ireland’s core objectives is to help “customers to thrive”.“In doing that, it covers a lot of dferent things, and it’s not just about being profitable,” he said.“We specically tailor our packages to the customer needs. Their success, is our success and we are very privileged to be part of that growth story.”Eamon McCay started his cooking oil business at a small Strabane premises. He’s now grown Frylite from a small family operation to an Ireland-wide firm with more than  staff, boasting a turnover of £m.And he’s been helped along the way by Bank of Ireland amid ongoing expansion and growth. It’s a relationship which has so far lasted more than  years, and shows no signs of slowing down.“I started Frylite in , delivering fresh oil and collecting used oil. I combined all of the areas in one,” Eamon says.And that initial  sq ft building has grown to five depots across Ireland, with a further site on the cards for yet more expansion. “We supply our vegetable oils to hotels, fast food outlets, commercial businesses, bakeries, industrial food service sector… it’s been gradual growth.”A depot in Galway in  was followed by another two years later in Dublin, with Coleraine and Cork following a short time later. And its Strabane base is now a , sq ft building on a four-acre site.Since , Bank of Ireland has provided facilities to the business including invoice discounting, asset finance and term and cash flow ending, and also previously used stockline facility.Speaking about his strong relationship with Bank of Ireland, Eamon says a commercial finance package ensured the businesses growth.“The bank have gotten to know the business. I felt like I have had a partner, which is invested in the business. Building good relationships is one of the values,” he said.But it’s not just about providing help and finance to customers. Bank of Ireland is sponsor of Catalyst Inc’s Invent competition and is also working with organisations such as the NI Chamber and CBI to showcase and help companies improve skills, digital prowess and scale exports.Another business with a more than two-decade relationship with Bank of Ireland is Pinnacle.And just some of the Sage Platinum Reseller’s top customers include everyone from the Irish Football Associationand Ulster Rugby to Titanic Belfast and Mash Direct.The software partner, which was set up in Belfast in , now boasts a team of more than  experienced providers of Sage business management software solutions, IT services and support.“Going from humble beginnings, the company has grown into a £m business,” Fran McKee, Pinnacle’s marketing director said.The firm, which is headed by founder Ken Montgomery, has been supported by Bank of Ireland through its stages of growth, which has included organic expansion and acquisition. “We have a solid partnership with Bank of Ireland, which has nurtured our business since its inception in .”The firm offers businesses solutions from simple to more complex business needs with Sage. It now has  offices across the UK and Ireland, but according to Fran, there is “massive growth on the agenda”.“We want to be a £m business within the next few years and as well as growing our Sage ision we want to also grow our IT services offering and with the bank’s support we’ll achieve our growth ambitions.  You can come to us as a one-stop-shop for IT and software requirements.“Customers today are very focused on providing a good service as well as achieving their growth ambitions, so they want to have the software in place to help them make decisions and run their businesses effectively.”And Gavin says the key message is that Bank of Ireland is a “proven and consistent funding partner for businesses over a long period of time.”“We work hard to build a great rapport and great trust with our clients and these long term relationships are testament to that. It is exciting to share the journey of young and small businesses to growth and expansion and we’re keen to help the next generation seize new opportunities for their businesses.” ■View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Premier.jpg","title":"premier inn looking at two new ni hotels","story":"Posted on Wednesday October  by John Mulgrew Premier Inn is eyeing up opening new hotels in Newry and Enniskillen as it seeks to expand across Northern Ireland, Ulster Business can reveal.The hotel chain, which has seven hotels here, is seeking developer opportunities in the two new locations, alongside growth in Dublin.The company, owned by Whitbread, has said it secured  new hotels in the UK during the last financial year, and has the same aspirations this year.It also says it is looking for “property partners and freehold development sites in Dublin and other major cities” as it seeks to grow Premier Inn across Ireland.Meanwhile, a new report from PwC says hotel prices in Belfast are rising five times faster than the UK average.In June , the average cost of an overnight stay in Belfast was £. but has now grown to £..Belfast is now the fourth most expensive city to stay in the UK, outside London.PwC Northern Ireland partner, Martin Cowie, said: “The influx of high-quality rooms to the market have driven and continue to support improved RevPAR and ADR for the city. “Though the full impact hasn’t been realised with easyHotel and the George Best Hotel yet to open as well as Signature Living’s new hotel at the Crumlin Road courthouse which just received planning permission, demand continues to be driven by inbound tourism, domestic holidays and events.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Pete-2.jpg","title":"in focus peter hannan on beef brexit and business","story":"Posted on Thursday October  by Ulster Business Peter Hannan tells John Mulgrew about turning away the big retailers, growing trade by % and that he doesn’t believe Brexit will happen once people see what’s at the edge of the clf Like many in his industry, Peter Hannan is no fan of Brexit.But the top-end beef and red meat supplier also doesn’t think it’s going to happen, given how disastrous the post-Brexit landscape is painted, now that it’s been starkly laid out in front of everyone.The Kildare-born businessman runs Hannan Meats, based in Moira. He’s become something of a star of the Northern Ireland food scene in the last decade – buoyed on by dry-aged beef and an array of the UK’s best and brightest using his produce.He’s aged beef for , days – yes, more than three years – although purely experimental, boosted turnover by around % in the last two or three years, picked up more three-star awards from the Great Taste Awards than almost any other food firm, and now plans to expand into Dublin as his next venture, by the end of the year. Anyone who’s met the Meat Merchant – the moniker given to his retail business in Moira – will know that the -year-old is a personable, larger-than-le character, whose own personality contributes as much to his business and brand, as does his meat.“Our main areas of growth in the last three years have been into the UK, Republic of Ireland and the continent. We haven’t been looking at doing more at home here, because we have a presence, and we think it’s very adequate. We don’t push that, or cold call. We think the clients that we have in Northern Ireland are the best, and we aren’t looking to expand on that.”France is also becoming a growing market for the company, and Pete says business there is growing “very rapidly”.He’s also recently signed a deal to supply all of the Hastings Hotels’ spots.“We have approaches from all sortsover the years,” Pete says. “We are primarily a food service company, so dealing with any of the multiples – doing it a lot more, or not doing it as well has never been on our radar. We’ve had them drive in to the yard here – four suits getting out of a black-windowed car. You are watching on the camera and say ‘oh, that’s somebody’.“Everyone has dferent ideas. We just don’t believe they are the type of partner that we would want. We don’t want to do  tonnes a week of commercial product.”But a few years ago, he did the highest-profile grocer of its kind in the UK – arguably the world.“Five years ago we started to deal with Fortnum  Mason, and they are truly magnicent to deal with,” he said. “That was a turning point because, regardless of what anybody says, the best front window for food in the world is Fortnum  Mason.”According to Pete, business in the five years since the relationship began has increased by ,% – or around  times.What started as a meat wholesale business, blossomed thanks to the success of Hannan Meats’ Himalayan salt-aged Glenarm beef, and has grown into a business with a wide-iety of products – many of which have been done for the first time in NI.Aside from selling lesser-known cuts of beef, such as hanger and rump cap, Pete’s business has ersied into dry-aging lamb, and curing both pork and beef in a sugar-pit – producing hugely flavoured bacon and cured-beef.It doesn’t take long for Pete to start naming some of the greatest chefs which call Hannan Meats their beef supplier. That includes Angela Harrnett and Mark Hix. He was one of the first UK restaurateurs to exclusively use Peter’s dry-aged beef across all of his restaurants – it all started when Pete met Mark outside one of his eateries and gave him an honest retort to whether he had enjoyed his meal. The beef wasn’t up to scratch.But it’s not all just awards, top chefs, suppliers, restaurants and celebrity-backing. Pete says turnover is up around % in the last two to three years – sitting at around £m.“We have lots of other things going on in the background. Taking our next step forward is something we have been considering. We are at a crossroads as to where we take the business next. We are now at a point, do we go forward with the likes of our Meat Merchant , do we take that to a city  Dublin would be next on the radar.”On Brexit, he doesn’t think it’s going to happen – given a clearer image of what le outside the EU could look like.“No doubt, all of us in business have been reluctant to make decisions because there is no clarity,” he said. “Personally, I don’t think we will Brexit. We need to go and apologise, and say ‘as we were’ and just get on. It was a hell of a bad idea. It was sold based on rubbish information, and that’s why people made a rubbish decision.“Now that we have a bit of clarity – Theresa May is bringing us to the clf edge, and saying ‘that’s how far down it is – have a look,you tell me to jump, I’ll jump… but we don’t have to’.“This whole thing about immigration. The thing about bringing , people into this country every year needed to be explained to take that issue off the table. If you want your fruit picked,you want doctors and nurses in the NHS, for example...you want any of those things, then let’s put up the barriers. Unless we take those people in, we don’t have have those things done.“… we shouldn’t be in this position, and I don’t think we will be for much longer. Once Theresa May brings these things to the clf, no one will say that they want to jump.“I think there is a huge head of steam. People will say ‘we won’t take that deal’.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"pinnacle marks  years with huge bash in portugal","story":"Posted on Thursday October  by Ulster Business Belfast firm Pinnacle – a leading provider of Sage software and IT solutions – has celebrated  years in business by taking more than  of its staff to Portugal for an an all-expenses paid trip.The company, which has branches throughout the UK and Republic of Ireland, flew its workers to a five-star resort in Vilamoura, to mark the occasion.The five-star celebrations included welcome lunch overlooking the Vilamoura Marina, followed by spa treatments and water sports.

I grew up in an era where comedians actually had the benefit of free speech and you simply switched off or walked outyou didn’t find them funny. Common sense used to prevail and adults were able to admonish children as part of their development process. Today the world is dferent, everyone’s opinion matters evenit is illogical, ill-conceived and does not stand the scrutiny of even the most cursory of cross examinations. Politicians have always manipulated the message to try and persuade the electorate that the policy they are peddling today is for our benefit. Once elected they then change tack, claim they never supported the policy that they were elected for and blame the opposition. One of my clients’ recently told me to stop wasting my time writing about Brexit because nobody cares and the subject is now boring. I tend to agree that the subject has been over discussed but sadly it appears to have been under considered by almost all associated with our path to European exit. Local, national and European politicians have patently no clue as to how to deliver a workable and practical orce with both sides predicting a range of dire consequences for the UK economy whether we stay or go. As ever the true position will never be visible to the vast majority of voters and, therefore, we will probably never have the chance to understand our exit deal, whether or not we get the chance to vote on it. Never has the duplicitous nature of politicians been more evident than this shambles we are now watching. Businesses do not have the luxury of endlessly debating a myriad of options, we need to make decisions and act upon them. If we don’t then jobs are lost and families suffer. Locally we are pathetically represented by a group of politicians who appear not to want to undertake the jobs they were elected to do. Maybe I am just cynical but it appears to me that they are hiding in the shadows hoping that someone comes up with a plan for which they have no actual responsibility. That way,it works they can quietly move forward asthey were a part of it,it fails then it was not their fault. Do we not deserve better than this  I read an article in another publication recently, penned by one of my competitors, in which he invoked property professionals to be more optimistic and sell the positives of the NI market. I have spent my entire  year career trying to sell the positives of investing in NI. I have stayed here, built a business, paid taxes, employed many people and hopefully delivered pleasing results for our clients. It would be really nicefor once our politicians could simply deliver us a viable business oriented solution that made le easier rather than the constant uncertainty we face.

It’s through getting to know our clients and their business that we can best share our knowledge and advice around the type of financial support they need.“At First Trust Bank, having listened to what our customers wanted, we invested in six new business centres across Northern Ireland to support fast, local decision making. We also established a Small Business Centre to meet the needs of our smaller customers. Now firmly embedded in their respective communities, these centres – coupled with our expert sectoral advisors – are on hand to help business owners identy opportunity and risks and how best to mitigate or capitalise upon them.”Richard Donnan, head of Northern Ireland at Ulster Bank, says it “is strongly committed to supporting businesses of all sizes, from micro firms right through to large corporates”.“Our latest results show a % in small business drawdowns, and we continue to work hard through initiatives such as our Boost initiative and our Entrepreneur Accelerator to build mutually beneficial relationships with firms across Northern Ireland. “A key focus for the bank is the development of digital services that make it simpler, easier and safer for customers to bank with us. “Our digitally active customer base grew by % year-on-year and we are continuing to respond to that change, for example, by introducing our Business Growth Enablers and through the development of our digital s such as our mobile app.”But it’s not all bank financing. The Growth Loan Fund offers assistance to Northern Ireland-based companies who demonstrate growth, and tend to work within the manufacturing, engineering or tradable services sectors. “Loans will be typically unsecured and personal guarantees will not be sought. The loans provided are expected to be complementary to existing sources of finance, including banks, trade finance sources and equity investors.”Some of the companies availing of the finance include Belfast-based BLK BOX Fitness, which secured £, to grow its online  and boost exports, along with Fermanagh gin-maker Boatyard Distillery.Meanwhile, the BGF was set up in  with £.bn and has since backed close to  companies. Last year, BGF was the UK’s top institutional investor and ranked the seventh most active private investor in the world by number of investments. Upstream is a Belfast-based alternative finance company specialising in SME funding, and has also now introduced a trade finance option for clients. The market-first solution unlocks the ability for businesses to finance their working capital needs end to end, from supplier to buyer.Niall Harkin is director of customer journeys at Danske Bank. He says “personal engagement is still really important” when dealing with small and medium-sized firms looking at expansion.“That’s why last year we introduced a team of  dedicated small business advisers back in to key branches across Northern Ireland, giving customers access to expertise in their local area to discuss business plans and explore funding options,” he said.“Meanwhile, teams of experienced relationship managers supported by specialists in areas such as cash management, markets and trade finance, support our larger SME customers.“At the same time, we’re investing heavily in our digital offering, and recently added the capability for SMEs to get lending decisions in a matter of minutes in ious situations. ‘future financing’ makes the whole credit process much easier for our customers. For an overdraft, we’ve seen approvals in four minutes and access to money well within  hours. “In the future, customers should be able to go online and request an overdraft increase on a smartphone at home.”But aside from the financial support, businesses here can also turn to the support from hubs. That includes Ormeau Baths’s Barclays Eagle Labs – which is located at the south Belfast listed building – and the Ignite NI Propel Pre-Accelerator. The options are out there and available for companies wishing to take that next step, whether traditional banking or alternative streams are the way to go.

The Northern Ireland Hotels Federation said a \"shudder\" was going through the industry, which comprises  hotels and , bedrooms. In Belfast, , rooms were added over the past year, thanks to new construction of six new venues, including the Hampton by Hilton and the Grand Central, and extensions to two existing hotels. The federation said the market was going through a \"stutter\" with occupancy and room rates going down. \"It is important to note that demand for hotel rooms has grown over the last year, but it hasnt kept pace with the increase in supply,\" it added. A separate report by PwC put the cost of an overnight stay in a Belfast hotel at £.

On day two of industry event Hospitality Exchange, federation chief executive Janice Gault said: \"Market snapshots indicate a stormy  with volatility in the market. Overall analysis shows a reduction in occupancy levels and a decline in rate.\" She said Northern Ireland needed a new tourism selling point - suggesting something like Failte Irelands Wild Atlantic Way promotion, but for the north west and west coast. \"Demand is growing, but this needs to be accelerated with a number of interventions, including increased promotion, a bigger marketing budget and a proposition of scale for Northern Ireland along the lines of the Wild Atlantic Way,\" she added. \"Measures like this will allow the market to adapt to and absorb new supply. There has been a seismic change and a response of equal measure is required to create new business.\" Ms Gault said challenges for the sector included skills and staff, as well as Brexit, which had led to \"considerable uncertainty\". \"Added to this are the issues around tax, in particular VAT, access constraints and capacity at key attractions,\" she said. \"You can see why the market is experiencing a shudder as we come to the end of an era of exceptional trading.\" And while  would be quiet in comparison to the flurry of openings in , it was \"far from dormant\", the federation said. There are to be new openings in Londonderry and Newry and Mourne, while ventures on the north coast are now \"dependent on what has become a protracted planning process\". But Ms Gault said that despite some problems, the hotel sector \"has strong prospects\". However, drawing in more visitors was paramount. \"We need to increase the size of the tourism cake to ensure that each hotel gets a good slice of business,\" she said. \"Having spent in the region of £m, the hotel sector is keen to see aon this investment and a realisation of the industrys potential.\" A full briefing on the forecast takes place this morning at a business breakfast at Hospitality Exchange, which is taking place at the Crowne Plaza, Belfast.
