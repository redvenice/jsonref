Playing nice: The demolition of the nuclear test site was seen as a  goodwill gesture by Kim Jong-Un ahead of a summit with the US, but that has since been called off          A North Korean airport official is seen guiding South Korean journalists upon their arrival at North Korea\u0027s Kalma airport in Wonsan yesterdayExperts are ided over whether the demolition will render the site useless. Skeptics say the facility has already outlived its usefulness with six successful nuclear tests in the bag and can be quickly rebuilt if needed.Jeffrey Lewis, of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, also told Vice News that North Korea has two further tunnel complexes running into adjacent mountains that are undamaged from previous tests.North Korea also did not invite any independent observers, raising speculation that it was simply destroying evidence of its nuclear program with the blessing of the United States.This is also not the first time that North Korea has demolished one of its nuclear facilities without hampering the country\u0027s progress in building a nuclear bomb.In 2008, a cooling tower at the Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center was demolished in front of the eyes of the world\u0027s media.The tower was part of the complex that produced polonium used in the country\u0027s first nuclear test, and at the time was seen as a symbolic move toward disarmament.Youngbyon had ceased operating the year before after a series of complex negotiations between North Korea, China and the US.But it is believed North Korea only closed the site having enriched enough material for several nuclear tests, only to reopen it years later when it needed more.The country claimed to have restarted the site in 2015, and in 2016 the International Atomic Energy Agency agreed that the plant was probably operational.           In 2008 North Korea destroyed the cooling tower at Yongbyon, the facility where they were enriching plutonium for their nuclear program, only to reopen the site a few years later          The South Korean journalists are part of a contingency of foreign reporters who will have been witnessing the demolition of  the nuclear testing site at Punggye-riThe demolition comes amid reports that dictator Kim Jong Un will be hiding his nuclear arsenals in a mountainous region of North Korea to avoid satellites being able to detect them.  NK News reports that that the regime has designated Chagang Province a \u0027Special Military-first Revolutionary Zone\u0027.The region, which borders China, will reportedly be fortified and access restricted to ensure that Kim can hide its weapons and materials in tunnels beneath the mountains there.A high-level source told the news website: \u0027Nuclear weapons can be hidden anywhere, but the North Korean authorities have chosen, it seems, a place where even satellites will have difficulty locating them.\u0027 North Korea cancels historic summit with Trump after \u0027ignorant and stupid political dummy\u0027 Mike Pence compared the country to LibyaPresident Donald Trump called off his summit with Kim Jong-un on Thursday after North Korea hurled insults at Vice President Mike Pence.Trump said it would be \u0027inappropriate\u0027 to hold talks at this time after the Kim regime again tested the limits of his patience.\u0027You talk about your nuclear capabilities, but ours are so massive and powerful that I pray to God they will never be used,\u0027 he said in a letter to Kim that the White House distributed.North Korea\u0027s vice foreign minister had slammed Pence for his \u0027unbridled and impudent remarks that North Korea might end like Libya.\u0027Choe Son Hui also said the future of the summit between Pyongyang and Washington is \u0027entirely\u0027 up to the United States, as she condemned an interview Pence gave to Fox News.       North Korea has called Mike Pence \u0027ignorant and stupid\u0027 for comments he made comparing the state to Libya.

Then a risk assessment can be made. \u0027That will decide whether or not the exclusion zone can be shrunk.\u0027The spokesman added that experts need to figure out how much explosive is left in the bomb before the area can be reduced. Before work began on the bomb, experts had said there was a 5050 chance the device would explode.           The unexploded bomb was found by construction workers in downtown Dresden before being taken away by the bomb squad to be defused           8,700 people were evacuated around the site where the bomb was found and were told they would have to stay away on Thursday morning           A concrete blast wall was erected around the bomb site on Wednesday to provide protection for disposal experts and surrounding buildingsDresden police chief Horst Kretzschmar said the bomb is in a condition that cannot be defused by conventional means, mdr.de reported.The detonator\u0027s tip has penetrated so far into the initial ignition part of the bomb and experts from the ordnance disposal service believe that the bomb will explode with only minimal rotation, he explained.Saxony police spokesman Thomas Geithner told mdr,de  the authorities were working on a plan to attach a device to the detonator in order to remotely detach it from the bomb.He added \u0027the probability is 50 percent\u0027 that the device will go off when the process begins but material such as water tanks and big stones will be used to insulate against the blast should that happen. Police also tweeted that a protective wall was also being built to help insulate the area against any blast.Several businesses and buildings located within the exclusion area including a senior citizens’ home, a nursing home, a vocational school, a day care centre, an allotment garden and various shops, have been evacuated, thelocal.de reported. At 9.00 am on Wednesday the police tweeted that the last people in the restricted area were being evacuated. Much of Dresden was turned to rubble by Allied bombing during World War II, immortalized in Kurt Vonnegut\u0027s famous novel \u0027Slaughterhouse-Five.\u0027More than 70 years after the end of the war, bombs are still regularly discovered in German cities during construction work.

It\u0027s a ticking time bomb and we always knew this situation could arise. We just hope that a disaster can be averted and nobody gets hurt.\u0027Kanaele, 68, and others say the wells, which run as deep as 8,000ft, pose a serious risk from the lava if they overheat or are breached by underground seismic activity.If the wells break, they could release tons of flammable and toxic hydrogen sulfide into the air around the current evacuation zone, which is already choked with volcanic smog.The gas has the potential to cause huge explosions and winds could spark an emergency evacuation covering a 10-mile radius.Community activist Bob Petricci, president of the Puna Pono Alliance watchdog group, said the area is one of the most unstable pieces of land on the planet and people should be concerned about the threat.\u0027The bigger danger right now is the wells, which go down 8,000ft, and tap into a resource which is one of the hottest and most toxic in the world, hydrogen sulphide,\u0027 he explains.\u0027The concentrations of this deadly gas are extremely high, I\u0027m talking between 1100-1300 parts per million at the well head. At 700 parts per million, a person will die breathing that in.\u0027Petricci, a sustainable farmer who lived next to the plant when it was built, says that in 1991 the plant had a blow-out that caused problems up to ten miles away.He added: \u0027I\u0027m not a scientist but I know enough to be sure we\u0027re all in a lot of danger should any of these wells break because of the volcanic activity.\u0027There\u0027s a lot of fractures occurring every time there\u0027s an earthquake and the wells go through these fractures.\u0027That\u0027s the issue right now that the government is worried about, if the well head snaps off they\u0027re not sure what will come back up and there would be no way to stop it.

Europe and Moscow are making diplomatic overtures to save the Iran deal, now under threat after the recent US withdrawal.In a joint appearance before the start of the talks, Macron said: \u0027I believe we must work together on joint initiatives. Putin meanwhile said he was ready to talk \u0027about key international issues, the resolution of which are important to both France and Russia\u0027.Mother\u0027s fury after her altar boy son, 14, is sent home from...Convicted killer, 50, who beat street drinker to death is on...Share this articlePutin handed Macron\u0027s wife Brigitte flowers as he greeted the couple late in the afternoon at the Konstantin Palace, a former residence of Peter the Great set some 12 miles outside Saint Petersburg.The meeting comes almost exactly a year since the freshly elected Macron hosted Putin in Versailles, when the French leader accused Russian media of producing \u0027lying propaganda\u0027 during a joint press conference.The trip will also see Macron address the Saint Petersburg International Economic Forum.The talks take place after US President Donald Trump in early May controversially pulled the United States out of the 2015 landmark pact with Iran that placed limits on its nuclear programme in return for easing economic sanctions.          Putin and Macron are expected to discus the crisis in Iran as well as the ongoing war in Syria           Putin held talks last week with Angela Merkel and Japan\u0027s Shinzo Abe will arrive later this weekSaving the deal provides a rare point of agreement between Moscow and European countries, which have seen relations tank in recent years over crises in Ukraine and Syria, as well as accusations of meddling in foreign elections and the poisoning of an ex-Russian spy in Britain.Alexander Baunov of the Carnegie Moscow Centre said talks over Iran will be positive. He said: \u0027Russia shares the position of the majority of the international community including Western leaders.\u0027The West has realised that a dialogue with Putin is \u0027inevitable\u0027 in order to preserve the accord, he said.Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will also visit Russia at the end of the week.Baunov added: \u0027Merkel and Abe have already begun a thaw with Moscow and Macron is scared of losing the advantage that France has always had with Russia.\u0027  But there are a number of sticking points that will prevent a full rapprochement between Paris and Moscow.Chief among them is Syria, where at least 350,000 people have been killed since war broke out in 2011.Moscow intervened in 2015 to prop up its ally President Bashar al-Assad - in a move generally seen as decisive in turning around the multi-front conflict - while France has participated in strikes on regime targets.Another issue is the conflict in eastern Ukraine, which broke out after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 and has so far claimed at least 10,000 lives.Paris and Moscow, along with Berlin, signed peace agreements in Minsk in 2015 that aimed to bring the fighting to a close but there is currently no end in sight.International investigators on Thursday said a missile that downed a Malaysia Airlines flight over eastern Ukraine in 2014 belonged to a Russian brigade. Moscow rejected the accusation.Before Macron\u0027s trip, Human Rights Watch also implored him to raise the issue of rights abuses with his Russian counterpart, following a crackdown on dissent and pressure on minority groups in the country.But the talks between the two presidents will not be the only bilateral activity of the day, as a raft of commercial agreements are also set to be signed during the economic forum.The presence of the French president at the forum \u0027legitimises visits by business people. Those who are worried about the risks, sanctions or criticism are covered to a certain extent by the president,\u0027 analyst Baunov said.\u0027If anything, the political leadership will get criticised for this rapprochement and not the business community.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/24/17/4C9771C900000578-0-image-m-16_1527177774764.jpg","title":"Is Roman Abramovich moving Tel Aviv","story":"Disgraced soldier kicked out of the army for offensive...Uber self-driving car \u0027saw pedestrian but did not brake...Share this articleThe Kremlin said Vladimir Putin was unaware of any attempt by Abramovich to seek Israeli citizenship.Presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: \u0027No, the Kremlin is not aware of it.

He said: \u0027Russia shares the position of the majority of the international community including Western leaders.\u0027The West has realised that a dialogue with Putin is \u0027inevitable\u0027 in order to preserve the accord, he said.Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will also visit Russia at the end of the week.Baunov added: \u0027Merkel and Abe have already begun a thaw with Moscow and Macron is scared of losing the advantage that France has always had with Russia.\u0027  But there are a number of sticking points that will prevent a full rapprochement between Paris and Moscow.Chief among them is Syria, where at least 350,000 people have been killed since war broke out in 2011.Moscow intervened in 2015 to prop up its ally President Bashar al-Assad - in a move generally seen as decisive in turning around the multi-front conflict - while France has participated in strikes on regime targets.Another issue is the conflict in eastern Ukraine, which broke out after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 and has so far claimed at least 10,000 lives.Paris and Moscow, along with Berlin, signed peace agreements in Minsk in 2015 that aimed to bring the fighting to a close but there is currently no end in sight.International investigators on Thursday said a missile that downed a Malaysia Airlines flight over eastern Ukraine in 2014 belonged to a Russian brigade. Moscow rejected the accusation.Before Macron\u0027s trip, Human Rights Watch also implored him to raise the issue of rights abuses with his Russian counterpart, following a crackdown on dissent and pressure on minority groups in the country.But the talks between the two presidents will not be the only bilateral activity of the day, as a raft of commercial agreements are also set to be signed during the economic forum.The presence of the French president at the forum \u0027legitimises visits by business people. Those who are worried about the risks, sanctions or criticism are covered to a certain extent by the president,\u0027 analyst Baunov said.\u0027If anything, the political leadership will get criticised for this rapprochement and not the business community.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/24/13/4C94F49800000578-5766431-image-a-43_1527165364309.jpg","title":"Inside supercave China fit four Great Pyramids","story":"    Expedition members row into the Miao Room Chamber, China\u0027s largest cave chamber by volume, in Ziyun County, Guizhou Province, south-west China.

Investors did. BT’s share price fell by a third in a rising stock market and sits at its lowest level since 2012. The idend was merely held, making a nonsense of the chief executive Gavin Patterson’s confidence a couple of years ago that double-digit increases were in prospect. Staff, too, may be less than cheerful. Some 13,000 are about to lose their jobs as Patterson confronts the fact that BT’s revenues are falling again.But, no, it turns out that 2017-18 was a triumph, at least in the boardroom. The victory wasn’t the maximum possible under the terms of the executive bonus scheme but the outcome was “above target”, says the annual report. Even Patterson seems to have sensed that finding looks perverse because he volunteered for an “at target” score, meaning his bonus was £1.3m not the £1.6m that the mechanical formula said it should be.Come on, though, awarding a £1m-plus bonus in these circumstances to a boss on a guaranteed basic whack of £997,000 is ridiculous. The pay formula may record BT performing wonders on cash flow and “customer experience” but, when the share price has more than halved in two years, a remuneration committee chaired by the former BSkyB boss Tony Ball should be asking whether it is measuring the right things.A further prompt should have come from BT’s three-year incentive scheme, which paid out nothing and thus gave a reading closer to shareholders’ misery. BT was 20th out of 23 in a league table of peers judged by shareholder returns, missed its cash-flow target by £1.7bn and was miles off on revenues. This disconnect between the three-year scheme and the single-year bonus plan seems to have escaped Ball’s committee.The Competition and Markets Authority may have the audit market on its mind (after Carillion, it should) but here’s another inquiry worth doing – and more urgently. Heathrow Hub, which is the lower-cost scheme that would expand the airport by extending the existing northern runway, wants the CMA to investigate whether the owners of Heathrow have unfairly favoured their own more expensive £14bn plan to build a third runway.It is a pressing subject for two reasons. First, MPs are due to vote on Heathrow’s expansion in the summer. Second, the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, made an alarming statement at a select committee hearing in February that should have caused a bigger fuss.Grayling, who favours Heathrow’s proposal, said: “I have to say that the extended runway proposal is a very innovative one. At the end of the day … the biggest issue for us was that the promoters of that scheme could not secure from Heathrow a written guarantee that if we picked it they would do it. That seemed to be a fairly fundamental problem for us.”One can understand Grayling’s desire to be pragmatic. If the parliament votes for more capacity at Heathrow, it has to be confident the work will be done. But surely the first question is: which scheme is fundamentally better?The Airports Commission in 2015 opted for Heathrow’s third runway, calling the Hub idea “imaginative” and “viable” but “less attractive from a noise perspective” among other factors. Since then a furious debate has raged about whether the commission got the correct data on noise and safety, and made fair comparisons on capacity. That’s one for the technical experts but there is sufficient uncertainty for Grayling to switch sides credibly if he so wishes.That is why the Hub’s claim that Heathrow “abused its dominant market position” by, in effect, vetoing a rival’s cheaper and quicker proposal is serious. Heathrow denies the allegation but it would remove all suspicion if its owners – an international consortium led by Spanish group Ferrovial and the Qatar Investment Authority – committed to build whatever scheme parliament approves and survives the likely judicial reviews. That guarantee ought to be easy to give. The CMA should establish the facts. This air around Heathrow is bad enough without this lingering row."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8fba307a2fb6471debb326968d456a45ad43655/0_389_2776_1665/master/2776.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b3896ee5ed61757e86eb244e118a2fb8","title":"tall stories the weird world of hong kong kowloon rooftops in pictures romain jacquet lagrez concrete stories","story":"From badminton to bonsai pruning to a precarious nap, it’s all going on high above the packed streets of Kowloon, Hong Kong.

Mr Corbyn the backbencher was a republican supporter. He backed a\u0026nbspunited Ireland and he prominently identified himself on several occasions with Sinn Féin, with which the Provisional IRA was entwined. He voted against the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement on the grounds that it strengthened the border between the north and the south. He was consistently outside the Labour party mainstream, which favoured a generally bipartisan approach on Northern Ireland. Nevertheless he voted in favour of the 1998 Good Friday agreement on the grounds that it offered the hope of peace and reconciliation across the ide.Mr Corbyn has not fundamentally changed his views on many things over the years. So it is hardly surprising that he continues to back a united Ireland or that he refuses to single out the IRA for condemnation. This puts him still outside the Labour mainstream on these issues. It also affects his ability to play a moderating role in Northern Ireland politics, including in helping to resolve the current impasse between the parties, because he\u0026nbspis seen as a supporter of one side in the argument. Both he and the Labour party have to live with that.Yet the reality is that what matters most in Mr\u0026nbspCorbyn’s visit to Northern Ireland is less his pro-republican mindset than his approach to Brexit. Mr Corbyn actually said nothing at all in his speech about a united Ireland. When he was challenged about it, his answer was impeccable. He wasn’t asking for a unification poll, he said. He wasn’t advocating it. If there was a wish for a poll in Northern Ireland, it would happen within the 1998 framework. That\u0026nbspis what every major UK party leader has said on the issue for the past 20 years. Mr Corbyn is no different. And he is right. If he is to be criticised for the specifically Northern Ireland political content of his Belfast speech it would be for not reaching out to unionists in a way that wrongfoots the DUP.Right now, though, Northern Ireland is overwhelmingly and pressingly a Brexit issue above all else. Theresa May appears to have recognised that it is not possible to have a hard Brexit and a soft border in Ireland. But she has not yet managed to pull her cabinet together – let alone her party – behind a coherent trade-off between Britain’s market interests, its post-Brexit status and a politically viable timetable. She has rightly ruled out a settlement of the Irish border question that treats Northern Ireland as a special case. So, as Britain’s former ambassador to the EU Sir Ivan Rogers explained in a lecture this week, the least difficult way through – and perhaps the only way – is for the UK as a whole to remain within a customs union with the EU.Mr Corbyn’s views about the EU have not changed much, any more than his views on Ireland have. This\u0026nbsptoo is a cause of frustration to many. But his speech shows he grasps that the customs union is the pivotal issue in UK politics over the coming weeks. He\u0026nbspknows the government is too ided to put forward a coherent plan to amend the Brexit bill. He knows there is a Commons majority for a customs union. He knows that, without a customs union, the Irish border will become hard not soft once it becomes the EU external border. Mr Corbyn’s lifelong hostility to a border may not hold the answer to the Irish question any more. But it may be the key to the Brexit one."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f31c97345d7e01bebb1b97bdf024cbb4ff34b8e/0_0_650_394/master/650.jpg?w=940\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=083413acbefa2731c0e72799dae79e11 940w","title":"following a pattern orla kielys life work goes on show","story":"A new exhibition charts the Irish designer’s three-decade trajectory Designer Orla Kiely’s Stem pattern may be one of the most recognised motifs of 21st-century fashion, but a new exhibition opening this week is set to shed light on the unsung elements of the designer’s archive. A Life in Pattern, opening in London on Saturday at the Fashion and Textiles Museum, is the first exhibition dedicated to the Dublin-born designer, whose breakthrough came in the mid 90s with her iconic laminated bags that featured a simplified plant print in bright and bold colours.“I hope that visitors will take away a sense that our type of print is much, much bigger than Stem and that the body of work is more than they ever imagined,” says Kiely, who has had a close hand in the curation of the exhibition. Cue hand-drawn blooms, abstract animal designs, playful plant shapes and geometric forms.Over the past 23 years, Kiely’s eponymous label has, of course, evolved into more than a bag and fashion brand. In fact, it is as recognised – if not more so – now for its interior design and homewares, all of which is celebrated in the retrospective. Homeware currently accounts for about half of the brand’s sales, with the iconic enamel plant pot recently going though the one million sales mark.Kiely worked with the textile historian Mary Schoeser and the museum’s head of exhibitions, Dennis Nothdruft, to play with scale in order to maximise the impact of her plant-based patterns. As such, giant oversized mannequins wearing bespoke dresses will be displayed beside their miniature counterparts and there will be “an immersive installation” where visitors will “be absorbed in the kaleidoscopic colours and rhythms” of Kiely’s design world. Her mood boards, methods and processes will also be explored in detail.The exhibition’s timing is apt, given the frequency at which the lifestyle and fashion industries increasingly collide. Now, it’s common place for a fashion designer to have a collaboration with an artist on the side, or a cushion to be sold alongside a coat, yet Kiely was one of the first to spread her net. Her early influences of Mary Quant, Biba and Betty Jackson growing up in Ireland and the inspiration she has mined from Danish design, cinema and photography since, have translated as effortlessly to what you’ll find in your wardrobe as they have the kitchen cupboard since day one.Kiely attributes this to finding the right balance between consistency (“We don’t really follow trends, we do what we like and what we feel is nice for the season, so we’re on our own journey”) and reinvention – the latter of which is most keenly felt on the fashion front.Kiely is about to release her fourth fashion collaboration with the stylist Leith Clarke, L’Orla, which has seen a new generation of fans flock to the brand, led by style influencers such as Alexa Chung, Keira Knightley and the Duchess of Cambridge.“We are always looking to inspire ourselves we don’t rest and think, ‘Oh, that was incredible last season, let’s just do another version of that’. We’re constantly building, recreating and working with people who are really inspirational,” says Kiely.“Somehow, our prints have an uplifting effect,” she says, “and make people smile.”Orla Kiely: A Life In Pattern is on at The Fashion and Textile Museum from Saturday 25 May to 23 September 2018."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6dc1cc7e8ff9251178916019c5614c629a70e275/0_309_4208_2526/master/4208.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=59183d9e7b27c6f5f8c5aa7850cd5811","title":"chicken decapitation battered cats hollywood animal cruelty","story":"The sight of a duckling having its foot prised off in Lars von Trier’s new film sent Cannes audiences scurrying. But it’s nothing compared to these real-life horrorsIf I am not looking forward to Lars von Trier’s The House That Jack Built when it eventually comes to UK screens, it is not because of the violence against women and children that helped earn the film an early round of disgusted reviews. No, what really fills me with dread is the prospect of seeing a duckling having its leg torn off with pliers.Even after Peta weighed in to confirm that Von Trier didn’t really torture a duckling (the effect was achieved “using movie magic and silicone parts”), the idea leaves me feeling queasy. (Regardless, the film itself sent guests scurrying for the exit during its international premiere at Cannes earlier this month). Half a century of watching horror movies may have accustomed me to misogynistic violence on screen (which is not to say I enjoy it), but it hasn’t inured me to the mistreatment of animals.Had Von Trier really tortured that duckling, he would have been following in a long and dishonourable tradition of auteurs treating animals even more badly than they treat actresses. Andrei Tarkovsky had a horse shot in the neck and pushed down a flight of stairs in Andrei Rublev (1966). Jean-Luc Godard filmed a pig having its throat cut for Weekend (1967). Chickens were decapitated in Sam Peckinpah’s Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid (1973). Bernardo Bertolucci’s 1900 (1976) contains scenes of frogs being tortured and a terrified cat being strung up so that Donald Sutherland can crush it to death with his head. The director cuts away from the act (thank heaven) and I like to think Sutherland didn’t really kill the cat, but the Italians do have previous form in this regard. The writer Curzio Malaparte, in a 1943 essay about Mussolini, describes a traditional Tuscan holiday entertainment in which working-class men, hands tied behind their backs, would batter cats to death with their shaven heads.Francis Ford Coppola incorporated footage of a water buffalo being hacked to death in Apocalypse Now (1979). Béla Tarr’s Sátántangó (1994) shows a cat being manhandled Tarr insisted the cat wasn’t harmed, but clearly he wasn’t concerned about showing it being swung around by its forepaws. Between takes of Park Chan-Wook’s revenge thriller Oldboy (2003), the actor Choi Min-Sik, a “devout Buddhist”, was caught on film apologising to the live octopuses he was eating – which makes you think of Lewis Carroll’s Walrus, weeping for the oysters he is devouring.But then both films come trailing notoriety, having once been classed as “video nasties”. The extras on both re-releases include interviews in which the films’ respective directors awkwardly address the animal cruelty. Martino says: “In a way, it was a constructed scene because we put the monkey and python together, but we didn’t plan for that to be the ending … So it was really unpleasant to watch.”It is here that many cinephiles, including me, find ourselves faced with a dilemma. On the one hand, we are vehemently opposed to censorship. We are also aware that animals die every day to feed us, and we wear leather shoes. On the other hand, I would rather not watch scenes of animal cruelty, and if this makes me a hypocrite, so be it. It is upsetting enough watching a deer being swallowed by a python on one of David Attenborough’s nature specials, but Attenborough himself drew the line at reality-show contestants killing crocodiles, pigs and turkeys “just to get a shot”.Humans have been abusing animals for entertainment since the dawn of time, and film-makers haven’t shown themselves any more principled than bear-baiters or bullfighters. The otherwise admirable stunt pioneer Yakima Canutt invented a device called “The Running W”, which brought down galloping horses, often injuring or killing them in the process. At least 25 horses were killed or had to be put down during filming of The Charge of the Light Brigade (1936), so enraging Errol Flynn, the film’s star, that he attacked his director, Michael Curtiz. Such was the public outcry when a horse broke its spine after being ridden off a 70ft cliff during filming of Jesse James (1939) that American Humane (AH, the US equivalent of the RSPCA) was finally tasked with overseeing the treatment of animals on Hollywood sets.Even then, it seems AH’s trademarked seal of approval is no guarantee that “No animals were harmed”. While researching my book Cats on Film, I found claims that at least 20 cats died during the production of Koneko Monogatari (1986), a Japanese film about a ginger and white kitten and his pug pal, retitled by US distributors as The Adventures of Milo and Otis, with a voiceover by Dudley Moore. AH gave it a thumbs up, and the rumours have never been verified, but it is obvious when you watch the film that animals are frequently in distress. The BBFC cut 16 seconds from the film and gave it a U certificate, but outtakes of a cat “falling” off a cliff and desperately trying to scrabble out of the sea to safety are enough to make me never want to see it again.And here I am being hypocritical again, because while I balk at cruelty to kittens or ducklings, I can just about tolerate non-cuddly scorpions and ants being set on fire in The Wild Bunch (1969) or horrible reptiles hacked to bits in Cannibal Ferox. But hooray for CGI, which now makes any sort of real animal torture redundant. “Today, I’d film those scenes in a different way,” Lenzi admits in his interview on Cannibal Ferox’s Blu-Ray release. “I’d probably re-do it now with more help from the special FX department.”Anne Billson is the author of Cats on Film"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5611d977e4884611548c2b5603fd29a24a28273c/0_173_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0ac0fa360b7b677da871b0b689419f7e","title":"mauricio pochettino tottenham premier league","story":"Mauricio Pochettino has signed a new five-year contract at Tottenham Hotspur worth up to £8.5m each year. The manager had refused in recent weeks to guarantee he would lead the club into their new stadium in September and he sparked alarm on the final day of the season when he appeared to suggest that his future was linked to how Daniel Levy approached the summer transfer window.Pochettino called upon the chairman to “be brave and take risks” and it was clear that the Argentinian, who has led Spurs to three successive top-three finishes and Champions League qualifications, was positioning, at the very least, to win certain concessions. Pochettino has worked effectively on relatively meagre budgets during his four seasons at the club and is determined to strengthen the squad in order to challenge for major trophies.However, he is well aware that because of the financing requirements of the stadium – a further £500m, at the very least, must be found – he is likely to have to continue to balance signings with outgoings. When he delivered his end-of-season message and talked of the need to “create a new project”, he was trying to get swift decisions over player sales to gain more flexibility on his signings.Pochettino is willing to listen to offers for Mousa Dembélé, Danny Rose and Toby Alderweireld – the last of those is a target for Manchester United’s José Mourinho. He was also seeking to mark his turf over the type of player he wants to sign. Typically, Levy has preferred younger ones with resale value but the manager would like him to consider more seasoned professionals.Pochettino and Levy have since held positive talks regarding the club’s direction and the announcement that the manager has agreed to fresh terms could not be better timed. Pochettino has been linked with Real Madrid, where the future of Zinedine Zidane could come into sharp focus after Saturday’s Champions League final against Liverpool in Kiev.Tottenham hope that Pochettino’s commitment will encourage some of their big-name players to extend their contracts. Negotiations are planned with Jan Vertonghen, Harry Kane, Dele Alli, Hugo Lloris and Christian Eriksen. Pochettino’s coaches, Jesús Pérez, Miguel D’Agostino and Toni Jiménez, have also extended their deals until 2023.Pochettino said: “I am honoured to have signed a new long-term contract as we approach one of the most significant periods in the club’s history, and be the manager that will lead this team into our new world-class stadium. This is just one of the factors that makes this one of the most exciting jobs in world football and we are already making plans to ensure we continue to build on the great work that everyone has contributed to over the past four years.“Daniel and I have spoken at length about our aspirations for this football club. We both share the same philosophies to achieve long-term, sustainable success. This is a special club – we always strive to be creative in the way we work both on and off the pitch and will continue to stick to our principles in order to achieve the success this club deserves.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ecfa232c967be4815ce98df52ec34a19dcb45c80/0_145_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9389b165d66c459dc3e9cfdf3de10982","title":"real betis quique setien real madrid liverpool","story":"One of the coaches to have defeated Zidane’s side this season advises Liverpool to keep the ball and warns of Madrid’s ‘anarchy’This Champions League final is a game that in theory should finish 4-4. It could be very entertaining for the fans, but perhaps not for the coaches. Real Madrid are a team who are a little anarchic. They don’t have a permanent shape: although they will play with four at the back and with Casemiro, Toni Kroos and Luka Modric in the middle, the way they set up from there can change. Cristiano Ronaldo may be through the middle or wider and much depends on his role. If he and Karim Benzema play, it tends to be 4-4-2 but Gareth Bale could start, andor Isco, Lucas Vázquez or Marco Asensio. All mean different things for the shape.That anarchic nature is more a general point, though. Madrid’s players are carried along by the football itself, what they feel in each moment they’re not guided by tactical rigour or a specific structure. What defines Madrid is their inidual ability, how they associate with each other intuitively. Look at players like Benzema, who drifts to the wings and combines, or the full-backs, Marcelo and Dani Carvajal: when Carvajal goes up he doesn’t look to see if the other full-back is deep and that open approach often compromises them defensively.In the middle there’s more control. Liverpool could try to pressure Modric to deny them that, but he has so much ability to carry the ball, overcome difficulties, find passes. His play depends more on team-mates offering options than on the opposition. He and Kroos understand each other well, their positioning and passing is excellent. With Casemiro, they are the only players who maintain a certain order. I’ve very rarely seen Modric lose the ball – he always makes the right decision.Madrid’s anarchy can make planning difficult: they’re unpredictable. But if you can be defensively sound and use the ball well, making the most of the space they leave, you can do them damage. We’ve seen throughout the season that Madrid concede a lot of chances. And if you can keep the ball, you can reduce their opportunities.We won 1-0 at the Bernabéu but we had much more difficulty then than in the second game, which we lost 5-3. At the Bernabéu we scored in the last minute. We’d been under pressure, although it’s also true that we’d tried to keep possession. We wanted the players to stay calm: have faith, choose passes well, be intelligent, keep it, make them run. We knew that chances would come. And although we had to resist, although the tiredness meant we were sometimes less precise than we wanted, that was what happened.At the Benito Villamarín we controlled practically the whole game, except for 15 minutes in the second half when they were superior, scored and turned it round. You can’t do anything about the ability Madrid have when they get the ball, combine and attack: they have extraordinary players, capable of creating danger or scoring easily. We talked to the players about the need to keep the ball. Because Madrid’s forwards don’t always press, that facilitated prolonged possession. And if you keep the ball, even if you’re not going to generate much with it, you can take control.That was how we set it up and that was the way it worked ... except that we lost. And that’s the thing. We were 2-1 up at half-time, and should have been further ahead, but they scored three from the 50th minute to the 65th we then made it 3-4 with five minutes left but they scored again in the 92nd. This is the issue: Madrid have 15 minutes and it’s the perfect storm. There will always be moments when you lose the ball – that’s unavoidable. Against some teams the repercussions aren’t serious. But if Modric gets it, he delivers a wonderful pass ... if Bale gets it, with the speed he has ... if Cristiano reaches a cross or produces a move ... you know they can hurt you, and that was exactly what happened. We had the game perfectly controlled, but you need lots of chances to score they need far fewer.Up front Liverpool have extraordinary players. It’s true that their capacity to defend is weaker but they can hurt Madrid because they have fast, intelligent footballers. When Madrid attack they lose shape and Liverpool can harm them. But, of course, Madrid can do Liverpool damage too. These two are better going forward than going backwards.That said, it’s important to make a point here: in big, important games Madrid tend to be much more rigorous defensively, they’re not as mad they don’t play with that sense of superiority, as if they know they’ll win. And if they are more solid, Liverpool will struggle more – just as Madrid will struggle to generate opportunities if Liverpool tighten up. But teams don’t change overnight. It’s unlikely Marcelo or Carvajal will stop going forward, that Cristiano, Benzema or Modric will change. Even if you tell them to defend permanently, they won’t. And Liverpool are similar. You’re not going to tell them to just defend. It could be very entertaining.Interview by Sid Lowe"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d847a8bbd1fa3b1b09b2b9e329769542834440cc/0_143_4930_2957/master/4930.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=81b627d06b5642f79fc1fffbbd702851","title":"wolfsburg lyon womens champions league final match report","story":"• Women’s Champions League final: Wolfsburg 1-4 Lyon• Extra-time comeback secures fifth title for French sideGoals from Amandine Henry, Eugénie Le Sommer, Ada Hegerberg and Camille Abily handed Lyon their third consecutive Champions League title after they had fallen behind in an action-packed period of extra-time.After a dull 90 minutes the game sprang to life. A deflected strike from the Wolfsburg forward Pernille Harder was followed by Henry’s top-corner strike from a wonderful Hegerberg chip. In between Harder’s goal and the leveller, Wolfsburg had gone down to 10 as Alexandra Popp picked up a second yellow for a rash challenge on Delphine Cascarino. The fresh legs of Shanice van de Sanden then sealed the tie for the French side as she three times sprinted away on the right, first providing the assist for Le Sommer, then for an unmarked Hegerberg – her record-breaking 15th Champions League goal in a single campaign – and finally for Abily, who was making her final appearance for Lyon at the age of 33.Lyon had dominated in normal time and could feel aggrieved not to have got the job done without the need for an extra half-hour after watching Le Sommer’s goalwards header seemingly cross the line only for their appeals to be waved away.This was the third meeting of the two sides in a Champions League final. Both previous encounters were tight affairs: in 2013 only Martina Müller’s spot kick for Wolfsburg at Stamford Bridge could separate the European giant, while Lyon won their most recent showdown on penalties after a 1-1 draw in 2016.The first chance of this the match fell to current champions Lyon five minutes in after Griedge Mbock was brought down in the middle of the park. The free-kick fell to Henry but her shot bounced clear off a Wolfsburg body. Minutes later, at the other end, Popp’s ball across the front of Sarah Bouhaddi’s goal was teasingly out of the incoming forward Ewa Pajor’s reach.The tree-lined Valeriy Lobanovskyi Stadium was close to empty ahead of the whistle, perhaps thanks to heavy security. However, 35 minutes in the little 17,000-seater was heaving, mainly with locals. Lyon edged the first half, with tricky winger Amel Majri and left back Selma Bacha causing plenty of trouble for Anna Blässe on the left.However, the match failed to light up, half-chances and misplaced passes the order of the day. After 15 minutes Lyon began to up the pressure a little. A Dzsenifer Marozsan corner was cleared as far as Lucy Bronze, whose volley went wide of the post. A minute later Majri broke into the box, but this time Blässe came out on top with a superb tackle.With the Wolfsburg defence resolute and well organised, Lyon were forced to try their luck from distance, a swerving shot from the left-hand corner of the box by a frustrated Marozsan comfortably collected by Almuth Schult. As the half drew to a close Harder, the heartbeat of the Wolfsburg attack, was increasingly forced to go deeper and deeper to get the on the ball.With Wolfsburg struggling to make anything happen, their manager Stephen Lerch swapped winger Caroline Graham Hansen for Tessa Wullaert at the break to try and shake things up. An uneventful opening to the second half was brought to an abrupt halt when Sara Björk Gunnarsdóttir crumpled to the ground, on her own, clearly in pain perhaps the exertions of the German cup final win after extra-time and penalties at the weekend had started to show in the legs of the players.Lyon spent much of the second period camped in the opposition half and they were denied the breakthrough in the 69th minute when a corner kick from the left was headed on towards Henry, who flicked the ball goalwards. Replays seemed to show the ball crossed the line, but Noelle Maritz cleared and the Czech referee Jana Adamkova waved away appeals.But Lyon kept pushing for what would surely be a winner. Cascarino, on for the bright Bacha, sent in a low cross but Le Sommer’s shot was nicely saved by Schult. With the clock ticking down further injuries started to roll in. First centre back Lena Goessling went down clutching her leg, only to seem to recover then in added time Lucy Bronze and keeper Bouhaddi crashed into each other in leaping to clear a Wolfsburg cross, both needing lengthy treatment.Wolfsburg came out fighting in extra-time. Harder raced forward and her deflected strike from outside the box gave the Germans a surprising lead. The game then exploded. Popp received a second yellow for a rash challenge before Hegerberg found the onrushing Henry, who skied the ball into the top of the net. Moments later the holders took the lead when Van de Sanden – who had come on for Saki Kumagai – raced down the flank and her cross was met by Le Sommer, who poked past Schult.With Wolfsburg forced to push forward they were left even more exposed and again Van de Sanden ran clear, her delivery finding an unmarked Hegerberg to put the game out of an exhausted Wolfsburg’s reach before the change of ends. A lovely curling strike floated beyond Schult with two minutes to play then gave Abily an emotional send off, crowning a trophy-laden Lyon career, and confirmed their record fifth title and treble."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3dd7722f85def4e3f18a542dc683a68f90cc2255/0_0_3598_2160/master/3598.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d578db01843dcae3c38b2d0b3e0577f8","title":"detroit become human review","story":"Playstation 4 Quantic DreamSonyThe human v android setup is hackneyed, but this choose-your-own-adventure-style descent into a near-future Detroit is served up with spellbinding artistryWith a gargantuan 4,000-page script, it is a near-miracle that Detroit: Become Human manages to tell a single coherent story at all. Yet this choose-your-own-adventure-style video game, in which humans live alongside an oppressed android workforce, has hundreds of potential storylines. Gradual, ever-developing and interwoven tales lead towards a myriad of endings. So vast is the scope of this mammoth work of interactive fiction that each person who plays it may have a close to unique experience. Indeed, the way that the story bends and morphs around the player is much more interesting than the story itself.Decisions have weight: do you pursue a rogue android across a busy highway, or let it escape? Do you choose to go against an android character’s programming, or comply with its human masters? Main characters can perish, cutting off their narrative completely. Whole scenes – hours of play – can be missed because of a single, seemingly insignificant decision. The variety of choices, and where they lead, is staggering. Detroit: Beyond Human opens up the bonnet, allowing players to see their path through the game on a branching tree diagram, and return later to direct their characters towards a different fate. Once the credits rolled, I could look back at what I had missed I doubt I had even experienced a fifth of this intertwined, spider-webbing multiverse the first time around.You play as three androids. Kara, or AX400, is a subservient housekeeper at the mercy of an abusive owner. Markus has a deep love for his ailing artist “owner”, but whether that translates into sympathy for humankind is your decision to make. The most intriguing character is Connor, as his stake in the inevitable human-android class war is less clear-cut. This robot detective is a professional traitor, programmed to hunt rogue androids who kill or harm humans, often taking him to dingy, Se7en-esque homicide crime scenes.These androids have to work out how (or whether) to free themselves in a human-run society that treats them with fear and hostility.Players are promised the ability to co-write these stories, but too often you feel trapped on train-tracks, able to pull levers to go down different routes, but unable to jump off altogether. In a game that forces you to consider free will at every turn, I repeatedly came to the conclusion that mine was limited. Adding to that frustration, hefty choices can be made almost by accident. In dialogue, you are regularly presented with four one-word reply options and what you choose decides fundamental aspects of your characters, such whether they are cold-hearted killers or inspiring leaders. While this adds gravity to your decisions, it can leave you feeling out of control. In my first playthrough, I ended up pushing all three characters into situations I did not intend to.Although stories are branching, all are wrapped around a central theme of inevitable android-human conflict, a somewhat overdone subject. Adding to unoriginality of the main plot and are some eye-rolling tropes, with forced references to race and class inserted for dramatic effect. Androids, for example, have to sit at the back of a bus. And one story strand pulls up disturbing parallels with history that many will find unnecessarily distressing. At one point, I genuinely encountered the line, “But who’s the real monster here?”Luckily, top-rate actors including Lance Henriksen, who already played an android in the Alien franchise (though this time he is human), carry each scene. And four years of meticulous motion capture and exacting cinematography is where Detroit: Become Human feels like a revolutionary achievement for video games.Countless late nights have gone into the levels, which are better described as film sets. Each room and prop is unique. Skin has pores, and drops splatter the faces of androids, which eerily don’t react. Tiles on a mouldy ceiling in a motel are inidually made. Fibres are visible in the upholstery of a piano stool. Office buildings have defibrillators. I spent a full five minutes admiring the details of a robot vacuum cleaner.Lighting is some of the most atmospheric in any game, and cameras do not merely hover but are directed continuously like a movie, with different filming styles to fit each of the three characters. Though it sells itself as an unrestricted story, some of Detroit’s best parts are the most tightly directed scenes. At one point, you can hack an android receptionist to bypass security. But if you run off to continue to the mission, you won’t see her eyes dart around the room in bewilderment as she visibly attempts to grapple with what just happened. The sum of these tiny touches is a credible future world, carried along by an impressive orchestral score.Detroit: Become Human is a spectacularly crafted game that bends and branches out around the player’s choices in an astonishing and unparalleled way. Although hampered by tired central plots and some predictable, occasionally hokey storytelling, the result is a technical feat in video game development and a meticulously detailed cinematic achievement."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6ea89122b31b52033a74c13ecd08af030921d4a/0_88_3891_2335/master/3891.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=570c75d753c9b494f05e7df08fa56387","title":"ben stokes jos buttler england pakistan first test","story":"Joe Root’s side have now been dismissed for under 250 in seven of the 14 Test innings they have played since SeptemberSeems new dawns last longer in the Arctic winter than they do in English cricket. At Lord’s their latest broke at around 3.30pm, when Jos Buttler walked out to join Ben Stokes in the middle, then set again 40 minutes later when Stokes was dismissed leg-before and Buttler was caught at second slip. By 4.30pm, England were all out for 184. They had lost six wickets for 35 runs in 63 balls. Sudden and short as it all was, the mayhem lasted long enough to make one thing clear – whatever was wrong with the team’s batting in the winter, it hasn’t been fixed in the spring.It was the seventh time England had been dismissed for under 250 in the 14 innings they have played since they were last at Lord’s, when they beat the West Indies here in September. So much for home comforts. The green, green grass here wasn’t any easier or more forgiving than the hard surfaces of Brisbane and Perth, or any of the other spots where they were routed last winter.The conditions were tricky, the ground damp, the air thick and muggy, closed over with grey cloud, and Pakistan’s attack, four men with the knack of moving the ball this way and that, was well suited to it.Alastair Cook, at least, played well for his 70, all clanking straight-drives and neat clips and flicks off his legs. He looked like a batsman who had his game in order. His top-order team-mates, though, all fell to rash attacking strokes and sloppy prods, bad shots to good balls. Joe Root was caught flashing at a wide ball, Mark Stoneman’s defence was picked apart by a straight one, Dawid Malan was caught off the edge of a dangling bat and Jonny Bairstow bowled by a fine delivery that beat him on the outside. So in came Stokes. He asserted himself by collaring some clumpy drives, brute-force thwacks through cover and down the ground.The meaty crack of Stokes’s bat is so unmistakable that you would likely pick the shots as his even with your eyes shut. It’s crash-bang-wallop batting. There were five fours in his first 24 runs, and then a hearty heave-ho six off Pakistan’s young spinner Shadab Khan. Cook was out in the over after, beaten, brilliantly, by Mohammad Amir. The shock and disappointment the English fans felt at his dismissal was tempered by the fact that it bought Buttler to the crease for the first time in Test cricket since England were thrashed by India at Chennai in December 2016.When Stokes came back into the one-day squad in February, Buttler said there was a “back-to-school feel” about the squad. And you could feel that here, too. There was a flush of childish excitement when they came together, an expectant clamour in the stands. The promise of Buttler and Stokes batting together is enough to justify even Lord’s asking prices. They must be as potent and preternaturally talented a pair as England have ever fielded together at No 6 and No 7.It was only a fortnight ago that Buttler and Stokes were batting at the Wankhede Stadium, for the Rajasthan Royals against the Mumbai Indians. The two of them have come straight from the IPL to Test cricket. Between them they have hardly had a sight of a red ball in nine months. Stokes has played two first-class games since September, England’s two Tests in New Zealand, and Buttler hasn’t played any at all. He has spent the winter playing white ball cricket for England and an assortment of T20 sides, Rajasthan, the Sydney Thunder, the Comilla Victorians. It showed.Buttler threw his bat hard at his very first ball, chopped it just past his stumps and scurried a quick single. He followed that with a paddle sweep off Khan, and then a pair of breathtaking shots for four, a rubber-wristed flick to mid-wicket and a vicious jab down the ground. It was brilliant while it lasted, which wasn’t long. In the second over after tea Stokes was startled to find himself out leg-before on review. Moments later Buttler was surprised to find he was caught. It’s likely been a long time since anyone set him a second slip. Asad Shafiq clung on to a shot that might have taken his head clean off if he had misjudged it.For all the talk about how England’s new national selector, Ed Smith, was going to use statistical analysis to inform his decisions, Buttler seems more like a gut pick. As if, just like every other English cricket lover, Smith believes that Buttler is so gifted that he can’t but succeed in Test cricket. Buttler says the last time he was in the Test team he made the mistake of thinking he had to play differently. He says Smith and Root have been encouraging him to treat Test and T20 cricket in the very same way. “Whatever colour the ball is,” he says, “I’ve just got to go and play …” Which sounds fine. In theory."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/733ddd3872310a02ebc689d88a3a1919a3154f23/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5d87207ed84a0644f96bf66adc3dddfb","title":"sharent trap should parents put their children on social media instagram","story":"It’s more and more usual for people to share pictures of their children online – and some have even turned it into a lucrative business. Is it always wrong to mix kids and social media?Follow some bloggers or Instagram stars and you will know more about their children than you do about the children of your closest friends and relatives. You will see them sleeping or having tantrums in their swimsuits in paddling pools or having their nappies changed. You will see their mealtimes, their holidays and what they looked like on Christmas morning. You may have seen them in the minutes after they were born, umbilical cord still attached, and perhaps even before they embarked on this childhood of unwitting digital documentation, in a fuzzy black-and-white ultrasound picture. The ethics of this – publishing photographs of one’s children to build a social media following, and then monetising it – have always been shady, but the issue has been amplified this week.On Mumsnet over the past few months, there have been active threads criticising parenting bloggers or “influencers” – that euphemism for advertisers – mainly about the transparency of sponsored posts and advertising content, but also about the perceived exploitation of their children. The account of one Instagram-user, Clemmie Hooper, was taken down this week and though it is unclear who took it down and why – there were allegations of abusive comments under a post – she has in the past attracted criticism for the use of her children. Hooper’s account, Mother of Daughters, had nearly 470,000 followers and documented life with her four girls. The account of her husband, Simon Hooper, who runs Father of Daughters for his 845,000 followers, is still running – and his posts almost always feature one or more of his daughters. The couple have been singled out this week – neither would comment for this piece – but they are far from the only ones.So is sharing pictures online of our children something we should be worrying about? “In an age of visibility, it is important that parents discuss the pros and cons of sharing with their children, even when quite young,” says Sonia Livingstone, professor of social psychology in the department of media and communications at the LSE, and one of the project’s researchers. “We interviewed several families where even small children wished their parents would share fewer photos, and consult them more. We observed in a few families that children are even learning to tell their parents to stop. But insofar as this sharing is to bring families together, even when geographically dispersed, there are also advantages, and children appreciate those, too. It’s a matter of respect and consent, and protecting that is important, more than the actual fact of sharing itself.”Are generations of children now growing up without privacy? “I don’t think so,” she says. “The conditions of their privacy are changing, partly because of their own actions, partly others’. What will matter to children is to feel they have agency, respect and dignity – that’s at the heart of privacy. So anyone sharing or using their images should prioritise this.”Genevieve von Lob, clinical psychologist and author of Five Deep Breaths: The Power of Mindful Parenting, says: “More and more parents are questioning the wisdom of posting so much about their kids online. The pictures that are uploaded can form a permanent digital tattoo. Because it’s all so new for parents, we need to start thinking about asking children’s permission to post online.”If you think about how children are being profiled on the basis of social media images, there is a real riskMost children won’t have the finances to bring a court case, “and a child is normally not considered to have the capacity to bring legal proceedings themselves”. And the implications of such a case on family relationships could be disastrous. Bessant prefers the idea of educating parents and children “so there can be a dialogue at an earlier age. I’ve done research talking to parents about how they share information and what they think privacy is and there are a number of parents who said that once their children start to say, ‘I don’t want those photographs out there’, they would be quite willing to either not post at all, or only post once they have spoken to their kids.”Veronica Barassi, a media and communications lecturer at Goldsmith’s, University of London who is leading the Child Data Citizen research project, says “there is a moral panic” about sharing pictures online. However, she admits there are dangers. “If you think about big data and how children are being profiled on the basis of social media images, there is a real risk. I’m particularly interested in things like facial recognition: the way in which that data is sold, and the lack of transparency, is the most worrying aspect of so-called sharenting.”It’s important that parents consider the long-term implications for their child of having a highly visible digital footprintWhat, then, should parents do? Those setting out with the intention of making themselves and their children famous are one thing. “It’s important that parents consider carefully the long-term implications for their child of having a highly visible and widely shared digital footprint,” says Livingstone. “In our interviews with parent bloggers, we found they were becoming more conscious of this, and often taking care only to present their child in a positive light. Of course, it’s possible that this too could be problematic, creating an ideal self that the child must live up to.”As for the rest of us, who have no intention of using photographs of our toddlers to advertise a nappy brand but are still exposing them online, consent is key and “can begin very early,” she says. “Perhaps sharing should be kept to a minimum early on. Sharing photos with a handful of friends and family is one thing. Sharing on public sites is quite another, and I’m not sure parents should do that at all.”Much of it is common sense, says Bex Lewis, senior lecturer in digital marketing at Manchester politan University and author of Raising Children in a Digital Age. “Try not to put their school uniform in, try not to show that you have a regular pattern every day.” Most parents, you would hope, wouldn’t post pictures of their children naked but there are other things parents should perhaps think twice about. It is probably not fair, she says, to show pictures of a child having a meltdown, “although those are quite funny to watch”. Turn off geotagging, which tells internet users where you are, and lock down your privacy settings. Even then, “there is always a chance someone could screenshot the pictures, but someone could take a picture of your child in the park, and if you thought like that you’d never go anywhere. Keep the child involved in the conversation from an early age. The digital world is an everyday part of our lives now.

The former Apprentice contestant was in South Africa to produce a film about the treatment of white farmers when the two incidents happened, both of which were publicised on her social media accounts. One picture posted to her Twitter account showed Hopkins being resuscitated by paramedics after collapsing in the street after taking the ketamine, which she uses to reduce pain in a dislocated shoulder.Two days later she posted a separate video from Johannesburg airport in which she claimed she would miss her flight home because “my passport has been marked for spreading racial hatred here in South Africa”.She complained the Mirror had conflated the two issues in its original headline.The Mirror argued its reporting was accurate but later added a correction to the story which the newspaper felt made the chain of events clearer: “A previous version of this article suggested that Katie Hopkins was stopped from leaving South Africa because of the consumption of ketamine. We are happy to clarify that Ms Hopkins was detained for spreading racial hatred, which took place after the ketamine incident.”Hopkins took her case to the press regulator IPSO, arguing the update was not enough to “correct the misleading impression given to the millions of people who had been misinformed by the original headline”. She was concerned most readers would believe she had been detained for taking drugs, rather than alleged racism.Following an investigation the press regulator sided with Hopkins and concluded the original headline gave “the significantly misleading impression that the reason for the detention had been the consumption of ketamine”.As a result they concluded the Mirror had failed to take care over the accuracy of the piece and upheld the complaint."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9dd329c2b580a2058b297832875f2845938a2fb8/0_0_3543_2126/master/3543.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8668e145c0935cfbbe144ea2835fd675","title":"lenny kravitz on 30 years in music people take your kindness for weakness","story":"The soulful rock star picks his favourite songs from his back catalogue – from those trying to win his wife back, to those reflecting on his mother’s death‘What’s wrong with people?” Lenny Kravitz wonders, when asked about the bad reviews he has had. “They talk shit: that’s OK.” The 53-year-old, whose success in soulful, funk-laced rock’n’roll has earned 40m album sales and four Grammys, is in a hangar at Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris, strutting in alligator boots to the sound of his band riffing Always on the Run. Today, he splits his time between the French capital and the Bahamas. You can see why the bad reviews don’t hurt. “This has been my city since I got here in ’89,” he says. “In the 90s, I had a French girlfriend here. You know Vanessa Paradis?”Kravitz has always existed centrally in the Venn diagram of music, fashion and celebrity, but is laying low here while preparing a tour for his forthcoming 11th album, Raise Vibration (he plays Manchester, Birmingham and London in June). Building a set list is easy, he says, but selecting his defining tracks is not. “I’m not good at favourites,” he says behind yellow shades. “They all have an origin. And sometimes you look back and think: ‘Ugh, I was pretty goofy there.’”Even as a toddler, Kravitz was musical. He would bang on utensils in the kitchen and learned to play piano, guitar and drums while growing up in New York City. His family relocated to Los Angeles when his mother, Roxie Roker, landed a role in the sitcom The Jeffersons. He graduated straight from Beverly Hills high school to life as a session musician. “I was the guy you hired to make your demos,” he says. “I did whatever I had to do to survive.”For a music lover as passionate as Kravitz, it is apt that his development came supporting three greats on the road: Tom Petty, Bob Dylan and David Bowie. The latter he opened for at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles on his birthday. “I was green,” he smiles. Dylan called him out to play Maggie’s Farm one night, too. “I was scared shitless. I didn’t know the words.” After a headline tour of his own, he co-wrote the 1990 single Justify My Love for Madonna – his first No 1. The video was banned, a songwriting lawsuit over the lyrics ensued – poet-actor Ingrid Chavez was later added to the credits – and rumours flew that he was having an affair with the pop queen. “There was no affair,” Kravitz insists. Bonet and Kravitz’s relationship was already on the rocks, with an amicable orce completed in 1993. “I was in not just a depression, but a fog. I didn’t know which way was up.”Still living in Broome Street, Kravitz wrote his second album, Mama Said. The single It Ain’t Over …, though, came to him in an LA hotel room on a Fender Rhodes piano he had had delivered. “I was trying to get my wife back with that song.” Returning to New York, he turned the album in, but wanted to keep this track off it. “I said: ‘I’m not putting that song on ’cos it’s a hit.’ I wanted to stay underground and give it to Smokey Robinson.”Eventually, he was talked round. The song’s smooth funk highlighted his Motown schooling and featured sitar and horns from Earth, Wind \u0026amp Fire’s own Phenix Horns. It reached No 2 in the US chart. “That was the first time I’d walk the streets in New York hearing my song come out of people’s cars. The video was everywhere. I had to stop taking the subway. It fucked up my commute.”With his life changing beyond recognition, Kravitz was working on Paradis’s album and his own follow-up. Are You Gonna Go My Way? – the title track – is a straight-up rock anthem, laced-in licks and raucous vocals. It would become his biggest smash, and an ubiquitous 90s soundtrack. “It won’t go away,” he says. Back then, Kravitz had no idea of its potential. “It was Chinese compared with what was on the radio. Foreign!”The riff came as he and guitarist Craig Ross were mucking about while Paradis was en route to her session. “I couldn’t be disrespecting her time while I was fucking around with my music. So we cut it in five minutes. Boom.” Not knowing what to do with it, he listened to the riff on repeat. “I grabbed a brown paper bag, wrote the lyrics and sung it the next day. I knew it was cool. But a hit song? Forget it.”The song is written from the perspective of another rock star. “I was writing about Jesus Christ,” says Kravitz, repeating the lyrics: “I was born long ago  I am the chosen  I’m the one.” The video of Kravitz flinging his dreads around on the stage was directed by the acclaimed film-maker Mark Romanek Spike Jonze, then an unknown, was the photographer. “The guys who put that shit together were all geniuses,” he says. Kravitz’s drummer, Cindy Blackman, had also just been hired. “I threw that afro wig on her. Wow. Spectacular! The visual, the song, the time. It was a perfect storm.”While Kravitz’s dreams were coming true, his mother had been diagnosed with cancer and she died in 1995. His experimental fourth album, Circus, was consumed by celebrity-related woes. “My life was all over the place,” he says. “Your mother leaves the planet, you’re dealing with these newfound trappings of fame. I had to change my personality. I’m an open person: unity, peace and love! But people take your kindness for weakness.”The song is a heart-rending ballad to a girl he was dating. He dreamed it while staying at New York’s Royalton hotel given its hues, the working title was The Country Song. “That’s the first time that kind of sound came out,” he says. The album was also his first experience with computer-programmed production. “I was using it as a spice.” It gave him his first Top 10 LP in the US, and a No 5 in the UK. But his mother’s death deeply affected him, and it wasn’t until his fifth record – 5 – that he would be ready to dedicate a song to her.In the late 90s, Kravitz was riding high on more belters: Fly Away, I Belong to You and his cover of American Woman, which featured on the soundtrack of Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me. Thinking of You was a slinky grooving highlight on 5 and something of an answer to Always on the Run, his 1991 signature theme, that began: “My mama said that your life is a gift.”He reflects on that connection. “My mum had great expectations for me,” he says. “Success was about being a quality person, having integrity.” At the age of 33, he took a good look at himself. Had he kept his head amid his period of superstardom? “I was always on the run,” he says. “I didn’t have time, I was crazy. Now I was asking: OK who am I? Am I my mother’s son?” On a superficial level, he changed his look, shedding the dreads. That was Bonet’s doing. “I went up to her house in Topanga. She said: ‘You need to cut your hair – it’s time for a change of energy.’ Then she pulled out the razor blade.”In the 10 years after 5, Kravitz released the mainstream Lenny and the funk-oriented Baptism, one of his weakest. Relentless in his music-making, he would return with his best-reviewed album in years: It’s Time for a Love Revolution. Kravitz had a new studio at the Edison hotel in Times Square. By “studio”, he means a full-sized ballroom. “That was a good time,” he smiles. “That song has one of my best bridges.”Based around a piano melody, it is a sombre rumination on unrequited love, to this day one of his most steadfast crowd-pleasers. “There’s always somebody waiting for somebody else to get their shit together,” he says.On the night of Barack Obama’s first election win, Kravitz was in “some cold-ass city” in Canada. For his ninth album, Black and White America, Kravitz responded, with politically minded classic R\u0026ampB. The cover features him as a young boy, the child of an interracial couple who got together during the civil rights movement. Push is a Beatles-esque, horns-driven number about positivity in spite of hardship, inspired by his family’s struggles for acceptance. “I was in shock that I had lived to see an African American president. I never thought I’d see that. Never.”Elsewhere, the record is politicised. It’s Enough – a Curtis Mayfield-esque groove about the Middle East, environmentalism and war – was originally a Ramones-y punk track. His daughter Zoë heard it and told him it wasn’t working. “She was right. I made it smooth, whispered. It made it more powerful.” For Kravitz, still the flower child, it’s a call to action to get people looking for change. That’s what concerns him the most, not the jokes about the giant scarf he was memorably papped wearing in 2012, or the time the crotch of his trousers split on stage, or those snooty critics he has so little time for. “As my grandmother Bessie used to say: ‘You wanna know me? Come live with me.’”Lenny Kravitz plays O2 Apollo, Manchester, on 19 June Arena Birmingham, on 20 June and SSE Wembley Arena, London, on 22 June.

The Royals were dominating everyone’s attention again – the Rajasthan Royals, that is. The score was a less than satisfactory 165 for five but in the 20 minutes before tea Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler, fresh from the Indian Premier League, had hinted at a glorious Tamasha after tea. Buttler had cruised to 13 in no time while Stokes, in exemplary Test fashion, had reached 36. It was compulsory to be back in the bucket seats in time for the resumption.Instead of a dazzling Bollywood counterattack, there was a horror show of X-certificate proportions. Five wickets fell for 19 runs and England were bowled out for a paltry 184, not what Joe Root had anticipated when winning the toss.This ugly procession began with a shrewd review by Pakistan against Stokes. When the delivery from Abbas struck Stokes’s pad the naked eye suggested that the ball must have pitched outside his leg stump the replay demonstrated otherwise, providing a reminder that Abbas gets commendably close to the stumps upon delivery. Two balls later Buttler flashed hard against Hasan and Asad Shafiq held a stinging catch at second slip. The Royals had been dethroned.There was no wagging of the tail. Dom Bess, after clipping his first Test boundary, was caught at second slip Stuart Broad was so lbw that he did not bother to review even though there were still two available and Mark Wood had an unsuccessful swish. The spectators had been glued to their seats for the wrong reasons.Not that the upper order had offered much reassurance. Without a resolute 70 from Alastair Cook, only the third time he has passed 50 in his last 25 Test innings (on the other two occasions he scored 243 and 244 not out), England might have been fielding before tea.After an early stream of boundaries Cook recognised the problem. The ball was swinging on to a surface that had retained a tinge of green despite the dryness of the soil underneath, which meant that the captain winning the toss did not have an easy decision to make.So Cook set out to blunt a probing Pakistan attack. His feet moved more positively than in New Zealand, with the right one further down the track to the fuller deliveries, which were frequent since the bowlers recognised the virtue of pitching full with the Duke ball swinging obediently.The others were nowhere near as reassuring as Cook. Mark Stoneman was dismissed by a good ball from Abbas but he should not have been bowled by it – lbw might have been a better dismissal. He pushed away from his body and the ball crept through the gate that had been created. He did not look in great form accomplished Test players can cope with that but Stoneman has yet to graduate to that level.Root was the most obviously culpable of the batsmen. Having been tied down for 23 balls he swished at a very wide swinging delivery from Hasan and Sarfraz Ahmed gleefully accepted the catch in front of first slip. Dawid Malan, on the back foot, edged his third delivery. The suspicion remains that his technique is better suited to the truer, bouncier surfaces of Australia.Jonny Bairstow suggested permanence alongside Cook but was bowled for 27 by the first ball of a new spell from Faheem Ashraf. There followed a brisk 49-run partnership between Cook and Stokes, who hit the solitary six of the day off the leg-spinner Shadab Khan – it was not a day for a tweaker of any sort. Then Cook, stuck on the crease, was bowled by a trimmer from Amir that beat his outside edge. Arguably the best ball of the day had dismissed the day’s best batsman. A little flurry from Stokes and Buttler and the innings was over.All the while Pakistan had been disciplined and patient in the field. Their quartet of pacemen bowled full enough to allow the ball to swing – and they received excellent support, a flying catch at mid-on by Amir to polish off the innings reflecting that.Batting was not much easier when Pakistan came out in gloomy conditions, with Broad, striding in from the Nursery End, offering the greatest threat. He removed Imam-ul-Haq, lbw after a review.Later Haris Sohail, on 16, was dropped off the bowling of Wood, who had been preferred to Chris Woakes in the morning Stokes, poaching a catch that should have been destined for Malan at second slip, was the unlikely culprit. That aside Azhar Ali and Sohail batted with discretion, fine judgment and hope in the last hour to take Pakistan to 50 for one at stumps. You always bat with hope having bowled the opposition out for 184. On Friday the tourists can add expectation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59c990dd5ea1bf749d3997668e269d5f5453ea3b/0_48_2712_1628/master/2712.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0d3da4abd6d937b3efb081a94329dc37","title":"golf pga championship rory mcilroy lucas bjerregaard wentworth","story":"On calm reflection, Rory McIlroy should be perfectly happy with his lowest career opening round at the PGA Championship. The Northern Irishman’s 67 marked only the seventh time in 25 attempts that he has returned a sub-70 scorecard in the tournament. His post-round annoyance stemmed from the fact this appeared to be the highest number he could have posted.McIlroy’s second shot to the par-five 18th was disrupted by an errant camera click. Irritation over that moment had just subsided when the 29-year-old missed a three-foot birdie putt. Such a troubled finish didn’t at all represent what had gone before.“These things happen, I’m sure he didn’t mean it,” said McIlroy, who received an apology from the photographer in question in perfect grace. “It’s a tough enough shot without something going off at the top of your swing, but it’s fine.“I think I did everything pretty well out there. I thought I gave myself a lot of chances, I took most of them. I’m a little frustrated I couldn’t get a birdie or two out of the last couple of holes but, overall, a really good start.”McIlroy dropped two shots, both on the front nine, with seven birdies more than atoning for that. After a low-key display at the Wells Fargo Championship and a missed cut at the Players Championship, this marked a sharp improvement. An early Friday tee-time affords opportunity to make further statements in this, an event McIlroy won in stunning fashion four years ago. “If I can hit the ball like I did today over the next three days, I think I’ll be right there,” he added. “I played a lot better today than I have done the last couple of weeks so it’s a good step in the right direction.”By close of play McIlroy trailed the pacesetting Lucas Bjerregaard by two shots. The Dane had played the outward nine in just 31 strokes while the South African duo Dean Burmester and Darren Fichardt pieced together fine 66s.Matthew Fitzpatrick, like McIlroy, signed for a 67, as did Richard Bland. The 45-year-old Bland has not won on the European Tour since joining in 2002. Shane Lowry was five-under on the 18th but an encounter with bushes and a lake meant the Irishman took seven and had to make do with a 69.

Over and over again, company spokespeople have promised that they only start recording if someone says the wake word: “Alexa”.It’s a spiel Danielle, an Alexa user from Portland, Oregon, had believed. She’d installed Echo devices and smart bulbs in every room in her house, accepting Amazon’s claims that they were not invading her privacy. But today she asked the company to investigate after an Alexa device recorded a private conversation between her and her husband and sent it to a random number in their address book without their permission.Danielle found out her Alexa was recording when she received an alarming call from one of her husband’s colleagues saying: “Unplug your Alexa devices right now, you’re being hacked.”She told KIRO-TV in Seattle that at first she didn’t believe the co-worker, but then she said: “You sat there talking about hardwood floors.” Danielle realised the colleague must have heard everything.“I felt invaded,” she told KIRO-TV. “A total privacy invasion. Immediately, I said, ‘I’m never plugging that device in again because I can’t trust it.’”An Amazon customer service representative confirmed that Danielle’s audio had been sent to the number and apologised but didn’t provide any information about why the device had been activated. A spokesperson for the company later said it had “determined this was an extremely rare occurrence”.Although Amazon maintains this was a malfunction rather than proof Alexa is always listening, the company has filed patent applications in the past for functionalities that involve always listening, such as an algorithm that would analyse when people say they “love” or “bought” something. The patent included a diagram where two people have a phone conversation and were served afterwards with separate targeted advertisements."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a3e5a1014d2a13599ce02cad6ad907319da1350/0_63_4798_2879/master/4798.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5842d06022490070adabe3b1e504fea2","title":"sites block eu users before gdpr takes effect","story":"Some companies push new onerous terms of service on users as GDPR rules come into force on FridayDozens of websites shut down their activities completely, others forced users to agree to new terms of service, and inboxes have been flooded with emails begging customers to remain on mailing lists as the GDPR rules come into force on Friday.The biggest update in data protection laws since the 1990s is posing major challenges for developers and businesses – while giving substantial new powers to consumers.Margot James, the digital minister, told the : “Of the eight guiding principles that governed the use of personal information under the old act, we have made an important addition – accountability. In the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, UK citizens more than ever need reassurances their data is as safe as it can be and that organisations are accountable for it.”She said businesses would now have to prove they had been given permission to use a inidual’s information, including contact details.“Except in certain, limited instances, organisations now must demonstrate they have our explicit consent to process our sensitive personal data. Generally, we’ve also given greater control to the British public over how their data is used. No doubt like me you’ll have received a flurry of emails in recent weeks from the organisations currently holding your data, and perhaps some you weren’t even aware did, asking for you to re-submit this consent.”The cascade of emails from businesses has become the most visible consumer-facing effect of the new regulation, sent by firms who want users to actively give their consent to remain on a mailing list. But, according to the Information Commissioner’s Office, such emails aren’t necessary to comply with the law.“Some of the myths we’ve heard are, ‘GDPR means I won’t be able to send my newsletter out anymore’ or ‘GDPR says I’ll need to get fresh consent for everything I do’,” Steve Wood, the deputy information commissioner, wrote on the organisation’s website earlier this month. “I can say categorically that these are wrong … You do not need to automatically refresh all existing consents in preparation for the new law.”Campaign groups and political parties who have come to rely on large email mailing lists to contact supporters could find they lose one of their main ways of communicating with the public. It has been suggested that businesses could be forced turn to more traditional methods – such as targeting customers with direct mail through the postal system – to reach customers.As the GDPR deadline neared, some websites and services started to push users to agree to onerous new terms of service before they could continue on to their destination. Websites run by Oath, the media firm formed through the merger of Yahoo! and AOL, received a blanket request on Thursday morning, asking users for consent “to use your … data to understand your interests and personalise and measure ads”. Users could click OK to move on, or follow a chain of further links to discover that the consent granted involved sharing data with more than a hundred ad networks. Another Oath site, Tumblr, placed a similar clickthrough before users. The blogging platform did offer some links to understand “how our partners use this data”. However, even this background information was hosted on Tumblr blogs, meaning users had to accept the terms in order to read information about the terms they were accepting. The US media network NPR took a simpler approach. Users could either agree to the new terms, or decline and be taken to a plain-text version of the site, looking for all the world like it had last been updated in 1996.It wasn’t just websites. PC hardware maker Razer issued an update to one of its computer mice, warning that users may find their devices weren’t working if they didn’t update Chinese smart-home manufacturer Yeelight disabled inter-connected lightbulbs because of the data protection regulation.And a growing number of companies are taking the nuclear option to ensure compliance: blocking all European users from their servers.Instapaper, a service owned by the US firm Pinterest which enables users to save articles to read at a later date, became the latest to disconnect European customers on Thursday. It said the cutoff was temporary while it made the required changes, and told users: “We apologise for any inconvenience, and we intend to restore access as soon as possible.” Pinterest did not respond to a request for comment.Other companies have taken a more permanent approach. Unroll.me, an inbox management firm, announced it was completely withdrawing services for EU companies due to an inability to offer its product – which is monetised by selling insights gleaned from reading users’ emails – in a way that was compatible with EU law. “We are truly sorry that we are unable to offer our service to you,” the company told EU users.American media network A+E has blocked EU visitors from all its websites, including History, and some multiplayer online games, including Ragnarok Online, have switched off their EU servers.Other firms have not gone so far as to blame the new regulation but have closed EU operations with convenient timing. Crowdpac, a political fundraising organisation set up by David Cameron’s former advisor Steve Hilton, announced it was closing its UK wing “for business reasons” until further notice. The company, which was still raising funds in the UK as recently as Sunday, now says it “hopes one day to be back”.Klout, a social media analytics service, and Super Monday Night Combat, an online game, will shut down on Friday. Lithium, the owner of Klout, said: “Klout no longer made sense as a standalone service. The upcoming deadline for GDPR implementation simply expedited our plans to sunset Klout.”Brian Honan, a data protection expert, said he viewed the shutdowns as a reasonable consequence of the new law. “The GDPR’s primary goal is to enhance the protections around the gathering and processing of the personal data belonging to iniduals residing within the European Union,” he said.“Companies have had well over two years to prepare for the enforcement date and to be ready.”Unfortunately, even going to the extremes of blocking every user based in the EU might not be enough to inure companies from the consequences of GDPR: the law applies to data processed on EU citizens wherever they are based in the world."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd512b80ed87fc2a914a40202e9815438b11ece0/0_967_4788_2873/master/4788.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4075921392701613db38e872b3ab65d6","title":"onenote evernote which is best for small business organise files smartphone tablet","story":"Matt’s dad wants to organise files and make them accessible via his phone and tablet.

In any case, you can usually find the same emails by looking in a mail folder, or by searching for an email address or a job number. (Always include a job number in emails if a project involves working with different people in different companies.)If your dad wants to access his files from anywhere with a smartphone or a tablet, then he will probably need to put copies online. The simplest way to do this is to upload project folders to an online storage service such as Dropbox, Microsoft OneDrive, Google Drive or whatever. However, he’d still have to use different programs to access some different types of data.An interesting alternative is to store everything in a sort of portmanteau program that will also help organise it. The leading examples are Evernote and Microsoft’s OneNote. These are about as close as you can get to a “paperless office”, at least for a sufficiently small office.Outlook even had a “save to OneNote” feature that made it easier to file emails with other data, but it has gone missing – temporarily, I hope – from the latest version. Otherwise, both programs allow you add emails to your notebooks by almost identical means. First, you can forward them to an email address, so you could set up mail rules to forward selected emails to OneNote or Evernote. Second, you can “print” them to a OneNote or Evernote notebook instead of to a physical printer. It’s very tedious to do more than a few.Still, you can also add things like receipts and business cards by, in effect, using your smartphone as a scanner. Example apps include Microsoft’s Office Lens with OneNote and Scannable or Scantastic with Evernote.The OneNote v Evernote debate has been long and sometimes heated, but they are different products, and each does some things better than the other. If you want to clip web pages and share notes then Evernote is the clear winner.However, I think OneNote might be the better choice for your dad, because its hierarchical structure is logical and almost infinitely expandable. It works like an old-school ring binder or filing cabinet. (It’s very popular in schools.)You can open as many notebooks as you like, and give them all names. Inside a notebook, you can create as many tabs as you like, for different projects. Inside each tab, you can have as many pages as you like.It’s probably easier to get going with Evernote because you can treat it like a slop-bucket and find whatever you need by searching for it. (Yes, Evernote does have notebooks, and you can create stacks of them, but the point stands.) OneNote requires more setting up to work well, but its structured approach may be a better match for your dad’s business purposes.Both OneNote and Evernote are available as free web applications and as apps, so you can try them to see which you like. Just open an email account at Outlook – you don’t have to give your real name or any personal details – and you can use OneNote until you fill up your 5GB of free OneDrive space. If you find it does the job, you can increase the storage to 50GB for £1.99 per month.There are also free OneNote apps for the Mac, iOS, Windows and Android.In the same way, you can try Evernote, and its associated apps. The drawback is that the free Basic version does not have all the features of the Premium version, and is limited to 60MB of uploads per month. To make a proper comparison, you would need to pay £44.99 per year for the Premium version, which allows 10GB of uploads. (The Plus version has been discontinued.)Alternatively, you could sign up for a free trial of Evernote Business, which costs £10.99 per user per month. This is aimed at teams, but it includes Evernote Premium as well. You can compare the features online.OneNote’s other advantage is that it’s integrated into Microsoft Office, and gets third party support from sites like Onetastic. Not everyone cares about Office integration, but most large organisations run on it, and your mention of Word suggests that your dad already uses it.If your dad has Office 2016, then he already has a copy of the desktop version of OneNote. This version can create and store files locally, while also working online.People who already have Office 2016 can subscribe to Office 365 Business Essentials for £3.80 plus VAT per month. That doesn’t include support, but it does include the standard 1TB of online storage, which is enough for most people’s work files.The Office 365 Business version (£7.90 plus VAT per month) adds downloads of the full Office programs plus 247 phone and web support. The Premium version (£9.40 plus VAT per month) adds a custom domain email address plus extra features such as Microsoft Invoicing, Microsoft Bookings, Microsoft Planner and Outlook Customer Manager.Evernote has dominated this category of software on the Mac for two main reasons. First, Microsoft took more than a decade to add OneNote to the Mac version of Office: it appeared on Windows in 2003 – five years before Evernote – and on Mac in 2014. Second, the Mac version has never had the full capabilities of the Windows version. This is annoying even if you don’t really need the missing features.Unfortunately, the Mac version will never catch up. In fact, OneNote 2016 will be the last desktop version for either platform, and Microsoft has already stopped updating it. Worse, it has made the free versions of OneNote 2016 impossible to find, and I did try. (Like all the free versions, these can only store notebooks in OneDrive.)Instead, Microsoft is pushing users towards the app version, which is provided as standard in Windows 10. This sacrifices features such as Outlook integration, Onetastic compatibility, and the ability to create OneNote notebooks on local devices (though notebooks are cached locally).Last month, William Devereux from Microsoft’s OneNote team claimed that the app would be better than the desktop version – it has many new features – and that it would be consistent across the various platforms (web, Mac, iOS, and Android). A scan through the comments shows how well that claim went down.You may find the app does what you need. If not, bear in mind that OneNote 2016 will only be supported until 14 October, 2025.Have you got a question?

It takes Rich and two other men to roll the animal off the sled and on to the ice, while his wife and young children watch.His sister, Natasha Pottle, who shot the bear the night before, hands her brother the plastic bags used to store liver, hair and fat samples that will be sent away for lab testing. The animal will provide valuable information for Labrador’s biologists, a small windfall for his family and meat for the community. Rich has barely begun cutting into the hide when a parade of people from the village start arriving to take pictures, offer observations or just watch respectfully.“When you get a bear, everyone in town knows it,” Rich said.Scenes like this are being repeated up and down the rugged, remote coast this year. Despite vanishing sea ice and shorter, milder winters, Labrador’s polar bear population is actually growing – which means a bigger harvesting quota for Inuit hunters.There are more than 2,500 polar bears in the vast coastal area that includes Labrador and northern Quebec, according to Environment Canada – far more than was expected earlier in the millennium – and further signs the bears continue to rebound despite the impacts of climate change.Indeed, although scientists and Inuit sometimes clash over the estimates, the polar bear population of coastal Labrador is among the healthiest in the world.“When I grew up, a polar bear was kind of this mythical creature because you didn’t see them very often. You didn’t hear tell of people seeing them,” said Jim Goudie, wildlife manager for Nunatsiavut, the regional indigenous self-government.“This abundance of polar bears is not something my father’s generation grew up with. It’s only since the mid-80s there’s been the boom. Now there’s polar bears everywhere.”The reason, biologists suspect, is the boom in the harp seal population. As Newfoundland’s seal fishery has collapsed under international pressure, the harp seals of the north-west Atlantic have proliferated. They now number about 7.4 million animals – more then seven times the population in the 1970s.That has created a veritable feast for Labrador’s polar bears, who have shifted their diet from ring seals to their more southerly, promiscuous cousins.“They jumped on the harp seal boom,” Goudie said. “They appear to have adapted for this moment in time … We’re seeing them further south than in the past.”Labrador’s Inuit have hunted polar bears for thousands of years. But only recently have they been able to so carefully monitor and protect the population, thanks to a unique, indigenous-run conservation program managed by Nunatsiavut.The bear shot by Pottle was one of 12 killed by Inuit hunters this season under Nunatsiavut’s quota system, which doles out bear hunting licences through a lottery. A hunter has one week to get a bear before the licence expires and is transferred to another person. Only Inuit residents can apply for a licence, and it’s illegal to sell a licence to a big game hunter who is not from the region.In Inuit culture, a polar bear remains a deeply respected animal, called Nanuk in the Inuktitut language, and getting one is still considered the mark of a great hunter. The harvest remains such an important part of local tradition that it has its own statute in Nunatsiavut’s land claim with the federal government.But Pottle isn’t putting on any airs. Shooting her first polar bear was a terrifying experience, she said.“I was scared,” she said. “It was intense. We chased the tracks out on to the ice and there he was. Then our Ski-Doo stalled and he started coming toward us. That’s when I started calling for my brother.”Her brother, carrying the rifle on his back, circled around to keep the animal at a safer distance. Then he handed the gun to Natasha and told her to shoot.“She was crying, and I said: ‘What’s wrong?’ She said she’s never going polar bear hunting again,” he said. “I said: ‘It’s your licence. You’ve got to shoot it.’”The bear meat will be ided up and shared among the region’s community freezer program, which provides food for the elderly and others who can’t hunt for themselves. Wasting the meat is prohibited by Nunatsiavut law. Failure to share the meat or submit samples for testing means a hunter can be banned for five years.Inuit hunters can sell a bear pelt for $4,000 to $5,000 to a local taxidermist, who will auction it off to buyers around the world. In previous decades, when the international market for pelts was booming, the same bearskin could fetch as much as $30,000. Under Nunatsiavut’s program, a computer chip is embedded in the pelt to prove it was harvested through a legal hunt.Much like the coastal Inuit themselves, the polar bear’s world relies heavily on reliable, vast expanses of sea ice. As the region’s sea ice vanishes because of warming oceans and milder winters, the bear has had to adapt. The animals appear to be thriving, but winter is becoming increasingly unpredictable.The loss of sea ice has been dramatic, according to climatologist Robert Way. He points to the Canadian Ice Service historical database, which shows Nunatsiavut’s northern region has lost about a third of its ice cover in the past decade.Conservationists say the Nunatsiavut model is a lesson for other regions trying to manage their polar bear population. Goudie argues the Inuit, sometimes criticized by animal rights activists for allowing the bear hunt, have a vested interest in preserving the polar bears that live among them.“For Inuit, it would be like losing an entire piece of their culture,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1293a839f1c47d3136977e450f43a4a10becd3dd/0_32_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e681f47e198436742ca6e3a53eacf1fa","title":"mh17 downed by russian military missile system say investigators","story":"International team says evidence shows missile came from a Russia-based unitA Russian military missile was responsible for shooting down flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine in 2014, an international team of investigators said on Thursday, for the first time pointing the finger directly at Moscow.The Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 was travelling from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur when it was shot down over the conflict zone in eastern Ukraine on 17 July 2014. All 298 people onboard were killed.At a press conference in The Hague on Thursday, the investigators showed photo and video evidence that they said proved they had identified the specific BUK missile system responsible. They said they had “legal and convincing evidence which will stand up in a courtroom” that the BUK system involved came from the 53rd anti-aircraft missile brigade based in Kursk, in western Russia.The joint investigation team (JIT) looking into the incident is made up of Dutch prosecutors and police and others from Australia, Malaysia and Ukraine. They showed photos and video of the convoy that carried the missile system over the border from Russia to Ukraine, and a series of distinctive markings and serial numbers which they said had enabled them to trace the exact system used in the attack, and trace it to the 53rd brigade.Russian officials have denied all involvement in the incident, and on Thursday the defence ministry repeated these denials, claiming that no Russian missile had ever crossed into Ukraine. Kremlin-linked media outlets have floated a range of implausible theories suggesting Ukraine was responsible for shooting down the plane. Russia has used its veto in the UN to prevent an international tribunal from being set up to determine guilt, meaning any eventual trial would be held in the Netherlands under Dutch law. Fred Westerbeke, the chief prosecutor, said the investigation was in its last phase but could not say when he would be ready to file indictments. Two years ago, prosecutors said there were about 100 people under suspicion of direct or indirect involvement. On Thursday, Westerbeke said that number had come down to several dozen, but he declined to name them. He said there was other evidence that would be kept secret until a court hearing began. “We don’t want to tell everything we know because then we are opening our cards to the other side and we do not want to do that.”The big question will be how a future court will operate, given Russia is likely to continue its policy of stonewalling and denial. Investigators had asked Russian authorities for information about the 53rd brigade but had been ignored, said Westerbeke. If specific Russian military personnel or commanders are indicted, Russia is almost certain to refuse their extradition.Australian foreign minister Julie Bishop said the countries that make up the JIT were now “considering options” about how to proceed. “That a sophisticated weapon belonging to the Russian army was dispatched and used to shoot down a civilian aircraft should be of grave international concern,” she said.The JIT stopped short of saying it believed the BUK system was deployed as part of a Russian military mission, saying only that they had identified the base from which it came. In a sign that some evidence is still missing, the JIT repeated a call for those with information about the incident to come forward, including information about the 53rd brigade, promising anonymity. “The next crucially important step is to identify some members of the military in the 53rd brigade ... who can directly say who was involved in the transfer or operation of the BUK,” said Ukrainian army general Vasyl Hrytsak, a member of the investigation team, in comments to Reuters. Bellingcat said it would hold a press conference on Friday to present new findings on MH17.In the weeks before MH17 was shot down, the separatists had shot down a number of Ukrainian military planes over east Ukraine, and intercepted communications between separatist fighters made it clear that they initially believed they had hit another military plane, not a civilian liner.Russia has repeatedly denied it was militarily active in eastern Ukraine, despite an overwhelming body of evidence to the contrary. In 2014, Russian troops and hardware were introduced at key moments to back pro-Russia separatists fighting against Ukrainian government troops.After a series of Russian media claims of Ukrainian responsibility were all shown to be false, Moscow appears to have settled on the idea that it was “impossible to tell” which side was responsible. This week a group of families of the MH17 victims wrote an open letter to the Russian people before the World Cup begins next month.“We are painfully aware of the dark irony that the Russian leaders who will profess to welcome the world with open arms are those who are chiefly to blame for shattering our world,” the letter says. “And that it is these same leaders who have persistently sought to hide the truth, and who have evaded responsibility ever since that dreadful day in July 2014.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Conference hears of \u0026lsquoexcessive duplication\u0026rsquo with \u0026lsquounnecessary form-filling\u0026rsquo2016 Census showed almost 400,000 people in Ireland live aloneFacebook video appears to show young men attempting to make exahusted pony stand upThree FF TDs indicate they will not back legislation for abortion up to 12 weeksFianna F\u0026aacuteil TD says article by Sammy Wilson and Owen Paterson has no recourse to factsR\u0026oacuteis\u0026iacuten Shortall claims Government \u0026lsquois not going to do anything\u0026rsquo to tackle issueBody of 24-year-old released to her family five days after Mark Hennessy killed herCampaigners used FoI to learn of 2011 Indaver and Department of Environment talksThe winning ticket was bought in Eason outlet in Wilton Shopping Centre, Co CorkTaoiseach will look at proposals that are \u0026lsquothe same or better\u0026rsquo than what is outlined in the backstopChildren and staff in Ballybay creche to be screened for infectionIrish youths outline their feelings on the issues ahead of the Eighth Amendment voteProgramme has saved lives, is performing well and will continue to do so, says CoveneyRomanian national (45) was assaulted in Ardglass\u0026lsquoThe \u0026rsquo will have extended live coverage of the Eighth Amendment pollEuropean Commission report warns of limited progress in decarbonising the economyMichael D Higgins gives address to celebrate Africa DayCIT may face penalties over \u0026euro13,000 retirement function which featured ice sculptureDepartment estimates it would cost \u0026euro200m to end two-tier pay structure that affects 60,000"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3507721.1527195361!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"bus %C3%A9ireann staff to receive pay review","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBus Éireann buses in Dublin. Management at the State-owned transport company is to carry out a review of pay for staff. File photograph: Caroline QuinnPA Wire Management at Bus Éireann is to carry out a review of pay for staff at the State-owned transport company.The company met with trade unions on Thursday and agreed that the process will commence in about three weeks’ time. It is understood that unions are seeking pay increases up to the level of the 3.75 per cent rise secured by staff at Dublin Bus. A Bus Éireann spokeswoman said that management had acknowledged that a review of pay levels across all grades of staff needed to be considered.She said that all parties accepted that a Labour Court recommendation, which brought to an end a three-week strike at the company last year, provided a mechanism to review aspects of pay and conditions at the company.“Management acknowledges the major contribution made by staff in the ongoing transformation of the company’s business, while remaining cognisant of the ongoing financial challenges that remain,” she said.Siptu described the meeting on Thursday as “constructive ”.Siptu sector organiser John Murphy said: “While the financial position of the company has improved due to efficiencies provided by our members under the Labour Court recommendation, the problem of severe underfunding of Bus Éireann remains.“It is essential that the National Transport Authority steps up to the mark and provides adequate funding to allow Bus Éireann to maintain services and increase its employees’ basic pay in line with industry norms. Such an approach would adequately recognise the sacrifices made by our members to secure the continued viability of the company.”The general secretary of the National Bus and Rail Union (NBRU), Dermot O’Leary, said: “Our members were informed last year that further investment at Bus Éireann would not be forthcoming unless they accepted the Labour Court recommendation and the efficiencies therein. The recent announcements on service expansion and driver recruitment is a clear indication that Bus Éireann is once again open for business."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3507521.1527187710!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"government seeks to reassure women over breastcheck s future","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFears have been expressed that spiralling legal costs could lead to the breast cancer screening programme being closed down. File photograph: Getty ImagesThe BreastCheck cancer screening programme is doing its job and has helped to save the lives of women in the State, Tánaiste Simon Coveney has said. Mr Coveney was speaking as the Government moved to reassure women about the programme in wake of fears that legal costs arising from potential litigation could lead to it being closed down.He told the Dáil that “BreastCheck as far as we can see is performing well and has saved lives and will continue to do so with the reviews that are taking place”. The  reported on Thursday that the national clinical director of BreastCheck, Prof Ann O’Doherty, had said her unit at St Vincent’s University Hospital in Dublin had received a surge of solicitors’ letters following the controversy over cervical cancer screening.She said in her 30-year career in breast cancer screening she would have dealt with one case or less per year involving solicitors. But her unit had received 15 solicitors’ letters in the last fortnight. Prof O’Doherty expressed fears that spiralling legal costs could lead to the breast cancer screening programme being closed down. Solicitor Cian O’Carroll, who represented Vicky Phelan in her recent case over a delayed cervical cancer diagnosis, maintained that the 15 letters mentioned by Prof O’Doherty were not legal threats, but correspondence from women seeking files. Mr Coveney said “BreastCheck is a screening programme that is extremely valuable and needs to be protected” and improved if necessary. He said that in terms of the legal issues, the Taoiseach had set up a group to look at common law in relation to medical litigation.The Health Service Executive said BreastCheck was moving to a policy of open disclosure next year. The executive had informed the Government the British National Health Service had moved formally to that position last year and Mr Coveney said the State would learn from that.BreastCheck said on Thursday that while mammography was the best screening test available for detection of breast cancer, like all other screening tests, it was not diagnostic and not 100 per cent effective. “Although mammograms will detect most cases of breast cancer, there will always be cases where cancer is not detected. Interval cancers, or cancers detected after a woman has had a negative mammogram and before her next mammogram is due, are inherent features of population-based screening programmes,” it said. The interval cancer rate of BreastCheck met international standards, with approximately 9.6 cancer cases per 10,000 women screened.Meanwhile, the Irish Cancer Society said that women diagnosed with breast cancer between screenings should be offered reviews of mammograms to discover if there was an error in a previous result. The charity said these women should be “communicated with openly and given any support they need”. The society also said Minister for Health Simon Harris must ensure any legal claims could be dealt with through mediation so patients, some of whom may be ill, did not have to go to court. Liz Yeates, chief executive of the Marie Keating Foundation, said while BreastCheck is one of the most highly accredited screening services, like any screening service it is not a diagnostic service and will not pick up 100 per cent of breast cancers.“The primary aim of breast screening is to pick up pre-cancerous cells but not all breast cancers will be found by mammogram,” she said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3505414.1527073210!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"remaking a country malaysia s new leaders get to work","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            Malaysian politician Anwar Ibrahim speaks during a news conference next to his wife Wan Azizah Wan Ismail in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on May 16th, following his release from prison.

Photograph: Vincent ThianAPMaria Chin Abdullah has faced death threats, detention without trial in solitary confinement and numerous police investigations, as she campaigned against corruption in her native Malaysia. She still faces prosecution for illegal assembly and is banned from travelling to the state of Sarawak in Borneo.Yet Abdullah will today, as she has for the past two weeks, go to work as an MP for Malaysia’s new governing Pakatan Harapan (Alliance of Hope) coalition. The 61-year-old mother of three is a powerful symbol of everything that has changed since the electoral shock on May 9th, when the ruling party was thrown out of power for the first time since independence in 1957.After decades battling human rights abuses by Malaysia’s authoritarian governments, most recently that of former prime minister Najib Razak, she must now confront an arguably bigger challenge: dismantling the old regime and implementing root-and-branch reform in her role as an MP. “For 61 years, it was only criticism but now we have to implement what we say,” says Abdullah. “It’s a tall order as the new coalition is not all homogeneous. Ironing out our differences and the principles of our new democracy will take some years.”The coalition rode a wave of anger against the perceived corruption of the Najib government. It represents one of the most dramatic, bloodless rejections of authoritarian rule in recent global politics, with the United Malays National Organisation (Umno) – in power for more than 60 years – ousted at the ballot box. Even more remarkable is the fact that this reformist revolution was led by former strongman Mahathir Mohamad, prime minister from 1981 to 2003, in alliance with his protégé-turned-nemesis Anwar Ibrahim. As the initial jubilation fades, Mahathir (92), restored as prime minister, faces the monumental task of delivering on his coalition’s promises to repeal repressive laws, reform corrupt institutions and ensure a fairer ision of the economic spoils.Scepticism over his Damascene conversion to participatory democracy is only one of the many hurdles in front of his government.During its long rule, Umno bent the legal system, civil service and state-owned companies to its own ends. But the repression, electoral manipulation and allegations of corruption reached their zenith under Najib, who has been banned from leaving the country after Mahathir launched a new investigation into accusations that billions of dollars were misappropriated from the debt-ridden 1MDB state fund set up by Najib.If Mahathir can get it right, this multi-ethnic nation of 31 million people could become an example in a region beset by repressive governments, reversing a years-long brain drain and transforming the prospects of this emerging market, which has attracted a wide range of global investors.But, from Myanmar to South Africa and Indonesia to Egypt, transitions from authoritarianism to more democratic systems have proved difficult. Anwar, the Pakatan Harapan figurehead freed from prison last week, is under no illusions about the challenge facing him – and Mahathir – if he takes over as prime minister within one or two years, as planned. “I’m a student of history,” he says. “I realise how revolutions and people’s movements have disappointed the masses.”He adds: “The central issue is still governance ... and democratic accountability. We can’t have the election commission involved in a fraudulent exercise, we can’t have the judiciary acting at the behest of the government, we can’t have a media that’s being cowed.”Even critics admit that Mahathir has moved rapidly since he was sworn in on May 10th to start dismantling the system he helped create. The prime minister won a full royal pardon for Anwar, who was first jailed under Mahathir between 1998 and 2004 before he was imprisoned again under Najib in 2015, and secured the departures of the attorney general and head of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission.He has set up committees to advise on institutional and economic reforms, and to investigate 1MDB, from which at least $4.5 billion was erted and laundered, according to the US Department of Justice.But suspicion remains. Although Mahathir has appointed some leading civil society advocates and technocrats to these committees, he has chosen others, such as economic adviser and former finance minister Daim Zainuddin, who many Malaysians doubt are genuine reformers. His cabinet also contains a mix of opposition stalwarts such as Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, the deputy prime minister and Anwar’s wife, alongside more recent converts to reform such as Muhyiddin Yassin, a former Umno heavyweight and now home affairs minister.Many Pakatan Harapan supporters are giving Mahathir a chance to prove he has changed his spots, after his marshalling of the disparate coalition parties and his popularity with rural Malay voters helped them to win the election against great odds. They say he must maintain the reform momentum in order to keep together his coalition, which includes his Malay-dominated party of Umno defectors, Anwar’s People’s Justice party and the ethnic Chinese-dominated Democratic Action party.“The new government has made a good start but they’re facing a huge task, particularly in terms of legal reform,” says Sevan Doraisamy, executive director of Suaram, a human rights group. Suaram is one of several organisations that waged a decades-long battle to stop the Umno government and the police using vague laws to crush dissent. Last year alone, his organisation documented 155 cases where people faced legal action that violated their freedom of speech and recorded 280 cases of detention without trial under heavily criticised laws. Doraisamy and other activists want the government to institute an immediate moratorium on the use of such laws, before they can be amended or repealed when parliament returns in the next few months. Mahathir showed his new colours by using Twitter to rebuke the police for arresting a man who criticised him on Facebook and promising to review the relevant law when parliament convenes.Amanda Whiting, professor of Malaysian law at the University of Melbourne, says the problem goes far beyond the law itself to a “deeply entrenched” culture of intolerance for criticism and meddling in the judicial process.“There needs to be a cultural shift, they can’t just change the laws,” she says. “There’s a complete lack of trust in some of the major public institutions like the attorney general. There are severe doubts about the probity of decisions made – and the willingness of senior people to bow to pressure – and these are under investigation now.”This culture of corruption, collusion and nepotism has become deeply embedded in Malaysia’s bloated civil service, on which Mahathir has promised to bring the axe, starting with the 17,000 political appointees who served under Najib.Wong Chen, a Pakatan Harapan MP, claims that up to 40 per cent of annual government spending, which is forecast to be $59 billion (€50 billion) this year, is lost to corruption and wastage, with previous Umno governments readily handing out grants and contracts to friendly parties. “The path we need to take is clear,” he says. “The question is: do we have the will?”The allegations of corruption rose markedly under Najib, particularly surrounding 1MDB. At one point, $681 million was paid into Najib’s own bank account, in what he later said was a gift from Saudi royalty, most of which he said he repaid. He has always denied any wrongdoing over 1MDB. Mahathir has gone after his predecessor with zeal, appointing respected anti-graft officials to a task force to investigate possible criminal charges related to the fund. He has authorised the police to conduct extensive searches at properties used by Najib and his family, with several hundred designer handbags and dozens of suitcases full of jewellery, cash and other valuables confiscated from one luxury apartment complex in Kuala Lumpur alone.  Najib’s lawyer has criticised the “cavalier and irresponsible” manner of the police conduct, but Mahathir says the new government is following the rule of law, rather than seeking payback.“If anyone made any mistake, the law will decide, but I’m not going to take revenge in any form,” said Shukri Abdull, the new head of the anti-corruption commission, on Tuesday. The former deputy head of the commission claimed that he was forced out of the organisation during Najib’s reign after receiving death threats for pursuing the 1MDB case. With debt coupons to be paid, Mahathir is under pressure to move fast on 1MDB. New finance minister Lim Guan Eng says that the last government has injected nearly $1.8 billion into 1MDB since April 2017 to cover debt service obligations.“There are a lot of issues,” says one banker in Kuala Lumpur. “They need to identify where all the liabilities are, what shady deals have been done and what is the residual risk.”But Peter Mumford, the Asia director of Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy, argues that there is a limit to how far the new prime minister will go to tackle corruption. “Mahathir needs to demonstrate he is cleaning up the system, but he will be cautious and selective in draining the swamp,” he says. “There are lots of skeletons in plenty of closets.”The opposition’s anti-graft campaign message was popular because it linked anger at the high cost of living and wide social inequality to the alleged excesses of the Najib administration.In particular, Pakatan Harapan promised to abolish the 6 per cent goods and sales tax introduced by Najib in 2015, to praise from international economists who believed it was wise for the government to ersify its revenue base away from oil production.The GST will be scrapped from June 1st. But the government has yet to come up with concrete plans for how to replace the lost money – which was forecast this year to be around $12 billion, or nearly a fifth of state revenues – or fund other populist pledges, such as reinstating some fuel subsidies and abolishing highway tolls.A senior economic adviser to the government says the rebound in oil prices since 2015 will give Malaysia ample breathing space for now – but not all analysts are convinced.“How are they going to make up for the lost revenues from the GST?” asks Steve Clayton, chief executive of JPMorgan in Malaysia. “There’s a pretty substantial hole to fill.”Mr Mahathir will also have to lay out how he will ensure that the fruits of Malaysia’s rapid economic growth – with gross domestic product expanding by 5.9 per cent last year – are more fairly distributed.Promised reviews – and possible renegotiations – of multibillion-dollar infrastructure projects agreed with the Chinese government as part of President Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative could help create more local jobs and business opportunities. But redrawing what Mahathir has called “unequal treaties” with China will be tough. Implementing so many sweeping changes at once is complex - and risky. Expectations are high and Malaysians are determined to hold the country’s leaders to account.“Our greatest fear is that the bad habits sneak back in and we end up with UMNO 2.0,” says Baharom, a 52-year-old personal trainer and supporter of Anwar. “But the difference this time is that the people have spoken. If they don’t reform, we will kick them out.”1981: Mahathir Mohamad becomes prime minister for the first time1998: Mahathir sacks Anwar, has him arrested and he is subsequently convicted of corruption and sodomy2003: Mahathir steps down as PM and is replaced by Abdullah Badawi2004: Anwar is released from prison2009: Najib Razak replaces Abdullah as PM and later sets up 1MDB2016: Anwar and Mahathir start reconciliation talks2018 (May): Mahathir elected as PM and frees Anwar, while putting Najib under investigation for corruption – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2018"},{"url":null,"title":"hawaiis erupting kilauea volcano pictures","story":"Kilauea volcano has created nearly two dozen lava-shooting fissures on Hawaii\u0027s Big Island since the eruption began, spewing lava and emitting toxic gases.Thousands have been forced to evacuate their homes and experts remain unsure of where more of the hazardous cracks might open up, or when the volcanic activity might stop.The eruption of Kilauea volcano in Hawaii sparked new safety warnings about toxic gas on the Big Island\u0027s southern coastline after lava began flowing into the ocean and setting off a chemical reaction.Gardener\u0026#39s World presenter Rachel de Thame reveals she is battling breast cancer on live TVHow much water do you use in the morning?The Trouble with M\u0026ampS, review: a lacklustre account of how Marks lost its sparkHumans, series three, episode two review: Thoughtful science fiction with plenty of heart and dramaGDPR fraudsters con people out of thousands with wave of phishing emailsGrenfell survivors claim fire brigade\u0026#39s \u0026#39stay put\u0026#39 advice cost residents chance to escapeThe Grenfell Tower survivors: Lucky to escape, but living with the horror of what they sawVenezuela President Maduro vows to free jailed opposition activistsLorry transporting Batmobile among range of novelty cars engulfed in flames on the M4Property lawyer gets to keep home extension despite having no planning permission Harvey Weinstein \u0026#39to be charged\u0026#39 over sexual misconduct allegationsNew helicopter fleet for Royal MarinesSyrian air defence intercepts missile attack on airportParachute trial: Emile Cilliers cheated and lied but proved irresistible to womenComment: Donald Trump\u0026#39s letter to North Korea is not madness.

The enduring commitment demonstrates Britain’s ongoing commitment operationally and diplomatically in the region, naval sources told The .Gavin Williamson has announced the move in a show of support for NatoBritain has had a presence in the Gulf for decades, but the three-week sea passage to deploy and recover a ship meant there were long periods with no Royal Naval assets in the region.The plan to base a Type-23 Frigate – and from the mid-2020s the next generation Type-31 – would likely see the whole ship’s company flown out to take over the vessel based in Bahrain.Routine maintenance of the ships would be carried out at the Mina Salman base, with the ship likely to remain in the region for about three years. The more comprehensive depth servicing every five to 10 years will be done in the UK. Smaller minehunter vessels have been based in the region for the last 10 years, but crews have deployed via Royal Fleet Auxiliary ships. The use of the new support base and a Type 23 frigate is a step change in naval capability.The Defence secretary also spoke of to the “increasing aggression and increasing assertiveness” of Russia.

Sainsbury’s retail and operations director Simon Roberts said: “I believe this is the right thing to do and am proud to be offering such a significant pay boost to over 120,000 store colleagues across the country. “The changes we are introducing from September will make pay and contracts fair and consistent for all of our colleagues, in every store, regardless of age or length of service. ”However, the contract changes that will introduce the new pay rates also mean staff will no longer be paid for breaks. The new deal will also get rid of a discretionary bonus scheme previously available for hourly paid workers, and premium pay rates for night shift work will be restricted to between midnight and 5am.One Sainsbury’s worker told The Independent that many staff felt they were being given an ultimatum over the contracts, and because many of those affected are older workers, there are concerns about their ability to find new jobs. The supermarket is also reducing the number of contract types\u0026nbspit offers, moving from 22 specific roles, to five broader contracts. The Sainsbury’s staff member said: “It’s a dogsbody contract –\u0026nbspinstead of being on different contracts we’ll be on one general contract. So they’ll be able to ask us to do whatever they want.”Siobhain McDonagh, MP for Mitcham and Morden, has been campaigning on behalf of a group of around 9,000 workers, who she says will actually lose money under the new rules. Earlier this week, a letter written by Ms McDonagh and signed by more than 100 MPs was sent to the prime minister, asking her to take action. “We are disappointed that 9,000 members of the most loyal staff are going to receive a pay cut,” she told The Independent on Thursday. “We suspect that a lot of them are older and have probably given years of service.“They shouldn’t be hit because they are loyal and hard working and work the unpopular hours.”Ms McDonagh added: “How can a company that made pre-tax profit of £589m last year, with a CEO that receives £930,000 before bonuses, think it is right to force a pay cut on thousands of their most long-standing and loyal members of staff? It’s not right and it’s not British to ask people to work well for less.”Sainsbury’s has said it will give\u0026nbsptop-up payments for up to 18 months in order to ensure that no workers take a pay cut. After the 18-month period, the company will conduct another pay review. Sainsbury’s\u0026nbspalso attempted to quell the backlash on Thursday by saying talks with staff were finished, and it would invest an extra £10m\u0026nbspin its proposed pay rates.​Following chief executive\u0026nbspMike Coupe’s pledge that no jobs would be lost as a result of the proposed merger with Asda, Ms McDonagh said she hoped regulators would seek that assurance in writing. “We already have experience of companies like Kraft making commitments that, when the ink’s dry on the deal, they forget,” she added. or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

And uptake of the maths A-level rose by 3 per cent.Unions say the government’s exam reforms – such as the introduction of the tougher English GCSE– may also have deterred some students from studying English in sixth-form.Jill Stokoe, a policy advisor at the National Education Union, told The Independent: “I think part of it is the drive towards Stem.“With English, history and geography, it could be that the difficulty of the new GCSE specification has put people off at A-level.”And reforms – which mean AS levels no longer count towards final grades – are likely to have led to fewer students taking these subjects in Year 12 and then deciding to take them onto A-level.Figures show that entries for AS levels have fallen by almost 60 per cent this year – from 659,880 to 269,090 – continuing a trend triggered by the decoupling of AS levels from A-levels.UK news in picturesUK news in picturesAlastair Cook batting against Pakistan during the first test match of the summer at Lord’s cricket ground, London.

And in performingexpressive arts, entries among GCSE students plummeted by 40 per cent. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the school headteachers’ union (NAHT), said: “Students’ experiences of a narrower curriculum at GCSE is now having an impact on their sixth form studies.”Disadvantaged students with lower grades do as well in medical schoolHe added: “It is now impossible to argue that the EBacc measure is not having a narrowing effect on young people’s choices at GCSE. “These reforms put schools in an impossible situation where they must reduce the opportunities they offer to pupils in order to satisfy an arbitrary government target.”A Department for Education spokesperson said: “The Government has worked with employers to reform GCSEs and make them gold-standard qualifications. They will prepare pupils for future success and help deliver the skills Britain needs to be fit for the future. Entries to the core academic EBacc subjects have increased, with over 4 million of these exams being taken this year, including significant increases to those taking the inidual sciences.They added: These subjects give pupils the best foundation to progress into further education and employment. Thanks to our reforms and the hard work of teachers, academic standards are rising with 1.9 million more children in good or outstanding schools than in 2010.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Is the adoption of other people\u0027s customs and cultures fair game or has political correctness gone mad?\u0026nbspDavid Barnett treads warily\u0026nbspLet’s get this out of the way: I am a straight, white, middle-aged man, so what follows you may take with a pinch of salt or disregard completely. But we’re going to talk, you and I, about the thorny issue of cultural appropriation.It was only a year ago that Oxford Dictionaries put the phrase into their official lexicons, with the definition, “the unacknowledged or inappropriate adoption of the customs, practices, ideas, etc. of one people or society by members of another and typically more dominant people or society.”Cultural appropriation is sometimes so blatant it smacks us in the face. The Black and White Minstrel Show ran on British television for – what seems now to us, looking back at it – and astonishing 20 years, from 1958.Even halfway through its run the show, in which white entertainers “blacked up” to sing songs in a Deep South of America style, was the subject of petitions calling for it to be taken off the air because of its in-your-face racism. It can hardly be seen now without an overwhelming feeling of embarrassment. How did we ever think that was acceptable?The show was harking back to the minstrel shows in 19th-century America, and blackface was a popular form of entertainment until the enlightenment of the 1960s, coupled with rising racial tensions across the US, finally put paid to it. Even Al Jolson, dubbed “the world’s greatest entertainer”, was renowned for performing in blackface. Jolson was Jewish, and while there can never be any excuses made today for blacking up, it’s interesting that in their 2008 book the Encyclopedia of American Jewish History, authors Stephen Harlan Norwood and Eunice G Pollack talk of Jolson’s 1927 movie The Jazz Singer in terms which suggest some kind of what we would today call intersectionality. For example: “Is there any incongruity in this Jewish boy with his face painted like a Southern Negro singing in the Negro dialect? No, there is not…The son of a line of rabbis well knows how to sing the songs of the most cruelly wronged people in the world\u0027s history.”Can a Jewish man really pretend to be a black man without racism? Is this cultural appropriation of the very worst kind or solidarity that only two historically subjugated peoples can appreciate? And what, then, of a Jewish woman who dresses up as a Japanese woman for entertainment?The cries of “cultural appropriation” were resounding around social media even before Netta Barzilai had finished her (ultimately competition-winning) performance of Toys, the Israeli entry in this month’s Eurovision song contest held in Lisbon.Netta wore a stylised kimono and was surrounded by dozens of maneki neko waving lucky cat statues. Twitter in particular was rather exercised by the thought of the cultural appropriation taking place before its very eyes. Or, I should say, mainly white Western Twitter. It seems the only people not too fussed were the Japanese themselves.According to the website soranews24, which repackages and discusses Japanese news stories for an English speaking audience, the overwhelming response on the ground seems to be a mildly nonplussed reaction.The site quoted from Japanese social media accounts which included the responses, “Culture is meant to be stolen. If it’s not worth stealing, then it isn’t culture”, “If people keep claiming ‘cultural appropriation’ then people will not touch our culture. Then, people will not understand our culture and it will be easier to become our enemy”, and, perhaps crucially, “Westerners care too much about silly things”.Is that the problem? Are we, Westerners, liberal Westerners, too over-sensitive of the feelings of others brought on by white guilt? Or are we right to call out what we think is wrong when we see it? Should we wait before speaking, to see what the actual people affected think? Or is it our duty to step in first?Perhaps it’s now we should go back to the Oxford Dictionaries definition of cultural appropriation, particularly the bit that talks about the “more dominant people or society”. Is Israel a more dominant culture than Japan? Or vice-versa? What do we think? What do they think?A couple of weeks before Eurovision, Eastern dress was setting Twitter alight again, this time when a Utah teenager posted online pictures of her wearing her prom dress which was actually a qipao, traditional Chinese dress. The 18-year-old was accused of cultural appropriation and casual racism. People of Chinese heritage chimed in with arguments on both sides of the debate, with some pointing out that the outfit was originally worn by women carrying out domestic duties, and thus not something to be really celebrated, and another writing, “I’m Asian and Chinese, you looked beautiful in that dress, I’m sorry you got bashed for it.”Cyprus\u0027 singer Eleni Foureira performs the song FuegoIsrael\u0027s singer Netta performs the song Toy Belgium\u0027s singer Sennek performs the song A Matter Of Time Estonia\u0027s singer Elina Nechayeva performs the song La ForzaCroatia\u0027s singer Franka performs the song Crazy Albania\u0027s singer Eugent Bushpepa performs the song MallCzech Republic\u0027s singer Mikolas Josef performs the song Lie To MeIreland\u0027s singer Ryan O\u0027Shaughnessy performs the song TogetherSwiss duo ZIBBZ\u0027s singer Corinne Gfeller performs the song StonesBulgarian group Equinox\u0027 singer Zhana Bergendorff (R) performs the song BonesLithuania\u0027s singer Ieva Zasimauskaite performs the song When We\u0027re OldFinland\u0027s singer Saara Aalto performs the song MonstersGreece\u0027s singer Yianna Terzi performs the song Oniro MouAustria\u0027s singer Cesar Sampson performs the song Nobody But YouAzerbaijan\u0027s singer Aisel performs the song X My HeartIceland\u0027s singer Ari Olafsson performs the song Our ChoiceArmenia\u0027s singer Sevak Khanagyan performs the song QamiMacedonian duo Eye Cue\u0027s lead vocalist Marija Ivanovska (R) and guitarist Bojan Trajkovski perform the song Lost And FoundBelarus\u0027 singer Alekseev performs the song ForeverNorway\u0027s singer Alexander Rybak performs the song That\u0027s How You Write A SongRomanian band The Humans perform the song GoodbyeSerbia\u0027s band Sanja Ilic \u0026amp Balkanika perform the song Nova DecaSan Marino\u0027s Jessika featuring Jenifer Brening perform the song Who We AreDenmark\u0027s singer Rasmussen performs the song Higher GroundPoland\u0027s singer Gromee feat.

The fashion shows routinely feature collections riffing off a range of global cultures. For the coming autumn, Gucci recently unveiled a series of headwear inspired by Sikh turbans. Vogue ran a photoshoot in its “Diversity Issue” last year with a model in full Japanese geisha outfit. Not unusual, and perhaps nothing wrong with it… save for in both cases (and in the Victoria’s Secret show last year in which a model flaunted a Native American-style headdress) all the models were white.Here’s where cultural appropriation smacks up against representation. Maybe if Victoria’s Secret had employed a Native American model, if Vogue had used a Japanese model, if Gucci had – as the Sikh Coalition suggested in the aftermath – used Sikh models who would have properly observed the correct way to wear what is, after all, a sacred clothing item, then the later dissemination of these items on to the high street might not be quite so problematic.There’s a difference, too, between fashion and performance. When I was very young, on a holiday at a Pontin’s camp on the North-West coast, I was wrapped in a blanket, had two stripes of lipstick put across my face, and a feather from a passing seagull taped to my head. I was entered into the fancy dress contest (I didn’t win). I was of course, a Red Indian, as Native Americans were called in those less-enlightened times.As bad as the Black and White Minstrels? Possibly. But “Red Indians” back then were almost a fictional, fairytale group of people, the image drawn from Monday matinee westerns not renowned for historical accuracy, from Peter Pan, from Hiawatha and Little Plum. Would I have dressed my children like that when they were the same age? Undoubtedly not. Times change. Sensitivities alter.Utah teenager, Keziah Daum, sparked a huge debate on Twitter about cultural appropriation after posting photos of her traditional Chinese prom dressAnd I look down at what I’m wearing right now as I type this. A T-shirt, which has its origins as an undergarment in 19th-century America. A pair of jeans, which were originally developed in Italy (Genoa, which gave rise to “jeans”) and France (the fabric of Nimes, or de Nimes, from which is derived “denim”). A pair of flip-flops (don’t judge me), evolved from the Japanese zōri which servicemen took back to America post-Second World War (though early flip-flops have been discovered in ancient Egyptian burial sites).I am a melange of styles borrowed, begged and stolen from around the world. Is this cultural appropriation, several generations down the line? Should I be wearing what my grandfathers wore? Polyester slacks and an Oxford shirt, a cardigan, brogues? Where is the line, and on which side of it are we?Music is another cultural appropriation battleground. Every time Katy Perry or Taylor Swift goes “ghetto” for another video, or Lana Del Ray puts on a Native American headdress, it’s there to see. White folks stole rock’n’roll from African rhythms filtered through the American South, we stole electronic dance music from the predominantly-black post-disco clubs of Chicago and Detroit, and Italy. Take away the cultural appropriation, and what’s left? A couple of rousing choruses of Knees Up, Mother Brown or The Lambeth Walk, perhaps.Should we talk about food? Those great British traditions such as pizza, or chow mein, or curry? A few miles from me, Bradford is awash with curry houses. The clientele is largely white. Is that cultural appropriation? Well, no, because most of the restaurants are owned and worked in by people of South Asian heritage. But what was deemed cultural appropriation was when, earlier this year, a restaurant called Fanny’s announced it was opening a venue for the purveying of “posh kebabs” in London’s Stoke Newington.The move was lambasted on Twitter because, for one, Stoke Newington is a hub for Turkish restaurants and takeaways… the people who, you know, invented the kebab. For another, because the people behind Fanny’s weren’t Turkish (one of the founders is called Claude Compton, for your information), and the tag-line “posh kebabs” intimated that these “lads from Fulham” were basically going to beat the Turks at their own game (as a side note, Fanny’s subsequently dropped the “posh” bit from their marketing and logo).Fanny\u0027s Kebabs finally dropped the \u0027posh\u0027 bit from their marketing (fannyskebabsInstagram)If you’ve made it this far, you might be wondering where I’m heading with all this. And the honest answer is, I just don’t know. Cultural appropriation seems, on the face of it, like it should be something that all of us should fight against, but the flip-side of that is knowing exactly just what it is and when we should call it out.As I said at the top of this piece, take what I say with a pinch of salt, given that I am a middle-aged white man. But where does that leave me, if we remove years of embedded cultural appropriation? Dressed in my grandad’s clothes, listening to a 78 of George Formby classics, and clutching a chip butty? And on that score, should I be calling cultural appropriation on the New York magazine The Insider’s awestruck piece last month on a Turkish restaurant that was selling this remarkable new thing, a sandwich stuffed with fries?The answer’s no, of course, because cultural appropriation will never affect me in the way it does other, marginalised people. I have working-class roots but I’m still pretty close to the top of the privilege chain all I can realistically get away with is some faux outrage at posh kids slumming it at Wetherspoons and Greggs for Instagram likes.But maybe those who identify as white, liberal allies should hit the pause button before calling out cultural appropriation, and just take a moment to think. The obvious stuff, the outright horror of the Black and White Minstrels and the more subtle but by no means any less problematic racism, yes, by all means, dig in. Dog-piling on teenagers for wearing a prom dress, maybe hold off a bit.Cultural appropriation is a big desert, and one on which we might have to draw our own personal lines in the sand as to what we know in our guts is wrong, and what we think might be, possibly, a little bit off.And with that, I bid you sayonara.Black and White minstralsor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Sainsbury’s retail and operations director Simon Roberts said: “I believe this is the right thing to do and am proud to be offering such a significant pay boost to over 120,000 store colleagues across the country. “The changes we are introducing from September will make pay and contracts fair and consistent for all of our colleagues, in every store, regardless of age or length of service. ”However, the contract changes that will introduce the new pay rates also mean staff will no longer be paid for breaks. The new deal will also get rid of a discretionary bonus scheme previously available for hourly paid workers, and premium pay rates for night shift work will be restricted to between midnight and 5am.One Sainsbury’s worker told The Independent that many staff felt they were being given an ultimatum over the contracts, and because many of those affected are older workers, there are concerns about their ability to find new jobs. The supermarket is also reducing the number of contract types\u0026nbspit offers, moving from 22 specific roles, to five broader contracts. The Sainsbury’s staff member said: “It’s a dogsbody contract –\u0026nbspinstead of being on different contracts we’ll be on one general contract. So they’ll be able to ask us to do whatever they want.”Siobhain McDonagh, MP for Mitcham and Morden, has been campaigning on behalf of a group of around 9,000 workers, who she says will actually lose money under the new rules. Earlier this week, a letter written by Ms McDonagh and signed by more than 100 MPs was sent to the prime minister, asking her to take action. “We are disappointed that 9,000 members of the most loyal staff are going to receive a pay cut,” she told The Independent on Thursday. “We suspect that a lot of them are older and have probably given years of service.“They shouldn’t be hit because they are loyal and hard working and work the unpopular hours.”Ms McDonagh added: “How can a company that made pre-tax profit of £589m last year, with a CEO that receives £930,000 before bonuses, think it is right to force a pay cut on thousands of their most long-standing and loyal members of staff? It’s not right and it’s not British to ask people to work well for less.”Sainsbury’s has said it will give\u0026nbsptop-up payments for up to 18 months in order to ensure that no workers take a pay cut. After the 18-month period, the company will conduct another pay review. Sainsbury’s\u0026nbspalso attempted to quell the backlash on Thursday by saying talks with staff were finished, and it would invest an extra £10m\u0026nbspin its proposed pay rates.​Following chief executive\u0026nbspMike Coupe’s pledge that no jobs would be lost as a result of the proposed merger with Asda, Ms McDonagh said she hoped regulators would seek that assurance in writing. “We already have experience of companies like Kraft making commitments that, when the ink’s dry on the deal, they forget,” she added. or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The footage is about MI6 spies and the next scene should be of a James Bond type in a dramatic fight for survival. Instead, the camera pans out to show an aquarium and the visitors a woman reassuring her alarmed child.MI6’s first ever television advertisement is aimed at attracting recruits from ethnic minorities and women, and breaking stereotypes. The message is clear: the officer from the Secret Intelligence Service is not a macho white man, but the young black mother.MI6 are in the process of relaxing their rules of entry to reach the new recruitment pools. An official said: “We are making our Services’ nationality rules slightly more flexible to support our ersity agenda and a wider selection of candidates.”Blair denies knowledge of man tortured in Libya after MI6 renditionThere are no problems with getting people to join, say MI6, with 800 more staff due to be taken on to bolster the 2,700 strong cohort. There was a rush of applications after the nerve agent attack in Salisbury on Sergei and Yulia Skripal, something which tends to happen after high-profile cases involving terrorism and espionage.The aim of the campaign is to reach people who may not see the Secret Intelligence Service as a natural career. The voiceover for the advertisement says: “We are intelligence officers, but we don’t do what you think. It is not keeping your cool in the shark tank, it is picking up the silent cues that matter. Secretly, we are just like you.”MI6 have won a number of awards in recent years for promoting gender and ethnic equality. The latest figures, however, show that more progress needs to be made on both racial and gender balance. Overall, women make up 24.1 per cent in the senior civil service grade and 37.8 per cent among the non-senior category. There is not a single black or other ethnic minority member of the service’s senior staff and that group makes up just 6.8 per cent of the non-senior workforce.The advertisement will be first shown on Thursday evening. Alex Younger, the MI6 Chief, said at a preview for journalists: “I want to dispel the myths that still too often see potential candidates rule themselves out. The service I am proud to lead is global, modern and most capable with a deserved reputation of being one of the best intelligence services in the world.“My message remains simple, there is no ‘standard’ MI6 officer: if you have what it takes, then apply to join us. Our work is exciting, intellectually challenging and it matters. Regardless of background, if you have the skills we need and share our values, I want you to consider a career in intelligence in a service that reflects today’s society, MI6 needs the best people this country has to offer.”UK news in picturesUK news in picturesAlastair Cook batting against Pakistan during the first test match of the summer at Lord’s cricket ground, London.

She said: “I wanted a change after the birth of my third child. I wanted to do something that made a difference and this absolutely ticked that. Joining the service and serving the country seemed to be a worthwhile thing to do. I have found combining my job with my family life very manageable, certainly compared to the commercial world, which can be quite inflexible.”“I was apprehensive at first, I thought one of the requirements for the job was the ability to blend into the crowd, to be a grey man, which is not me, of course, at any level. But I find what I do interesting. I have been able to work against a full range of targets. I can put my views forward, challenge group think. I have been able to use my difference to my advantage.A senior director who had been 20 years with MI6 said an awareness of the need to be more inclusive “has been a process of evolution”. He wanted to stress the importance of thinking beyond the established norm and welcoming different views. “We are looking for people who are brave enough to speak up,” he said. “Having a more erse workforce will, we believe, help counter group think.”MI6’s head of recruitment, a mother of two children who has also spent 20 years in the service, said intelligence officers were required to have a “blend of emotional intelligence and impersonal skills”, an ability to form “instrumental relationships”, a “strong sense of integrity and creativity”, a “desire to work and live overseas” and “an interest in foreign affairs and culture”.The aim of the advertising campaign was to find a twist on the 007 theme. “The concept was to play on the Bond image but to explain very clearly that this was not James Bond,” she said. “MI6 can take advantage of this Bond image and then turn it on its head”.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Numbers could be down due to stormy or wetter weather as well as changes in the sand eel population, which is one of their staple foods.“So far we’ve surveyed four of the eight islands where we conduct the census. Figures from the two largest islands are vastly contradictory, with numbers on Brownsman 42 per cent down, while recordings on Staple show an 18 per cent increase. We will now do some further investigations as to why this might be.“Predictions have been made that within the next 50 to 100 years these stunning birds will have completely died out on the Farne Islands. The Icelandic population in particular is really struggling, with exceptionally low productivity for over 10 years.UK news in picturesUK news in picturesAlastair Cook batting against Pakistan during the first test match of the summer at Lord’s cricket ground, London.

Due to be released this summer, the\u0026nbspaction plan will be an official response to the survey’s findings.The news comes as the UK falls to fourth in Europe in the Rainbow Index, a yearly ranking of the progress made in LGBT+ rights, having topped the list in 2012.Though given the Conservative Party’s history of dragging their heels on LGBT+ rights, as well as May’s personal history of voting against progressive legal reform, not everyone is convinced. The Labour Party responded by labelling the plan as “empty PR”.Paul Twocock, director of campaigns, policy and research at Stonewall UK, welcomes the Government’s intention to publish an LGBT+ action plan. Stonewall research reveals that 20 per cent of LGBT+ people have experienced a hate crime within the last 12 months. For trans people, this figure increases to a staggering 40 per cent. Paul believes that the action plan, combined with the government’s recently reaffirmed commitment to launching a consultation on reforming the 2004 Gender Recognition Act, will improve life for LGBT+ people in the UK.Both the action plan and reform of the Gender Recognition Act should allow us to make important steps forward towards building a society where LGBT+ people are truly accepted, everywhere and by everyone and it will mean this government can maintain the UK’s impressive record as a world leader on LGBT+ equality.Susie Green, CEO of trans and gender identity charity Mermaids, cites hate crime as a major concern of trans youth. Susie believes that May’s action plan must urgently address this hostility, which is fuelled by sensationalist media coverage.We need stronger controls around media coverage of transgender people, and particular attention needs to be given to the use of online media to perpetuate hate crime. Young people and trans women in particular are targeted on social media, with little done to protect them.Susie would like to see statutory training for all areas of service around transgender children and young people, including schools, social care, police and healthcare. Lesson plans in school covering transgender identities should be mandatory, and included from primary school age.Teachers need to be equipped to deal with conversations around transgender children and young people, which is clearly not the case at present.Concerns over outdated sex and relationships education are also expressed by Liam Beattie, relationships and sex education policy lead at Terrence Higgins Trust. While Wales announced a progressive overhaul of their SRE curriculum, England still lags behind in its approach towards gender and sexuality in the classroom.\u0026nbspBeattie explains that a lack of inclusive sex education at school made him feel “invisible”.LGBT+ sex and relationships must be included when relationships and sex education becomes compulsory in all English schools from next year. Looking back, I’m still angry that I left school completely oblivious to the realities of HIV or the fact that, as a bisexual man, I was at higher risk than my sisters or straight friends.My gaps in knowledge had to be filled through speaking to gay and bi friends or using dating apps. We can’t continue to let young people down like this. The feelings of isolation and shame that follow so many LGBT+ people from childhood to adulthood can have a corrosive impact on their mental health. As a result, LGBT+ people are twice as likely to have a mental health condition compared to heterosexual people. Upon the announcement of May’s action plan, Paul Martin OBE, chief executive at LGBT Foundation, said:LGBT+ people continue to face a significant number of inequalities from poorer physical and mental health, increased risk of hate crime and discrimination, to loneliness and isolation and negative experiences in employment and we hope that a commitment to tackling these key issues will be outlined in the upcoming action plan.To alleviate these inequalities, human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell believes that the LGBT+ action plan must urgently confront homophobia in schools. He says:Nearly half of all LGBT+ pupils have been bullied, often leading to anxiety, depression, truancy, academic under-performance and self-harm.To combat anti-LGBT+ bullying and other forms of hate crime such as racism, the Prime Minister should make equality and ersity lessons mandatory in every school, from the first year of primary education onwards. The health and welfare of pupils must take priority.There should be no opt outs for faith schools and no right of parents to withdraw their kids.\u0026nbspAs Home Secretary, May faced criticism for her handling of asylum claims relating to sexual orientation and gender identity. At present, LGBT+ asylum seekers are still detained indefinitely, despite never having committed a crime. Leila Zadeh, executive director of the UK Lesbian and Gay Immigration Group, told indy100:An action plan to improve the lives of LGBT+ people should include clear and tangible commitments to improving the wellbeing and safety of LGBT+ people who are seeking asylum.As long as LGBT+ asylum seekers can be detained or made to share accommodation, there will be risks to their personal safety. The government should also review the quality of its decisions on asylum applications by LGBT+ people, to ensure none are returned to persecutionNigerian LGBT+ rights activist Bisi Alimi would like to see a national monument commemorating the struggle for LGBT+ rights in the UK. He believes that this will help to imprint the memories of the LGBT+ movement in public consciousness.This monument should put into account the iniduals across race, gender, religion and age that have shaped Britain pre and post Section 28 and should form\u0026nbsppart of the school curriculumThough while there are many voices welcoming the plan, there are also sceptics. Editor-in-chief of Attitude Magazine Cliff Joannou believes that, because of the government’s failure to introduce statutory LGBT+ inclusive relationship and sex education in schools, the legacy of Section 28 looms over schools and local authorities. He tells indy100:For Theresa May to announce her \u0027LGBT Action Plan\u0027\u0026nbspin a gay magazine on the anniversary of Section 28 is both ironic and crass.The government has shied away from tackling LGBT+ discrimination in faith schools, where homophobia and transphobia is most prevalent. Shockingly, conversion therapy is still legal in the UK.While these issues continue to affect young LGBT+ people we will be far away from the equal society that the government likes to fantasise over.Actions speak louder than words, and successive governments have failed to take any action on the very real issues that the LGBT+ community continues to face.More:\u0026nbspWales \u0027leads the way\u0027 with new LGBT-friendly sex education curriculum for next articleWe use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

The European Commission’s negotiators have already rejected the plan before its public announcement, as first revealed by The Independent earlier this week.“The regulatory alignment option is not available on the all-UK basis because it would amount to selective participation on the single market,” the senior EU official said, adding that the backstop “cannot be time limited”.It is incumbent on the UK to take the responsibility for its own decision“A backstop that would be strictly time limited would defeat the purpose of a backstop,” they said, before making clear that the Prime Minister’s plan for a UK-wide backstop would have to be withdrawn if progress is to be made at the June European summit.As well as the main issues of customs and the Irish border, side issues like the European arrest warrant and the Galileo satellite system have made little progress since March too. EU negotiators complain that the British side “do not understand” that Britain will not be able to use the European arrest warrant after Brexit, with Theresa May again having pledged to stay in the system just three months ago.“There are member states that simply cannot extradite their own nationals to a non-member of the EU. This is a constraint that unfortunately will apply once the UK is outside,” the senior official said.“The European arrest warrant is simply not available. I don’t think you can expect member states to change their constitutions in order to continue extraditing their nationals to the UK.“These are not bureaucratic issues. We are talking here about the lives and liberty of citizens. This is not something that can easily be done.”Brussels says the best the UK can hope for is to conclude a separate extradition treaty with the EU, as well as bilateral agreements on procedures like intelligence sharing.The row over Galileo has also been the subject of briefing and counter-briefing by the two sides. British sources briefed newspapers this week that they would demand the UK’s £1bn investment in the project back if British companies were locked out of the project. But EU sources disputed whether this stand had actually been made, describing the claim as “spin”.  The EU says British demands to retain the same access to Galileo as a member state are unreasonable. Though officials say Britain could potentially still use the system, they do not want to give British defence firms the right to build or run parts of it because they say that would effectively give the UK, a third country, the power to turn off the EU system for member states. Officials also pointed out that the UK itself had signed off the security rules restricting non-EU countries from running parts of system, as one of the 28 European Council members, before it knew it was going to leave.David Davis, the Brexit Secretary, who is travelling to Europe to drum up support for the UK to keep access to the satellite system, said: “Today we set out more detail on how we think the UK, as a third country, can continue to cooperate with the EU on security and keep our people safe and prosperous. As I travel around member states I hear how much our partners value the UK commitment to the EU’s security.“A relationship based solely on existing third country precedents, as some seem to be suggesting, would lead to a substantial and avoidable reduction in our shared security capability. Our citizens depend on this, let’s not let them down.”The senior EU official said they shared the UK’s concerns but that “this is a consequence on the UK position and it is incumbent on the UK to take the responsibility for its own decision”.Brexit so far: in picturesBrexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

Officials say mutual recognition is not possible outside the single market, because it would amount to asking “the EU to trust the UK more, with less guarantees, than they trust each other”.Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, has said Theresa May’s red lines mean Britain can only get a free trade agreement similar to the ones the EU has with Canada and South Korea, but the UK said today that this “shallow level of cooperation” was “inconsistent with our ambition”, which would require “a more formal and deeper institutional structure”.A UK Government source said:  “This is their public negotiating position, nothing more, nothing less. We presented 7 papers this week, in the interests of resolving difficult issues in the interests of both sides, so the claim we aren’t providing enough detail is laughable. “The risk is that if they follow down this track, putting conditions on our unconditional offers and trying to insult us, the EU will end up with a relationship with its third biggest economy and largest security partner that lets down millions of citizens in the EU and UK.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Sir Ivan Rogers, the UK’s old ambassador to the EU, was criticised after he advised ministers in 2016 that leaving the EU would take around 10 years. He stepped down from his post shortly after.The EU says under the December agreement just Northern Ireland would stay in full alignment with the single market and customs union to prevent a hard border, while UK negotiators say they actually agreed that the whole UK would do so. The relevant text is somewhat ambiguous as to what was agreed.EU officials do not want the backstop to apply to the whole UK because it would give Britain access to the single market without having to uphold the so-called “four freedom” or submitting to the European Court of Justice. The UK says it cannot accept the backstop only applying to NI because that would create a potential customs border between Great Britain and NI  – which the DUP oppose. Theresa May has relied on the DUP for her majority in the House of Commons since she called an election and lost seats last year.The time-limiting element has now been introduced by the UK because Cabinet Brexiteers like Boris Johnson fear that an indefinite backstop could be a backdoor way of keeping the UK aligned with the EU in perpetuity. Ministers have publicly confirmed that a time-limited backstop is on the way.Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in picturesBrexit threatens life on the Irish border: in picturesJohn Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

The remaining 35 per cent were uncertain.There was more good news for Mrs May when considering the fate of the UK-based workforce itself. When asked whether British workers will become \u0026ldquoless talented and skilled after Brexit, 39 per cent of respondents disagreed while just 31 per cent agreed.And while 35 per cent of people agreed they were \u0026ldquoworried about the lack of up-skilling of the UK workforce after Brexit, 36 per cent said they were unsure while a further 29 per cent said they did not agree.Outside of London\u0026rsquos Remain bubble, confidence in the UK\u0026rsquos economic future was particularly high.When asked \u0026ldquodo you believe high-skilled jobs will leave the UK for the EU?, 37 per cent of respondents in London said yes.This figure shrunk to 33 per cent in Manchester, 32 per cent in Glasgow, 29 per cent in Newcastle and just 19 per cent in Birmingham - where Brexiteers outnumbered Remainers in June 2016\u0026rsquos in-out referendum.The poll also showed a difference of opinions when broken down by gender.

This implies leaving its programmes as well.\u0026ldquoWe need to put the cooperation on Galileo between the EU and the UK on a new basis.The Frenchman added: \u0026ldquoThe EU\u0027s rules on Galileo have been in place for a long time, and are well known to the UK.\u0026ldquoIn particular, third countries and their companies cannot participate in the development of security sensitive matters, such as the manufacturing of PRS-security modules. \u0026ldquo"},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/128/183x122/918057_1.jpg","title":"kitten starved burned sold app","story":"Nimbus - who looks like fluffy clouds - was rescued by Battersea Dogs and Cats Home after a new owner realised he was far younger than advertised.The tiny kitten highlights the charity\u0027s campaign against unregulated online pet sales.Shaun Opperman, Battersea\u0027s head vet, said: Nimbus was far too young to be separated from his mother when he was sold online.He came into us in a terrible state as he couldn\u0027t clean himself properly.

and it went up to £7.38 from April 1, 2018.The wage increased from £5.60 to £5.90 for 18 to 20-year-olds, and from £4.05 to £4.20 for under 18s.However, apprentices were only entitled to £3.50 if they are under-19 - this increased to £3.70 from April 1, 2018.In April 2018, the minimum wage for 25-year-olds rose from £7.50 to £7.83 an hour.The national limits are legally binding.Anyone who thinks they are not getting the National Living Wage or National Minimum Wage should complain to their employer in the first instance.If this does not get anywhere, the next step is to take the complaint to HMRC who will investigate.Those who are self-employed, voluntary workers, company directors and family members who live in the home of the employer and do household chores do not qualify for either rate.There is no difference in pay for those that live in London compared to elsewhere.The only discrepancy is for people working in agriculture or horticulture.Workers already employed before October 1, 2013 are entitled to the pay set under their contract of employment.This is a voluntary scheme aiming to recognise the actual cost of living, to which 3,000 employers have signed up.Under it, the lowest rate of pay is calculated according to the cost of living in the UK based on the changing cost of a basket of groceries.The amount is set by the charity Living Wage Foundation, and accredited employers include local authorities, NHS trusts, banks, retailers, charities and construction companies.The foundations calculations put the real Living Wage at £8.75 an hour - and £10.20 in London.These rates also apply to over-18s in recognition that young people face the same living costs as everyone else.And while companies are not legally entitled to pay more than the National Living and Minimum Wages, those which have signed up to the real Living Wage scheme have pledged to pay all workers those rates.The rate is calculated every November, and accredited employers are committed to any increases.While theres no legal obligation for your employer to pay you more than the National Living Wage (£7.50 from April 1, 2017), if your company is accredited by the Living Wage Foundation you should be receiving more than that.The foundations head of partnerships Graham Griffiths said anyone concerned can use their online whistleblowing service, and any employer not adhering to the Real Living Wage faced losing its accreditation.Graham said one area where it was challenging to pay the living wage were retail and hospitality but pointed to Ikea, Aldi and Lidl, which have agreed to pay the same rate.The scheme was launched in 2001 by parents in East London, and the foundation was set up in 2011.In 2005 following a growing interest from employers, the Greater London Authority established the Living Wage Unit to calculate what the lowest pay should ideally be.In 2008 Trust for London selected the scheme as a special initiative and made a grant of more than £1million to campaign for it and set up an accreditation scheme for employers.In April 2016 it became the inspiration for the governments higher minimum wage rate, which it rebranded the National Living Wage.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Nobody would believe that.Yet the happy couple set aside family rows, petty jealousies and drunken sabotage and basked in the warm embrace of an adoring public.Windsor’s Disney-style ceremony was watched in broad daylight north of the equator and the middle of the night Down Under by happy viewers of all races and creeds.There is a message here for us all.Harry and Meghan’s wedding did more than unite this nation in sympathy and affection for a popular prince and the love of his life. It showed this country is world class.The sub-plot, of course, was the emotional union between the damaged children of two broken families.Fans have long yearned for Prince Harry to find happiness after the roller-coaster life and shocking death of his fabled mother, Princess Diana.They have warmed to a young man who transformed himself from a mixed-up kid to a likeable soldier, helicopter pilot and champion of war-damaged Invictus casualties.As for his bride, Meghan Markle is the glamorous star of hit TV series Suits, who dreamed as a child of becoming a princess.Best of all in this age of right-on political correctness, she is the daughter of a charming African-American mother and an Emmy-winning Hollywood lighting specialist.The House of Windsor is now truly multicultural.It is also hip.Our amazing sovereign, at 92, and doughty Prince Philip, 96, both heading for their royal telegrams, are the Queen and King of Cool.Where else in the world would you see an Elton John double act with Windy City preacher Bishop Michael Curry?This was a truly uplifting occasion, worn lightly by a once-stuffy Royal Family.Nobody does it better when it comes to choreographing mounted cavalry, trumpets, banners and horse-drawn carriages with an electric-powered E-Type and a vintage Rolls-Royce.All underscored by a sense of humour, as Harry and his supportive brother William exchanged banter at the altar of Windsor’s historic St George’s Chapel.Even the weather turned out in tribute, bathing Windsor Great Park’s glorious greenery in spring sunshine.There may have been some muffled coughs over Markle family squabbles but they were nothing compared with the torrid dramas leading to the Queen’s own “annus horribilis”.The world has become used to British pageantry.But this Royal Wedding was a timely reminder that Britain is not just a small island with a fading history on the edge of Europe.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex ride in a carriage down The Long Walk back towards Windsor Castle after getting married in St Georges Chapel, WindsorThe 21st-century United Kingdom is an unrivalled brand on the global stage.The world was witnessing more than mere pomp and circumstance.This was UK plc on international parade, joining hands with the global community in a way no other nation can match — even the mighty USA.Had Meghan married into the family of a French or American president, a German Chancellor or a Kremlin tsar, would anyone have tuned in?Neither China nor Russia could captivate so many friendly eyeballs.The Olympics might do it.But London 2012 revealed Britain is best on these occasions, too.On Saturday, Britain proved it is capable of reaching out to a world beyond borders.Harry and Meghan’s marriage bonded the UK indelibly with the US.If the new Duke and Duchess have kids, they will be American citizens — as well as British due to Harry’s lineage — and will eventually be liable to American tax.Importantly, this wedding had special significance for the 2.5billion citizens of 52 Commonwealth countries, especially in Africa and the Caribbean, who swear allegiance to the Queen.My Australian in-laws were constantly on the phone from Sydney this weekend, all thoughts of becoming a republic abandoned, to discuss the finer points of royal protocol.But this event was watched from lands with no current ties to Britain — South America, the Far East and the Gulf States.It was a showcase of modern Britain forever adapting to change, the key to our success as an outward-looking nation.There was a clear hint of defiance, too. This steely couple were doing it their way.Our Brexit negotiators — on both sides of the argument — should take note.That big wide world, viewing us in high definition on Saturday, is where Britain’s future lies.These are our markets.The audience liked what they saw and they want some of what we’re having.In marketing terms alone, it was priceless.Too often we underestimate our strength and standing.We have developed an absurd inferiority complex.We’ve been led to believe we are too weak and puny to stand alone on the global stage.Yet we are among the world’s greatest economies, second only to Germany in the EU.We are a nuclear power with a real professional army which has helped keep the peace in Europe, and have an envied place on the UN Security Council.Republican lefties despise all this stuff.They smear Britain’s record as a brutal colonial power while ignoring our global lead in abolishing slavery.Disturbingly, some Conservatives seem to agree the UK is washed up and past its prime.Since we cannot run our own economy, they say, we should hand the job to unelected bureaucrats in Brussels.These, remember, would be the same Brussels flunkies who created the euro, wrecked the economies of member states and put millions of unemployed young people on the scrap heap.Most of those workless youngsters gratefully upped sticks and moved here.I wonder why?Saturday’s Royal Wedding showed we are in the Premier League.Now the world is watching, perhaps with slightly less enthusiasm, as another British saga lurches towards its climax — another broken family consumed with jealousy and bent on revenge.The cast is familiar — the statutory drunk, a bully who prefers to talk with a gun in his hand, some characters who would prefer a car crash to a happy ending.Can we stop the bickering and reach a good Brexit deal?Why can’t the Leavers and Remainers put the country first, join hands, bury their differences and take a vow to work together to serve the national interest?Inspired by the Royal Wedding, by the poem Invictus, we can rise above petty differences.“We are the masters of our fate: We are the captains of our soul.”Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Oh well.Most married couples leave it 18 months before they reach that arrangement.But on that bombshell it was on with the Royal Wedding, which normally divides the nation into two distinct camps.There are the royalists, who have great fun watching all the pomp and pageantry on television.And the republicans, who have great fun hating all the pomp and pageantry on television.So the only real choice to be made, for all of us, is: Which channel?Personally, six hours of a photobombing Kay Burley giving it the full Partridge on Sky News was a punishment that’s way beyond me, as was five hours of the E! channel gang ­yelling: “Oh my God. Wow!”ITV was never going to be anything less than thoroughly professional in the hands of Julie Etchingham and Phillip Schofield, once he shut up about Holly Willoughby, so I went with the Beeb, where Naga called it a night shortly after announcing Prince Harry was now: “The Duke of Essex.”Oi! Oi! “Sussex rather.” Oh. Pity.The real surprise for some of you, though, might have been discovering that to give it an informal vibe, ­alongside Kirsty Young, BBC1’s 9am-and-beyond coverage was now being fronted by the strangely contorted ­figure of Dermot O’Leary — the former host of ITV’s The Marriage Ref.A show that may have been the ­perfect rehearsal for most royal ­weddings, but probably not this one.They weren’t alone, obviously.The Beeb had the joint surrounded, in fact, by among others Huw Edwards, ­fashion expert Jo Elvin, who was “across the dress” (as clueless as the rest of us), Alex Jones, Ore Oduba and Anita Rani, who performed the ­essential task of repeating what the other person had just said.Ore: “First glimpse of the dress, it’s going to be a moment.”Anita: “It’s going to be a moment.” Traditionally, of course, on these great state occasions, the moment TV crews start interviewing other TV crews is the cue for the coverage to descend into flannel, repetition, idle speculation, cliche (“Excitement’s ­building”), imponderable questions and outright stupidity.On Saturday, by slight contrast, the trigger was actually the arrival of Oprah Winfrey and the first trickle of celebrity guests, who had a clearly ­nervous ­Dermot asking: “When the invite says ‘hats’, does that mean hats are an absolute given?”“Absolutely, it does,” said Kirsty, slapping him down testily.It got progressively worse with each arrival as well.So by the time Amal Clooney wafted in alongside husband George, who was dressed as one of Modern Romance, even basic motor tasks seemed beyond some of the BBC team.Kirsty: “It can be difficult to wear a hat, can’t it?”Jo: “I think so, yes.”In fairness, it should also be stated this idiocy was certainly not restricted to the BBC.I switched over to ITV during the ­arrivals and heard Meghan’s old drama teacher, Gigi Perreau, say: “This is incredible and we’re right there. Well, we’re here but we’re also there, so it’s fabulous.”It’s just the nature of the beast.With so much time to fill, everyone will say these things.Only the BBC, though, could possibly leave me feeling queasy with the choice of one of its Royal Wedding experts.This was left-wing “social commentator” Afua Hirsch, who was privately educated and has led a life of unimaginable advantage, compared to most of us, but is also a professional victim who thinks pretty much ­everything is “racist”, wants Nelson’s Column torn down and wasn’t about to drop her agenda with such a large audience at her mercy.“While I have felt alienated by the inherited privilege,” said Afua, who’s enjoyed more than most, “my own struggles with identity have made me appreciate the need for cultural ­continuity.“So while I didn’t relate to the Royal Family, I did relate to that need for a sense of tradition.”Quite a brass neck, isn’t it, speaking out against the whole concept of the Royal Family, while simultaneously using them to increase your TV profile, as Afua had been doing all week.Instead of telling her so, or pointing out Harry’s ex Chelsy Davy had arrived while she was guffing away, a nodding Dermot said he could listen to Afua “all day”.A claim I doubt, frankly.Indeed, I reckon he’d have been throwing himself off Windsor Castle’s ramparts before breakfast if he’d tried.No one else, I suspect though, was listening to a single word she said.Nor will they have needed Afua’s lofty approval to enjoy a day filled with so many memorable events, including Bishop Michael Curry’s fiery address to the congregation, the ­reappearance of the Duke of Edinburgh and Meghan’s Rolls-Royce ­hurtling up the Long Walk past 100,000 Union Flags like it was being driven by Richard Hammond.These are all magical moments you’ll possibly want to watch again — and if you do, having sat through both start to finish, I’d probably recommend the ITV version.It had the better ­historic detail, was never in any danger of missing Chelsy Davy’s arrival and rounded everything off nicely as well.Over on the BBC, meanwhile, Kirsty did it by searching for profundities and going where angels feared to tread.“Something has travelled between Harry and Meghan that might be the next page of the story, where they give us a gorgeous little product of their union which we might enjoy too . . . ?”Though not if Naga’s honeymoon arrangements are to be believed, they won’t.Obviously.Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Later, I went back with him after he had built a night school for the boys, and asked over a cup of tea: “Why are you doing this, Harry?”He replied: “This is the most important thing I do.”It tells you everything about who his mother was.Inside the Chapel, the hymn was Guide Me, O Thou Great Redeemer, which was played at Princess Diana’s funeral and one of her favourites.Di’s sister Lady Jane Fellowes delivered the only reading. Listening to it was Sarah, the Duchess of York, who had not been invited to other recent royal weddings.Inviting Fergie was a brilliant thing to do. During Diana’s troubled times every Sunday she would drive down to Berkshire to have lunch with Fergie, spending the afternoon talking about their divorces.Outside in the Chapel courtyard were 2,000 people from Harry and Meghan’s charities, including servicemen who have lost limbs.Harry is following Diana’s hugely successful campaign to stop landmines by working with those who have been wounded by IEDs.When Harry was flying back from one of his tours of Afghanistan he shared the plane with three soldiers who were in a coma.He realised these soldiers, if they recovered, would have limbs missing and facing a life of misery — which is why he inspired them with his support for the Invictus Games.And Harry and Meghan asked guests to make donations to the Children’s HIV Association.Harry has clearly never forgotten how his mother took the stigma out of Aids by embracing sufferers, including babies in Brazil.And then there was the ring. On Saturday night Meghan was wearing the emerald-cut aquamarine ring Diana first wore in 1996.Harry once told ITV’s Tom Bradby: “I wanted to do something that would make my mother proud.” He succeeded on Saturday.Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I’ve not sold it and that’s all I’m saying.”According to eBay rules, bids can only be retracted within one hour if there is less than 12 hours in the auction to go. The decision to allow a bid to be cancelled is up to the seller.Payment is only received once the winning bidder officially confirms the transaction - with funds usually transferred by PayPal.Claire was one of the 1,200 non-VIP­ members of the public invited to share in Meghan and Harry’s big day outside St Georges Chapel on Saturday.Sharing her excitement, she tweeted: I got to watch the royal wedding right outside Windsor Castle in this amazing setting. Such an amazing day #Golden ticket #Royal connections.But while some have accused Claire of cashing in - others are also alleged to have taken advantage.The hessian sacks, inscribed with the royal couples initials, contained a welcome letter, commemorative chocolate coin, bottled Windsor Castle water, fridge magnet, official order of service and a tin of shortbread.One seller called Chrisofwilliams, from Merthyr Tydfil, Wales, stands to make more than £40,000 after putting his commemorative bag on eBay.The gift was initially listed for 99p on Sunday, with the seller saying: Buy a piece of history and memorabilia to celebrate a momentous special day for Britain’s and the royal family.I am selling my limited Goody bag for guests of Royal wedding of Meghan and Harry 19th May 2018.Official bag with full contents containing commemorative chocolate coin unopened sealed and in original condition, labelled spring water bottle unopened and sealed in original condition: royal wedding fridge magnet unopened in original packaging, the castle spectator badge and a tub of ‘handbag shortbread’ unopened as well as a Marriage order of service booklet and a 20% off voucher of middle ward shop in Windsor castle.Don’t miss out on this limited once in a life time opportunity to have a piece of royal history.”The hessian gift bag was given to the 2,640 guests who were invited to the wedding of the year.But many saw the monetary value in flogging off the bag, selling it online.So what does the bag actually contain? - Bottle of Windsor Castle Still Spring Water 500mL- Harry and Meghan Traditiaionl Handbag Shortbread Biscuits- Royal Wedding 2018 Belgian Milk Chocolate Coin 90g- Royal Wedding Commemorative Magnet- Voucher for royalcollectionshopAnother online listing has reached £420 while another hit £411.One of of the listings, the seller declared proudly: “At the wedding today I received this wonderful gift bag for guests.”And the post promised: “I forgot to mention all money raised will go to charity.”Another seller has even been trying to flog PDFs of the Royal Wedding order of service - for £5 each.As the non-VIP guests departed on Saturday the wedding reception turned into an ­outrageous party with a very royal dance-off and “beer pong” games. The Sun can reveal that chat-show superstar James Corden — who was compering the event — instigated an extraordinary dance routine which featured Prince Charles, Prince William and Harry.The royal couple chose I Wanna Dance With Somebody as their first dance at the fun-filled, early-hours wedding bash.Harry, 33, and Meghan, 36 — now the Duke and ­Duchess of Sussex — let their hair down to the hit by Whitney Houston at Frogmore House, Windsor, where telly’s Corden hosted dinner and fireworks for 200 guests.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So is Her Majesty the Queen. They haven’t felt the need to label themselves as such we know from their actions.As the basic scriptwriting rule dictates, show don’t tell.To her credit, Meghan Markle championed many charitable causes that advocate female empowerment before she met Prince Harry, and no one is suggesting she shouldn’t continue with this work.But what grates about the above statement is the unsaid inference that here is a feisty, independent woman who, unshackled by pomp, ceremony and dutiful political impartiality, is going to drag the stuffy, deluded old monarchy kicking and screaming into the 21st century.That this go-get-’em gal from the US of A is going to shake things up with a few bumper-sticker sentiments and teach those Brits a thing or two about how the world works.Or perhaps we should leave it to Patrick Jephson, former private secretary to Princess Diana, a man very much in the know on the inner workings of the House of Windsor.In his book, The Meghan Factor, he says: “The one key skill Meghan absolutely must perfect is how to avoid being seen as any kind of a destabilising force. It’s a useful guideline when weighing the pros and cons of any intended course of action, from saving a local playgroup, to saving an endangered species, to saving the planet. What always comes first is saving the monarchy.”Quite. In other words, don’t get up the collective nose of the British public or they might just, ahem, pick it and flick you off into oblivion.As we saw on Saturday, as Bishop Michael Curry’s address entered what felt like its third decade, The Queen’s resolutely impassive expression suggests she’d make a fine poker player.We have no idea what she thought of it, nor Donald Trump, Brexit or the highly political Me Too campaign. She has opinions, of course. But what she doesn’t do is wear them like a badge.Just like her great-great-grandmother Victoria, who advocated “never complain, never explain”, The Queen knows the future of the monarchy lies in being a non-political figurehead who promotes national unity.Jephson adds: “If you acquire a profile, a purpose and a passionate public devotion independent of the royal mainstream, then you risk being perceived and presented as a threat to the Crown itself.”We already know what Meghan thinks about an awful lot of things, because her life so far can’t be edited.We also know that her soapbox has just got bigger thanks to her new status which, to those unused to it, could foster the corrosive misconception that everyone is hanging off your every word.Read my pursed lips: They’re not. They’re just being polite.So Meghan must learn fast that she’s a very minor cog in an ancient royal machine that has survived so long by saying nothing and doing its duty to its loyal subjects.Frustrating that may be for a “feminist” (or, indeed a manist), but that’s the trade-off for the largely taxpayer-funded life of luxury that is granted, not self-generated.As a celebrity, you can say what you like and we can choose to listen or not. But opinions divide people and, as a royal, you are supposed to represent everyone.Meghan needs to understand, and implement, that distinction sooner rather than later.HUMAN rights lawyer Amal Clooney was officially crowned “best-dressed guest” by fashionistas observing the Royal Wedding.According to one, she was “a sublime vision in marigold”, though personally speaking, Colman’s Mustard yellow might be more accurate.Either way, Ms Clooney once again proved adept at pulling focus from the other mere mortals floundering in her ever-stylish slipstream.By contrast, the Duchess of Cambridge’s understated, Alexander McQueen frock coat got a sniffier reception from certain fashion quarters, not least because she’s worn it three times before.They’re missing the point.A wedding is about the bride, not the guests.And Kate understood that perfectly by wearing something that wouldn’t propel her into the limelight on Meghan’s big day.Now that’s style.THOSE attending Chelsea Flower Show (no, me neither) have declared that “she-sheds” are the latest must-have – kitted out with radiators, chandeliers and squishy sofas.Alternatively, we could have all that inside the house and just send the other half out into the garden.AN Islamic school in Birmingham has warned female pupils against using tampons.The guidance, adopted as school policy, states: “Among the types of pads, tampons may not be appropriate due to insertion.”But the head of the school insists it has “no connection to faith”.Hmmmm. Meanwhile, it has emerged that women are having “virginity restoring” operations on the NHS at a cost of £1,000 a time.The 30-minute procedure involves the hymen – which can break after using tampons, doing sport or having sex for the first time – being stitched or reconstructed.One relationship counsellor suggested that one of the reasons was that some religious women were “over- whelmed” by feelings of sexual guilt and wanted to be “as pure as possible again” for their husband.Want to? Or are forced to by religiously driven, moral expectations not placed on the man they’re marrying?Either way, is this really something the NHS should be funding when money for other, more vital, operations is so scarce?MEMO to Sir Anthony Hopkins: Yes, families do fall out and just because you’re related doesn’t mean you have to like each other.But saying you “don’t care one way or the other” whether your 48-year-old daughter Abigail has children or not seems overly cold and perhaps partly explains your 20-year estrangement.In future, a simple, “We don’t speak and I’d rather not go in to it”, might be wiser.HOW come, in this age of state-of-the-art camera phones, when anyone spots the Loch Ness monster, beast of Bodmin Moor or any of the other fearsome creatures supposedly roaming our shores, the evidential photo is always out of focus?Exhibit A: The “lion” spotted in Oldbury in the West Midlands this week.Yep.

It’s the uncertainty caused by Remain diehards in the Commons and Lords bent on scuppering it and even destroying our Government.It is destabilising for firms not to know what Brexit will look like. If Theresa May formed a position fully honouring the result, and told the EU to like it or lump it, the unease would end overnight.Our economy would take off like a rocket.IT is disgraceful that Google is revealing rape victims’ names via the “autocomplete” function on its searches.

The Government must think again so that people don’t fall into debt or are left at risk of losing their home.”Lib Dem MP Stephen Lloyd added: “These lamentable figures show that thousands of people have still not responded to the significant changes on mortgage interest loans being pushed by the DWP.This is yet another cack-handed benefit change by the Tories which is wholly unnecessary, and is already causing anxiety amongst some of our most disadvantaged, marginalised citizens.The DWP said that any SMI claimants who havent got a phone call about the change will still get the benefit for at least six more weeks.Those affected are urged to contact the official hotline on 0800 731 0459 for pensioners or 0800 169 0310 for anyone of working age.A spokesman said: Over time, someone’s house is likely to increase in value, so it’s reasonable that anyone who has received financial help towards their mortgage should be asked to pay that back.“Everyone who signs up to the loan will continue to get help with their mortgage interest, and it’s only repayable if there is available equity when the property is sold.“If people decide to decline the loan now but change their mind in future the loan can be backdated so in effect there would be no break in payments.“We have already contacted everyone currently in receipt of SMI to explain the change but we are making sure people have time to review the documents, obtain advice and consider their options."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000283428196.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"burn wood they said itll be green they said how the eco freaks got us all wheezing","story":"Pollution in our cities is worse than it’s been for many years. The way things are going you could give your kids 20 Rothmans a day and they wouldn’t be much worse off than they already are.And the reason for this is a genuine scandal. A real eye-opener. It shows what happens when people in authority take notice of the people who know absolutely nothing. The Green lobby. The eco-freaks. The obsessive loons. The climate change fanatics.If you’re middle class, you’ve probably got one. They’ve become incredibly popular in the last decade.Trouble is they spew out enormous amounts of something called PM2.5 particles. That’s soot to you and me.They’re the major cause of soot in our cities and the main reason everyone you know is gasping for breath.We’re about to be sued by the European Union because pollution from these stoves is way above acceptable limits.But why do we have them?Because at the behest of the green movement, the government encouraged us all to have them. Burning wood is much better, they said, than gas or coal or oil. Renewable! Doesn’t churn out as much CO2!No, it just churns out lethal amounts of soot. Billions of pounds were spent by our government on a scheme to convert us to renewable heating systems.The brainchild of the disgraced Lib Dem halfwit Chris Huhne. Millions more was spent converting one of our biggest power stations to woodchip. The wood is shipped over 3,500 miles from the US (there’s eco-friendly for you). And it’s all made everything a lot, lot, worse as a consequence.Then there are diesel cars. You may have one. The government is getting tough on those, too.It’s now been discovered that they are much more polluting than petrol cars. It’s another major cause of pollution in our towns and cities.So why do we have them? Because the idiotic Greens told us to. Back in 2001 the Labour government offered tax breaks on diesel cars. Everyone rushed to buy one.A member of that Labour government has now ’fessed up and said it was the wrong decision, no question.But they wanted their Green credentials.And just look what trouble it has caused — 37,800 more deaths every year in this country simply as a consequence of those wood burning stoves. It is close to unbelievable.I wonder what the Greens will come up with next as an idea to save the planet.Maybe we should burn magpies, or sour cream and chive Pringles, or our own trousers.The truth is they haven’t got the remotest idea. They urge these measures upon us without the slightest notion of what might happen as a consequence.And the problem is that important people take them seriously. Governments, for example.And we end up paying through the nose for their idiocies — and then, a little later, gasping for breath.The wood burning stove business should convince all members of Parliament. Never listen to a green.No matter how nice he or she might seem. Just ignore them. They’re bad for your health.WHAT a shame – Roman Abramovich can’t get back into the country because we haven’t cleared his visa. So he’s sitting on his yacht somewhere, getting snippy. I’m not sure why we let Roman in in the first place.You don’t get his kind of money by being lovely to everybody, do you?First we helped wreck the Russian economy in the early 1990s by plundering its state run industries. Then we opened the doors to a whole bunch of Russkie gangsters – sorry, oligarchs – with boats the size of Poland. Anyway, I’ll probably end up glowing like a Belisha beacon just for writing this.BROADCASTER Dan Snow has admitted he lies to his daughters.He’s told them that during the war there were loads of female Spitfire pilots. Zooming around, shooting down krauts. He says he doesn’t want them to feel limited by their gender. He should have gone further. Told them that back then Britain was led by a nice lady called Winnie.And that the first person up Everest was a little girl called Hillary. And as for that Ada Hitler . . .THE Iraqis are executing the IS jihadi brides. Loads of them.Some of them are whining that they had no idea their husbands were evil Islamists. One of them said she thought she was marrying a rapper.Yeah, right love. We’ve got a few here, mind.Women who went out to join IS and then thought better of it. They’re lucky we won’t extradite them to Iraq.HEY – got your Royal Wedding gift bag yet? Guests to the wedding are flogging them on eBay for as little as £20,000. Hell of a bargain. I’ve got a bid in on one right now. It says it contains:I’VE got a bit of a soft spot for Victoria Beckham. She’s been criticised for not smiling at the wedding of Harry and Meghan.Some people have suggested Posh Spice was looking a bit grim because David had been out on the pull again. Nah. She wasn’t smiling because, basically, she’s a miserable cow.And I like that. Why should she have to wander around grinning like a village idiot?Keep the sulk and the pout, Vikki, love. Plus I liked what she was wearing at the bash. She was dressed as if for the funeral of someone she didn’t know very well. She looked great.SO, all four of the great American authors are dead. Both Tom Wolfe and Philip Roth died this week.Saul Bellow and the finest of them all, John Updike are already dead.These gentlemen were my heroes when I was growing up. But how long will they be remembered?Updike is already unfashionable on account of his alleged sexism. Wolfe and Bellow were quite right-wing, so the literary critics will quickly consign their books to the “dead white male” rubbish bin of history. And as a consequence, we will have lost an awful lot.Keep their work alive, whatever the critics tell you.

In the end, she went and promised Harry she wouldn’t try and gatecrash the party.”Harry’s call may have been weighing on Chelsy’s mind as she took her place among other guests in St George’s Chapel on Saturday, as cameras caught her pulling a bit of grimace during the service.Even the BBC Three Twitter account made light of the situation, writing when your ex turns up to your wedding.While other viewers poked fun with a series of memes suggesting that Chelsy was jealous or could even shout out objections while the Arch Bishop of Canterbury was officiating.Harry and Zimbabwean-born Chelsy hit it off when they were both students at boarding school.She even met the Queen at a society wedding and was a guest at Prince Charles 60th, as her relationship with Harry became more serious.But law student Chelsy had struggled with the pressure of dating a royal in the spotlight and the couple split.She told the Times: It was so full-on.

Yes, of course.“We understand the UK covers 12 per cent of the costs of the budget of the Galileo programme, and I really do think that the security risks that are ahead demand a very strong cooperation between the UK and the European Union.”In a second Brexit paper published yesterday, Britain also warns the EU that a failure to agree a strong internal security partnership will put lives at risk across the continent.If the EU insists on treating the UK like any other ‘third country’ rather than a special partner, more than 30 crime fighting measures from the European Arrest Warrant to the system to tackle football hooliganism will collapse.In a bid to turn EU states against commission bosses in Brussels, Brexit Secretary David Davis said: “As I travel around Member States I hear how much our partners value the UK commitment to the EU’s security.“A relationship based solely on existing third country precedents, as some seem to be suggesting, would lead to a substantial and avoidable reduction in our shared security capability.“Our citizens depend on this, let’s not let them down.”Mrs May’s stand on Galileo won cross party support last night.Even the pro-EU Lib Dems backed her, with the party’s defence spokesman Menzies Campbell saying it “makes no sense for the security of Europe” for Britain to be shut out of Galileo.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I have my ears pierced, I cry at the end of The Greatest Showman and I enjoy shopping for clothes.Everyone has the right to say how they want the world to see them. Everyone has the right to be happy with themselves.Goodness knows there’s enough things to be unhappy about. You shouldn’t be one of them.But the Labour Party has now decided that anyone who says they are a woman is eligible for political roles that are for women only. They do not ask for any more proof than that.As a Labour member and a woman on Wednesdays, that means I am eligible to stand for one of those roles.So, when the position of Women’s Officer came up for election, I decided to apply. The post involves encouraging women to join the party and speak for women and their experiences - and can only be held by women.Standing for the position was a chance for me to talk about self-identification with my local Party and bring my concerns to their attention.Of course, I was not expecting to win, but I was ready to do the job if I did.I was happy to let people make a democratic, informed choice.Women are worried that letting men say they are women without any checks is dangerous.There is a fear that some men will identify as women just so they can go into changing rooms or loos and spy on or attack women.Women also say that it will affect women’s rights to dignity and privacy, for example on women-only hospital wards or in shelters.Those are also real concerns, but a small minority of people don’t want them to be talked about.They call feminists like Germaine Greer - who has said transgender women are not women - out-of-touch or get angry when people yell out body parts or facts on TV.Those people are stopping a very important debate. I don’t feel that’s right.And self-identification is not just Labour’s position.Nearly every political party in the UK says that the Gender Recognition Act should be changed so that anyone can legally change their sex just by saying they are a man or a woman.The Labour Party made their decision so they could be ahead of the change to the law.Some trans people say that the current requirements set out by the GRA are humiliating and difficult to cope with on top of living their lives. That is a real concern and one that has to be listened to.However, I don’t agree with the idea that you should be able to legally change your sex just by saying you want to.It ignores the very real struggles that trans people face every day.It says that I have had the same life experience as people such as the L’Oreal and Playboy model Munroe Bergdorf, journalist and TV presenter Paris Lees and Lily Madigan - a transgender schoolgirl who was sent home from school for wearing a girls uniform.It says that their life-long fight to feel right in their bodies is the same as me identifying as a woman once a week.I can’t begin to imagine what their journeys have been like, but I know those journeys need to be recognised by more than just words.Following a recent meeting of Woman’s Place UK in Basingstoke, I talked with a reporter about my nomination for the Womens Officer role. The article that he wrote led to the Labour Party suspending me yesterday, with immediate effect.I am not allowed to attend meetings or stand for election and there will be an investigation.They seem to think that I am not enough of a woman.Some people online think the same. I have to ask the question, how much more of a woman would I need to be?I hope that what I did shows we need the debate on gender identity.We need to find the common ground so that trans people can live as they want to, while allowing women the dignity, privacy and safety that they deserve.We are all here thanks to women, so let’s talk to them.Really? I mean, really? I first came across David Lewis smug grinning face in a magazine earlier this week. Announcing he was a woman from morn to midnight on Wednesdays and boasting that he is changing nothing. Not his clothes. Not his routine. Not his womanly beard.Why? Because 15 minutes of fame. Because trans rights has gone too far. Because proposed law changes.He is not trans: has no idea what it is to be trans.The situation he is describing does not happen and has not happened anywhere, except when anti-trans campaigners break the law to make a point.Being trans is not fashion, trend or choice. Mocking transness in this dishonest way hurts people.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There were just 78,000 Romanians living in the UK in 2010, putting it 15th below Bangladesh.Separate Home Office figures today revealed 148,000 National Insurance registrations were given out to Romanians in the year to March - a third of all those handed out to EU nationals.The Home Office said the number of foreign national offenders removed in the 12 months to March fell 11 per cent to 5,630.Last year, Romania threatened to block Brexit altogether unless Theresa May gave its country’s residents a guarantee of UK citizenship.The first Romanian to arrive in the UK to work after Mr Cameron relaxed controls – Victor Spirescu – died in a car crash this January.The man – dubbed the “poster boy” for Romanian immigration – was found to have taken cocaine when he lost control of a car near Newport Pagnell."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000408598175.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"extremist corbyn is unfit for power because hes rejected mainstream politics says one of his own mps","story":"Moderate Ian Austin blasted the extreme views held by his party leader and accused him of hijacking Labour.The MP pointed to Mr Corbyns links to terror groups such as the IRA, Hezbollah and Hamas.And he also ripped into the leaders weak stance on anti-Semitism and Russia.Mr Austin, the MP for Dudley North, wrote on PoliticsHome: The fact is that Labour has never in its history had a leadership as far to the left as this one.

The number of Romanian nationals living in the UK in 2017 was estimated to be 411,000 - a jump of 25% on the previous year, and the largest increase for any country. Polish remains the most common non-British nationality, with an estimated one million in the UK. Romania has overtaken the Republic of Ireland and India to move from fourth to second place in the list. Some 350,000 Irish nationals lived in the UK in 2017, while there were 346,000 Indians.  The figures, from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), show the total number of non-British nationals living in the UK in 2017 was 6.2 million, up 4% on 2016\u0027s total of six million.  This is a smaller rise than that recorded between 2015 and 2016, when the number rose by 8%. Nicola White of the ONS migration statistics division said: Non-UK born and non-British populations continued to increase in 2017, as more people continued to come to the UK to live than move to live abroad for a year or more. Poland-born residents and Polish nationals were the most common populations from outside the UK. However, the largest increases in population were seen from those born in Romania and those with Romanian nationality.  The figures show that 3.8 million (61%) of the 6.2 million non-British nationals living in the UK in 2017 held EU nationality. This is roughly the same proportion as 2016 (60%). London had the largest proportion of non-British nationals in 2017, with the highest numbers in the local authorities of Newham (38%), Westminster (36%) and Brent (34%).

The shock audio was released on YouTube today in what appears to be an extraordinary breach of UK national security. Mr Johnson was scrupulously diplomatic through most of the call, which he used to condemn Russia\u0027s behaviour, vow a crackdown on oligarchs and talk about the poisoning of Sergei Skripal. But the UK Foreign Secretary then persistently asked for more detail when told about fake claims that the Kremlin had given money to Jeremy Corbyn. And he confirmed that ex-spy Skripal and his daughter Yulia are both still in the UK, though he didn\u0027t specify where. The video was tweeted today by Russian pranksters Alexei Stolyarov and Vladimir Kuznetsov, who style themselves Lexus and Vovan. A Foreign Office spokesman confirmed it was real, saying: The Foreign Secretary realised it was a hoax, and ended the call. We checked it out and knew immediately it was a prank call. The use of chemical weapons in Salisbury and Syria, and recent events in Armenia are serious matters. These childish actions show the lack of seriousness of the caller and those behind him. Critics claim the pair have links to the Russian security services and a senior UK diplomatic source said: This seems to be the latest desperate attempt by the Kremlin to save face after it was internationally shamed in the wake of the Skripal attack.  Boris rumbled them pretty quickly and ended the call. It is tragic to see a major international power reduced to failed pranks you would usually only see on Trigger Happy TV. Armenia, located in the sensitive eastern bloc near Georgia and the Russian border, elected its new Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan earlier this month. Mr Johnson started the call by congratulating him and calling for the UK and Armenia to strengthen relations forthwith. In return, the man posing as Pashinyan thanked Mr Johnson for giving the time on his day off. He also said I\u0027m a fan of your poetry - picking out a satirical poem Mr Johnson wrote about the Turkish President having sex with a goat. Early in the call, Mr Johnson said Russia was unable to resist malign activity and we have to stand firm against them. You throw a stone in Kensington and you’ll hit an oligarch, the Foreign Secretary said. It\u0027s very important for the Russians to know that certainly the UK is absolutely determined to stand against them.  We will continue to tighten the squeeze on some of the oligarchs who surround Putin. But the call got increasingly awkward towards the end as the man posing as Pashinyan said Russian President Vladimir Putin has influence over Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Oh really, well, that - did he tell you that? Boris Johnson replied. Yes, he told me, the man replied. Boris Johnson replied: Really. He told you that he was influencing Jeremy Corbyn? The response came: Yes, absolutely.

But just as you need to carefully plan your route to that seaside resort or holiday cottage, it makes sense to plan ahead for the actual journey, too. That way you’ll all still be in the holiday mood when you reach your destination and really ready for fun! Below we’ve teamed up with Halfords to reveal the 5 secrets to the perfect car journey which will leave you feeling relaxed and refreshed when you arrive. They cover everything from picking the right tunes to play on the way to why it pays to plan when you\u0027re off on a road trip. 1. Get the sounds right    A great road trip needs a great soundtrack. But with the whole family in the car, creating a playlist that keeps everyone happy can be a challenge. Even if Dad likes Dua Lipa, Mum likes Metallica and the kids change their minds every few seconds, there is a way to keep everyone happy: using a streaming service en route.  This bank holiday there’s 10 per cent off selected audio systems at Halfords – including a Pioneer car stereo. Featuring a digital radio and with support for Android devices and iPhones alike you can stream from Spotify, Apple Music and use apps like Google Maps and Waze. Remember: Halfords experts can help you with your choice and fit your new stereo seamlessly into your car. The experts can fit your new stereo in-store from as little as \u0026pound30. 2. Keep the kids happy    Keep the kids entertained and you’ll be amazed how quickly “are we nearly there yet” becomes a thing of the past. Whether it’s for big screen classics or cartoons, the Nextbase Car Dual DVD, below, is an ideal solution.  The pack includes two DVD players with built-in nine-inch screens.  You can use each separately, or connect them together to watch the same movie on both. There are speakers to listen out loud, or you can hook them up to a pair of optional wireless headphones. With the ability to play different films at the same time, it will be sure to keep the kids happy - and give you peace and quiet on the journey, even if they want to watch different films.  The chances are that if you’re travelling as a group you’re all going to want to keep your mobile devices charged up. Halfords has a range of portable phone chargers to keep your USB devices topped up – the Halfords Premium Triple USB Charger can charge three devices at once. 3. Don’t get lost    While it\u0027s pretty easy to think of things to fill a long car journey there\u0027s no sense in making it longer than it has to be. If you don\u0027t already have one, or yours is too old to be useful, then consider a new sat nav. You can pick up a great device, like the Garmin Drive, which includes lifetime map updates and traffic camera alerts for just \u0026pound79. The Garmin Drive will also ensure you get there quickly - by rerouting you and diverting you away from traffic.

Halfords also has 20 per cent off on a range of dash cams ahead of the holiday. In-store experts can even fit seamlessly into your car.  4. Watch your levels    Don\u0027t risk something delaying your journey because you remember 10 miles in that you\u0027ve run out of screenwash or that the oil level is low. Why not book a FREE Summer Car Check for your car at a time that suits you.

Aaron Thompson originally from Romford, Essex, got sick of travelling back and forth to see his girlfriend who lived in Lutterworth, Leicestershire. So bravely, he decided he would try and buy a house in her city, and that\u0027s exactly what he did.  The now 19-year-old bought the new build home with his girlfriend Jessica King, 21, and moved into the property in March.  He has revealed that while saving up for the three-bed, he would give himself just \u0026pound70 a week to spend and lived with his parents.  His new home cost \u0026pound230,000 according to the Daily Mail. And Aaron has provided a list of top tips on how to afford buying your own place - including setting a budget, using the help to buy scheme, and not being scared. Speaking about his decision to buy a property at such a young age, he said: I got with my girlfriend when I was young, I was 15. She lived in Lutterworth, it was a lot of travelling back and forth.   He told the Leicester Mercury : I got to the point one day when I thought I am not going to do this anymore. I was never going to break up with Jess, I just thought sod it I\u0027ll buy a house.  I saved up as much as I could, and thanks to the help to buy scheme we managed to make it possible. I also have to thank my parents for their support - to say to them at 18 I am moving 100 miles away to buy a house, for some parents that would be mad, but my parents support me through everything. 1) Don\u0027t be scared My number one thing is it\u0027s not as scary as you think. Even money problems- I am only an apprentice electrician, I am not earning big money. I earn bog standard money. I still have a gym membership, I still have a phone contract, I still go out with my friends. They say buying a house is a really big thing, but it\u0027s not as big as you expect. 2) Save money on some things but spend on the important things The other thing is don\u0027t cheap out on the important stuff. The sofa, and the bed, and things like that, get the best you can but you don\u0027t need to go and spend \u0026pound50 on sofa cushions when you could get them much cheaper. You can go to Ikea and get cutlery and things like that rather than spending a fortune. 3) Don\u0027t buy a glass table Everytime you sit down at that dining room table it has stuff on it and you need to wipe it down. 4) Don\u0027t rush into it Me and my girlfriend have been together four years. I know that we are happy. One thing I would say to young couples is don\u0027t rush into buying a house. If you are young and moving in with someone you have been with for four or five months and you are all loved up, you might think it\u0027s okay but you can wait. I knew I was ready to move out. 5) Use the help to buy scheme If you can, use the help to buy scheme and don\u0027t rent. The downpayment with the help to buy scheme was peanuts, it really was. It didn\u0027t take us long to get it. 6) Set a budget Leave yourself with a set amount to spend every week and put money away. Then you don\u0027t feel suffocated but you don\u0027t spend all your earnings. Aaron is an apprentice electrician by trade and is also a racing driver. He met his girlfriend, who is a former racer through racing. Although he one day hopes to be a paid racing driver, for now being an electrician is what pays the bills. He added: When I left school - I wasn\u0027t the most academic of people and I always knew I wasn\u0027t going to go to university or do A Levels. My father was a professional race car driver, he said to me go and get a trade job and then you will have work. I am in my final year of an apprenticeship, training to be an electrician. My main goal is to become a paid racing driver. I have been racing myself for 11 years but my granddad was a racing driver, my dad was too, same with my uncles, and my cousin drives in the touring cars. Saving money has been a priority for Aaron since he started working and he soon saw the benefits in buying early. He said: I am not wasteful, it\u0027s my money. I know for a fact if I am going to be a race driver or a tradesman I need some sort of pension. It\u0027s not just a family thing for me, it\u0027s an investment. The quicker I can buy one property the quicker I can buy the second property.  The main thing that helped Aaron save the money was budgeting, in addition to being able to use the Help to Buy scheme. He added: It\u0027s hard for me to say how long I have been saving for. I was living with my parents and putting stuff away. I was leaving myself \u0026pound70 a week as money to spend.

Road traffic data analysis shows that many of us are simply swapping our computer screen for a windscreen in the quest to reach popular UK holiday hotspots. According to research from Virgin Atlantic in collaboration with INRIX, a leading transportation analytics company, journeys of under 100 miles from London will take nearly seventy per cent longer to reach this weekend.          Beach getaways are not the only victim of travel disruption this bank holiday, with historical hotspots such as Edinburgh taking up to thirteen hours to reach by road from London, meaning culture vultures could be left soaking up nothing more than motorway scenery.         A weekend jaunt to the Lake District will take almost eight hours on Friday, and with flights to New York taking just 7 hours and 45 minutes, you could take a trip to the Big Apple in less time!    Reaching Glasgow will take more than nine hours and a trip to Loch Ness will require an eye-watering 12 hours and 28 minutes in the car.  Shai Weiss, Virgin Atlantic’s Chief Commercial Officer, said: “Many of us are willing to spend countless hours travelling around the UK over the bank holiday, but very few think about the possible destinations we could reach in the same time. “With Virgin Atlantic flights to New York taking as little at 7 hours and 45 minutes, and with a three course meal and hours of movies included you can relax on your journey as well as enjoying a holiday of a lifetime over your bank holiday.” With flights to New York taking as little time as 7 hours and 45 minutes from London Heathrow and Manchester Virgin Atlantic are encouraging Brits to ditch the motorway for the runway this weekend and take-off on the holiday of their dreams. Speaking about bank holiday travelling, Graham Cookson, Chief Economist \u0026amp Head of Research, at INRIX said: “This bank holiday is set to be a very busy time for road travel. “A large increase in the volume of vehicles on the road could mean that even simple journeys are likely to incur significant delays. “Popular bank holiday destinations such as Brighton, could take almost double the time to travel to, leaving your time enjoying the beach significantly reduced.” "},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markles cheeky page boy","story":"NewsMeghan Markle\u0027s cheeky page boy reveals what made him pull THAT face as the stunning bride walked into churchBrian Mulroney and his twin brother John had the important job of carrying Meghan\u0027s veil - and they looked very excited\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByZoe ForseySocial Audience Writer11:11, 24 MAY 2018Updated12:08, 24 MAY 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAfter Meghan\u0027s stunning dress and that romantic first kiss, one of the big talking points from Prince Harry\u0027s wedding was the adorable little page boy who stole the show with his excited facial expressions. Brian Mulroney and his twin brother John, the children of Meghan\u0027s best friend Jessica, were two of the couple\u0027s four page boys on their big day. The brothers had the important job of carrying the bride\u0027s five-metre long veil up the steps of St George\u0027s Chapel. But when they stopped at the top, as Meghan prepared to walk down the first part of the aisle alone, Brian\u0027s face was an absolute picture. Now his dad Ben, the son of former Canadian prime minster Brian Mulroney, has explained exactly what happened to make the seven-year-old so excited - and it\u0027s all to do with a trumpet.  Speaking to Canadian breakfast show Your Morning, the TV presenter said: I asked him, and he said he\u0027d never heard a trumpet before. I think when he walked in, he saw all the people there, and the flowers, none of that was there during the rehearsal.  Brian and John joined Prince George and Prince Harry\u0027s godson Jasper Dyer, six, who is the son of Amanda Dyer and Mark Dyer, as page boys. Their sister Ivy, four, was a bridesmaid, along with Princess Charlotte, Florence van Cutsem, three, Remi and Rylan Litt, aged six and seven. The youngest bridesmaid was two-year-old Zalie Warren.  Meghan didn\u0027t have any grown-up bridesmaids or a maid-of-honour, so all the attention was in the adorable little helpers. They all features in two of the couple\u0027s beautiful official wedding photos, taken by Alexi Lubomirski in Windsor Castle\u0027s Green Drawing Room.

The new Duke of Sussex dated Chelsy on and off for seven years from 2004 to 2011 and the jewellery designer was invited to the stunning wedding ceremony at St George\u0027s Chapel on Saturday - but not the evening reception at Frogmore House.  Another of Harry\u0027s exes, Cressida Bonas, was also at the Windsor Castle wedding.  According to Vanity Fair in the days before the wedding Harry , 33, and Chelsy, 32, had a tearful \u0027parting\u0027 phone call.  The publication claim a source told them: It was their final call, a parting call in which they both acknowledged Harry was moving on.  Chelsy was quite emotional about it all, she was in tears and almost didn’t go to the wedding. The prince and Chelsy remained good friends after their 2011 split with the 33-year-old invited to Prince William and Kate\u0027s wedding the same year. That set tongues wagging the pair were back on but Harry said he was 100% single amid a flutter of speculation he was interested in Pippa Middleton after she took the headlines for her bum at the ceremony.  But Zimbabwean Chelsy has spoke about the media scrutiny their romance suffered.  In an interview she said: It was so full-on: crazy and scary and uncomfortable. I found it very difficult when it was bad. I couldn\u0027t cope. I was trying to be a normal kid and it was horrible. Chelsy appeared uneasy while sat in St George\u0027s Chapel preparing to watch her one-time-beau tie the knot with American actress Meghan Markle.       But there is no bad blood between the pair. At the lunchtime reception Chelsy greeted the bride and was all smiles as she hugged her tightly, a source told the Mirror. Harry and Zimbabwean-born Chelsy met when they were both students at boarding school. She even met the Queen at a society wedding and was a guest at Prince Charles 60th 10 years ago, as her relationship with Harry became more serious.

Her eyes were closed and she seemed peacefully asleep, with fairy lights around her bed as her favourite music played softly in the background. The image still brings so much comfort to her mum Stephanie because, tragically, Daisy wasn’t asleep, she had died at the age of just 12. It was thanks to a special mattress Stephanie was able to collect such precious memories during a week with her little girl after she had passed away. For the mum and her three other children, being able to say goodbye to Daisy in their own home was crucial to the grieving process.  “She just looked like she was asleep,” the 49-year-old mum says. “It was amazing to be able to feel like she was with us. You have these visions of her looking like something from Silent Witness, lying there in the mortuary, but it was just like having her home again.” Daisy died in 2017 of a rare condition called Costello syndrome, which affects fewer than 300 children worldwide. It is caused by a mutation of a cancer- causing gene, which meant Daisy had a 17% increased risk of developing a cancerous tumour, heart and bone problems. She lived longer than doctors expected but eventually it was too much for her body to cope with. After she died, Daisy’s family were able to take her home to Wimbledon, South West London, for an extra week before they laid her to rest because of the special cold mattress. “When Daisy came home she was in her nightie, we put her duvet on her and tucked her toys around her,” Stephanie says. “I played her music, the soundtrack to Frozen, we had some candles on. My children and I just drifted in and out of her room. It was like she was sleeping. But I did keep expecting her to wake up and say ‘go away!’  “People might hear that and say, ‘Oh my God, that’s really freaky’, but it felt like the most natural thing in the world. I felt I’d reclaimed her. I’d brought her away from a traumatic death and a medical environment and she was just my little girl tucked up in bed.” The technology is not widely available but a small number of hospices have the mattresses. Stephanie, a writer and campaigner, explains: “It’s a blue, plastic-coated mattress and it has cooling fluid and is attached to a tube. It acts like a padded fridge or a freezer block, you put that on the bed and put normal bedding over the top. “I was astounded that there is very little information about these cold mattresses. If Daisy had been under a different hospice, we wouldn’t have been able to take her home after she died. “The most horrific thing for me is that she would’ve had to go to the mortuary. Embalming was the other option, which is horrible. How horrific – you’ve just lost a child and then have to go through that. “The mattresses seem to be really rare, we were so lucky our hospice uses them.” They took Daisy home for a night and then spent seven nights with her at Shooting Star Chase children’s hospice, where she spent so much of her life.  It has been a traumatic couple of years for the family. Stephanie’s husband of 23 years Andy died from cancer a year before Daisy in December 2015, leaving Stephanie as a single mum to Daisy, Theo, 21, Xanthe, 19, and Jules, 15. Being able to spend the extra time with Daisy has been hugely beneficial to them all. Theo and Jules decided that the night with Daisy at home brought them enough closure, but Stephanie and Xanthe spent the rest of the week with her in the hospice, where they re-created Daisy’s bedroom. Stephanie says: “My other daughter spent so much time with Daisy in the hospice, she painted her nails, did her make-up. After Andy died, she didn’t want to be there right at the end. “But actually with Daisy, she said being able to spend time with her and dress her up in her favourite Princess Anna dress, from Frozen, and put all her toys around her was so healing.” Now Stephanie is able to remember her daughter at peace. “Daisy looked so relaxed at the end,” she says. “She had been in a lot of pain for the last few months of her life and was very tense. When she died, we all said how long she looked because she wasn’t tense any more. “In my mind I have that beautiful picture, not on a ventilator and bloated from the fluid, with tubes everywhere. “I have a nice picture. Had I not been able to have that, my last memory of her would’ve been before she went to the mortuary.” "},{"url":null,"title":"uk weather bank holiday heatwave","story":"NewsUK weather: Bank Holiday heatwave will be marred by rain and thunderstormsDon\u0027t pack away the raincoat just yet - with showers and thunderstorms set to interrupt the scorching weather\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByBrett GibbonsHeather McNeill19:12, 24 MAY 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe scorching bank holiday where temperatures will rival the Caribbean will have a damp start for some with heavy showers and thunderstorms. While some Brits will bask in 30C on Monday, others will face ran storms which are set to soak large parts of the country from tonight.  The gloomy prediction comes as forecasters advise people to make the most of the unseasonably warm May weather , with summer predicted to be cooler than average.  Outbreaks of rain will start to affect central and southern England and much of Wales from Thursday evening. According to the Weather Channel, some of the downpour will be heavy and thundery with a chance of hail in isolated spots where storms are at their most severe.  It will be warm and sunny in north-west England, Northern Ireland and Scotland, but it will remain cloudy and cooler in the north-east. More showers return on Friday but there will still be some sunny spells for most regions.  Rain will travel over Wales and the Midlands to the north of England, easing to light patches in the afternoon. It will become mostly dry over the south of England and the Midlands by evening. Elsewhere it should remain dry throughout the day. On Saturday there is the risk of occasional showers and thunder on the south coast, but elsewhere will be cloudy - except for Scotland where it will be dry and sunny.  Heat will start to build through Sunday and Monday peaking at a scorching 29C in the south of England. A spokesperson for The Weather Channel commented: “There is a mostly sunny and dry outlook under high pressure with the best of the sunshine expected over central and northern areas. “It will be cloudier in the south with showers at times, due to the presence of weak troughs of low pressure, becoming more widespread later with the threat of thunder showers.  “Mostly gentle onshore easterly winds will keep maximum temperatures lower along the east coast than further inland and to the west.” Temperatures could top 29C on Monday in the south-east of England - comparable with the Caribbean. However the scorching prediction is not set to break records, with the warmest late May bank holiday weekend recorded in 1944, when temperatures in southern England reached 32.8C.

Today two men were jailed for life after being found guilty of murder , while a woman was convicted of manslaughter.  Siblings Demi, Brandon, Lacie and Lia Pearson died after the horrific attack in Walkden in December, and their mum Michelle is still recovering in hospital. Her family today said Michelle, 36, would never recover from her broken heart. Zak Bolland, 23, was handed four life terms and told he must serve at least 40 years behind bars. David Worrall, 26, was ordered to serve a minimum term of 37 years in prison. A third defendant, Courtney Brierley, 20, was handed 21 years in a young offenders’ institution for manslaughter.  In a statement from the family, read out on the steps of Manchester Crown Court following the sentencing, the children\u0027s grandmother Sandra Lever said: Today may be the end of the trial but it is not the end for us as we try to recover and get on with out lives. Michelle, the children\u0027s mum, is still recovering from her injuries, and will be in hospital for some time to come. The staff have been amazing and are trying their best to fix her, but they will never be able to fix her broken heart. We miss the children every day, our lives are just not the same without them.  And the statement continued: We will never again hear their voices... that thought leaves us numb. I hope that Bolland, Worrall and Brierley know that they have taken away the light of our lives. We are very happy today with the results and would like to thank all those who have helped us to get justice. Demi, 15, Brandon, eight, Lacie, seven, and three-year-old Lia died after two lit petrol bombs were tossed inside their home last December.  The court had heard the children suffered cardiac arrests and died as a result of a combination of smoke inhalation and burns following the blaze. Their mum, Michelle Pearson, screamed Not the kids! Not my kids! before being overcome by the smoke, heat and flames that had filled the house.  This afternoon, Bolland - who had been involved in a petty feud with the victims\u0027 brother Kyle Pearson, 17 - and Worrall were both locked up for life for murdering the four siblings. The sentences were delivered in complete silence at the court, with the grieving Pearson family watching from the public gallery. Speaking after sentencing Detective Chief Inspector Lewis Hughes from GMP’s Major Incident Team said: This is one of the most heartbreaking cases I have ever dealt with. I am glad that the sentences these three have received today reflect their atrocious acts, but nothing can change what has happened and nothing can bring back the children. I would like to commend the bravery of the children’s family. I can’t even begin to imagine what they have been through.  My thoughts will always be with their mother Michelle, along with their father, brothers and wider family and friends. They have all shown a phenomenal amount of strength during the most devastating of circumstances. When Bolland, Worrall and Brierley planned their attack, they knew that innocent children were asleep in their beds. They smashed the kitchen window and threw their handmade petrol bombs inside. The fire spread so quickly and the heat was so intense that the smoke alarms melted before they had chance to sound. This left the family with virtually no chance of escape.

This is all described in the book, and I have a little fun with it.\u0026#8221Mark began writing the book in 2010, while he was travelling between his work in London and a small house in France.\u0026#8220I’m a huge fan of Ian Fleming’s James Bond stories and when I travelled to places like Paris, Monte Carlo, Venice and the French Riviera \u0026#8211 all places that have appeared in Fleming’s novels \u0026#8211 it really felt like you were in the world of Bond, so I play with this a bit too,\u0026#8221 he said.\u0026#8220And when I went Interrailing, I travelled \u0026#8211 as everyone did back then \u0026#8211 with a number of compilation tapes for my Walkman, so the soundtrack to the book is also very 80s.\u0026#8220Everything from Duran Duran’s Bond theme ‘A View to a Kill’ to Simple Minds’ Glittering Prize album. Fab music.\u0026#8221The story starts in Dundee, and Mark said it was central to the story of Sam\u0026#8217s journey from uncertain, undecided small-town boy to a modern, outward-looking European with a sense of direction in his life.\u0026#8220Once the main character Sam has left Dundee and is discovering new cities like Paris, Barcelona and Monte Carlo, he often compares them with his origins. His experience of ‘otherness’ opens new possibilities to him, ones that weren’t available in Dundee at that time,\u0026#8221 Mark said.He initially started looking for a publisher for the book but decided instead to self-publish and said the reviews had been great.\u0026#8220I’ve been amazed at how many people have said it really took them back to that period and reminded them of their own lives back then. I love that it resonates with them,\u0026#8221 he said.\u0026#8220I’ve also done some readings in London and a few guest spots on blogs. But I’m fairly unknown as an author, so it’s a hard slog to get seen and heard.\u0026#8220There’s still lots of work to do.\u0026#8221\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5b0288303a011.jpg ","title":"dundee people dundee student lucy gets a good look at cruise ship for school project","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAs the cruise ship Magellan sailed away from Dundee, Lucy Anderson was there to wave it off.The Dundee seven-year-old was studying the Titanic for a school project, her mum Pauline said, and wanted to see how big a cruise ship really was.\u0026#8220We just decided as we knew someone who was going on this one and have never seen any off them leave from Dundee before,\u0026#8221 Pauline said.\u0026#8220We went down to the Stannergate where a lot of other people obviously had the same idea.\u0026#8221Along with her big brother Lewis, 11, Lucy had a good view as the 726 foot ship sailed out to sea.\u0026#8220She was amazed with it and was standing waving to everyone standing on deck,\u0026#8221 Pauline said.\u0026#8220Not sure if it’ll help her but she now knows where the rooms with balcony’s are and ones that only have windows and where the captain is.\u0026#8220It was so good to see and is such a good thing for Dundee at the moment that these boats are coming quite regularly now \u0026#8211 hopefully a sign of more good things to come to the city.\u0026#8221\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/1-1.jpg ","title":"dundee people pictures may fayre raises 600 for dundee school","story":"\t\t\t\t\tIt may have been competing with a royal wedding and brilliant sunshine, but a Dundee school\u0026#8217s fayre still raised £600.Lynne Rihoy, Chairperson of the Claypotts Castle Primary Parent Council, said the fayre was a success.\u0026#8220It wasn\u0026#8217t as busy as previous fayres, but given the royal wedding and the fabulous weather outside, we still managed to raise around £600,\u0026#8221 she said.Kids were treated to face-painting, a visit from the local police and other games.\u0026#8220It seemed to be quite popular,\u0026#8221 she said.Lynne said the event was one of two the Parent Council organised each year, with the money raised going back to the school to fund books, school trip, leavers jackets and other things the school couldn\u0026#8217t cover.    \t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5b02866b031c0.jpg ","title":"dundee people pupils run for very worthy cause","story":"\t\t\t\t\tOne hundred pupils and staff from Perth High School took part in the Perth Park Run to raise funds for the Teenage Cancer Trust.Teacher Dr Stephen Jones formerly worked for the trust and he also ran in the London marathon, raising £3,000 for this very worthy cause.The Perth High contingent were resplendent in their Teenage Cancer Trust T-shirts as they raced round the North Inch.Dr Jones’ initial goal was to raise £100 for every mile of this London marathon run but he is now on target to collect about £3,000.The other staff members and pupils raised a further £2,600 through their efforts.Dr Jones added: “This a fine gesture by staff and pupils.

Prior to that the Tangerines were unbeaten in 15 of 16 league games he played.With the 25-year-old set to return around the start of the new season, Duff believes it was vital United beat off interest from Championship rivals Ross County to get him fixed up on a new two-year contract. Having known him since he was a kid at Aberdeen the best part of a decade ago, Duff is well placed to judge what he can do.“I actually watched one of United’s play-off games with Fraser and from speaking to him I know he is working hard to get back fit,” he said.“He’s about to start running again so it shouldn’t be too long before he is back. That, and him signing a new deal, is very good news for United.“You saw the quality he has when he played for part of last season.“He was a bit of a stand-out in the United team and I will not be surprised if that’s the case again next season.“It really will not surprise me if they build the team around him because that’s the level of ability he has.”With most of last season’s team gone, Fyvie will be surrounded by new faces.That will make United something of an unknown quantity and bringing so many players in at one time has to be something of a gamble.For Duff it’s a calculated risk and, so long as the right type of player is sourced, he believes the team can gel.“I think if you go out and get the right players with the right attitude and philosophy, it can work.“You want players who want to come in and work hard to prove, basically, why the club signed them and that they should be playing at a club like United. If they do that then United can be where they want to be.”And having spent the best part of a decade at Tannadice from the start of his career, he would like nothing better than to see them back in the top flight.Last week he was back in a United strip for Dave Bowman’s annual game to raise cash for skin cancer and dementia charities. Running out at Tannadice reminded Duff where United should be.“You look around the place and it’s geared up for the Premiership but no one has the divine right to be there, you have to earn it. It will be a battle again next season because it’s a tough league.“But I was here nine-and-a-half years from when I was a kid and the upbringing here was very good – second to none – so I want United back up.”At 36, and despite recently taking on a new job with the Connect Energy Group that involves a lot of travelling, Duff has no plans to hang up his own boots.Next season he’ll again be plying his trade in the Highland League with Inverurie Locos.“The new job is keeping me busy but I do get Saturdays off so I’m available and happy to keep playing.“We finished third last year, so the aim is to go a bit higher next season.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"livingston star byrne on dundee united radar","story":"\t\t\t\t\tLivingston promotion hero Shaun Byrne is the latest player to be linked with a move to Dundee United.But the Tangerines will face stiff competition from elsewhere if they do move for him.The 24-year-old was part of the side that clinched promotion to the Premiership by beating Partick Thistle in the play-offs on Sunday.He’s now out of contract and that’s alerted United, Falkirk and a string of English clubs.

proud of stints at both dundee and united but focus is now on hibs","story":"\t\t\t\t\tSought-after Simon Murray’s future will not be decided until July at the very earliest.And while the striker, who’s just finished a loan spell at Dundee, is extremely flattered by interest from the other side of Tannadice Street, his first choice is to remain at parent club Hibs.Murray is currently enjoying his summer break but is well aware of speculation linking him with a return to first full-time employers Dundee United.Beaten Scottish Cup finalists Motherwell are also known to be considering a summer move for him and, dating back to his time at United, several clubs in Europe have monitored his progress.As recently as Dundee’s victory over St Johnstone last month, one sent their chief scout to update their file on him.For the 26-year-old, however, the next piece of business he aims to be involved in is a battle to re-establish himself at Easter Road.“I am contracted to Hibs for another year and, although I spent the second half of the season on loan at Dundee, my aim has always been to go back there.“I still finished the season top scorer for them and, even when I went to Dundee in January, the plan was always to go back.“At the time I spoke to Neil Lennon and he stressed whether or not I went was entirely down to me.“I could have stayed and he would have considered me for selection but really the move came up because Anthony Stokes had left and they needed a No 10.“They wanted Scott Allan and the only way the deal was going to be done was if I went to Dundee, so the gaffer did say to me I would be back in the summer.“He’s told me I can stake a claim for a place in the team next season and I know, if he says that, he means it, because he’s very honest with me.”Should things not work out in his second season at Hibs, Murray will look at his situation.“Obviously, if they sign another striker or decide to go another way I’ll have to think about what happens next, so it is good to know other clubs are interested. If it doesn’t work out, the only person I will blame is myself but I feel the move to Dundee has been good for me because it’s got me a lot more Premiership experience.”He admits had the loan interest at the turn of the year been from someone other than Dundee, there’s a fair chance he would have opted to stay put.“A lot’s been said about me being a Dundee fan and that was a factor.“More important was it was a move that wasn’t going to involve me having to get used to a new city or league.“I stayed at my mum’s when I was back up and I already knew some of the boys, so it was easy to settle in. I’m not saying I wouldn’t have gone somewhere else but all that made it an easier choice to come.”And, as a proud Dundonian, Murray admits the fact he’s joined a select band of players to have worn dark blue and tangerine is pleasing.“I will look back at the end of my career and be proud I played for Dundee and United. While I’m a Dundee fan, even before I was at United I was never one who didn’t want them to do well.“I always went to see both teams and I still do. I’m a football fan and I want to see both sides from my city doing well.“Now I’ve got a United connection, they are a club I will always have a lot of time for.“They were the team that gave me my chance in the game full-time and I’m grateful for that.“I still know a lot of people there and they are very good people who I respect a lot.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5b03eb105ae54.jpg ","title":"zimbabwe international striker macauley bonne tops dundee wishlist","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee are in the hunt for a goalscorer and Leyton Orient marksman Macauley Bonne is top of their wishlist.The Zimbabwe international scored 25 goals for the National League side last season, sparking the Dark Blues interest.Born in Ipswich, Bonne started his career at Colchester United, where he played with current Dundee midfielder Glen Kamara briefly, before loans at Lincoln City and Woking.It’s been at Brisbane Road, however, where he’s shone, smashing in 22 league goals last season.With a year remaining on his current deal there, a fee will be required to prise him from Orient and that could be a sticking point with the non-league side holding out for six figures.With Shrewsbury, Portsmouth and Burton Albion all interested, too, Dundee have fierce competition to land the 22-year-old striker.Orient are also keen to keep him on a longer contract but a mid-table finish in the National League is unlikely to have been enough to keep him amid interest from other clubs.Dens gaffer Neil McCann highlighted a lack of killer instinct in his side throughout last season, something he is determined to rectify this summer with a proven goalscorer.With money in the bank from the January sale of defender Jack Hendry, Dundee have the funds behind them to strengthen that area of the team.And having already raided the English non-league for Roarie Deacon last summer and Elton Ngwatala last week, Neil is hoping he can attract another National League star to come north of the
