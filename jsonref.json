The High Court judge who first heard her claim asked me to represent Bryce Taylor, which would mean cross-examining the ‘People’s Princess’.I would need to explore under cross-examination Diana’s two-faced attitude to privacy – she had told the tawdry secrets of her marriage to journalist Andrew Morton for a book which blackened Charles’s name.However, on the evening before ‘the trial of the century’, there was a deal, and Diana’s lawyers withdrew her claim, reportedly after depositing $1 million in Bryce’s Swiss bank account.This was all swathed in secrecy, of course, so the Princess could claim to have ‘won’.I was somewhat deflated, as always when a big case settles at the door of the court.It’s a condition my witty wife Kathy Lette called ‘courtus interruptus’.  ... and the time I hid James Hewitt in my London atticI also once advised Diana’s lover, James Hewitt.The press was in full pursuit after the story broke of his royal romance with the Princess, so he hid in a converted pigsty in the South of France and then prevailed on an Army helicopter pilot to fly him to North London, where he hid in our attic for a few days while I mulled over the 1351 Treason Act, which still punished with death any party to adultery with the wife of the monarch’s eldest son and heir.If James was bang to rights, Diana would have been guilty as an accomplice, although I had to doubt whether she would suffer the same fate as Anne Boleyn.

It was not difficult to argue that Alex – by now a seedy businessman in Athens – was a charlatan.

In those days they still had all-male juries for sex cases.‘You are about to see a film, gentlemen of the jury,’ said the prosecutor. ‘It will be for you to say whether it is an indecent importation.’The lights went down, and the star, Ms Linda Lovelace, left, came on to the makeshift screen.Ninety minutes later, the lights came up. Nobody moved. The judge announced it was lunchtime and made his exit, in a crouching position.

Everything I could find in the newspapers I cut out.’Crawford, above, who went on to find fame on television and stage, says: ‘You see thousands of soldiers and it’s the pageantry, the uniforms, the regalia… There was this extraordinary spectacle.’                                                    Watching film commissioned by the Queen to record the atmosphere inside Buckingham Palace on the day, he says: \u0027Imagine the build-up and the excitement. A great deal of hustle and bustle and fiddling around making sure things were put on the right way round.

Jeppesen said he found North Korean people to be friendly, pictured above with two friends in 2016          In his book he reveals how he lived in a lavish but empty hotel, was escorted by two mandatory guides in public at all times, and was woken up every morning to a 5am ode to Kim II-sung          He adds that the hardest part of the trip was the psychological toll of being constantly watched and monitored as he studied in the nation\u0027s capitol, railway station in Pyongyang above          He describes everyday life where men and women wear colorful clothing, head to the zoo for fun, and are under the constant watchful eye of their official housing unit spy, view of Pyongyang aboveBut that doesn\u0027t mean there aren\u0027t loopholes. Relaxed inminbanjangs would turn a blind eye to certain rules such as one woman Jeppesen met who was \u0027known to rent out her second room as an hourly love hotel for extra income.\u0027Contrary to the mental picture of uniformed citizens and regimented society many might have of North Korea, Jeppesen says times are changing and fashion has become more relaxed. Men were seen wearing short-sleeve shirts of all colors and designs as well as flashy Rolexes on their wrists, though they\u0027re often fake ones.Women wore skirts and occasionally jeans were permitted for certain positions.A hot trend for the ladies was high heels sported with socks.   One of the more bizarre sights for the student was seeing North Korean citizens visit the zoo which boasts more than 6,000 animals and 650 species and mostly displayed dogs and cats.\u0027Having pets was never really part of the culture. North Korea has always been a very poor country, and they’ve always had difficulty feeding their citizens. Keeping an animal you have to feed when you yourself aren\u0027t getting enough rice to get you through the day is an outrageous luxury to them,\u0027 Jeppesen said. It was at the zoo he was stunned to find an elderly woman selling ice cream and candy be violently taken away by two police officers. \u0027I subtly tried to watch where they were taking her, but I lost sight of them...I don’t think it ended well for her,\u0027 he wrote in his book.  As for home entertainment, Jeppensen said the evening news was a monotone review of Kim Jonh-un’s daily schedule recited as \u0027cheery symphonic music\u0027 played in the background.While watching TV at a government official’s home, Jeppesen said the officer turned off the news and instead played a \u0027pirated copy of Zootopia he bought at a DVD stall.\u0027    The sun sets in Pyongyang pictured last April where Jeppesen was shocked to see housing unit spies and locals gawk at pet animals at the zoo          Locals are pictured walking around the North Korean capital in a photo from April 2017For the student, the hardest part of the experience being constantly watched as he assumed his hotel room, computer and phone were all bugged.\u0027Psychologically, it was very difficult and stressful.

Now Donald Trump’s focus has switched to the real target for his trade war: China. Wilbur Ross, the US commerce secretary, is in Beijing for talks aimed at reducing America’s $30bn-a month-deficit. Exports of Chinese high-tech manufactured goods are top of Ross’s list.Make no mistake: Trump’s strategy is a sign of weakness not strength. Countries that resort to protectionism normally do so for one of two reasons: to assist the development process when they are on the way up and to slow the pace of decline when they are in relative decline.Protectionist tendencies never really went away. They resurfaced in the 1980s, when there was a panic about the threat posed by Japan. And behind the Trumpian bombast is a deep-seated fear that America’s hegemony is threatened by China’s rapid economic transformation over the past 40 years.If the struggle between the US and China merely leads to a trade war, the world can consider itself lucky. Historically, when a rising power challenges the existing top dog it has more often than not led to bloodshed.That’s not remotely in prospect currently. In terms of the measures that count – technological sophistication, military clout and income per head of population – the US remains streets ahead. But China has been catching up fast. The first phase of its development, moving people out of the fields and into low-cost manufacturing, is over. A second phase, in which investment in higher education allows the economy to compete in sectors hitherto the preserve of the developed west, is well under way. China is not remotely interested in an international ision of labour where the west does the clever stuff and it is left with the cheap end of the market.Trump’s action sums up what Rebecca and Jack Harding are talking about in their new book, the Weaponisation of Trade (London Publishing Partnership). They argue that trade is a strategic concern it is not just a matter that governments are happy to leave to market forces, decisions made in the boardrooms of multi-national corporations and by technocrats hammering out trade liberalisation deals at the World Trade Organisation in Geneva.“Trade is more than an economic concept and trade wars are not just protectionism,” the two Hardings say. “Strategic trade is one way in which countries can build their influence and power globally, and trade can be used in part as a substitute for direct military intervention.”This marks a shift from the dominant political ethos in the decade that followed the collapse of communism, when the global economy boomed and protectionist pressures waned. Yet the notion that the world would be a better place if it were run in accordance with the free-trade beliefs of Adam Smith and David Riccardo did not survive the financial crisis of a decade ago.Even before the arrival of Trump, trade barriers were quietly going up, with 7,000 protectionist measures introduced since the financial crisis. Simultaneously, higher transport costs and security fears post 911 have made companies less keen on having long supply chains. There has been a tendency to localise rather than globalise production, which has chimed with a political mood that has prioritised national action over multilateral co-operation. Trump’s America First approach is just one expression of the new mood and he will be confident that his tough-guy stance will go down well in the rust belt states that helped to elect him in 2016. That looks possible, even though the idea that the size of the US trade deficit is simply due to China abusing international trade laws is nonsense. To be sure, Beijing has been able to grow its exports by keeping its currency competitive. No question, there has been theft of US intellectual property rights.But the prime reason why the US is running such a sizeable trade trade deficit is that the opening of the global economy has allowed US corporations to outsource production to where it is cheaper, which is why the rust belt has been hollowed out.Low-cost imports from China led to lower inflation, which in turn meant interest rates were lower than they otherwise would have been. American households could load up on cheap credit to buy cheap Chinese imports. The US consumed more than it produced and spent more than it saved. China has funded America’s spending habits by investing in US companies, US property and US Treasury bonds. The fear that Beijing could pull the plug on the US economy at any time by dumping its US holdings made previous US administrations nervous. Trump has decided that the time for dithering is over, although his solutions seem somewhat bizarre. Tax cuts will encourage consumer spending while tariffs will raise the cost of domestic production. Higher inflation will mean a more rapid policy tightening from the Federal Reserve, which will slow the economy. A recession would would certainly bring down the trade deficit.The communities that saw their guts ripped out by de-industrialisation will welcome anything that offers hope of revival, but have been sold a lie. “They’re closing down the textile mill across the railroad tracks,” Bruce Springsteen sang in My Hometown more than 30 years ago. “Foreman says these jobs are going boys and they ain’t coming back.” Sadly, he was right."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/799e68cfebac27de0d59a60fd081e62f8b2364ea/0_11_3582_2149/master/3582.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a95d6559927354750b2c6b5751a4dfc9","title":"sunday essay britain always an island nation but never alone","story":"The Brexit charge is that the European Union has become an overbearing political project threatening British sovereignty and values. Britain, so the story runs, is an exceptional country with an exceptional history, exceptional institutions and an exceptional destiny. For Europeans inured to political instability and bloodshed, supranational institutions are needed to keep the peace. These chosen British lands have no such need. The Brexit vote was a protest vote against an order that had created insupportable lives for too many British citizens, intensified by fears over immigration, but it was underpinned by this cultural narrative of Britain’s uniqueness.Like all caricatures, this story contains enough truth to be plausible. As the dominant part of an island to the west of the continent, England after 1066 was able to develop parliamentary government, religious toleration and common law without the periodic invasions that beset other parts of mainland Europe. It was not occupied by Napoleon or Hitler or ravaged for decades by territorial-cum-religious war. It was first into the Industrial Revolution and built the most extensive of the European empires on the basis of maritime prowess as an island nation. It was on the winning side in the 20th century’s two world wars. English, once spoken only in the Thames valley, became the world language.But there are limits to this account. It greatly overstates the uniqueness of English history, our differences with Europe and our differences with the other nations of the British Isles.We have never been truly orced from our continent. How could it be otherwise? England’s violent record in Ireland, Scotland and Wales should disabuse anyone who thinks our history is distinctively peaceful – and our record in empire-building was of a piece. All the currents that have shaped us – Roman, Saxon, Danish and Norman occupations, the Renaissance, the rise of Protestantism, the gains of overseas expansion, the concept of the nation-state, universal suffrage and the welfare state, industrialisation, the brutalities of early capitalism and the emergence of socialism – have shaped the rest of Europe, too. The development has been symbiotic.Thus, Magna Carta was part of a family of European settlements that fettered monarchical feudal rights across Europe. England’s break with Rome under Henry VIII prefigured the cataclysm that overcame the Holy Roman Empire England was part of the European state system established by the 1648 peace of Westphalia.Sometimes, as with industrialisation, Britain was ahead of the pack, although we soon lost the advantage to Germany. Sometimes, as with votes for all women over 21 in 1928 or laying the foundations of a welfare state before the First World War, we were well behind Scandinavia and even ex-colonies Australia and New Zealand. On the welfare state, we took our cue from Bismarck. The Enlightenment was a pan-European movement. Indeed, there is a powerful argument for viewing the British Industrial Revolution as a European event, given how many of the key inventions had origins in European thinking and in immigrants, many of them refugees compelled to seek better lives here.The truth is that Britain has been integrating immigrants and sharing sovereignty for centuries. As urban centres grew and trade and cultural networks flourished, supported by revolutionary advances in technology from the three-masted sailing ship to the printing press to electrification to containerisation, these connections have woven Britain, Europe and the rest of the world closer together.This interconnectedness has made cooperation more, not less, essential over time. Since 1834, Britain has signed more than 13,000 treaties and international conventions – a red-tape mountain – virtually all of which have diluted our notional sovereignty while advancing our national interest. The EU continues this process. The EU buildings that Boris Johnson sees ominously “looming over cobbled Brussels streets” are not representatives of some terrifying “other”: none of the EU’s members has ambitions – whether public or cryptic – to submerge their nation into a federal superstate. There is no European army massing in Calais. The EU’s buildings represent an often ticklish interdependence in which we Europeans devise solutions to shared problems – from environment to trade, from security to terrorism – that we could not have applied on our own. It is a construct for the future. Brexit is a step back to an imagined past that never existed.Even as England became a separate state from parts of the European mainland in the 16th century, engagement remained intense. Elizabeth I spoke six European languages and regarded herself as a “prince of Europe”. Resisting marriage advances by French and German princes lest they cramp her options, she was as deeply engaged as any of them in the culture and politics of the European Reformation and Counter-Reformation.Shakespeare’s Jaques (As You Like It) said that “all the world’s a stage”, but Europe was Shakespeare’s actual stage – all of it, together with its history: Venice, Verona, Sicily, Denmark, Athens, Rome, Paris, Vienna, Milan, Naples, Mantua, Cyprus, Bohemia, Illyria (Croatia), Navarre (Spain), Troy and Antioch (Turkey). And most exotic of all, the unnamed, heavenly Mediterranean isle of The Tempest, of which Caliban tells the shipwrecked Stephano: “Be not afeard. The isle is full of noises, Sounds, and sweet airs that give delight and hurt not.” Political unions between England and mainland Europe continued long after Mary I, married to Philip II of Spain, was evicted from Calais in 1558. The Glorious Revolution of 1688 brought William of Orange (the Netherlands) to the English throne. After the death of the childless Queen Anne in 1714, the throne passed to her cousin George, Prince of Hanover, an Anglo-German union of crowns that continued until Queen Victoria’s accession in 1837. Victoria promptly united with Saxe-Coburg in her marriage to Prince Albert. Victoria’s great-great-granddaughter, Elizabeth II – Elizabeth I of Scotland, which “the Faerie Queene” did not rule – is cousin to the kings or queens of Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Spain and the Netherlands. Her husband, Prince Philip, is a prince of Greece and Denmark and son of a German princess.So the monarchy is the most European of English institutions, just as it is the most Scottish and Welsh. It is nonetheless ambiguous. For as well as her European relationships, the Queen continues to be head of state of Canada, Australia and New Zealand. She is also head of the Commonwealth, a club of 53 mostly ex-colonies which still have strong cultural, educational, sporting and economic links to Britain despite the relative decline of the mother country. If those bonds are weakening, it is not because of the EU – it is because of Britain’s fading economic and political relevance.A similar story of tension between England Alone and European Britain is told across England’s intellectual, political, diplomatic, religious and cultural life. David Hockney was strongly influenced by Picasso, David Bowie’s talent flowered in Berlin, George Orwell wrote in Paris and Catalonia. Isaac Newton was far more internationally famous than Shakespeare in his day, because he wrote for a European audience in Latin. Only since the late 18th century have English language and culture held significant sway in mainland Europe. Even then, it took 150 years of revolution, turmoil and occupation for London to replace Paris as the capital of Europe. By the late 18th century, Britain’s leading scholars were writing in English, but no less engaged in Europe for their ideas and influence.Adam Smith, the father of modern economics, started writing The Wealth of Nations in Toulouse, while touring the continent as tutor to the Duke of Buccleuch. He met Voltaire in Geneva and David Hume in Paris, where his fellow Scot was secretary of the British embassy. Hume introduced him to all the great writers of the French Enlightenment. Smith even intended – his sudden death intervened – to dedicate his great book on the “invisible hand” of the free market to François Quesnay, a French economist as well as physician to Louis XV.The Industrial Revolution arrived in Britain not just because of British genius, or because we had abundant coal and running soft water, but due to the interplay with the European Enlightenment. The leading economic historian Joel Mokyr argues that the quest for knowledge that defined the Industrial Revolution – led by great inventors such as James Watt, Richard Arkwright and Josiah Wedgwood – was inspired by an Enlightenment seeking to open up the world to the force of reason.Inventors and thinkers alike converged on Britain, whose political institutions, tolerance and openness made it a European hub. As Hume wrote: “Notwithstanding the advanced state of our manufactures we daily adopt, in art, the inventions and improvements of our neighbours.” Whether it was Leblanc’s soda-making system, Jacquard’s loom or De Girard’s wet-spinning process, the British proved adept at absorbing European ideas from whatever source to reinforce their technological prowess and leadership.The Industrial Revolution transformed not only British but also European societies and polities. Managing the convulsions and uncertainties associated with industrialisation led to common responses: while the details differed, social unrest allied to Enlightenment views of inidualisation and human rights was a catalyst for democratisation, which opened the door for redistribution and the extension of social and educational rights to the masses. William Beveridge, godfather of the NHS and postwar welfare state, studied extensively the systems of compulsory social insurance for pensions and sickness that Bismarck had introduced into Germany in the 1880s.The greatest Briton, Winston Churchill, exemplifies the English European who never turned his back on the European mainland. Churchill had an American mother and an imperial destiny from his boyhood at Harrow and Sandhurst, as a young officer on India’s North-West Frontier and then a reporter in the South African war. Yet he was equally proud of being a descendant and biographer of the Duke of Marlborough, victor of Blenheim in league with Germans against the hegemonic Roi Soleil, Louis XIV.And therein lies an episode of significance for the history of Europe. While visiting Marlborough’s battlefields in Bavaria in 1932, Churchill nearly met Hitler. The Nazi leader, about to take power, had been due to meet Churchill at his hotel in Munich but – in a moment rich with symbolism – he cancelled at the last minute because Churchill had berated the Nazi leader’s press secretary the night before about antisemitism.“Why is your chief so violent about the Jews? What is the sense of being against a man simply because of his birth? How can any man help how he is born?” Churchill recalled saying. And the upshot: “He must have repeated this to Hitler, because about noon the next day he came round with rather a serious air and said that the appointment could not take place.”Maybe the most fateful non-meeting in history.Churchill never saw empire as a reason for British isolation from Europe. Faced by the ultimate crisis, he spurned Chamberlain’s isolationist view of Czechoslovakia as “a far-away country”. Instead, he stood up to Hitler, offered the French an “indissoluble union” to keep them in the war as Hitler’s armies advanced on Paris in June 1940, refused to contemplate the armistice urged on him by his foreign secretary, Lord Halifax, after the fall of France and pursued to the end a war to liberate Europe from “the pestilence of Nazi tyranny”. But note for devotees of Darkest Hour and Dunkirk: Britain was never “alone” and could not have triumphed had it been so. Even in its darkest hour Britain could call on its then vast empire and, within 18 months, on the Americans, too. It also had a powerful defence industry incorporating Europe’s largest and most sophisticated aviation industry, built up in the 1930s by methods that rejected laissez-faire. Britain could and did outproduce Germany.Today’s pro- and anti-Europeans quote different Churchill postwar speeches. “We must build a kind of United States of Europe” is the classic federalist quote from his 1946 Zurich speech. “We are with them, but not of them” is the classic anti-integration quote when he was prime minister for the second time in 1953. However, swapping quotes out of context is no substitute for understanding Churchill’s thinking, which was consistently in favour of strong European engagement.For Churchill, as for Attlee, his internationalist Labour counterpart, the issue of the 1940s was to combine European engagement, imperial power and global partnership with the United States.Churchill’s approach was unambiguously to maximise British influence in all three circles, not to disengage. Seventy years after Llandudno, Britain has only one circle left intact – “United Europe” – and it is implausible that Churchill would have favoured disengagement from that one. On the contrary, he would have seen British leadership of the EU as all the more imperative because it is now our principal circle of influence. He would have been equally resolute in support of Nato, being the legacy of his wartime alliance with the United States that still secures British security and influence, but it is inconceivable that he would have regarded this as a substitute for the EU.The key point about Churchill’s 1953 “with them but not of them” remark is that it was in the context of France and Germany debating the establishment of an integrated “defence community” separate from the US, a stillborn precursor of the economic community that they went on to found in 1957.Churchill was not in principle against close military engagement with France and Germany, but in the context of the early 1950s he did not want to weaken the Anglo-American bedrock of Nato by supporting a speculative bid for a European army.In the event, the French parliament rejected the defence community, for reasons similar to Churchill’s. However, on economic cooperation Churchill was consistently positive. “We are prepared to consider, and if convinced to accept, the abrogation of national sovereignty, provided that we are satisfied with the conditions and the safeguards,” he said of the Schuman Plan in 1950. A year later, he was more explicit in disowning isolationism: “There are disadvantages and even dangers to us in standing aloof.” And after he left No 10, he supported Macmillan’s application to join the EU, having privately opposed Eden’s ill-fated Suez expedition in 1956.“In defeat, defiance” was another Churchill maxim. He never gave up the struggle to change public opinion and the Conservative party to his way of thinking, even when threatened with deselection as Tory MP for Woodford in Essex, now Iain Duncan Smith’s constituency, for opposing Chamberlain on his Munich agreement with Hitler to dismember Czechoslovakia.The Brexiter argument that Britain has outgrown the old continent has a long pedigree. Global Britain, descended from the “blue water” tradition, assumes a future in which Britain escapes European geography, European engagement and European immigration. Out in that blue yonder, there are no risks, no power imbalances and no limitations on sovereignty.This Global Britain, ludicrously branded “Empire 2.0” by some Brexiters, is a piece of flimsy nonsense, particularly as our former empire is entirely self-governing, the Commonwealth is a club with no clout and there are no uncolonised continents besides the Antarctic ripe for exploitation. The reality is that British strategic thinking has always been – has always had to be – at least as European as global. To argue, as Brexiters do, that we are not leaving Europe but rather the EU is elemental fatuity. The institutions of the EU are today’s Europe: they are where Europe’s states cut their deals, organise the economics, politics and security of our continent, hammer out joint foreign policy and are through which the shared rules that keep our borders open to the friction-free movement of goods, services, money and people are sustained. And all is congruent with democracy, the rule of law and accountability. They are a magnificent achievement. To argue differently is to traduce the evidence of our eyes – and a betrayal of our interests as a European power.For European balance-of-power politics, so advancing our national interest, has been a central theme of our history. We resisted the emergence of Spain, then France and then Germany as would-be dominators of our continent by building countervailing alliances. We helped defend Europe against outside predators – the Turks in their time, and in the last century the Soviet Union. The crusades, misguided as they were, were in their day quintessentially European. Britain built its overseas possessions in part to secure a better counterweight in Europe.As Churchill said, Europe is “where the weather comes from”. It is a Brexit fallacy that being out of the EU means being spared what happens in the EU and the eurozone. Britain has an existential interest in what happens in Europe, as it always has. There is no hiding place in the Atlantic.Today, risks are mounting, democracy is under threat worldwide, even in recently confident and progressive western Europe and North America. Putin’s Russia is behaving like the fascist regimes of the 1930s, backed by sophisticated raids from online troll factories. Citizens – and ominously younger voters in some European countries – are more and more willing to tolerate the subversion of democratic norms and express support for authoritarian alternatives.Oleg Kalugin, former major general of the Committee for State Security (the KGB), has described sowing dissent as “the heart and soul” of the Putin state: not intelligence collection, but subversion – active measures to weaken the west, to drive wedges in the western community alliances of all sorts, particularly Nato, to sow discord among allies, to weaken the United States in the eyes of the people of Europe, Asia, Africa, Latin America, and thus to prepare ground in case the war really occurs. To make America more vulnerable to the anger and distrust of other peoples.In Brexit-voting Weymouth, Captain Malcolm Shakesby of Ukip is unruffled by Putin or European populism. He inhabits the cartoon world of British exceptionalism, and his main concern today is Mrs May’s “sellout” of the referendum result. Brexit, uncorrupted, will be a success. “It will work because the British people are resilient,” he says. Then, in full Dunkirk mode: “In the Second World War, when we were down, we managed to pull through. The French couldn’t hack it, the Netherlands couldn’t hack it, the Belgians couldn’t hack it. We would have done what Churchill said, fight them on the beaches. That’s what nobody else ever does.” Of course Churchill did not actually do that – fighting on the beaches – and his whole statesmanship was to ensure that we did not have to, either.The MP for Shakesby’s South Dorset constituency is a Conservative who won the seat from New Labour in 2010. He, too, is a captain, one Captain Richard Grosvenor Plunkett-Ernle-Erle-Drax, educated at Harrow, then Sandhurst and the Coldstream Guards, grandson of Admiral Sir Reginald Drax and great-grandson of Lord Dunsany, second oldest title in the peerage of Ireland. Drax is quintessential governing class. At least six of his ancestors since the 17th century were MPs for Dorset or Gloucestershire. His home: the ancestral seat, Charborough House, Grade I listed, deer park and 7,000 acres. The grounds are open to the public twice a year, when the villagers of Sturminster Marshall are admitted to sell tea and cakes.Drax’s view on Brexit? “Resignation is the only honourable path” for MPs who won’t accept it. Drax is tribute to the Faragist takeover of the Tory party. It is a party now indifferent to Britain’s place in Europe and blind to the vital need for full engagement with our continent.

I have a growing suspicion that the hardy insects would find that they shared the post-apocalypse wasteland with Theresa May. She has demonstrated an ability to survive existential threats that has astonished scientific opinion.This week, she will have endured a year in Number 10 since the general election that was conceived in hubris and ended in disaster. This is not an anniversary the prime minister will want to linger upon. She went into that campaign with a double-digit lead in the polls and Tory dreams of a landslide and came out of it without a parliamentary majority. The consensus was that her credibility had suffered a fatal dose of political irradiation. Conservative MPs counted her longevity as prime minister in days, maybe weeks, months if they were generous. The spectacle of a premiership going to pieces before the nation’s eyes was magnified by a maladroit and frightened response to the terrible Grenfell Tower inferno. In the wake of that, one senior Tory, usually an astute reader of his party’s moods, offered me the prediction: “She is one more disaster away from being ejected.”He was right to suggest that there would be further calamities, but wrong to conclude that these would be terminal for Mrs May. She had a farcical party conference, followed by a flailing reshuffle that underscored the feebleness of her position. Four of her cabinet have been forced to quit, one of them the effective deputy prime minister. The entire 12 months have been dominated by the joyless grind of managing Tory isions over Brexit, while her earlier hardline rhetoric has melted on contact with the realities of trying to navigate an orderly withdrawal from the EU.Yet there she is, despite it all, still in Number 10. In the immediate aftermath of the election, I dubbed her “the zombie prime minister”. Do I now regret that phrase? No. I still think it an apposite description of a premiership that has never recovered its authority. But perhaps I should have added the caveat that zombies can be very resilient. That which is already dead is hard to kill.From disaster, Mrs May has derived a form of durability. Allies say that nothing else in her political career will match the feeling of abject failure that engulfed her at 10pm on 8 June last year when the exit poll was broadcast. She cried and came close to quitting as prime minister in the subsequent hours. However awful the humiliations that have followed, and whatever further ignominy destiny has in store, nothing will ever be as bad for her as that night.This is her inner personal fortification. Her outer shield has been the numeracy and the inadequacies of the candidates to replace her. During the year since the election, Tories have found it easier to find ways to describe Mrs May as useless than they have to agree which of them would make things better. One of her more successful calculations was giving a big job to Boris Johnson in the belief that this would expose him as fundamentally unfit for large responsibilities. Amber Rudd was sunk by the Windrush scandal. Jeremy Hunt and Sajid Javid fancy their chances. In common with other potential contenders, they want someone else to arrange the disposal of Mrs May rather than get blood spilt on their own hands. Gavin Williamson’s spider has had better reviews from Tory MPs than its owner. Philip Hammond is said to be planning a speech on capitalism. Philip who? The chancellor has been the invisible man. He has adopted such a low profile that it is not so much a submarine strategy as a deep sea ing bell strategy.Not so Michael Gove, who is lurking in a rather obvious way and touting himself as half of a complicated double-headed leadership deal with Ruth Davidson. Before she succumbs to that offer, Ms Davidson would be wise to consult Mr Johnson about the perils of coupling her fortunes to the machinations of Mr Gove. Liberal Tories pant for the leader of the Scottish Conservatives to come south to be their standard bearer, but before anything can come of that she first has to acquire a seat in the right parliament. Then a self-described “pregnant lesbian” would have to take her leadership chances with a shrunken and mainly aged Tory membership whose social attitudes lag behind the country as a whole.These many contenders have something in common: the hunger of their ambition is tempered by caution about timing. There have been 12 months of conversations about replacing Mrs May, but they have all run up against the fear of unleashing a chaotic and vicious struggle for the party that could blow it up. Rivals for the premiership have flinched from that, as they have also shied from taking up the burden of delivering Brexit, an unwillingness to take responsibility for what they willed that is particularly pronounced among the Brexiters. Brexit is the water torture of the May premiership and also its life-preserver. Every Tory who craves the crown has concluded that it would best to let Mrs May perform the contortions necessary to try to hold the party together until it is done.The hard Brexiters have been exposed as bluffers. Jacob Rees-Mogg is all mouth and trousers, as we say in Yorkshire. If his cabal had the will to do so, they could easily assemble the 48 signatures required to trigger a no-confidence vote in Mrs May’s leadership. The regularity with which the Brextremists have threatened to collapse her premiership and then retreated from the deed has revealed the weakness of their own position.Labour has played a significant role in the preservation of Mrs May. She has had no better friend than Jeremy Corbyn, an unwitting and unintended saviour of her premiership. In the immediate aftermath of the election, Labour thought she was there for the taking. His admirers indulged themselves with talk of Mr Corbyn being in Downing Street by Christmas. Tories could also visualise a Corbyn premiership – and decided that this was an outcome more to be loathed than soldiering on with a zombified prime minister. Scared that a leadership battle would precipitate another election that would see Labour roll into power, the Tories clung on to Mrs May for fear of something worse.The Corbyn Terror among Tory MPs has receded since the turn of the year. Labour has become preoccupied with its self-inflicted troubles. The local elections last month did not result in the feared Tory meltdown. Despite everything, the Conservatives have edged into a modest advantage in opinion polls. Mrs May’s personal approval scores have recovered. Her ratings are still deeply negative, but all politics is relative and she bests a Labour leader whose grip on the loyalty of his party’s members makes him irremovable.None of this means that the Conservatives are going to permit Mrs May to lead them for as long as she likes. Some grudging respect for her dogged capacity to soak up punishment doesn’t translate into a willingness to let her front the next general election. The flaws that were pitilessly exposed by the 2017 campaign haven’t been forgotten. The Tory party has not revised its bedrock view that Mrs May cannot be trusted with another election.What it does mean is that the Tories are not panicking as much as they were six months ago. They are not sweating as feverishly as they would be were Labour sitting on a substantial poll lead. Tories have decided they can tolerate leaving Mrs May at Number 10 a while longer.By writing about her survival, I am aware that I tempt fate. Perhaps she will be gone this week. The fundamentals of her position have not changed in the year since she shredded her authority by throwing away her parliamentary majority. She is an enfeebled prime minister in a confined and brittle position. She lives hand to mouth, crisis by crisis. Looming parliamentary votes on Brexit could detonate the Tory party and put her premiership in jeopardy.She would struggle to survive a rejection by the House of Commons of whatever deal with the EU she eventually manages to come back with. Her premiership will never be better than a contingent one. There is nothing noble or inspiring about this status, but a contingent premiership is still better than the alternative, which is an ex-premiership. Each additional day that she endures in Number 10 is, for Mrs May, a victory of sorts. And an example that it is not only the cockroach that can survive apocalypse."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d25ed743457062d6f707123fbf1aa1b700690b20/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7bcf81e447b84c22ef2fc2ccb109776e","title":"street cricket the sport transforming birmingham kids lives","story":"In inner-city areas where children have few facilities, it’s easy to fall in with a bad crowd. One 12-year-old chose a different path, and is now a graduate, cricket coach and teacherAt 12 years old Siraj Ali wasn’t a bad kid. But, like many of the young people he grew up with in the outskirts of Birmingham, he’d hang out on the street at night, sometimes get in trouble at school, and had anger management issues that could boil over.“The area that I come from, the crime rates are really high,” says Ali, a decade later. “In and outside school I was getting into a lot of trouble. I wasn’t being myself. I was being dragged into the wrong crowd.”Birmingham’s reputation for gang culture and the associated crimes – such as those involving knives and guns – is widely reported. In hindsight, Ali, now 22, reckons he was at risk of slipping into that “bad crowd” and that if things hadn’t changed he’d carry a criminal record by now and struggle to get a job.Thankfully, things did change – and in September 2017 he graduated from the University of Wolverhampton with a degree in sport, media, culture and development. He’s currently confident of being hired by a teaching agency and, perhaps most importantly for him, he’s teaching young people cricket at his local leisure centre, where he hopes he can help others negotiate the dangers of growing up in that neighbourhood.“If I hadn’t got involved in cricket something bad would have happened to me,” he says. “When I went to Street they just dragged me in another direction.”He’s referring to Chance to Shine Street, a charity that uses cricket as a means to build young people’s confidence, social skills and focus – while keeping them off the streets for a few hours a week. With the help of its official long-term partners, NatWest – who have a long history of supporting grassroots cricket to support communities and help make the game accessible to all – Chance to Shine Street has helped more than 38,000 youngsters since 2008. The broader Chance to Shine programme has introduced more than 3 million young people – half of whom are girls – to cricket since its inception.Now a coach with the organisation, Ali first encountered Street (as it’s generally known) as an angry 12-year-old. Invited along to a session by a local coach, he grew frustrated, smashed over the wickets and walked out. Luckily, both he and the coaching staff persevered. Ali went on to play around the country in his teens, continued playing for local T20 sides while at university, and is now dedicated to using cricket to help the kids coming of age in the Alum Rock and Saltley areas of Birmingham.“I’ve been coaching at the local leisure centre for four or five years now,” he says. “I enjoy the role because it’s challenging. With some of the kids you don’t know what’s going on at home or at school. But I always try to ask questions: ‘How are your studies? Are you getting into trouble? How are things at home?’”Ali, who coaches primary-school children as well as those in secondary school, reckons the key to Street’s power is the way cricket can help instil a sense of confidence in young people. “Street cricket is available for all kids, and it’s a fun and friendly environment,” he says. “These sessions are in areas where there isn’t much opportunity for kids, and they offer a chance for them to help themselves grow in many ways, such as in confidence. This is very important for kids – it can be very beneficial for them in their education.“When they play in a group, a big group of 13 or 14 kids, it’s a different crowd every time – one’s funny, one’s low on confidence, one’s very confident. They sit together, talk to each other, express how they feel and they become good friends. They work together like that. That’s the main key to our organisation – to help kids work together and get on and help each other.”Many of the young people he’s worked with over the past five years have gone on to a college education or university. The player-turned-coach attributes his ability to reach students to the fact that he’s been through the same things they’re going through the children can relate to him in a way they sometimes can’t to parents or teachers. “I understand them because I came from the same community and I’ve been through this all at a young age,” he says. “It’s all about understanding the kids and what they go through. Some of the children I have worked with are now playing for Warwickshire youth teams, so this is progress, and I will continue to help kids.”Mentoring is something Ali enjoys – and that influenced his choice of degree, which is focused on the development of young people. But it’s been a two-way street. At university, Ali found he was more confident than many of his peers, thanks to his time spent speaking to large groups of young people and working with people from across the charity and beyond.“When I first joined the street project as a coach, things were a lot different and I wasn’t confident leading sessions,” he says. “Coach Khaled worked with me and he started to review my performance. Week by week I was growing in confidence, and this confidence has been vital when I’ve had to make presentations at university or lead my group in front of the whole class. I am now a graduate and I am looking to continue to inspire kids and help them grow their passion for cricket and their education.”As a erse and inclusive sport, cricket truly has no boundaries, and NatWest think that’s worth protecting. That’s why they’ve supported it since 1981. NatWest are proud to be the principal partner of the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) and the official partners of Chance to Shine, reflecting the bank’s own values and commitment to fairness and inclusion.To find out more, visit Natwest Cricket"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b1ad3c2a1f080684bed00f508ae332b5959183d/43_0_5671_3402/master/5671.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=37ee8c57e3345b15d1351dea7dd9112a","title":"the joy of pints and pies how i learned to love uk holidays","story":"Travel writer Anna Hart on how she finally left her passport behind and learned to love holidaying at home in the UKFor most of my life, travel to me meant going as far as I could for as long as I could. I was a glutton for international trips, ticking off European cities I could visit in a weekend, backpacking around swathes of south-east Asia and Central America, and road-tripping across New Zealand and California. A relentless neophiliac, I firmly believed that “away” was intrinsically superior to “home”.It was a trip to New Zealand that planted the first seeds of doubt about my internationally-attuned travel palate. Campervanning around the islands, I realised that I’d been taking a lot of the delights of the UK for granted: our storied towns and villages the fact that long country walks can be bookended by pints and pies in historic pubs a public transport system that reaches into the peripheries our shark-free waters and uncrowded beaches. When enthusiastic UK-bound Kiwis would ask me for recommendations, I desperately wanted to be able to share insider tips beyond the three cities I’d lived in so far: Belfast, Glasgow and London.This experience gently encouraged me to view my homeland through the eyes of a tourist, and when I returned home, I launched Project UK. I began gently, with a day trip to the Somerset town of Bruton, where I wandered around the Hauser \u0026amp Wirth art gallery and stumbled upon a restaurant, At the Chapel, which I would cheerfully eat at every day. Next was a camping trip to Dorset, travelling entirely by public transport and drinking cider at the Square \u0026amp Compass. I swam off Shetland’s wild, deserted beaches I cycled the Kentish coastline, I rock-climbed in the Peak District, and then I realised that much of what I thought I had to travel for was right here on my doorstep.As well as pure pragmatism - saving time travelling, the absence of a time difference or jetlag, reducing my carbon footprint - there are a growing number of “pull factors” keeping me closer to home, stopping me from straying abroad.Embarking on a meaningful relationship with my home country - rather than flightily flouncing off for flings with far-flung destinations - has enriched my enjoyment of history, literature, music and art. These days I track different destinations and bands via Songkick so I can plan UK city breaks around gigs I want to go to - because Cardiff, Liverpool, Leeds, Belfast, Manchester, Newcastle, Glasgow and Edinburgh are some of the best cities in the world in which to catch a gig. I keep a rolling list of destinations that have, until now, only existed in my imagination – the Yorkshire moors that inspired my beloved Brontës, the lakes that I read about in the poetry of Wordsworth, Shelley and Coleridge, and, um, parts of the Northern Ireland coast that provide the backdrop for sex, blood and gore in Game of Thrones.It’s rewarding to bump into a Glaswegian and enthuse about the burgeoning culinary scene in Finnieston. It’s been satisfying to join up some of the dots and understand why post-industrial Birmingham became the birthplace of heavy metal music. And now, when I read a Daphne du Maurier novel like Rebecca or My Cousin Rachel, I can visualise the Cornish scenery she renders through words. I’ll never lose my lust for long-haul international travel, but learning to see the UK through the wide eyes of a visitor means I’ll never take home for granted again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/023f29a85170eda53eb8ecd4ee1d932ab6ee3fc9/0_0_5651_3391/master/5651.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=597bff482d92a878015e406dd1722157","title":"quiz have you got the entrepreneur gene","story":"Dreaming of ditching the nine to five?

This article is part of the ’s 2018 World Cup Experts’ Network, a cooperation between some of the best media organisations from the 32 countries who have qualified for Russia. the is running previews from two countries each day in the run-up to the tournament kicking off on 14 June.On the eve of an under-21 friendly against Spain in March 2011 Raphaël Varane was the kind of player who could talk about “Emile Durkheim and the social bond” or John Keynes’s macroeconomic theories and bring a touch of humour into the conversation by telling his interlocutor “Keynes is more fun”.He was not even 18 at the time. Fifteen months later, and after only 23 games in Ligue 1 with Lens, the club he joined at nine, he was signing a six-year Real Madrid contract for for a €10m fee while taking his A-levels and majoring in economic sciences. “A real bargain for that price,” said the then Lens coach, Laszlo Boloni. “He is a gem, he is learning fast because he listens, he can already read the game very well and he is such a gifted, fast and intelligent defender. Exactly the same as Cristiano Ronaldo was in an attacking version when he started with me at Sporting.”It was Zinédine Zidane, then counselor to Real’s chairman, Florentino Pérez, whose phone call to Varane clinched the deal. “I was at my mother’s home in Hellemmes,” near Lille, Varane remembers. “It was 7.30pm and my phone rang. I was tired, I did not feel like answering and I was not really listening when I suddenly recognised his voice: ‘It’s not a joke, it’s really me,’ said Zidane. I told him politely I was busy revising for my exams and asked him to call back later. But when I hung up, I was thinking ‘shit’ and went to see my older brother who thought I was crazy. I said yes to Real the day before taking my philosophy final exam.” He would explain later: “Don’t call me an intellectual. After all, there are a lot more people taking their A-levels each summer than signing for Real Madrid. I was just a good and serious student.”His first coach at Hellemmes, Christophe Debuyser, says: “At the age of seven or eight, he was already working harder than anyone and most importantly, he never cheated. His familial environment offered him a good structure and proper stability. Thanks to this, he has never fallen into excess.”His father, Gaston, who came from Martinique in the 1970s, worked as an auxiliary nurse in a nearby hospital, his mother, Annie, was an English teacher, his older brother a law student and one of his two sisters is a pharmacist. Not the typical background for the average young professional player. One more thing: he met his future wife, Camille, in high school and they married in Le Touquet in June 2015 in a private ceremony, with no fancy stars around or an expensive party. “She brings me the perfect balance,” he says. “We grew up together, we are very close and complement each other quite well, and we try to keep the same values and simplicity we have been taught.”When Didier Deschamps announced his squad for his first game as France manager in August 2012 against Uruguay, Varane was part of it, with the World Cup winner soberly suggesting that “talent has no age”. But it was not until the following spring that Varane made his international debut at 19 against Georgia, a 3-1 win, before becoming the youngest player since 1910 to captain his country against Armenia in October 2014 when he was 21.“There are players who never mature at 30 and some who do at 20,” said Deschamps. Varane has won three Champions League finals, in 2014, 2017 and 2018 – he missed the 2016 final through injury and the last Euros as well – and has worked successively with José Mourinho, Carlo Ancelotti, Rafa Benítez and Zidane. Not a bad cast to help you improve every day, although it was his early mistake against Germany and a lost aerial duel with the defender Mats Hummels which ruined France’s chances in the quarter-finals of the 2014 World Cup.“I put that behind me now,” he says. “Anyway, it is part of everyday life for a defender: you win some duels, you lose some. My timing is better today and I have learned how to use my body more cleverly.” Guy Stéphan, France’s assistant manager, has said that “Raphaël belongs to a generation, like Paul Pogba, who are not afraid to fail. They keep on trying, look forward and never lose their composure.”Spain will play in Russia with a Barcelona-Real Madrid mix of Gerard Piqué and Sergio Ramos in central defence and France will enter the tournament with the other half and a less experienced partnership of Varane and Samuel Umtiti. The World Cup-winning full-back Bixente Lizarazu, a media pundit, believes Varane can improve and could benefit from finding an edge. “He is quick, talented but I would like him to become a leader and the boss of this defence. Maybe he is too nice.” To which Varane replies: “I am a shy, quiet and cool guy in life. And I am no different on the pitch. I just play to my strengths and my ability.”Patrick Urbini writes for France Football. Follow him on Twitter here.

Torn rather than sliced, those jagged edges are sharp enough to grate a cut clove of the new season’s softly fragrant garlic, something I like to do when there are good tomatoes in the house for pan con tomate.I was brought up on tomatoes on toast made with sliced white Wonderloaf and tinned tomatoes, so the first time my friend James made it for me the way his grandmother did in Spain, the idea suddenly made sense. The thick, open-pored bread was baked until thoroughly crisp, rubbed with a clove of new, sweet garlic, then moistened with grated tomatoes, olive oil (we used Nuñez de Prado) and flakes of sea salt. I begged for basil, but he said no. At home, his family would probably use pan de cristal, similar to ciabatta but thinner and more crisply crusted, and with a chewier and larger-holed crumb (infinitely superior in other words). It is almost impossible to find here, but pretty much any bread is fine, as long as isn’t too dense, or brown, too crusty or too fresh.As with everything so simple, the details need to be carefully thought through. Stale bread is lighter and more airy than fresh, the olive oil needs a peppery kick and the tomatoes are best when verging on the over-ripe, so they collapse into a juicy dressing. A simple thing, perfectly executed.On a slightly more complex note, I’ve been baking this week: a savoury apricot and rosemary-scented foccacia made specifically to go with goat’s cheese. It was worth taking 10 minutes to cook the fruit before adding it to the dough, the result being silky fruit but also a fantastic apricot and rosemary-scented oil with which to moisten the baking bread. As a fruit and herb bread for a sharply lactic, snow-white cheese, it proved easy to make and difficult to beat.ciabatta or pan de cristal 200gcherry tomatoes 400g, ripe but not too sweetolive oil 4 tbspgarlic 3 or 4 cloves Split the bread lengthways. This is easiest with a very long, slim-bladed knife, but tear rather than slice if possible. Cut each half into pieces roughly 7cm x 9cm.Using a coarse-toothed grater, grate the tomatoes into a mixing bowl, then stir in the olive oil with a good pinch of sea salt.Place the bread, cut side up, on a baking sheet and brown lightly under an overhead grill, or else cut side down on a hot griddle.Peel the garlic and cut each clove in half. Rub the garlic over the surface of the toast, discarding each piece as it loses its juice, then spoon the tomato and olive oil over the toast. Trickle with a little more olive oil and serve, with more salt for those who wish it.I have long been an advocate of the baking stone – a thick piece of stone or chunky unglazed tile left in the bottom of the oven to heat up, on which to cook bread or pastry. The extra heat held by the stone ensures a crisp base to pies, loaves, tarts and foccacia. My own has done years of service both as direct heat for a pizza or loaf and as something on which to sit a baking sheet or tart tin. If you are thinking of picking one up for your oven, may I suggest the heavier the better? Whatever, they do wonders for a foccacia.For the dough:strong white bread flour 500geasy-bake yeast 1 7g sachet sea salt 1 tspolive oil 2-3 tbspwarm water 350mlapricots 400golive oil 4 tbsprosemary 3 bushy sprigsRub the bottom of a baking tin, approximately 22cm in diameter, with a little of the olive oil. Set the oven at 230Cgas mark 7.Put the flour and yeast into a large mixing bowl and crumble in the sea salt, then the olive oil and the warm water. Mix thoroughly, adding more water if necessary, to produce a soft, but not sticky dough.Generously flour a board or work surface, tip out the dough, then knead or fold gently but firmly for about 5 minutes. If you wish, use a food mixer with dough hook.When the dough feels elastic, transfer to a lightly floured bowl, cover with a cloth or clingfilm and leave in a warm place to rise for about an hour, until it has doubled in size.Cut the apricots in half and remove their stones. Warm the olive oil in a shallow pan, add the apricots and let them cook for a few minutes until they have softened. Pull the rosemary needles from their stems and add to the apricots, then set aside.Gently remove the dough from its bowl and push it into the oiled tin, pressing it out to reach the edge.Place the apricots on top of the dough then spoon over the rosemary and oil from the tin. Cover with a cloth and leave to rest in a warm place until the dough has risen almost to the top of the tin. Scatter lightly with sea salt.Bake for about 30-35 minutes until the fruit is starting to brown here and there and the dough is springy to the touch. Remove from the oven and leave to cool for 15 minutes before removing from the tin. Place on the table, with some goat’s cheese, for everyone to tear apart."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d448314f1fd55ae5a409a072141edf81c543d2f3/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c86556758fb74fd0b2207b1fdb798332","title":"the 10 best terrazzo items for the home in pictures","story":"Chip in.

The injury required surgery but seemed unlikely to curtail a career in the armed forces.Although it was never quite right after the incident, he continued in his role. Then, one day in 2014, while serving in Kabul, Afghanistan, he reached for his rifle and felt a blinding pain in the same shoulder. The pins that were holding it together had been ripped out, tearing tendons and fracturing the bone.“In my mind I knew it was all over then, the pain was so severe I couldn’t breathe,” he recalls of the incident. “Things went downhill from there.”He attempted to continue his job, but after a few weeks Kiff’s senior officer made it clear he was in no position to function effectively in what was a war zone. He was flown back to his base in Germany where he found his problems shelved as the rest of the regiment began a move back to the UK. The injury also meant that a pending promotion was off the table because he was now considered unfit for duty. Serious injury often signals the end of a career in the armed forces but making the transition back to civilian life can be a very difficult process for both the service person affected and their family.With little external support and constant chronic pain he began to sink into severe depression, which soon had an impact on his relationship.“I knew Mike was struggling badly from the calls we had when he was in Afghanistan, but when he returned to base it began to fall apart almost from the moment he walked through the door. He was no longer the same man who had gone away,” says wife Linda. The couple had met while Mike was on leave in Bournemouth, married in 2006 and have two children.As the barracks emptied out around them, their problems were low priority. However, Mike had some good fortune when a medical officer recommended a break at Brydon House, a recently opened personnel recovery centre that had received major funding from The Royal British Legion.“I had physiotherapy, received specialist counselling and found people who were prepared to listen to my problems. It was a completely different level of support, a hundred times better,” he says.After a lengthy recovery process, Mike was medically discharged and the family returned to Bournemouth from Germany. Unfortunately, their problems worsened. They found themselves homeless and were forced to move in with Linda’s parents. Meanwhile, Mike was jobless, in severe pain and on antidepressants. Linda took a job working nights. Their relationship deteriorated rapidly.“I had no one to turn to,” says Linda. “I’m Mike’s support system, of course, so I took the brunt of it. He was jobless for a year and I was working full time. Our roles changed completely, which only added to the stress. It wasn’t a healthy situation but I discovered I could also get support from the Legion. Until then I thought they were just fundraisers.“They advised me to adapt my thought process towards him. I talked to them on a number of occasions and they were always a huge help. We had hit a wall in our marriage and their support was crucial to us getting through it.”“My issues had begun to affect our relationship and we were struggling,” agrees Mike. “The Legion were there to support us. We were both able to talk to people about what was going on. I was able to get anything from a sympathetic ear to practical financial guidance and help finding a job. Linda got advice about how to manage me because I was depressed and angry.”Slowly, with support from the Legion, the couple have rebuilt their lives. Mike now works as a civilian instructor teaching fibre optics to military personnel and Linda has a job in retail. Mike is still on medication and has good days and bad, but knows he can always pick up the phone and talk to someone.In 2017 the couple ran the London Marathon to raise funds for the organisation. “It was a way of saying thank you and having a common goal also helped reconnect us,” says Mike. “I think it’s safe to say we’d probably be orced without them and if that had happened I don’t know what would have happened to me. It would have been the final straw.”To find out more about The Royal British Legion click here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f03cbc57766d6fd01351b3481d35e44ea003237/0_86_4500_2699/master/4500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aaed485f901db6506f8d94cdf8437145","title":"low paid face decade wage squeeze","story":"The wages of 10 million low-paid workers have stalled for two decades and face pressure for a decade to come, according to a bleak assessment of Britain’s future jobs market.Global economic competition, automation, the shift to the gig economy and a widening regional ide will see further pressure placed on the incomes of those earning between £10,000 and £15,000, it warns.The analysis by the Centre for Social Justice (CSJ) thinktank, which is on the political right and chaired by the former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith, also blamed a chronic national failure to boost skills and education. It will be seen as another warning to Theresa May from Conservative figures to kickstart her domestic agenda. There have been concerns within the party that the focus on Brexit has led to inaction in other crucial areas that could hold Britain back after its exit from the European Union.The analysis, co-written by Boris Johnson’s former economic adviser and Brexit supporter Gerard Lyons, concludes that wages of those on the lowest salaries stalled long before the 2008 financial crash. It warns that the current evidence shows that most never escape a life on low pay. The centre’s support for action on low pay shows that it is now an issue of concern across the political spectrum, with automation expected to place further pressure on jobs in some low-paid sectors unless new skills and opportunities are developed.Britain does not compare well with other developed nations when it comes to low pay, it states. Taking data from manufacturing, and giving the US a score of 100, Switzerland topped the table with a pay rate of 155, followed by Norway on 126, Germany on 111 and France on 97. However, the UK was much further behind, on 73.While the report shares concerns about low pay, it argues that the UK should prepare for automation by stripping back taxes and regulation. “The biggest opportunity for the UK is to unleash the potential of the private sector, particularly small and medium-sized firms, helped by lower regulations and taxes,” it states.“The wider macroeconomic environment has driven some of these changes. Globalisation has added to intense competition, suppressing costs and wage growth.”It warns of the reliance of the UK economy on the financial sector, Britain’s continuing budget deficit and the regional imbalances between London and the rest of the country.Half the people employed in so-called elementary occupations, such as bar staff, clerks, care workers and labourers, are on low pay, as defined by two-thirds of the median income of £25,000 a year.It urges a skills overhaul to deal with the coming pressures. The authors conclude: “The British labour market has changed significantly in the last 20 years. There are more people in work than at any time on record, driven partially by a growth in the number of women entering the\u0026nbspworkforce, the increase in the number of people working part-time, people working far longer into old age, and a large influx of workers from abroad.“This far more erse workforce is\u0026nbspincreasingly employed in the service sector, as manufacturing has continued to cut the number of workers, and mobility between low-paid, low-skilled jobs and high-paid, high-skilled jobs seems to be decreasing.”Other research suggests there is better news for those on low pay. The Resolution Foundation thinktank recently found that a smaller proportion of UK workers are low paid now than at any time since the early 1980s, due to above-inflation increases in the government’s national living wage. The national minimum wage has risen from £6.70\u0026nbspin 2016 to £7.50 in 2017 and £7.83 from April 2018."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a24a99d5895d88c5ccc8d6bb565869ded9d20581/0_231_6878_4128/master/6878.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c3b919b98d5e146d4bbee59960c75b68","title":"bt broadband connection no internet scottish highlands","story":"We recently moved to a house in the Scottish Highlands.

The neo soul queen may be upfront about her age – tweaking the lyrics of Me to sing: “This year I turned 46” – but she still has the youthful insouciance that brought her acclaim as a thrilling live performer in the 90s. Drowned by an oversized cream suit and enormous wodge of crimped hair, Badu is the sparky counterpoint to her ultra-tight backing band, bashing out beats on a drum machine as she introduces “the 90s babies” to classics like Next Lifetime and Tyrone.But she’s late, and the curfew comes anyway – after barely an hour, she’s on a mid-set high during Bag Lady when the plug is pulled. It was always going to be this way – Badu isn’t renowned for her punctuality, for a start, but Field Day, now in its 11th year, is under strict orders to keep a lid on the noise and chaos. This is the festival’s first appearance in south London after events behemoth AEG nudged it out of its slot in east London’s Victoria Park. Residents of the affluent area around Brockwell Park were quick to raise the alarm, warning of vandalism and damage to bioersity. Their concerns seem to have been taken seriously, with curfews strictly monitored and stewards for miles around. The downsizing just about works – Field Day has always had a homespun feel to it – but at times the site feels overwhelmingly packed. With Badu in the headline slot, Friday’s lineup demonstrates a shift in priorities for London’s younger music fans, who have developed a serious thirst for jazz. From the 70s-style ensemble showdowns of Moses Boyd Exodus and the Comet Is Coming to the hypnotic Ethio-jazz of Hailu Mergia, about half the day’s acts are loosely jazz, often cross-pollinating with hip-hop, Afrobeat and soul. And on the main stage, the extraordinary falsetto of Moses Sumney heralds a potential successor to Badu’s eccentric crown, with the LA singer beefing up songs from last year’s Aromanticism with violin, clarinet and guitar. The perplexing charms of Jimothy Lacoste start Saturday off on a different note, as north London’s viral wonderkid brings a hint of knowing wit to his absurd iPad pop about “future baes” and London buses. New York rapper Princess Nokia caters to a similarly young and enthusiastic crowd, mixing juicy autobiography with hip-hop, jungle and, on new tracks, early 00s emo. Her a cappella Blink-182 cover is dreadful, but who else would dare?Elsewhere, dance music is the focus. The Barn, a high-spec rave tent, fills up immediately and stays full – Four Tet’s headline slot has to be paused temporarily to relieve the crush. Finally, Fever Ray closes the weekend with a dose of a radical art-punk energy. Karin Dreijer is flanked by two singer-dancers – one in a stunningly grotesque muscle-suit – and an all-women band as she turns the abrasive rave-pop of 2017’s Plunge into a choreographed celebration of queer sex and mental rebirth. The anthemic peak comes with To the Moon and Back, as Dreijer’s voice is drowned out by thousands of (mostly women) hollering: “I want to run my fingers up your pussy!” For once, it’s a welcome disruption to the festival order."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a287333a791cf4c1126d3565f15ce4c4c2a66688/0_164_4929_2957/master/4929.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7d12397a4a9246ca1563e501b57fb82f","title":"patti smith review brighton charismatic goof punk rock poet","story":"The punk rock poet’s snarl was nowhere to be seen and she even got away with telling fans this was a London warmupIt feels a little strange to hear Patti Smith, poet laureate of punk rock, expounding on her love of the Sunday evening Inspector Morse spinoff Endeavour between songs, but here we are. Confined to her hotel room on Friday night by a heavy Brighton sea mist, she says – “I couldn’t see shit” – her evening was enlivened by watching an episode of the period detective drama on ITV3. Over on her Instagram page, she’s even been ruminating on the philosophical qualities of the show’s dialogue.This is not necessarily what one might expect from someone regularly held up as the living embodiment of a certain fearsome rock and roll cool – a woman who recovered from slipping over on stage at Glastonbury by snarling “I fell on my fuckin’ ass … because I am a fuckin’ animal” – but tonight at least, Patti Smith cuts an unexpectedly goofy figure onstage. She fluffs lyrics, stops one song, argues with her backing band about how to end another, chucklingly announces that she’s treating the gig as merely a rehearsal for her appearance at a London festival the following day and demands the house lights be turned up “in case there’s a potential boyfriend” in the audience. Indeed, Smith is so charismatic and likeable that she can pretty much get away with anything, up to and including departing the stage midway through the set “to go to the bathroom”, her backing band busking through a medley of Velvet Underground songs in her absence. At the conclusion of Ghost Dance, she tells the audience to raise their arms and “shake out the ghosts” and the venue is suddenly filled with hands dutifully flapping above heads. She plays a cover of Midnight Oil’s late-80s stadium rocker Beds Are Burning, which isn’t much improved by Smith appending some ecologically themed incanting – “Man in his infinite lack of wisdom sent his toxins into the sea!” she bellows – and a plodding version of John Lennon’s Mind Games, which features Smith reading the lyrics off a sheet of paper and concludes with the singer’s own appraisal of Lennon’s lasting message: “He wanted you to make love! Not war! Not war!” Smith has long had a thing for unlikely cover versions – in the mid-90s she was wont to favour audiences with a version of Deep Purple’s Smoke on the Water, while among the selections on her 2012 album Twelve was her interpretation of Tears for Fears’ Everybody Wants to Rule the World – but it’s hard not to think she’s got far better songs of her own tucked away in her back catalogue than either of these. Her own music ranges from chaotic – Because the Night sounds oddly rickety – to transcendent: Dancing Barefoot benefits from having its studio gloss stripped away, a version of Pissing in the River has a glowering power. Listening to her attack Gloria with a ferocity that makes it feel like something she came up with yesterday, rather than 43 years ago, you’re struck by the fact that her voice has proved apparently immune to the ravages of time: she sounds exactly the same at 71 as she did in 1975. It ends with a ragged attack on People Have the Power, prefaced by a sly apology from Smith herself. “I made a lot of mistakes tonight. I always fuck up in Brighton,” she shrugs. “Everywhere else I’m perfect.” And then she heads off, perhaps to see what’s on ITV3.

It should be learning from the new Italian populist coalition government, which has plans that would defy EU rules on debt, he said, suggesting that Britain should start breaching EU rules by pursuing policies such as signing trade deals. He also backed a change in leadership.“We’ve got to have that self-confidence to make breaches,” he told the Observer. “There’s no point in voting for freedom if you don’t know what to do when you’re free. What is true is that you have a whole lot of people who didn’t want this to happen who are in charge of it happening.“I would go to Gove. He’s the only minister who is still being a minister.

I don’t think May can carry Brexit through any more.”He added: “Italy has confronted the EU – they’ve said they will go ahead and be in breach of its rules.“We should say, ‘we’ve got to have life after this, so we’re creating that life. We are creating trade agreements which are in breach of everything, because we won’t be in breach by the time you come to take us to court’. That’s how Elizabeth I would have been leading with this.”His backing for Gove risks reigniting the Tory debate about May’s leadership, with some Brexiters worried that Britain could end up being locked into a customs union with the EU that would prevent it pursuing an independent trade policy. In reality, few Tory MPs want an unpredictable leadership election which could further destabilise the party. However, a challenge to May’s leadership could emerge should pro-Brexit MPs conclude there is a better alternative.Gove was one of the figureheads of the successful Vote Leave campaign. His botched attempt to succeed David Cameron in 2016 saw him widely condemned by Tory MPs for betraying Boris Johnson, whose leadership bid he had been supporting. He was then sacked from the frontbench by May. However, he has been enjoying something of a renaissance since returning to the cabinet as environment secretary last year. “No other politician could have made such an impact in that job,” said an ally.A source close to Gove said the environment secretary was “fully supportive of the prime minister and will continue to be so”. He added: “He believes it’s vital we get behind our prime minister to deliver the Brexit 17.4 million people voted for.”Odey, who has also donated to Ukip in the past, said he believed that May was a gifted technocrat, but questioned her handling of Brexit. “The European Union are not good at hitting a moving ball,” he said. “The problem is, Theresa May is not good at hitting a moving ball, either.“As someone said about May, she should have joined the civil service, rather than becoming a politician. She is perfect for that, but she can’t make a decision. So there is no leadership.“We should be reaching out to Italy. We should be saying that we have so many of the same problems.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c51ca7b86ee58f241b9759df8074c3e3204d567/0_146_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=80b1786cf587740dd5f96a175b5ec94d","title":"jonathan aitken to be ordained as a deacon","story":"Former Conservative minister became a Christian while in prison for perjuryJonathan Aitken, the former Conservative cabinet minister who served a prison sentence for perjury, is to be ordained and plans to work as an unpaid prison chaplain.Aitken became a Christian while serving a prison sentence for perjury in 1999 after lying on oath in a libel case against the .Now he is to be ordained as a deacon later this month at St Paul’s cathedral by the new bishop of London, Sarah Mullally.“I am having a slight struggle tempering my enthusiasm with proper Christian humility,” he told the Sunday Times.The disgraced politician applied to become a deacon last year, and went through the routine process of “discernment”, during which church figures assess applicants’ commitment and aptitude. “I don’t know if they went through the press cuttings,” he said.The diocese of London said Aitken had undergone a risk assessment and other necessary checks.Aitken, 75, has encountered scepticism about his conversion to Christianity, but said he did not get upset about the “bucketfuls of cynicism poured over my head”.“In a different era, I’d have been one of the cynics myself. If I’d had a parliamentary colleague who’d got into trouble, gone to jail and come out saying, ‘I’ve found God’, I’d have said, ‘Oh, how very convenient for him’.”After his release, he studied theology but initially resisted the idea of ordination. However, the “nagging insistence” did not go away. Now, “I feel I’ve got the energy for it and, above all, I’ve got the calling for it.” But, he added: “18 years ago, I think if they’d had any sense, the Church of England would have rejected me. Remember what a hot potato I was – going through this downward spiral of defeat, disgrace, orce, bankruptcy and jail – so I don’t think they’d have been queuing up to have me as a curate.”He hoped that many of his former parliamentary colleagues and ex-prisoners would attend the service on 30 June, at which 38 people will be ordained as deacons. “I live in a more real world now and am very happy with it,” he said.Graham Tomlin, bishop of Kensington, said: “I have known Jonathan Aitken for several years and this is a calling that has grown within him and been tried and tested by many others. “His experience of the prison system, both from the inside and the outside, gives him a unique perspective to offer Christian ministry in this vital area of our life as a society. “He brings Christian learning from his theological studies, wide life experience, knowledge of the wider issues in criminal justice and a pastoral understanding of the needs of prisoners that will help strengthen the church’s ministry to all.”Aitken was sentenced to 18 months at the Old Bailey after admitting perjury and perverting the course of justice.While a government minister in charge of defence procurement, he allowed aides of the Saudi royal family to pay his £1,000 hotel bill during a stay at the Paris Ritz in September 1993. When the  obtained a copy of the bill and challenged Aitken, he told the paper that his wife, Lolicia, had paid his part of it using money he had given her. He claimed he had spent a private weekend in Paris and had not had any business meetings.He sued the  for libel, saying: “If it falls to me to start a fight to cut out the cancer of bent and twisted journalism in our country with the simple sword of truth and the trusty shield of fair play, so be it.” He repeated his claims about the hotel bill in the witness box.The 16-day libel hearing collapsed after evidence was produced that Aitken’s wife and daughter, who was also embroiled in his account, were in Switzerland during the weekend in question when he had said they were in Paris.Sentencing Aitken, Mr Justice Scott Baker said: “For nearly four years you wove a web of deceit in which you entangled yourself and from which there was no way out unless you were prepared to come clean and tell the truth. Unfortunately you were not.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dcc4e87b652521547b5423877168e33e17c52e0d/9_424_5459_3274/master/5459.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=50549c0ba720c14bbef393d6a2ef26ed","title":"obesity food poverty cheap bread","story":"Cinnamon Square craft bakery, in a historic building in Rickmansworth, near Watford, has been full of children on their half-term break learning the ancient art of proving and kneading dough.Its owner, Paul Barker, likes to set a test to help them see how different “real” bread is from the white, sliced factory loaf most of them are used to. Take a piece of white sliced and rub it in your hands it quickly turns in to a grey, tacky ball that looks as unappetising as old chewing gum. Try the same with a well-made loaf and it just breaks in to crumbs. Think about the chewing-gum-like lump in your stomach. You may be able to buy a large loaf of that for as little as 45p in the supermarket, but how much good will it do you?“We focus on time – it takes anything from 27 hours to 152 hours to make one of our loaves. The bread is more nutritious, more flavoursome and more digestible. The children are so not used to it, but they are converted,” Barker said. He has passed on his award-winning bread-making skills to more than 12,000 children to date, visiting primary and secondary schools as well as giving classes in his bakery.This inequality gap has grown much bigger in the past decade. Obesity is a disease of poverty, much as cholera was in the 19th century. It does not exclusively affect the poor, and rates are going up across the board, but those who live in deprived areas have far less chance of escaping it – or the catalogue of diseases that come with it, from cancer to diabetes.Researchers studying this “social gradient in overweight” across different countries see a pattern emerging. Obesity is a form of malnutrition, they argue, and the greater the structural inequality within a society, the more that people living under financial and social constraints lack the opportunities for an active, healthy life.Tam Fry, chairman of the National Obesity Forum, says: “The simple matter is that obesity is usually the province of socio-economic grades D and E, who cannot afford fruit and vegetables even when they know about good diet, so they feed their families highly processed food, which is less nutritious.”How we now make our bread – a staple for centuries – sums up the problems of a society where healthy eating comes at a price that is just too high for many. “I don’t touch white sliced bread myself,” said Fry, “but it’s cheap, and you can stuff something cheap between it, which may also be highly processed and unhealthy, and call it a sandwich, a meal. There is a distinct difference between the lower and the middle-class larder.”Barker makes bread the way it has been made for generations, using just well-milled flour, yeast, water, and a little salt. Bread like this is called the staff of life because it contains so many vital nutrients: essential fats, fibre, protein, more than 20 vitamins and minerals, and carbohydrates. Since staples by definition account for a large proportion of our intake, if the staple of the diet is healthy, it is much easier to ensure that the diet overall is healthy. But the nutritional gulf between a well-made wholemeal loaf and a white-sliced factory one is enormous.When whole wheat is milled into white flour, the vitamins and minerals are reduced by more than half. The essential-oil-rich germ, which has the greatest concentration of nutrients, is sold off as animal feed. Concern that over-refining might be leaving humans malnourished compared with their livestock was first raised in 1919, and eventually governments required millers to put back a few of the vitamins and minerals through fortification, although they are not restored to the levels found in wholemeal flour.It was in the early 1960s that scientists at the British Baking Industries Research Association in Chorleywood, Hertfordshire, developed a way of making bread that dispensed with the time required by traditional methods.They found air and water could be incorporated into dough if it was mixed at very high speeds in mechanical mixers. It needed double the quantity of yeast to make it rise, and chemical oxidants to get the gas in, and hardened fat to provide structure – without the fat the bread collapsed, in early experiments.Since flavour develops during proving, the new loaf needed more salt to make it taste of something. It also needed emulsifiers to plug the gaps, enabling the dough to retain more air. The process removed labour, reduced costs and gave much higher yields of bread from each sack of flour because the dough absorbed so much more water. The chemicals needed are now mostly incorporated into a premix of additives with soya flour, and labelled as “flour treatment agents”. Extra pure gluten is added to strengthen the flour so it can survive the factory process. This Chorleywood bread process is now ubiquitous, and just three giant baking companies dominate the British market.White bread like this has a glycaemic index score of around 70 (the GI index measures how rapidly food triggers a rise in blood sugar and the release of insulin). Excessive consumption of refined carbohydrates over-stimulates insulin production, leading to blood-sugar highs and lows, which leave you feeling hungry and liable to overeat. Wholemeal bread scores only 50. Stoneground wholemeal is lower still at 30. The slower release of its energy keeps you feeling full longer.On health grounds the choice between the two should be simple. But Barker’s bread costs £2.45 for a large white, and more than £4 for a large speciality wheat and rye loaf. A supermarket white sliced loss leader can cost just 45p. And this is only one example of the poor being routinely priced out of healthier food.Whatever the government comes up with this week, Elizabeth Dowler, professor emerita at Warwick University, who has researched food poverty for the government, says better wages must be part of any solution. Which should mean less cheap bread in shopping baskets.“Obesity is the canary in the mine. It tells us there is something seriously wrong with not just the food system but the whole economic system. When you talk to poor parents about how they manage on very low incomes, you learn that they have so little that food is a long, long way down the list. Unless you address the social contexts in which people live, you’ll never really tackle obesity. What they are up against will continue to defeat them.”Felicity Lawrence is author of Not on the Label (Penguin, £9.99).The price of a basic sliced white loaf – fifth of the cost of a traditionally made white loaf from a specialist bakerNumber of vitamins and minerals in a non-processed loaf of bread which, with essential fats, fibre, protein and carbohydrates, make up what we need for good healthThe number of British four- and five-year-olds who are severely obese when they start schoolGlycaemic index score for a basic loaf of processed white bread its wholemeal equivalent scores 50 and stoneground wholemeal 30"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e09838fec2c7aaed67d8fb7850d91fad95567f8c/0_84_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39b42bc30084476f3be82cfb207a6f20","title":"renters union shoddy housing cost fortune acorn bristol","story":"Faced with soaring rents and mouldy rooms, Bristol’s angry tenants have formed the Acorn renters’ union – and their protests are spreading around the countryIt is a warm, sunny Saturday lunchtime in the centre of Bristol. Somewhere else in the country a royal wedding is about to take place, but here a group of two dozen demonstrators in red T-shirts are heading into TSB, armed with a list of demands. “Private renting isn’t fun,” they sing, “when you’re paying for a slum. Stop it happening to you, better join the Acorn crew. Housing is a human right, won’t give up without a fight”.The organisation behind the good-natured protest is a trade union for renters called Acorn, first set up in Bristol four years ago. Since then, as frustration and anger about the housing market – and particularly the conditions for private renters – has grown, the group has gradually spread around the country, with branches springing up in cities including Brighton and Sheffield. Anny Cullum, an activist and NHS administrator, says that until she got involved in Acorn, “there didn’t seem to be anything similar in the community. The way to ensure you have your right to a proper, decent and dignified way of living is for ordinary people to band together.”Acorn frequently works through direct action: members organise protests in their spare time, taking photos on their mobile phones and sharing them on social media with the aim of embarrassing their targets into agreeing to their demands – forcing landlords to repair mouldy properties or stopping evictions they consider unjust. They have targeted TSB because the bank has clauses in its buy-to-let mortgages that forbid landlords from renting to people on benefits, to asylum seekers, and in some circumstances to students. But on the night before the protest, having notified the bank of their intention to demonstrate, TSB relents an email is sent to Acorn indicating the bank will change its terms and conditions so that buy-to-let mortgage holders can rent to people on benefits.“This is a massive win,” Cullum says, using a megaphone to address the assembled protesters. “If we weren’t here today, we wouldn’t be finding out about this, this wouldn’t be happening.” (Although the group is quick to argue that the other prohibitions ought to change too.) For its part, TSB confirms the policy change in an email the bank says it has been reviewing this “for some time”, but the timing of its concession does not seem coincidental.In April, a group of Acorn protesters in Bristol prevented a court-appointed bailiff from evicting Sally Andrews and her three children from a property owned by Ernest Arathoon, a former director of Bristol City. Andrews complained about the property’s disrepair after moving in a year ago – there were problems with the gas and damp. Arathoon said she was behind on her rent, and the property had only fallen into disrepair after she moved in. Acorn argued that the eviction was illegal anyway, because the tenant had not received the documents she should have done when she moved in, including gas safety and energy performance certificates. The landlord said Acorn had got its facts wrong. “A lot of us showed up – about 30 of us,” says Ajmal Miah, an Acorn activist and student at the University of the West of England. “There was a community of people standing up for this tenant.” There is persistent frustration among Acorn members about private landlords who supply poor quality housing Ballard recalls an early battle on behalf of a woman who had been living with “extreme levels of damp, fist-sized mushrooms growing on the walls of her bedroom”. Acorn members picketed a letting agency and the landlord’s business. Ultimately, the campaign apparently forced the landlord to pay for thousands of pounds worth of damp proofing at the woman’s house.In recent years, rents in Bristol have been soaring, fuelled in part by a buoyant local economy, and also by Londoners, priced out of the capital, moving west. Louis Herbert, an Acorn organiser, says that in the five and a half years he has lived in Bristol, rooms that cost around £250 a month, in the Easton area, are now going for £400-500. This inner city neighbourhood was once multicultural and working class, but Herbert says he has had to move out: “I can’t afford to live in that area any more.”Students in the city have their own set of related concerns. Bristol Cut the Rent is a sister group to Acorn, and its members are frustrated by the price and quality of housing in a city with two expanding universities, Bristol and the University of the West of England. Bristol University student numbers were 17,100 in 2004-5 in 2017-18 they were 25,024. Nic Hamer, a second year who studies English, says: “I struggled to pay my rent in my first year and it was £107 per week – pretty much the cheapest you could pay”.After four years of successful campaigning, Acorn is now recognised by the city council as a voice for private renters. There is wide sympathy in the union for the local authority, particularly since the election of Labour’s Marvin Rees as mayor of Bristol in 2016. While there are repeated complaints that there is not enough social housing, there is also an acceptance that the council’s ability to build is constrained by central government. But that didn’t stop Acorn from opposing a clumsy attempt last year to end a council tax exemption for some of the city’s poorest households. “We were only asking councillors to stick to their manifesto,” says Aidan Cassidy, a former Bristol University student who now works for the local energy supplier, Bristol Energy.There are two tiers of Acorn backers: there are around 500 paying members in Bristol. There is no specific fee, although people are asked to contribute one hour’s pay per month and the website suggests £8, £10 or £15 as possible sums. On top of that there are around 7,500 supporters: those who sign up for the mailing list and could be willing to turn up if needed. With some external support, it is enough to pay for a handful of organisers, and Acorn hopes to boost its presence around the country.Ask Acorn members what frustrates them most about the housing market, and they tend to reply that the system seems increasingly rigged against them. There is too much damp, too much hassle, and economic interests are conspiring to ensure rents keep rising. Sasha Sadjady, a civil servant and one of Acorn’s founder members, says she got involved because renting was “incredibly precarious … places are snapped up in 24 hours. Landlords want to know all sorts of information about you. Then, when you are in the house, you only have six months’ security. Such is the precarity, you are never ever able to feel comfortable in what should be your own home.”Sadjady says what annoys her the most about the housing market is a lack of understanding of the underlying economic forces at work – indicating what sort of longer term politics may emerge from a group like Acorn. “Sometimes it annoys me when you say it amounts to problems with certain landlords. There is always an antagonism there, because they are making a profit out of something that should be your right.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de4fd4b42309ad44898e004c62c885712d225d68/0_49_1936_1162/master/1936.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1e8e5817e4872231c994e6f9029ff108","title":"maria sharapova blows away pliskova to lay down french open marker","story":"The cold war is over. Serena Williams, husbanding as much diplomatic warmth as she deemed appropriate, inferred strongly before her blockbuster match here on Monday against Maria Sharapova that her Russian rival had been indulging in fake news.Williams on Saturday beat Julia Görges 6-3, 6-4 to go through to the fourth round, not long after Sharapova had blitzed the sixth seed, Karolina Pliskova, 6-2, 6-1 in under an hour. Later, after batting away a couple of innocuous questions about her daughter, Olympia, Williams was confronted with a 14-year-old remark by Donald Trump that “Maria’s shoulders were incredibly alluring and ... you were intimidated by her supermodel good looks”. Pausing, she replied: “I can’t say I have been intimidated by anyone.”That became blindingly apparent as she opened up both barrels, ever so quietly. “We are both on a comeback for two totally different reasons. She’s been on her journey for over a year and I just started mine a couple months ago. It’s something new and different. I don’t know what else to say.”Yes, she did. Asked about passages in Sharapova’s recent book in which she intimated the reason Williams has dominated the Russian in 19 of their 21 matches over 14 years was because Williams was so distraught at losing to her in the 2004 Wimbledon final she cried in the locker room, Williams looked surprised.“It would be more shocking if I wasn’t in tears. I do have emotions and I wear them on my sleeve. I’m human. What happens there should definitely maybe stay there and not necessarily talk about it in a not‑so‑positive way in a book.”On Monday’s fourth-round match – the most anticipated of the tournament – she said: “Quite frankly, she’s probably a favourite. She’s been playing for over a year now. I just started. I’m just trying to get my bearings. This will be another test. This is one of her best surfaces, and she always does really, really well here.” Except when playing Williams, to whom she lost in the 2013 final.She continued: “I don’t have any negative feelings towards her. It was a little disappointing to see in that hearsay book. Especially having a daughter, I feel negativity is taught. Women, especially, should bring each other up.“A lot of people always assume that I feel a different way and it’s not true. You know, if anything, I feel like we should encourage each other and the success of one female should be the inspiration to another. I have said that a thousand times. I always get inspired by other women that are doing well.“Before her incident of drugs or not, I just feel she was doing good. Now she’s doing well again, and I have never had any hard feelings toward her. Whenever I play her, obviously I go out there the way I play everyone else. I go extremely hard. I don’t play anyone different. I play everyone so hard because they play me really hard, and I always have to be ready for it.“As a fan, I was really excited for it to come out and I was really happy for her. And then the book was a lot about me. I was surprised about that, to be honest. I didn’t expect to be reading a book about me that wasn’t necessarily true. I didn’t know she looked up to me that much or was so involved in my career.Without abusing the metaphor, Williams had the ultimate cornerman on court in Mike Tyson, who was there cheering for her on Saturday evening. “Seeing him there is always pretty cool. He was obviously such a great champion.”Whatever the verbal heat generated, Williams is probably right in her assessment of her next match. It would be one of her best career triumphs to overcome Sharapova again, at 36 and in the early stages of her comeback. For Sharapova, losing would be another devastating blow – and might underpin her extraordinary will to win against all odds."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ce60288cd36a3fe7895dbe2a6f2a09822bd0c5c/0_14_3556_2134/master/3556.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af5598e42b89d6fbea7205dc5c33520a","title":"us national spelling bee facial expressions in pictures","story":"Competitors in the Scripps National Spelling Bee often struggle to contain their emotions when asked to spell obscure or complicated words.

Curran isn’t getting any swing so is trying to mix things up a little the last ball of the over is an excellent yorker that Faheem blocks.34th over: Pakistan 107-6 (Salahuddin 28, Faheem 3) There’s no way out of this predicament for Pakistan, though Salahuddin in particular is showing no sign of giving his wicket away. He’s waited a long time for his Test debut. “Mine was an Ashes Test at Headingley in 1968,” says Barry Davis. “I was 12 years old. Having played sort of make-believe cricket with my older brother in our bedroom for a few years – I recall you chose your Test sides and rolled two kinds of dice, which indicated balls bowled, runs scored, types of dismissal etc. – which were, I think, always based on Ashes sides, it was wonderful to see the likes of Inverarity, Redpath and Ian Chappell in the flesh, so to speak.”33rd over: Pakistan 105-6 (Salahuddin 27, Faheem 2) “Finding it jolly tricky to calibrate the BBQ so that the leg of lamb on the rotisserie is ready precisely at the moment the final Pakistan wicket falls,” says Kim Thonger. “Does anyone have any tips? Ideally ones that don’t result in accusations of match fixing, or food poisoning.”32nd over: Pakistan 105-6 (Salahuddin 27, Faheem 2) Bess has switched around the wicket to the right-handed Salahuddin, with a leg slip and short leg. He’s bowling pretty well and isn’t afraid to toss the ball up. Salahuddin takes a sharp single, which leads to a run-out referral against Faheem. He was home safely, though he would have been out with a direct hit.“While we can all relish the sight of a bowler really on song and taking loads of scalps, for the team it’s probably better when the wickets are shared around, as here,” says John Starbuck. “Ifwhen Stokes comes back, in late summer, it could be mainly as a batsman (probably replacing Malan if he doesn’t do much else this season) because the team won’t need any more bowlers.”Do you think? I can’t see them playing six bowlers, except in the subcontinent, so you might as well pack the batting. I’d expect Stokes to replace Curran for the first Test against India. 31st over: Pakistan 102-6 (Salahuddin 26, Faheem 0) Pakistan need another 87 runs to make England bat again. The new batsman Faheem gets one of them with a pleasant cover drive off Curran.“Another David Brown here,” writes, well, David Brown. “It was our prep school outing to Lord’s to watch England play the Windies in June 1980 our headmaster’s brother was Donald Carr of the TCCB and we were a bus full of mini cricket obsessives. I remember having great seats directly under where the Media Centre now stands. Viv Richards stroked the ball to all parts for a masterful 145 with Des Haynes almost becalmed in comparison. England couldn’t find any way to contain him until he chipped out to, I think, Graham Dilley on as a sub right at the close. Not sure I’ve seen a better innings in the flesh.”England are hurtling to victory. Shadab fishes outside off stump at a good delivery from Curran and edges straight to first slip, where Cook takes a simple catch. 30th over: Pakistan 102-5 (Salahuddin 26, Shadab 4) Ah, Bess has switched ends and will replace Woakes. Shadab, who has made fifties in each of his last three Tests, waves a confident drive for two. Meanwhile, the ECB have announced that Ben Stokes will miss the ODI against Scotland and the first part of the Australia series because of a hamstring injury. “I might be confusing games, but Keith Hard’s 22nd over recollection of the great 1953 Aussie capitulation reminded me of an extract, I think from a Richie Benaud autobiography,” begins Brian Withington. “Richie was made responsible for organising a mid-match evening drinks reception for a popular member of the Australian press corps who was getting married. Keen not to disappoint the young epicurean Benaud filled a hotel bath tub with ice and numerous bottles of the finest available gargling beverages. The reception was a tremendous success until it came to facing Jim Laker the next day. I suspect it may have been the arms shouldering Slasher who admitted to not being sure which of the several balls he could see to play at. Apparently he was far from alone in that predicament. Hope I’ve got the right game and source - it could have been from Denis Compton’s In Sun and Shadow but I think I also read a Benaud autobiography around the same time as I was off to the Oval in 1968.”29th over: Pakistan 99-5 (Salahuddin 26, Shadab 1) Dom Bess (3-0-11-1) is replaced by Sam Curran, who is 20 today. He wasn’t at his best in the first innings but this is a good chance to pick up a few cheap wickets. Salahuddin, who is playing with calm control, ignores a few tempters and then works a single to fine leg. Shadab then flogs a short ball for a single to get off the mark it would have been four but for a splendid ing stop from James Anderson. “Old Trafford, July 1939 was my first Test,” says Brian Daniels. “ Can clearly remember George Headley cutting boundaries. Was one a six off Bowes? And then, Hammond making hard drives and Constantine fielding at cover. Pity I cannot remember Compton that day but I must have seen him.”Constantine, Headley, Compton and Hammond? Not bad, but - sorry to boast - I can beat that. On my first day watching Test cricket, Tim Curtis made 12 from 71 balls. And then Bill Athey made 16 from 75!28th over: Pakistan 97-5 (Salahuddin 25, Shadab 0) That was a terrific delivery from Woakes, which moved sharply off the seam to hit Sarfraz in front of off and middle. The new batsman is the impressive Shadab Khan.“Can’t compete with first Test memories, but I do remember watching Essex, early sixties at Leyton when they were a nomadic side,” says Simon Porter. “Trevor Bailey had been playing his usual game, when out of nowhere he unleashed a mighty six, whereupon the ladies lavatories housed in an old double decker bus burst into flames. Also saw Barry Knight win a single-wicket competition at the Oval, (I think) in the mid-60s. Although I was the only one apparently supporting him from the stands, there was a very sympathetic crowd who didn’t seem to mind my youthful excesses.”We’re nearly done here. Woakes has taken the big wicket of Sarfraz, plumb LBW to a fullish nipbacker. He didn’t even discuss a review.27th over: Pakistan 94-4 (Salahuddin 22, Sarfraz 8) Bess has a slip and short leg for Salahuddin, who is playing carefully. A quicker ball is worked away for a single to complete a quiet over.26th over: Pakistan 92-4 (Salahuddin 21, Sarfraz 7) Woakes continued, having made the replacement ball kick nastily in the previous over. Sarfraz nails a straight drive so well that the ball hits the stumps at the non-striker’s end, and four runs become none. He’s going to counter-attack, as he always does.“July 1975, Edgbaston - 1st Ashes Test of the summer,” begins Gary. “The nice England of Edrich, Amiss, Fletcher, Underwood etc who were all friendly and polite to a boy on the boundary against an Australia with a brace of Chappells, Lillee, Marsh and Thomson - who scared the hell out of me - and the England team that they trampled underfoot, winning by an innings. I think Thomson may have been faster, but Lillie was the most lethal bowler I ever saw live. In retrospect I’m sure they were not actively mean it was just like watching amateurs against professionals. Snow, Greig and the rest were really fine players, but in that match the Aussies were truly fearsome. After that match I thought fast bowlers were like Lillie and Thomson, spinners like Underwood, keepers like Marsh and Knott I found out in the years that followed that they are not ...”I wonder what speed Thommo reached in the mid-70s before that shoulder injury. Based on what I’ve read and seen, I reckon he must have hit 105mph, maybe even 110.25th over: Pakistan 91-4 (Salahuddin 21, Sarfraz 6) Sarfraz charges Bess’s first ball and blasts it through mid-off for four. The wicket has not, it seems, changed their plan to go after him. Five from the over.“Pakistan’s record against England in England remarkable for the contrast between London and the provincial grounds,” says Faisal Ali. “In London Tests, Pakistan have played 25, won 10, lost 7. Outside London, if they lose here, it will be played 28, won 2, lost 16. Obviously Pakistan green is more of the guacamole than the mushy pea variety.”24th over: Pakistan 86-4 (Salahuddin 21, Sarfraz 1) Woakes starts a new over after the successful Bess set. Salahuddin continues to look the part, leaving a couple before driving nicely to cover. The skipper Sarfraz, new to eh crease, is solid in defence then off the mark to third man. Woakes finishes the over with another quick delivery that spits at Salahuddin’s gloves. That’s me for the day. Thanks for your company throughout our discussion of first visits to a Test Match. Some wonderful yarns in there. I’ll leave you with Rob Smyth. Bye for now.There it is! Two red lights and an umpires’ call, Bess into the book for the first time in Test cricket with the final ball of his first over in the match. He was round the wicket, beating the inside edge. He tossed it up and gave it a chance. Went straight on. Can’t ask for much more than that. Well bowled. HAS DOM BESS TRAPPED IMAM? Given out on the field! He’s gone upstairs but I think Bess has his first Test wicket! We’ll see. 22nd over: Pakistan 80-3 (Imam 30, Salahuddin 20) Imam drives three more straight to start the new Woakes over. He’s ticking over really well now. Salahuddin unlucky not to add to his own score, picking out fielders with a couple of nice drives. The intent has been there since lunch.Keith Hart is nearly our oldest reader, unable to (quite) beat 1947. Even so, a fair effort: “I think I saw Lindwall and Miller play Lancashire at Old Trafford in 1948, but since I was only 5, I could have made that up. My first test was vs India in 1952. Fiery Fred blew them away in the first innings. I can get the actual score onlline (58 all out, Truman 8-31), but what I recall vividly is his dishevelled appearance, long curving run and sling-shot delivery. The next year member and saw every ball of the Laker test. In the second innings, the Aussies gave up. I remember Slasher Mackay (and he wasn’t the only one) lbw while shouldering arms.” I love this stuff. Thanks for playing along.21st over: Pakistan 77-3 (Imam 27, Salahuddin 20) This is maturing into a nice partnership, worth 35 now with five taken from Anderson’s fifth over since lunch. Imam picked up three of those with a push off the back foot out to point before Salahuddin drove a couple in the same direction for two more. Sure enough, Jimmy bounces back beating Salahuddin with the final delivery.20th over: Pakistan 72-3 (Imam 24, Salahuddin 18) Salahuddin wants to play Woakes off the front foot, nice and positive. The bowler does grab the edge eventually, but though the cordon on the ground for one. Imam now, who immediately nails a lavish straight drive to the boundary! His best shot so far. Keeps the strike with a single behind square.19th over: Pakistan 66-3 (Imam 19, Salahuddin 17) Root backing his top dog Anderson, who goes around again. A bit more to this set, Imam having to leave quite close to his stumps and nearly wearing one on the hand. Maiden. Meanwhile, a nice story here from the ECB with Chance to Shine reaching a major milestone. They do great work.18th over: Pakistan 66-3 (Imam 19, Salahuddin 17) Right, so Chris Woakes does replace Broad. Good change. He was excellent on day one, especially before lunch when the ball was relatively new. Imam works one to square leg that puts Salahuddin back down the business end again. With a bit of width, he takes two before defending and leaving the rest. He’s going alright.John Tumbridge witnessed the brothers Chappell salute on the same day first up. Nice. “On 12th August 1972 I was explaining to my dad how boring the summer holidays were. Get yourself down to the cricket was the suggestion. So off to the Oval to watch the Chappel flay the English attack. Both got centuries, I wish I had understood then I was witnessing history being made and not had the general frustration of being English and 14 and we seemed to be losing. England first innings 284 Australia finished the day 10 behind with seven wickets in hand, eventually winning by 5 wickets.”17th over: Pakistan 63-3 (Imam 18, Salahuddin 15) Not enirely sure why Anderson is getting a third over after the break but here he goes. His pedestrian exchange with Salahuddin continues, the right-hander able to defend throughout.“My first visit was Lords in 1983 against NZ,” adds Julian Pye. “It was the first day, and could have been subtitled The Agony and the Ecstasy. Two of the worst feelings for any player in the morning session - poor Chris Smith out LBW to Hadlee first ball (not just his first ball faced, but his first ball in Test cricket), and the dead silent walk back to the pavilion, past the platoon of headmasters sporting the Rhubarb and Custard. Then Lance Cairns dropped the easiest catch ever dropped in Tests - lobbed gently to him, chest height, sun not in eyes, the works - to let off David Gower. Who then scored a beautiful century, of the type where rather that hit the ball, he seemed just to charm it to the boundary.” 16th over: Pakistan 63-3 (Imam 18, Salahuddin 15) Nup, Broad once more. Salahuddin leaving and defending competently early on before collecting three behind square. There is nobody back there to collect it so the men in the cordon have to chase it down. Vic Marks observes on TMS that the 7-2 field (with a third man) takes the Broad bouncer out of the equation. “Took my six-year-old son Tom to his first test at the Oval in early 80s against Windies,” recalls Richard Davies. “Unforgettable moment is watching Holding (who had been bowling off a short run for 18 months) pacing out an extra 10 yards in MIDDLE of an over. Ground went silent. First ball a throat ball to Broad? Caught behind.” Mikey, what a man. 15th over: Pakistan 60-3 (Imam 18, Salahuddin 12) Nice from Salahuddin, steering a wide Anderson offering to the third man boundary to start his new over, then getting off strike with a clip next ball. Imam isn’t bothered by the rest with Jimmy not posing any probems at the moment. Give Bess a go, Joe. 14th over: Pakistan 55-3 (Imam 18, Salahuddin 7) Salahuddin working into it now, using a straight bat whenever he can with Broad attacking his stumps. Gets one to point to keep the board moving when offered a bit of width. For those just joining the coverage, Pakistan still trail by 134. Might be time to give Woakes a go from that end, I reckon.“My father isn’t reading the OBO, so I’ll answer this query on his behalf,” writes Rob Marriott. “His first day of Test cricket was at Trent Bridge, in 1965 he unexpectedly had a day off work, so drove down from Bradford where he worked at the time. England were playing South Africa, and he saw Colin Cowdrey score a century. Dad has often described it as the most cautious, unadventurous, tedious hundred he’s ever seen scored in all his years of watching the game, Cowdrey never trying to score off anything that wasn’t easy and safe. Consequently, that remains the first and last day of Test cricket that my father ever attended. My father’s life of watching Tests was ruined by Colin Cowdrey.” A sub-category emerging here: one Test and out. 13th over: Pakistan 54-3 (Imam 18, Salahuddin 6) Anderson back on after one Curran over, angling in at Imam round the wicket. Twice the opener works him off the pads, the first time to a fielder and the second for a couple of runs. Not much going on here from Jimmy with couple down the legside too.They keep coming and they are great, so I’ll keep publishing them. Martin Crookall’s turn. “Saturday at Old Trafford, 1981. An overcrowded ground full of peeling wooden benches, 25,000 people cramming into 21,000 seats and me stuck with sitting on my (thin) jacket on concrete. A deadly dull morning session, 29 runs in two hours and only one four, Gatting in the last over before lunch, and out leg before padding up to the next ball. Not much better after lunch. Tavare advancing like a glacier. Botham coming in and he’s just as becalmed. Went for a can of lager beneath the stand, missed the second and third boundaries of the day. Second new ball due, suppose it’ll be back into the shell again, yawn. Alderman with the first over from below us on the Warwick Road End. Lillee from the Stretford End. Bowls a bouncer at Botham, who swivels and hooks it behind square into the crowd for six. I can see that shot any time I want, don’t even have to close my eyes.” 12th over: Pakistan 52-3 (Imam 16, Salahuddin 6) Oooooh. Beaten, beaten! Broad twice beyond the edge to begin the fresh session. Both were no more than half an inch from getting Broad a second wicket. “He’s probably never had an examination like this,” observes Simon Mann on TMS of the task ahead of Salahuddin on debut. Pakistan’s new number five gets bat on ball to help with his nerves and then four off an edge to finish. It’s with a degree of control along the ground through the cordon, so no issues there.Ian Forth with the story of trying to get a mate interested in the game only for it to backfire. “I took my friend Nigel to his one and only day of test cricket at Lord’s in 1989. Australia were 6 down overnight, and I explained that England would wrap the innings up at the latest by lunch, and then we could enjoy England taking on a callow Australian attack. At 5 o’clock Australia were still batting, Waugh having made a colossal century. England then lost 3 quick wickets before the close of play. Years later I saw this described as the single most depressing day some aficionado ever witnessed. Nigel doesn’t even like cricket very much, and this day out hardly helped matters.Broad has the ball. Salahuddin facing up. We’re away for the second session.Back to Headingley. A couple of tweets in my timeline with some dark skies over the ground. Weather might be the only factor that drags this into a fourth day. Also, some analysis on how Anderson and Broad used the new ball before lunch. Provided those clouds don’t open, play resumes in five minutes.“Great thread about people’s first Test experiences!” writes Mo Holkar. I agree, these are great. “Mine was 25th August 1986, and although we only had a morning’s play, it was full of Ian Botham biffing the NZ bowlers to all parts of the Oval -- this was the “who writes your scripts?” Test, his comeback after the drugs ban. Highlight was 24 in an over off Stirling. Glory days! Hope today’s youngsters will have similar treasures to remember.”Phil Rhodes from the same era: “Mine was England v West Indies in 1984 at Edgbaston. My dad got permission for me to have the day off school and we went on the Friday. I saw big centuries from IVA and Harry Gomes as they pummelled us around the ground. My abiding memory of the day though was how drunk people around us were and the amount of abuse Derek Pringle was getting for essentially not being Ian Botham. Shoes were being thrown onto the pitch as well. A grand day out and as an 8 year old an eye opener into alcohol at a Friday or Saturday at a test match in England!” Geoff Davison turns the clock back a bit. “Brian Withington may be feeling ancient because his first test was in 1968 but mine was at Sabina Park in Kingston Jamaica in February 1960 (I had to look it up). I was with my Dad watching Geoff Pullar and Colin Cowdrey reach 170 without loss in the second innings with me cheering every English run. As I remember no-one else was doing so - but what a generous crowd – nobody seemed to mind a school boy cheering on his team.” What a wonderful memory!David Brown also with a beaut: “I was rather spoiled for my first Test. Glorious weather at Lords on the first day against India in 1990. Gooch started his march to 333 and Lamb came in and smacked a ton. Gooch was particularly dismissive of Kapil Dev who looked shockingly fast to my naive eyes. I assumed it would always be this easy. How I now laugh at my foolish innocence.”I’ve been to about 120 Tests and I’m yet to see a triple ton at any stage. Urgh!“My first test came in slightly unusual circumstances,” begins Simon Platt. “We went to the one day international v the mighty West Indies at Old Trafford in May 1984 (IVA Richards would make his 189no) only to find that our allocated seats were taken and there was no room anywhere else in the ground. LCCC atoned for their cock-up by giving us tickets to the Test later in the summer. That was the match when Garner smashed a ball into Paul Terry’s arm and effectively ended his Test career. You could hear the crack in the stands.” Yikes! I think the 189 not trumps the Test, though. Last one for now, from Ian Sargeant. “First day at a test match was a tedious and wet one as a teenager at Lord’s in the 1980s.” I wanted tedious detail of it, but I’ll survive. “ First day of county cricket however was smashing. Late july 1978 ish at the saffrons at Eastbourne. Sussex hit over 500 v Northants (Mendis, Parker and Barclay all got tons Parker doubled). Then Imran Khan bowled some fiery stuff at the end. As an 8 year-old I was hooked.”My first visit to the MCG to watch Victoria was the day that Ian Harvey made his maiden first-class ton. And here’s my diary from that day. For real. Also, it was the day Matt Elliott got his first double, brought up with a straight six. Actually, daynight to be precise. This was one of the rare Shield games played with the yellow ball. This email deserves its own post, from John Bottomley.“Reading people’s reminiscences of their first test matches makes me wonder if I may be the oldest reader of OBO.” Anybody out there? This will be fun.“I grew up in Birmingham but at the time of my first test there were none at Edgbaston. However I had an aunt and uncle in Leeds who let me stay with them for my first experience of test cricket. This was England v South Africa in 1947. But I must mention my second in 1948, which was a famous (or infamous) England v Australia test, when after an England declaration, Australia made 404-3 on the last day to win. But my abiding memory is of Bradman batting. I don’t recollect him ever hitting the ball in the air and it was impossible to set a field for him - he almost always found the gaps.Is there any OBO reader who can beat 1947?”You were at the Leeds chase in 1948?! Nobody is topping that. Are they?11th over: Pakistan 48-3 (Imam 16, Salahuddin 2) Sam Curran brought on for a twist before the break. Imam doesn’t mind that, flicking away the birthday boy’s loosener for his third boundary. The left-hander is comfortable, using his bat throughout, and is unlucky not to get another boundary from the penultimate delivery of the session that’s stopped well at cover. That is lunch, the visitors still trailing by 141 runs. Earlier, England piled in 61 runs inside 11 overs for their last three wickets. The bulk of those were from the bat of Buttler, who went up the gears in a real hurry once the eighth wicket fell. The highlight was a huge blow into the football stand currently under construction. He also got to his half-century with a six over fine leg and was the only England batsmen to reach 50, finishing unbeaten on 80.The hosts capitalised on their 189-run first innings lead with three wickets in 55 minutes before lunch. Anderson went through Azhar who played a dreadful shot before also picking up Haris, was cut off by a spectacular ing catch from Dom Bess at mid-off. Broad is in the book too, strangling Shafiq just before the break. I’ll be back shortly to share some more emails of your first memories of attending a Test Match. 10th over: Pakistan 44-3 (Imam 12, Salahuddin 2) With that wicket, Stuart Broad has overtaken Wasim Akram. It was his 415th in Test cricket at an average of 29. One more will take him beyond Rangana Herath, which was close to coming from the last ball of this set, just going beyond the edge of the new man Salahuddin. One over left until lunch. He has! It looked like the right-hander was fine but the technology showed a little spike as the ball kissed the glove and that’s all Paul Reiffel needed. Nothing special about the delivery but it was a tidy take from YJB moving low to his left. Pakistan are still 147 behind with 75 overs remaining today due to the rain yesterday. HAD BROAD STRANGLED SHAFIQ DOWN THE LEGSIDE? They are going to ask Paul Reiffel to check upstairs for them. Looks close. 9th over: Pakistan 42-2 (Imam 12, Shafiq 5) Jimmy finds Shafiq’s edge but mostly along the ground through about fifth slip to the boundary to get him off the mark. Another single in that general direction puts Imam on strike with about ten minutes until the interval. They have to tough this out. More good batting from the young left-hander to help with that task, not tempted by Jimmy outside the line.David Seare’s initial visit was at Old Trafford in 1990. “It was the Saturday and we watched Azharuddin batting with a teenager called Tendulkar. Don’t think the young lad ever made much of himself. His senior partner could only really go into politics after that bit of business in 2000.” 8th over: Pakistan 37-2 (Imam 12, Shafiq 0) Broad again to Imam to continue their excellent little contest. He pushes two to cover that would have been four had that man Bess not got a hand to it, ing once again. Looks a Test cricketer, doesn’t he? And this is all before he’s influenced a match with the ball. That’ll come. They are up appealing later in the over when Imam leaves a ball from around the wicket that hits him on the front pad, but it won’t be doing enough to prompt Root to ask DRS. Technology confirms the decision. Broad hasn’t got the wickets but he’s the better of the two bowlers so far. Oh, now I’ve written that he oversteps and gives the left-hander a chance to take a boundary off his pads, which he takes. “I do remember being incredibly excited by the fact that Graham Gooch would be batting,” emails Richard Woods of his first Test experience (sort of, in this case). They are really piling up, by the way. I’ll get to the bulk of them at lunch. Some wonderful stories. Back to Richard.“He had been selected for his debut before the first Test. In those days the test team announcement was always made on a Sunday. Northants were playing Essex in a Sunday League game in the day of the announcement of the team for the first test at Edgbaston, and my father and I were already heading to the game when the announcement was made. When Gooch came out to bat he got a highly appreciative round of applause from the Northants faithful and from me, even though I’m always and forever a Gloucestershire fan. He made 7 - a six and a single, then got out. He was my favourite player from then on, until I saw Botham batter the Northants bowling all over the Wellingborough School ground a few years later.”Here is Jimmy’s first wicket, knocking over Azhar Ali.What a catch! I’ve stitched up Haris by talking him up in the previous over, but forget about that, this is all about Dom Bess at mid-off! He has the chance to e to drag it in with his left hand and does it expertly. A poor shot from the left-hander, getting Anderson into the book for a second time. Pakistan are still 159 runs behind with 20 minutes until lunch. This could get ugly.

Djokovic v Verdasco. My esteemed colleague John Brewin will guide you through the beginnings of that one.The American records a straight sets win over the No 25 seed inside 53 minutes. That was as easy as it gets. Stephens racked up 11 games in a row to finish in style. Kontaveit had been playing well coming into this but that was pretty chastening. It’s a similar state of affairs over on Suzanne-Lenglen, where Putintseva is putting Strýcová to the sword. She’s 4-2 up in the second. “I was really pleased to get out there and play some good tennis,” Stephens says, before dipping into some GCSE French. Stephens is eating up the ground on Chatrier, she’s making it look like a real doddle out there. Kontaveit’s decision-making has left a little to be desired at times but she’s more than capable of the spectacular. But after a fourth double fault puts the game on a plate for Stephens, the Estonian goes long at the end of a healthy rally. Stephens leads 2-6, 0-3, having gobbled up eight games in a row. Over on Suzanne-Lenglen, Putintseva is 3-1 up in the second after taking the first 6-4.That was all very routine for the US Open champion.The Kazakh has made a barnstorming start against the No 26. Meanwhile, Stephens has just broken Kontaveit she’s looking good at 5-2 up in the first. She has not really had to get out of first gear to get this point, on the verge of the first set. David Goffin, the No 8 seed, meets Marco Cecchinato on court once Putintseva Strýcová are done and dusted.The France footballer Kylian Mbappé, born to the northeast of Paris, is among the spectators at a roasting Chatrier, where it’s around 26C. None other than Mike Tyson is taking in Stephens’ duel with Kontaveit too – how the latter could do with finding some fight. On Suzanne-Lenglen, Barbora Strýcová trails the unseeded Yulia Putintseva, of Kazakhstan, 4-2 in the first set. Putintseva knocked out Johanna Konta in the round of 128 en route to here and the 23-year-old is making another fine impression this afternoon.Both Stephens and Kontaveit were in action yesterday, the former recording a marathon 8-6 third-set win. As for Kontaveit, she ousted Petra Kvitová, the No 8 seed, in straight sets – both tie-breaks. In the early stages on Chatrier here, they’re level-pegging at 1-1, with Stephens sending an angling, effortless forehand straight down the line. Lovely stuff.What’s coming up? Sloane Stephens, the US open champion and No 10 seed, will duel with Anett Kontaveit, of Estonia, on Chatrier. After that, Djokovic will take on Verdasco. If that doesn’t get the pulse racing, then we’ll be dipping in and out of Strycova v Putintseva. If Mahut and Herbert can seal a straight sets win on court 1 in the men’s doubles, then the Williams sisters will take centre stage there against KlepacSanchez. Dominic Thiem is in good spirits. “I love the clay here,” he says. “It was my first time on Phillipe-Chatrier not playing against Rafa so I could enjoy the court a little bit more. The first two sets but he raised his level after that. It was a 50-50 match then, but my advantage was I had already two sets.”The No 7 seed gets the job done in two-and-a-half hours. The adrenaline got to him at 40-30, with an overzealous easy forehand. But he hits back to establish advantage and clinches victory second time round, when Nishikori – who again struggled with that niggling wrist injury of his – strikes his return wildly long. The Austrian is into the quarter-finals – where he’ll play Alexander Zverev. For a while, it was a cakewalk but Thiem was made to work to get through in the end, in an ultimately nervy finish.Over on Chatrier, Thiem has poked his nose in front of Nishikori in the fourth set. He leads 4-3, with two sets already in the bag. Presumably Zverev might pop over to take a look, because he will meet the winner in the last eight. The way he’s talking though, Zverev won’t fear anyone.Sascha speaks: “I’m young, so I might as well stay on court and practice a little bit ... It’s the best, a five-set match. I’ve been down 2-1 every single time but I’m unbelievably happy to be into the quarter-finals. The draw doesn’t get any easier and I have to see how it goes in the next few days.”Alexander Zverev, for the third straight match, wins in five sets. They embrace at the net but its the 21-year-old German who reaches his first grand slam quarter-final. He’s into the last eight in Paris. Zverev leads Khachanov 5-3 in the fifth set. He makes it 10 points in a row on serve before Khachanov, at last, manages to breakthrough. But once he pulls level at 15-15, he’s unable to repel the No 2 from the tennis equivalent of opening up his legs and sprinting hard. The German is one game away one from clinching victory ...A roaring “Come on!” from Khachanov, only seconds after he’s a little guilty of overplaying, screwing up a high forehand volley with the court gaping. But, he’s off the hook and edges to 3-4 in the fifth set. Away from Suzanne-Lenglen, Nishikori has nudged himself in front in the fourth against Thiem on Chatrier.A thirsty Khachanov moves to within touching distance of Zverev once more, pummeling an ace beyond the German to get to 2-3. Without going all dramatic on you, this one’s surely going to go down to the wire. Nishikori and Thiem, meanwhile, are level-pegging at 1-1 in the fourth.After shipping the last four, Khachanov wins his first game of this fifth and final set, in which Zverev’s 2-1 up. Whoever prospers here, you have to feel they are capable of doing some damage in the tail end of this tournament. On Chatrier, Nishikori has just won the third set 7-5 after almost two hours, that’s after losing the first two. Zverev looks to the heavens after toasting another supersonic rally, with a slamming backhand down the line. That tees him up at advantage, at which point he prospers. He’s back in front at 1-0 in the fifth and he’s straight back around the other side of Suzanne-Lenglen for more. For giant athletes, both at 6ft6in, they are shifting around court like gazelles. We are in for a stunning finale ...This is a corking match – with only a Zverev medical time out delaying the fifth set on Suzanne-Lenglen. He’s getting a bit of work done his left foot, a troublesome toe it seems (we’ve all been there). Elsewhere, Nishikori is having a good go at fighting back at Thiem. He’s 5-4 up in the third.A third five-setter in a row for the German. He has a knack for doing things the hard way and, on that evidence, he seems to have more left in the tank. Khachanov was a little sloppy doing the basics and he’s been punished. He’ll need to dig deep – and dip into the energy reserves – to edge himself back in front here.Zverev’s huffing and puffing, cursing and yelling. Yet a coaching warning revs him up to prosper at deuce and to a third straight game over Khachanov. The German punches the air in delight, with a nod to Alexander Zverev Sr to boot. It looks as though we are heading for another helter-skelter five-setter. He’s another game away from taking us there ... Over on Phillipe-Chatrier, Dominic Thiem is ripping his way through his meeting with Kei Nishikori. He won the first 6-2, the second was a 6-0 whitewash and though he trails in the third, he’s now back on serve. The Austrian was semi-finalist in Paris in 2017 and 2016.... but Zverev ups the ante to keep his nose in front in the fourth set. A flurry of hard-hitting serves and then a cute volley at the net plunge Khachanov into trouble and the 21-year-old German comes out the other end of a challenging game. He trails 2-1 but leads 2-3 in a seesawing fourth set. Who will win it?Karen Khachanov has just pulled level at 2-2 in the fourth set. The Russian’s body language is very low-key, while Zverev is looking agitated. Zverev’s serving is beginning to look a little wobbly and Khachanov can take advantage here at 40-15 to break and go 3-2 ...A reminder that Madison Keys breezed through to her first quarter-final at Roland Garros a little earlier. She sealed a straight sets win over Romania’s Mihaela Buzarnescu with an ace on her third match point. “Hopefully big things can happen here,” Keys said. She will pit her wits against the winner of Barbora Strycova or Yulia Putintseva – who meet on Suzanne-Lenglen after KhachanovZverev – in the last eight. Caroline Wozniacki, the No 2 seed and US Open champion Sloane Stephens are also vying for a spot in the last eight, against Kasatkina and Kontaveit respectively. He races to 40-0 and wraps up the third in a little over half an hour. The wheels have seemingly come off for Zverev, who has it all to do again. So, we’re 6-4, 6-7, 6-2 ... who will come out on top? Another player who is up against it at the moment is Kei Nishikori, who trails Dominic Thiem 3-0 in the second after a demolition job in the first. A double break for Khachanov over Zverev, whose clean and crisp backhand down the line is the only thing troubling the Russian at present. Khachanov leads 5-1 in the third ...Things are looking dandy for the No 7 seed on Chatrier.Khachanov has just broken Zverev again. He’s 2-1 up on Suzanne-Lenglen in the third. The German could do with sticking around at Roland Garros – given they’ve just closed Hamburg airport owing to a power failure. Force has not been a problem for Zverev here, though – just erratic.Elsewhere, Dominic Thiem is out on court and in the groove against Kei Nishikori on Phillipe-Chatrier. He’s 4-2 up in the first. Khachanov has just cancelled out Zverev taking the first game of the third set. Zverev needed that last set, given he’s never come from two sets down to win. As for later, the Williams sisters are in doubles action, while Novak Djokovic will take centre stage against Verdasco.A drawn out puff of the cheeks at the end of a marathon tie-break says it all. He gets through 7-4 in the end, after an impressive show of stamina. His movement, particularly impressive for a 6ft6in athlete outwits Khachanov and his power is ultimately too hot for the Russian to handle. A walloping 200kmh ace helps him up to 4-2 before setting the seal – Zverev is a real animal on court. That fascinating set has whipped up the crowd on Suzanne-Lenglen.Khachanov and Zverev go to a tie-break. We’ve just had a preposterous rally, with the German’s ridiculous forehand almost finding its way in. They’re level-pegging at 6-6 (1-1) ...Another game, another clenched Khachanov fist. He’s won three games on the trot to move to within touching distance of taking the second set. He’s at 6-5 but 0-30. To do so, he’ll have to break Zverev. Khachanov breaks Zverev to move to 5-5 in the second. After eight long minutes, in which Zverev squandered three set-points, Khachanov toils with the 21-year-old, hitting a rasping forehand to tee up another knockout blow. Zverev’s decision-making has been questionable – he’s allowed Khachanov to stay in games he should have wrapped up – but kudos to the Russian, who has kept a cool head amid the chaos.Zverev’s tail is up again he’s ploughing through the second set. He’s won 12 points in a row, out of nowhere really. He’s 3-5 in the second after falling to Khachanov in the first. The Russian is serving ...The American hit a brick wall halfway through the second but she’s through to the last eight – her first quarter-final at Roland Garros – after dispatching the Romanian in 64 minutes. Zverev has been effing and blinding out on court het up at his performance so far. A sloppy backhand gifts Khachanov a way back in and then a sticky drop shot helps the Russian to deuce. His shot selection seems a little erratic and Khachanov prospers, with Zverev failing to seize two break points. He’s 3-2 up in the second.Madison Keys, the 13th seed, is cruising through to the last eight at Roland Garros. She’s 6-1, 5-1 up against Mihaela Buzărnescu on Phillipe-Chatrier. The US Open finalist ought to have that one done and dusted inside around an hour. Light work. Straight to Suzanne-Lenglen, where Alexander Zverev eventually came unstuck in the first against Khachanov. He had already survived two set points at 5-4 down to limp to deuce but eventually a sloppy forehand plays into the Russian’s hands and Zverev has work to do if he’s to prosper.Another stonking day of tennis is already under way in Paris, where a couple of heavyweights are in action grand slam-loving Novak Djokovic and Yorkshire-loving Alexander Zverev, no longer the new kid on the block. Zverev is already out on court against Karen Khachanov on Suzanne-Lenglen, while Madison Keys is a set up against Mihaela Buzărnescu.Yesterday’s action was jolly good fun Serena Williams made light work of Julia Görges, not long after Rafa Nadal did likewise with Richard Gasquet. Here’s Kevin Mitchell’s verdict on day seven:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d98fecc18cca004f79c78520a70f0e7a70bd4c0c/0_244_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35ccf3ada541731af46875b2693b6eaa","title":"hushed tones six of the best noise cancelling headphones","story":"From Bose to Beats, we assess the cans capable of shutting out the world as well as making your music singBose is one of the pioneers of noise-cancelling technology and is often lauded as the best in the business. The QC35 II are the second edition of the company’s wireless noise-cancelling cans and set the standard by which everyone else is measured.They’re excellent not only for active noise cancelling (ANC) but passive (noise blocked by the design of the headphones, rather than by playing ambient sounds) too, which is where some rivals fall short. Bluetooth connectivity is good, but only supports AAC and not other HD audio formats, a cable is there if you need it and the battery lasts around 20 hours with everything turned on.They have a distinct, tightly controlled “Bose” sound, which most but not all will like. The Bose app allows you to turn down or off the ANC, while volume and playback controls are on the right ear cup. An action button on the left invokes Google Assistant or toggles noise cancelling.They’re light and comfortable, relatively small and understated on the head, fold up for travel and are durable enough to survive day-to-day commuting.Verdict: They’re not quite as feature‑rich as some, but they’re more comfortable and have the best noise cancelling.Sennheiser’s PXC 550 are a bit dull to look at. They’re also not as comfy as some. But being light and relatively airy when worn, they’re more likely to better accommodate those of us with large ears.The PXC 550 have Sennheiser’s characteristic wide soundscape, which sounds less direct than rivals. They lack a little energy with electronica, and bass heads should look elsewhere, but fed guitar and vocals they sound fab.Sennheiser’s app lets you adjust the level of noise cancelling, change the EQ and turn on smart pause, which stops the music when you take them off. Unfortunately, to get smart pause to work reliably you have to wait for two seconds once you turn the headphones on before putting them on. Given you turn them on and off by twisting the earcups into place that quickly gets annoying. The right ear cup has a touch-sensitive pad – tap to pause, swipe right and left to skip, or up and down to adjust volume. A switch turns noise-cancelling off, to dynamic adjustment based on noise level or to maximum, while a button cycles through sound effects such as “club”, “movie” and “speech”.Noise-cancelling is good, but not quite on a par with Bose and Sony, particularly on the daily commute where they struggle to block out noise of fellow passengers and screeching trains.The PXC 550 support aptX for Bluetooth and come with a cable. The battery lasts around 30 hours between charges and the headphones fold up for travel.Verdict: A long-lasting option with a wide soundscape.The headphones you wear can be a statement. If you’re wearing B\u0026ampW PX you’re stating that you like your headphones to look as good as they sound, with much finer, metal-articulated arms, platinum highlights and fabric-covered earcups and headband.The PX aren’t ostentatious, but they look more like a £300-plus set of headphones from yesteryear than the bright plastic of the Beats generation.I found that to get the best out of them you have to crank them up loud, which sort of defeats the point of having noise-cancelling. They’re also more affected by the noise-cancelling, which noticeably changes the sound for the worse when turned on.Noise cancelling is good with droning engines, but not quite as good as the rest in an office or on the commute. They handle the wind the best of them all, however.The B\u0026ampW app allows you to customise the noise cancelling between “office”, “city” and “flight”, including the level of ambient noise let through. Buttons on the right ear cup control playback and volume. Taking them off pauses the music, while they’ll accept music over Bluetooth with aptX HD support, analogue cable or USB-C.They feel heavier and are less comfortable than rivals, with thinner, harder pads that squeeze the sides of your head more firmly. They don’t fold down for travel either.Verdict: They look great and will sound great if you like your music really loud.Sony’s top-of-the-line noise-cancelling headphones may not have a snappy name, but they pack a real punch. They are arguably the best Bose rivals money can buy, matching the standard-bearer in noise-cancelling. What Sony adds is slightly better sound, including HD and hi-res audio support over Bluetooth, and a number of customisation options such as noise-cancelling that can be adjusted either manually or automatically.The smartphone app also allows you to change the perceived direction of audio: to make it sound like the music is coming from in front of you or behind, or all around. There’s a full equaliser too.The right earcup is touch-sensitive – double tap to pause or play, swipe up or down to adjust volume or left or right to skip track. Cover the touch-sensitive area with a hand and it pipes ambient sound into the headphones so you can hear announcements or similar. A switch on the left ear cup can also turn ambient sound on or off.The battery lasts around 30 hours and they fold up for travel and are very comfortable for extended listening periods. The downside is that they’re a bit bigger than the Bose QC35, aren’t great at handling two devices connected at the same time, and aren’t quite as good at dealing with wind noise.Verdict: Ideal if you want more features or don’t like the way Bose sounds.While not exactly cheap, Plantronics’s BackBeat Pro 2 offer wireless noise-cancelling for £100 less than the best of the rest and for the most part you wouldn’t be able to tell.They have a decent set of controls on the outside. Pause, track skip, noise-cancelling switch and volume jog dial are all on the left cup, while the right has a button to fire up the virtual assistant, a power switch and a microphone mute button. Take them off to pause the music, put them back on to start it again.Noise-cancelling is good, but not quite best-in-class, letting in a bit more office chatter than the Bose or Sony. Battery life is an excellent 24 hours or so, but they take around three hours to charge when flat.The Plantronics are very comfortable to wear, even for extended periods, with big, plush ear cups and a nice padded headband, but they do not fold up, only rotating the ear cups to flat.If you like bass with your noise-cancelling, these are the ones for you: they have the deepest bass available here. It’s tightly controlled and doesn’t ruin the rest of the music, sounding great with thumping bass lines.Verdict: Excellent deep bass and good noise cancelling for less.The third-generation Beats Studio 3 Wireless are a step up over previous versions of Dr Dre’s noise-cancelling headphones. They’re available in a range of colours and have cups big enough to accommodate most ears.They’re quite tight on the head, with no rotation in the cups, which means they don’t come close to the Bose or Sony for all-day listening comfort. They do fold up, but not flat like most others, and can be a bit creaky each time they’re opened.Controls on the outside are fairly simple. There’s a big Beats button for controlling playback, hidden buttons above and below that for volume control, and a power button. Press the power button twice to turn off the noise-cancelling, hold the Beats logo to fire up Siri or Google Assistant on an Android phone.They work well with Android smartphones and Windows machines, but better with Apple’s products thanks to the company’s W1 chip. Simply turn them on near an iPhone and the pairing is shared between any other Apple devices you might own. They support AAC audio over Bluetooth, with a strong connection in all scenarios.The active noise-cancelling is good, but not on a par with the Bose and Sony, letting in more commuting noise. The headphones have a particular “Beats” sound, which is energetic and heavy on mid-bass, suiting pop but less so ambient electronica.Verdict: Great if you have an iPhone, but better comfort, sound and noise- cancelling are available elsewhere.Microphones on the headphones detect ambient noise heading to your ear. The system then plays the inverse of those unwanted sound waves through the headphones. The sound waves meet and cancel one another out before hitting your eardrum. This is normally described as active noise-cancelling (ANC) noise blocked by the design of the headphones is described as passive noise-cancelling."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/614ef8bb0e0e09c10e48fa6ae4558fa50c0546c5/137_0_2727_1637/master/2727.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c91c89118e444f80074bca3e7dfd470f","title":"juncker eu italy olive branch","story":"Jean-Claude Juncker has thrown the new government in Rome an olive branch, warning that Brussels and “German-speaking countries” must not repeat the error made during the Greek crisis by reading stern lectures to the Italian people.The president of the European commission said that, while he had been tempted to intervene during the recent political impasse in Italy, he was determined not to feed the populist narrative: that the EU is meddling in domestic affairs.Juncker noted that the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S) and the rightwing League party had both recently dropped their policy of exit from the European Union, and he would judge them on their deeds and not their rhetoric.Giuseppe Conte was sworn in as Italian prime minister on Friday after a last-ditch coalition deal between the two parties ended months of political deadlock and narrowly averted the need for a snap election in the eurozone’s third-largest economy.Conte attended a military parade on his first full day in office, while his deputy Matteo Salvini, head of the League and an ally of French rightwing leader Marine Le Pen, was heading to Sicily as part of his campaign against illegal immigration.In an interview with German news service RedaktionsNetzwerk, Juncker admitted to “concern” about the recent developments in Italy, but insisted that the recent turmoil in the financial markets in response to the new government had been “irrational” and should not be seen as a guide to how the political story will unfold in Rome.“I think very highly of President Mattarella, but I have not spoken to him during this crisis. I have not interfered, although I have been tempted to,” Juncker said. “I do not want to feed the accusations spread by the populists that we are sitting in Brussels meddling in Italy’s affairs. I am certain the Italians have a keen sense of what is good for their country. They will sort it out.”But he went on: “By keeping out of it, I’m not helping. By getting involved, I’m not helping. I am caught between a rock and a hard place.”The commission president had flirted with danger on Thursday by suggesting that the EU should not be blamed for the state of Italy’s poorer regions, where there needed to be “more work” and “less corruption”. Rather than blaming the EU, there needed to be more “seriousness” within the country about tackling its economic and social problems, he said.In this latest interview, Juncker claimed that he had personally fought against those who wanted to launch an excessive debt procedure against Italy over the state of its finances, a process that would be designed to give the EU more power to enforce austerity on Rome.Italy, the third-largest economy in the eurozone, has a public debt second only to Greece’s and there was a negative reaction from the financial markets to the League-M5S coalition, which plans to significantly raise public spending.Juncker offered a more placatory tone, suggesting that Brussels and Berlin had learned the lessons of the Greek crisis. He also denied that the eurozone was set on a course for another economic downturn: “The Italians cannot really complain about austerity measures from Brussels. However, I do not now want to lecture Rome. We must treat Italy with respect. Too many lectures were given to Greece in the past, in particular from German-speaking countries. This dealt a blow to the dignity of the Greek people. The same thing must not be allowed to happen to Italy.” Juncker said that the financial markets’ reaction was “irrational”: “People should not draw political conclusions from every fluctuation in the stock market. Investors have been wrong on so many occasions.”Neither of the coalition parties in the new Italian government campaigned on leaving the euro or the EU, but both have backed such calls in the past and are scathing about the rules that underpin the eurozone.Mujtaba Rahman, a former European commission and UK Treasury official who now works for consultancy the Eurasia Group, warned that as the cornerstone of the coalition government’s platform was fiscal expansion, it was liable to clash with the commission this autumn.“A significant deviation from EU-mandated fiscal targets may prompt the commission to open a new Excessive Deficit Procedure, a process designed to give the EU more power to enforce austerity on Rome. Yet the symbolism of this move would only strengthen the Italian government’s domestic standing.”The size of the Italian economy means that a bailout in line with that given to Greece – should the financial markets turn on the Italian government – would be a huge and crippling endeavour for the EU. Rumours have emerged in Brussels that Berlin is looking at a plan B which would instead involve seeking to contain the spill over of future economic turmoil in Italy.Daniel Gros, a German economist, and director of the Centre for European Policy Studies think-tank, said: “The view is that it would be impossible to do a standard European Stability Mechanism programme for Italy because you would exhaust the entire capacity of the ESM. And Italy is not like Greece: it has a strong economy, it has a current account surplus and critically it has very little net foreign debt as a country. It would make no sense. Yet an ESM might be needed, if things get rough, to help Spain and Portugal.He added: “This is not an economic problem where economic measures are needed but just some crazy politics for which one does not understand the rationale... There is very little Brussels can do. I think they are still hoping that somehow they can bring Italy to reason, but I think that is a forlorn hope”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/479b6ce40da6c31ffbc348b8d71e36c35c186709/0_115_967_580/master/967.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1dfce2c1099ae3c4993bcfd7f6aa75a7","title":"bashar al assad visit north korea state media claims","story":"‘I am going to meet HE Kim Jong-un’, Syrian president has been quoted as sayingBashar al-Assad is to visit North Korea, Pyongyang state media has claimed, in what would be a first state visit to the isolated nation under the leadership of Kim Jong-un.The report by the official Korean Central News Agency did not say when the visit would be, but the two sanctions-hit nations have been allies for decades and Washington has accused the North of assisting Syria with its weapons programmes.“I am going to visit the DPRK and meet HE Kim Jong-un,” Assad was quoted as saying, using an acronym for the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. “HE” stands for “his excellency”.Kim has not hosted any other heads of state since coming to power in 2011 after the death of his father. In recent months he has met the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, and the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, in a flurry of diplomacy that is expected to culminate in a summit with Donald Trump in Singapore on 12 June. Kim has yet to host a foreign leader in , Pyongyang. “The world welcomes the remarkable events in the Korean peninsula brought about recently by the outstanding political caliber and wise leadership of HE Kim Jong-un,” Assad was quoted as saying. “I am sure that he will achieve the final victory and realise the reunification of Korea without fail.”Assad also pledged to “fully support all policies and measures” of Kim’s government and strengthen ties in the future. Both Syria and North Korea have been targets of international sanctions over weapons programmes and human rights abuses. North Korea sent 40 items to Assad for the development of ballistic missiles and chemical weapons over a five-year period, according to a leaked UN report.Syria agreed to destroy its chemical weapons in 2013 but Assad has been repeatedly accused of using such weapons on his own people. Pyongyang made about £150m in 2017 by violating international sanctions and shipping equipment to Syria. Proliferation remains a risk as the cash-strapped nation looks to illicit trade to boost government coffers. Experts have said North Korea will remain proliferation risk for the foreseeable future. Trump’s meeting with Kim is expected to be focused on closing North Korea’s nuclear weapons programme, but so far there has been no mention of Pyongyang’s stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23261b080ba132b8134189e3d1fd5ab2203e5b0e/0_139_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=21ea2e1151a3a9dac1bcff085c3c6b7f","title":"irish feminists target women in the home clause in constitution","story":"Politicians and activists say the sexist and archaic language undermines womenIrish feminists buoyed by victory in the abortion referendum have their sights set on removing a section of the constitution which refers to women’s place in the home.The clause has no direct legal implications in contemporary Ireland, but politicians and activists have long argued that its archaic and sexist language undermines women.Commonly known as the “woman in the home” clause, its existence “constitutionally relegates women to second class citizenship”, the Sinn Féin leader, Mary Lou McDonald, said in 2015.Article 41.2 of the constitution says the Irish state “recognises that by her life within the home, woman gives to the state a support without which the common good cannot be achieved. The state shall, therefore, endeavour to ensure that mothers shall not be obliged by economic necessity to engage in labour to the neglect of their duties in the home.”A constitutional conference in 2013 recommended change, and when the prime minister, Leo Varadkar, took office last year he promised it would be one of the issues put to citizens in a referendum. The vote could be as early as October, potentially alongside the presidential election. Options include removing the clause entirely, or replacing it with a gender-neutral reference to the work of carers.Although the change is likely to be largely unopposed, many hope the debate about its removal will offer a chance to discuss wider issues around women’s status and gender inequality.“Its continued existence, even as a constitutional dead letter, is symbolic of the latent sexism we don’t like to admit still informs our society,” Niamh Egleston, a law student in Dublin, said.Some, however, argue that the vote on the clause should only come after the battle for abortion rights has been completed by passing legislation approved in principle last week.The Proclamation of the Republic, read out during the 1916 rebellion, was addressed to “Irishmen and Irishwomen”, an overt reference to gender equality. Irish women gained full voting rights in 1922.The first woman elected as a member of the House of Commons in Westminster was the Irish revolutionary Constance Georgine Markievicz, in 1918, although as a member of Sinn Féin she refused to take up her seat.In the following decades, laws and traditions left women restricted, both in the workforce and wider society, with marriage and motherhood seen by many as being incompatible with a career.When the 1937 constitution was being drawn up under Éamon de Valera, who would go on to become prime minister, feminists accused him of trying to erode Irish women’s political and social achievements.“Mr de Valera has always been a reactionary where women are concerned,” Gertrude Gaffney, a reporter for the Irish Independent, wrote in 1937. “He dislikes and distrusts us as a sex and his aim ever since he came into office has been to put us into what he considers is our place and keep us there.”Restrictions included a bar on married women working in the public sector, which was only removed in 1973 and a married man could mortgage or sell a family home without his wife’s knowledge or consent.Since the abortion referendum, activists are focusing on issues such as the gender pay gap, sub-par sex education and the cost of contraception as ways to continue improving gender equality."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3505689.1527087516!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"in praise of aphid eating pollinators","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA hoverfly at tomato flowers: drawing by Michael  VineyFor me, summer will be confirmed when I am stopped in my tracks by a glint in the air a step or two ahead of me: a spark of pure sunlight with just a hint of colour, a tiny whirr of wings that makes a space shift sideways, or up or down in a sudden, quantum bilocation.The insect is showing off, staking out a territory and hoping for a mate, and if I can track it to a flower, the hint of colour will no doubt resolve into the imitative, wasp-bright, yellow and black markings of so many of Ireland’s hoverflies.Stingless, most no bigger than a thumbnail, hoverflies are a largely unsung legion among our insect pollinators. Evolution has woven them into the ersity of wildflowers, and the past 5,000 years have recruited their Irish range of species, some 180 strong.While the pollinating services of bumblebees and honeybees deserve their headlines, gardeners value hoverflies for another great benefit. Their larvae, hatched on plants, eat sap-sucking aphid pests rapaciously: they are “aphidophagous”.Outstanding in this respect is the common and much-studied Episyrphus balteatus, whose glowing orange body bands make it “the marmalade fly”. Laying perhaps 4,500 eggs in its lifetime in the heart of aphid colonies, it is the aphids’ most effective natural enemy, to be welcomed into cereal crops and tomato and strawberry tunnels. Welcomed, that is, by growers who prefer aphid control by hoverflies than the toxic protection of pesticides.Last year, as the termination of neonicotinoids was finally played out in Europe, shocking news of major insect decline was reported in Germany. A 27-year record of insect biomass in 63 nature protection areas showed a midsummer decline in flying insects of 82 per cent – a drop inexplicable in terms of habitat or weather.This is part of the wider decline in flying insects that leaves our car windscreens and headlights unnaturally clean at journey’s end. It threatens to worsen as climate change disrupts the insects’ habitats and range. But more immediate threats are posed by the intensive farmland they fly across on long-distance migration.The marmalade fly, for example, while native to Ireland for thousands of years, is also a determined migrant. Like some of our butterflies, it travels in huge numbers from the Mediterranean, arriving in July and August and spreading across the island.The first scientific record of this came in 1995, when two biologists in a boat off Courtmacsherry Bay in Co Cork saw skeins of hoverflies heading for the coast in company with clouds of red admirals. The flies were so numerous that dead ones were forming drift lines on the sea. Such mass arrivals have sometimes caused public panic, as on coasts of southeast England during a heatwave in 2004. Mistaking the hoverflies for wasps as the insects settled on them for a rest, children ran screaming, prams were covered up, and so on.As for their return to the south, a memorable observation came from a British ornithologist, David Lack. Climbing to a high, narrow pass in the Pyrenees to check the passage of migrating birds, he found a torrent of hoverflies, chiefly Episyrphus balteatus, pressing on at ankle height into the wind. What caught his eye was “a shimmer of iridescent light, due to the reflection of the autumn sun on myriad tiny wings”. Given the dire decline reported from Germany, I have to wonder how far hoverfly migrations through Europe to Britain and Ireland have already been hit by neonicotinoids. The marmalade is among the hoverflies attracted especially to the nectar of yellow flowers, like the sulphurous shades of fields of oilseed rape, prime candidate for systemic pesticides. Such threats crop up in the scientific bible of Europe’s hoverflies, Syrph-the-net, the remarkable database compiled and maintained by Dr Martin Speight, long the leading entomologist of the National Parks and Wildlife Service and now with Trinity College Dublin’s zoology department.For example, accompanying the marmalade fly among the “anthropophilic” (human-friendly) species is another migrant, Eristalis arbustorum (no English name), common in urban parks and gardens. But its appetite for the nectar of hedgerow plants takes it on to farmland, where its larvae mature in cow dung.Like other insects involved in recycling manure, its progressive decline has been blamed on dosing cattle with systemic chemicals, such as ivermectin, to kill parasitic worms.There are few common names among hoverflies and a great variety in size, shape and colouring: several dark ones look more like bees. There is much more about them at the Irish Pollinator Initiative hosted on the website of the National Bioersity Data Centre (bioersityireland.ie).This also offers species photographs, gives access to their accounts in Syrph-the-Net and welcomes new records of local hoverfly species.

Photograph:  Darragh KaneResidents from Direct Provision centres in Cork were among the 8,500 people who took part in the Cork city marathon which got underway on Patrick Street yesterday morning.Organiser of the initiative, journalist Graham Clifford, said he has been “overwhelmed” by the success of the Sanctuary Runner project which he set up with the assistance of press photographer Clare Keogh.“I worked in refugee camps in North Africa, travelled across Eastern and Central Europe with refugees during the migrant crisis and have been reporting on Direct Provision for years.“Also, I love to run so it seemed like a simple, but effective, proposal to help Irish people understand those living in Direct Provision and vice-versa through running. The success of the project has been overwhelming.”The project has been supported by athletes Sonia O’Sullivan, Derval O’Rourke, Lizzie Lee, Rob Heffernan and Gillian O’Sullivan and well as boxer Gary Spike O’Sullivan and former Kerry player Tomás Ó Sé.Among the iniduals giving encouragement to runners from the sidelines on Sunday was Olympic bronze medallist Rob Heffernan who said the warm weather had made conditions challenging.“It is humid. When it is twenty degrees in Cork and it is humid it is tougher than thirty degrees with less humidity abroad. But the conditions are perfect otherwise. There is no wind. There is no sun out. I am not running. I am reminiscing here.”It is the twelfth year of the Cork city marathon and Lord Mayor, Fianna Fail councillor Tony Fitzgerald, said there was a “carnival atmosphere.”“It is a perfect occasion in the heart of our city. All the training. All the running, all the healthy food options for this wonderful occasion come to fruition this morning.”This year the marathon started earlier to facilitate the Eucharistic Procession in the city.The marathon was won by Co Louth native Gary O’Hanlon in a time of 2.21.Gary (43) of Clonliffe Harriers is a national champion and has taken place in numerous marathons. Mark Kirwin placed second while Eoin Callaghan was third.Zola Flynn was the first woman over the line in a time of 2.58 whilst Brighton AB group were the first relay team to cross the finish line.One of the more colourful participants was Dolores Duffy who dressed up as “Superwoman” and completed her 65th marathon.“The whole way people were shouting ‘well done and go on’.

File photograph: Stephen CollinsCollins PhotosLabour Party leader Brendan Howlin has said the Brexit position of Britain’s government amounted to “a very British coup”.Mr Howlin said he believed the British government does not have the support of its parliament for its Brexit strategy.He also called for prime minister Theresa May to demonstrate her mandate for her position on the issue.“It is entirely unclear that the positions being pursued by the British government have the support from the British parliament. What evidence we have suggests not. It appears too that the British government thinks so too. Having been defeated 15 times in the House of Lords the British government is yet to bring the EU Withdrawal Bill to the House of Commons ,” Mr Howlin said.Mr Howlin, who is also Labour spokesman on foreign affairs and Northern Ireland, made the remarks in a statement issued on Saturday.His comments come amid ongoing ridicule of a proposal from Britain’s Brexit secretary David Davis to create a 16km buffer zone around the Border following Brexit. Mr Davis’s latest plan would give Northern Ireland joint UK and EU status so it could trade freely with both, as well as a buffer zone to eliminate the need for Border checkpoints with the Republic. The proposals were roundly dismissed by Irish Government figures, members of the British parliament and the DUP, which urged the Tories to stop coming up with “half-cooked ideas” on how to deal with the Border question. Pro-EU MPs have accused the British government of “making it up as they go along” when it comes to the issue.“The May government is refusing to advance its own Trade and Customs Bill in the House of Commons . . . because it fears defeat at the hands of Conservative rebels and Labour, the SNP and the Liberal Democrats,” Mr Howlin said.“Meanwhile, the EU is obliged to engage with a British government whose extreme Brexit position draws no mandate either from the people in the referendum or Westminster.“If Ms May has a mandate for her position, let her prove it.

Photograph: Nick BradshawIt took 35 years to build a landslide.Repealing the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution was neither quick nor easy, despite what the margin of difference might say.Sixty-six per cent said “Yes”. Makes it look simple.But that two-thirds majority conceals hard history and hard-fought battles behind a stunning final result.Woman by woman, story by story, year upon year, day after day. The rocks and pebbles of countless unjust ordeals and small personal tragedies piled up after each furtive trip to Liverpool and beyond.Brave campaigners for basic abortion rights did everything they could to increase the pressure, their efforts ignored and condemned by priests and politicians and that tiresome class of pious people who live in terror of the slippery slope.They thought they could hold back a landslide. On Friday, gravity kicked in. The slippery slope did for them in the end.The Eighth Amendment, which guaranteed a foetus the same right to life as the woman carrying it, is gone from the Constitution. Good riddance to it. It brought nothing but difficulty and despair to Irish women in times when they desperately needed proper care and compassion at home.It was a wonderful morning on Saturday in the RDS when the boxes were opened and the votes counted. It was a wonderful afternoon in Dublin Castle when crowds filled the courtyard to hear the official declaration. It was a wonderful day for Irish women.A day made even better in the happy knowledge that the vast majority of Irish men are looking out for them and want only the best for them. By voting in their droves to repeal, they placed the concerns of women far above the fears of ideologically-motivated crusaders who prize saving souls above having a heart.With repeal looking the likely outcome, there were calls from some quarters for a muted and dignified response. Perhaps it was the reason why there was neither screen nor public address system for the huge crowd at the castle.But no. For all the decades of all the women who suffered, and for all the women who fought and agitated for change, we had to celebrate this historic turning-point in modern Irish society.Some never thought they would live to see the day. Some, like Monica Barnes and Mary Holland and Nuala Fennell and many more, didn’t. The celebration was for them too.It was for Ailbhe Smyth, who never stopped fighting. It was for senator Ivana Bacik, Catherine Murphy, Joan Burton, Catherine McGuinness and many more who were there from the start.Political rivalries were cast aside for the day. “Oh, c’mere to me,” said socialist Bríd Smith, giving Fianna Fáil’s Timmy Dooley a hug.Obstetrician Peter Boylan, looking very cool in his shades turned up and it was like George Clooney had just rambled in, such was the clamour which greeted his entrance. The three co-directors of Together4Yes – Ailbhe Smyth, Orla O’Connor and Gráinne Griffin – arrived to rapturous welcome.Senators Lynne Ruane and Alice Mary Higgins were in floods. Ruth Coppinger was hugging for Ireland. Katherine Zappone, who demanded the referendum as her price for supporting the Government, was ecstatic.“Oh God, I told my husband I’d give up the fags if there was a repeal,” said Fine Gael’s Kate O’Connell, one of the party’s most active campaigners, as she ran out for a smoke.Brendan Howlin arrived in just after Mary Lou McDonald’s big entrance. The Labour party was fighting the cause when all the others didn’t want to know. “We never get the credit,” said Howlin, shrugging. “We carry the flag, but then in comes the fresh faced Leo to take all the glory.”Maybe not. Health Minister Simon Harris pretended to be embarrassed by the “I fancy Simon Harris” poster, but he was secretly thrilled. Wherever he went he was mobbed. No wonder Leo stuck close by him.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin maintained a low-key presence, but his early intervention and support for repeal and the proposed legislation was a pivotal point in the campaign.It was a courageous move which now sees him on the right side of history and one half of his parliamentary party stranded on the other.As Micheál walked through the crowd, tearful young women hugged him. A man and woman approached. “We’re one of those couples who had a fatal foetal abnormality,” the women said to him. “Thank you. Just, thank you,” she sobbed.Meanwhile, back in the RDS, the Attorney General was chatting to former Supreme Court Judge Catherine McGuinness.She had had eye surgery the day before but the doctor gave her a special dispensation to attend the count. “Theoretically I should have a patch over my eye today.”At Dublin Castle, Frank Crummy (81), who set up Ireland’s first family planning clinic, was resplendent in his repeal jumper, alongside his wife Evelyn.There was a lot of discussion about why so many politicians and pundits called the campaign so wrong. The Together4Yes team remains amused by the old school, outmoded metric used by some of them to evaluate their very effective efforts. It was as if they were affronted at the idea that people outside the Kildare Street bubble might actually know more than they do about what the electorate really wants these days.Independent TD Clare Daly, a politician hugely deserving of credit for the part she played, decided to stay away from the castle bunfight. Instead, a number of Johnny Come Lately politicians with a weakness for self-publicity preened and waved from the platform.It’s always the same.A third of the electorate voted No. “I feel like I’ve lost my country,” a woman told us amid the celebrations in the RDS. She was very sad. She couldn’t be consoled.Cheers and tears and champagne greeted the announcement. The sky fell in briefly when a few drops of rain fell. Everyone danced.Because it was a monumental day.

File image: Leon NealAFPGetty ImagesThe Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has urged the British Conservative Party to stop coming up with “half-cooked ideas” on dealing with the Border and to provide clarity on its Brexit plan.Britain’s Brexit secretary David Davis was reported on Thursday to be creating a plan that would give Northern Ireland joint UK and European Union status so it could trade freely with both, as well as a buffer zone to eliminate the need for border checkpoints with Ireland.Mr Davis is drawing a proposed 16km-wide trade buffer zone along the Border that would be in effect for local traders, such as dairy farmers, after Britain leaves the bloc, The Sun newspaper reported.A 10-mile wide “special economic zone” would be created along the 310-mile border, within which local traders could operate under the Republic’s trade rules.The DUP, which props up British Prime Minister Theresa May’s government at Westminster, has made clear that it does not want Northern Ireland treated differently from the rest of the UK.The party’s East Antrim MP Sammy Wilson said on Friday that none of the mooted proposals had been discussed with his party. He described them as “at best contradictory”.He said: “First of all, to suggest that Northern Ireland be tied to both EU and UK regulations, when one of the objectives of leaving the single market is to allow the UK to set its own regulations, raises the question which regulations apply to Northern Ireland if and when the UK and the EU regulations erge?“Secondly, who will make the judgement as to which regulations should apply? Will it be the EU or the UK Government? Will it be the UK courts or the European Court of Justice?”Mr Wilson said the purpose of the border buffer zone “appears to be even less clear”. He asked what would happen to trade from outside the buffer zone when it crossed into the zone and if checks would have to be carried out there.Mr Wilson said the British Government must make it clear that all of the borders that would exist as a consequence of Britain leaving the EU “whether that is between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, the Irish Republic and Great Britain, or Great Britain and Europe all present the same problems”.He concluded: “Instead of moving from one set of half-cooked ideas to the other it is now time for the Government to put down its foot and make it clear to EU negotiators that the Prime Minister stands by her commitment that no deal is better than a bad deal and if they want to avoid the consequences then they need to stop dismissing the perfectly feasible ideas that were put forward in August of last year.”Sinn Féin accused Mr Davis of trying to “hide a hard border in a buffer zone”.MEP Martina Anderson said: “Once again this shows the lack of knowledge of border areas and the concerns they face - David Davis obviously didn’t learn much on his flying visits.”Mr Davis’s Department for Exiting the EU did not deny that the proposal was under consideration.A Downing Street spokesman said: “The Prime Minister has been absolutely clear that we cannot and will not accept a customs border down the Irish Sea, and that we will preserve the integrity of the UK’s common market.” -

tooth decay or sensitivity in the future.Coating the outer part of the teeth, enamel is the hardest tissue in the body and can resist extreme temperatures and acidic food and drinks, helping it last for decades.Researchers at Queen Mary University of London now say they have developed a new way to grow mineralised material, which could pave the way for regenerating hard tissues such as enamel and bone.Dr Sherif Elsharkawy, a dentist and first author of the study, said: This is exciting because the simplicity and versatility of the mineralisation platform opens up opportunities to treat and regenerate dental tissues.How to | Brush your teeth betterFor example, we could develop acid-resistant bandages that can infiltrate, mineralise, and shield exposed dentinal tubules (microscopic

Of the 180 weapon systems that currently coexist in Europe, we must move to a situation like the United States, which has only about 30 weapons systems.”The new intervention force has been touted as an opportunity to involve Britain in European defence cooperation after Brexit.Earl Howe, the junior defence minister, said last month: “It will help to achieve what we are looking for, which is a deep and special partnership with our European colleagues in defence and security”.Mrs Merkel said she welcomed the opportunity to involve Britain in the force. But she also stressed that the the EU’s existing defence pact and any “common military strategy” are “closely related”, which will stoke Brexiteer fears that the force could involve Britain in a European army by the back door.Mr Macron is thought to be keen to involve Britain in future European defence cooperation as one of the continent’s most effective militaries.But he is also pushing for the force in part because of frustrations with the slow pace of EU defence integration.Twenty-three member states signed up to a defence cooperation pact last year after Britain dropped its opposition in light of Brexit.But progress has been slow amid foot-dragging from several members, including Germany, where there are traditional misgivings over the role of the military, given the country’s Second World War history.Mrs Merkel emphasised that the German armed forces would remain commanded by parliament and not the government, and “would not take part in every mission”.Israel strikes Hamas military targets and naval forces in Gaza as rocket fire breaks calmPhilippines President Rodrigo Duterte says UN human rights expert \u0026#39can go to hell\u0026#39Jonathan Aitken to be ordained and plans to become a prison chaplainAnti-immigrant party tipped for victory in isive Slovenian election Lee Rigby killer Michael Adebolajo says sorry for murderComment: A Very English Scandal proves history is best repeated as farceCoronation Street dominates British Soap Awards as Lucy Fallon wins two prizes for grooming storylineAnnual World Custard Pie Championship sees 2,000 pies thrown in food fight\u0026#39Demonic possession is real and victims seeking exorcism should not be ignored\u0026#39: Prominent psychiatrist on the world beyondEdward Snowden\u0026#39s lawyer warns of \u0026#39databases of ruin\u0026#39 as Big Tech ousts Big Brother in surveillance debateMet police accused of \u0026#39wasting\u0026#39 £10m on leadership training programme as crime soars Murder probe launched after boy, 17, stabbed in \u0026#39targeted\u0026#39 attackWhale dies in Thailand after swallowing 80 plastic bagsGPs handing out too many antibiotics harms cancer survival chancesTerror suspects are to be monitored more closely as Government unveils new plans to target extremistsTiny Indian football team qualify for top ision in \u0026#39fairytale\u0026#39 coached by former Rangers legendSNP and Tories would block free vote for MPs on abortion in Northern IrelandWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"benedict cumberbatch hero save deliveroo cyclist muggers sherlock baker street","story":"The Sherlock actor was near\u0026nbspBaker Street at the timeBenedict Cumberbatch has been hailed as a “hero” after saving a Deliveroo driver from a gang of four muggers.\u0026nbspThe actor was in an Uber with wife, Sophie Hunter, near London’s Baker Street – the fictional home of the character Sherlock Holmes, who Cumberbatch has famously portrayed on screen – when he stopped the car and leapt to the rescue.Witnesses say the 41-year-old began by shouting “leave him alone” at the attackers before getting involved, dragging the four potential muggers off the victim.\u0026nbspThey reportedly tried to punch Cumberbatch, who defended himself, the attackers then fleeing once they realised who was stopping them,\u0026nbsphaving stolen nothing.\u0026nbspCumberbatch’s actions are said to have stopped serious injuries to the cyclist, who had been hit over the head with a wine bottle.“Benedict was courageous, brave and selfless,” the driver, Manuel Dias, who also helped fend off the attackers, said. “Here was Sherlock Holmes fighting off four attackers just round the corner from Baker Street.”He continued: “They tried to hit him but he defended himself and pushed them away. He wasn’t injured. Then I think they also re­cognised it was Be­ne­dict and ran away.\u0026nbsp“He asked the rider how he was and when he said, ‘I’m OK’ Benedict just hugged him.”The police have since confirmed they were called to the scene at Marylebone High Street, just half a mile from Baker Street, in November.

Is the adoption of other people\u0027s customs and cultures fair game or has political correctness gone mad?\u0026nbspDavid Barnett treads warily\u0026nbspLet’s get this out of the way: I am a straight, white, middle-aged man, so what follows you may take with a pinch of salt or disregard completely. But we’re going to talk, you and I, about the thorny issue of cultural appropriation.It was only a year ago that Oxford Dictionaries put the phrase into their official lexicons, with the definition, “the unacknowledged or inappropriate adoption of the customs, practices, ideas, etc. of one people or society by members of another and typically more dominant people or society.”Cultural appropriation is sometimes so blatant it smacks us in the face. The Black and White Minstrel Show ran on British television for – what seems now to us, looking back at it – and astonishing 20 years, from 1958.Even halfway through its run the show, in which white entertainers “blacked up” to sing songs in a Deep South of America style, was the subject of petitions calling for it to be taken off the air because of its in-your-face racism. It can hardly be seen now without an overwhelming feeling of embarrassment. How did we ever think that was acceptable?The show was harking back to the minstrel shows in 19th-century America, and blackface was a popular form of entertainment until the enlightenment of the 1960s, coupled with rising racial tensions across the US, finally put paid to it. Even Al Jolson, dubbed “the world’s greatest entertainer”, was renowned for performing in blackface. Jolson was Jewish, and while there can never be any excuses made today for blacking up, it’s interesting that in their 2008 book the Encyclopedia of American Jewish History, authors Stephen Harlan Norwood and Eunice G Pollack talk of Jolson’s 1927 movie The Jazz Singer in terms which suggest some kind of what we would today call intersectionality. For example: “Is there any incongruity in this Jewish boy with his face painted like a Southern Negro singing in the Negro dialect? No, there is not…The son of a line of rabbis well knows how to sing the songs of the most cruelly wronged people in the world\u0027s history.”Can a Jewish man really pretend to be a black man without racism? Is this cultural appropriation of the very worst kind or solidarity that only two historically subjugated peoples can appreciate? And what, then, of a Jewish woman who dresses up as a Japanese woman for entertainment?The cries of “cultural appropriation” were resounding around social media even before Netta Barzilai had finished her (ultimately competition-winning) performance of Toys, the Israeli entry in this month’s Eurovision song contest held in Lisbon.Netta wore a stylised kimono and was surrounded by dozens of maneki neko waving lucky cat statues. Twitter in particular was rather exercised by the thought of the cultural appropriation taking place before its very eyes. Or, I should say, mainly white Western Twitter. It seems the only people not too fussed were the Japanese themselves.According to the website soranews24, which repackages and discusses Japanese news stories for an English speaking audience, the overwhelming response on the ground seems to be a mildly nonplussed reaction.The site quoted from Japanese social media accounts which included the responses, “Culture is meant to be stolen. If it’s not worth stealing, then it isn’t culture”, “If people keep claiming ‘cultural appropriation’ then people will not touch our culture. Then, people will not understand our culture and it will be easier to become our enemy”, and, perhaps crucially, “Westerners care too much about silly things”.Is that the problem? Are we, Westerners, liberal Westerners, too over-sensitive of the feelings of others brought on by white guilt? Or are we right to call out what we think is wrong when we see it? Should we wait before speaking, to see what the actual people affected think? Or is it our duty to step in first?Perhaps it’s now we should go back to the Oxford Dictionaries definition of cultural appropriation, particularly the bit that talks about the “more dominant people or society”. Is Israel a more dominant culture than Japan? Or vice-versa? What do we think? What do they think?A couple of weeks before Eurovision, Eastern dress was setting Twitter alight again, this time when a Utah teenager posted online pictures of her wearing her prom dress which was actually a qipao, traditional Chinese dress. The 18-year-old was accused of cultural appropriation and casual racism. People of Chinese heritage chimed in with arguments on both sides of the debate, with some pointing out that the outfit was originally worn by women carrying out domestic duties, and thus not something to be really celebrated, and another writing, “I’m Asian and Chinese, you looked beautiful in that dress, I’m sorry you got bashed for it.”Cyprus\u0027 singer Eleni Foureira performs the song FuegoIsrael\u0027s singer Netta performs the song Toy Belgium\u0027s singer Sennek performs the song A Matter Of Time Estonia\u0027s singer Elina Nechayeva performs the song La ForzaCroatia\u0027s singer Franka performs the song Crazy Albania\u0027s singer Eugent Bushpepa performs the song MallCzech Republic\u0027s singer Mikolas Josef performs the song Lie To MeIreland\u0027s singer Ryan O\u0027Shaughnessy performs the song TogetherSwiss duo ZIBBZ\u0027s singer Corinne Gfeller performs the song StonesBulgarian group Equinox\u0027 singer Zhana Bergendorff (R) performs the song BonesLithuania\u0027s singer Ieva Zasimauskaite performs the song When We\u0027re OldFinland\u0027s singer Saara Aalto performs the song MonstersGreece\u0027s singer Yianna Terzi performs the song Oniro MouAustria\u0027s singer Cesar Sampson performs the song Nobody But YouAzerbaijan\u0027s singer Aisel performs the song X My HeartIceland\u0027s singer Ari Olafsson performs the song Our ChoiceArmenia\u0027s singer Sevak Khanagyan performs the song QamiMacedonian duo Eye Cue\u0027s lead vocalist Marija Ivanovska (R) and guitarist Bojan Trajkovski perform the song Lost And FoundBelarus\u0027 singer Alekseev performs the song ForeverNorway\u0027s singer Alexander Rybak performs the song That\u0027s How You Write A SongRomanian band The Humans perform the song GoodbyeSerbia\u0027s band Sanja Ilic \u0026amp Balkanika perform the song Nova DecaSan Marino\u0027s Jessika featuring Jenifer Brening perform the song Who We AreDenmark\u0027s singer Rasmussen performs the song Higher GroundPoland\u0027s singer Gromee feat.

The fashion shows routinely feature collections riffing off a range of global cultures. For the coming autumn, Gucci recently unveiled a series of headwear inspired by Sikh turbans. Vogue ran a photoshoot in its “Diversity Issue” last year with a model in full Japanese geisha outfit. Not unusual, and perhaps nothing wrong with it… save for in both cases (and in the Victoria’s Secret show last year in which a model flaunted a Native American-style headdress) all the models were white.Here’s where cultural appropriation smacks up against representation. Maybe if Victoria’s Secret had employed a Native American model, if Vogue had used a Japanese model, if Gucci had – as the Sikh Coalition suggested in the aftermath – used Sikh models who would have properly observed the correct way to wear what is, after all, a sacred clothing item, then the later dissemination of these items on to the high street might not be quite so problematic.There’s a difference, too, between fashion and performance. When I was very young, on a holiday at a Pontin’s camp on the North-West coast, I was wrapped in a blanket, had two stripes of lipstick put across my face, and a feather from a passing seagull taped to my head. I was entered into the fancy dress contest (I didn’t win). I was of course, a Red Indian, as Native Americans were called in those less-enlightened times.As bad as the Black and White Minstrels? Possibly. But “Red Indians” back then were almost a fictional, fairytale group of people, the image drawn from Monday matinee westerns not renowned for historical accuracy, from Peter Pan, from Hiawatha and Little Plum. Would I have dressed my children like that when they were the same age? Undoubtedly not. Times change. Sensitivities alter.Utah teenager, Keziah Daum, sparked a huge debate on Twitter about cultural appropriation after posting photos of her traditional Chinese prom dressAnd I look down at what I’m wearing right now as I type this. A T-shirt, which has its origins as an undergarment in 19th-century America. A pair of jeans, which were originally developed in Italy (Genoa, which gave rise to “jeans”) and France (the fabric of Nimes, or de Nimes, from which is derived “denim”). A pair of flip-flops (don’t judge me), evolved from the Japanese zōri which servicemen took back to America post-Second World War (though early flip-flops have been discovered in ancient Egyptian burial sites).I am a melange of styles borrowed, begged and stolen from around the world. Is this cultural appropriation, several generations down the line? Should I be wearing what my grandfathers wore? Polyester slacks and an Oxford shirt, a cardigan, brogues? Where is the line, and on which side of it are we?Music is another cultural appropriation battleground. Every time Katy Perry or Taylor Swift goes “ghetto” for another video, or Lana Del Ray puts on a Native American headdress, it’s there to see. White folks stole rock’n’roll from African rhythms filtered through the American South, we stole electronic dance music from the predominantly-black post-disco clubs of Chicago and Detroit, and Italy. Take away the cultural appropriation, and what’s left? A couple of rousing choruses of Knees Up, Mother Brown or The Lambeth Walk, perhaps.Should we talk about food? Those great British traditions such as pizza, or chow mein, or curry? A few miles from me, Bradford is awash with curry houses. The clientele is largely white. Is that cultural appropriation? Well, no, because most of the restaurants are owned and worked in by people of South Asian heritage. But what was deemed cultural appropriation was when, earlier this year, a restaurant called Fanny’s announced it was opening a venue for the purveying of “posh kebabs” in London’s Stoke Newington.The move was lambasted on Twitter because, for one, Stoke Newington is a hub for Turkish restaurants and takeaways… the people who, you know, invented the kebab. For another, because the people behind Fanny’s weren’t Turkish (one of the founders is called Claude Compton, for your information), and the tag-line “posh kebabs” intimated that these “lads from Fulham” were basically going to beat the Turks at their own game (as a side note, Fanny’s subsequently dropped the “posh” bit from their marketing and logo).Fanny\u0027s Kebabs finally dropped the \u0027posh\u0027 bit from their marketing (fannyskebabsInstagram)If you’ve made it this far, you might be wondering where I’m heading with all this. And the honest answer is, I just don’t know. Cultural appropriation seems, on the face of it, like it should be something that all of us should fight against, but the flip-side of that is knowing exactly just what it is and when we should call it out.As I said at the top of this piece, take what I say with a pinch of salt, given that I am a middle-aged white man. But where does that leave me, if we remove years of embedded cultural appropriation? Dressed in my grandad’s clothes, listening to a 78 of George Formby classics, and clutching a chip butty? And on that score, should I be calling cultural appropriation on the New York magazine The Insider’s awestruck piece last month on a Turkish restaurant that was selling this remarkable new thing, a sandwich stuffed with fries?The answer’s no, of course, because cultural appropriation will never affect me in the way it does other, marginalised people. I have working-class roots but I’m still pretty close to the top of the privilege chain all I can realistically get away with is some faux outrage at posh kids slumming it at Wetherspoons and Greggs for Instagram likes.But maybe those who identify as white, liberal allies should hit the pause button before calling out cultural appropriation, and just take a moment to think. The obvious stuff, the outright horror of the Black and White Minstrels and the more subtle but by no means any less problematic racism, yes, by all means, dig in. Dog-piling on teenagers for wearing a prom dress, maybe hold off a bit.Cultural appropriation is a big desert, and one on which we might have to draw our own personal lines in the sand as to what we know in our guts is wrong, and what we think might be, possibly, a little bit off.And with that, I bid you sayonara.Black and White minstralsor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

As Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, argues, Britain could have a second EU referendum before Christmas this year, giving time for a lengthy 12-week campaign starting next September.Nick Clegg puts a rather different argument. He says that Brexit should be put to a second referendum because people who voted Leave are dying off.\u0026nbspThe “high point” of support for Brexit had passed because “the oldest voters voted for Brexit in the largest numbers” while the young voted to remain in the EU.\u0026nbspMy case is that the first referendum said we should leave without specifying how. In a second referendum, the government would in effect say – here’s the deal we have negotiated... do you approve? What could be more logical? What could be more natural?\u0026nbspNothing except that Ms May has ruled out a second Brexit referendum. In February, in a typically muddled formulation, she told a conference:\u0026nbsp“We are leaving the EU and there is no question of a second referendum or going back and I think that’s important. People in the UK feel very strongly that if we take a decision, then governments should turn not round and say, no, you got that wrong.” But if anybody is going to say, “you got that wrong”, it wouldn’t be the government but rather the people saying to the prime minister that she got wrong the exit terms she negotiated.\u0026nbspThat is what Ms May doesn’t like about the notion of a second referendum.In fact, there is a strong case for holding a second referendum. Since 23 June 2016, the date of the first referendum, we have learnt quite a few things we didn’t know before. Business chiefs, for instance, are worried about the time-wasting bureaucracy of filling in customs declarations after Brexit takes place. That is what a hard border would mean.As to the Brexiteers’ notion that technology could be used to avoid this, Jon Thompson, chief executive of HM Revenue and\u0026nbspCustoms, delivered a stark verdict\u0026nbspwhen he appeared before the Treasury Committee.\u0026nbspThe cost to business of introducing a high-tech customs plan would be up to £20bn a year, he said. That is a frighteningly high price to pay.\u0026nbspWhen we cast our referendum vote, we also hadn’t thought about complex procedures such as car assembly. As a car chassis moves along the production line, components from all over Europe are put into their appointed places. If this is taking place in a British car plant, then many of the components will have come from the continent. If the plant is on the other side of the Channel, then many British-made parts will have had to have been shipped across. In fact, more than two-thirds of the UK’s exports to the EU take the form of intermediate inputs to the production of finished goods and services. Likewise, about 55 per cent of imports from the EU represent products to be incorporated in final production in the UK. If all this were to be subject to customs clearance, then the whole series of complex procedures would come to a halt.No wonder the prospect of Brexit is already having a negative effect on economic activity. As the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, an intergovernmental economic organisation, commented this week: “Economic growth is projected to remain modest at 1.4 per cent in 2018 and 1.3 per cent in 2019, owing to high uncertainties about the outcome of Brexit negotiations.”\u0026nbspThis is about half the rate of growth being experienced by the rest of Europe. Did we know that Brexit would condemn Britain to reduced economic activity?In short, we need a second referendum because we know much more about the disadvantages of leaving the European Union that we did when we were first asked. Moreover, in Ms May we have a prime minister who cannot make up her mind about anything. The Financial Times put this point strongly on 17 May: “It has been 693 days since Britain voted to leave the EU. In another 316, that decision is set to become reality. Yet the government of Theresa May has still not come to an agreement – either with itself or with Brussels – on what the new economic relationship with the continent should be. This was the most basic question raised by Brexit, and it should have been answered before Article 50 was triggered, setting in motion withdrawal.\u0026nbspFailure to do so is testament to political isions and weak leadership.”\u0026nbspSo we shall have to make up Ms\u0026nbspMay’s mind for her.So, in light of this muddle and confusion, what question would be put in a second referendum?\u0026nbspIn the 2016 referendum the question was\u0026nbspshould the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?\u0026nbspIn effect, this formulation called for an answer from the gut. Like it or leave it? But in a second referendum, this luxury would not be available.\u0026nbspThere would have to be reference to the terms of disengagement covering such crucial questions as whether the UK would remain a member of some kind of customs union.\u0026nbspAs it is hard to get such detail into a simple question, I suggest the following:Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave on such terms as approved by parliament?\u0026nbspIn addition, a simple version of the terms approved by parliament could be sent to every voter and could be made available in voting stations.This would have the merit of emphasising that parliament is the supreme decision-making body in this country. However, as a Remainer, I must remember a key rule about asking questions – never ask one when you might not like the answer. How likely is it that the answer to a second referendum might differ from the first? Remember that voters are likely to be hostile to the holding of a second referendum. They may think – you have asked us once, we gave you an answer, don’t bother us again. With the result that the turnout for a second referendum would likely be low and thus unconvincing.However, Peter Kellner, the experienced political commentator and former president of YouGov, has just published a much more upbeat appraisal.\u0026nbspHe believes that below the surface, public opinion is stirring. In particular, one million Labour voters who backed Brexit two years ago are having second thoughts. His study of recent polling results convinces him that significant numbers of younger Leave voters, as well as those supporting Labour in last year’s election, no longer think Brexit is right for Britain. He also supports the Nick Clegg thesis and argues that the effects of demographic changes since the referendum are growing. “Bluntly,”\u0026nbspas he writes, “older, mainly Leave, voters are dying and younger, mainly Remain, voters are joining the electorate.”Mr Kellner bases his findings in the more than 23,000 voters that YouGov has questioned since the start of the year.\u0026nbspAnd his conclusion is that there is a real prospect that if the people were given the final say on Brexit, they would vote for the UK to stay in the European Union. So let’s have a second referendum.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

frontbenchers are urging\u0026nbspministers to reinstate the Access to Elected Office Fund without delayThe government has been accused of shutting disabled people out of elected office by delaying the return of a dedicated fund to help people stand for parliament.A group of Labour frontbenchers has urged ministers to reinstate the Access to Elected Office Fund without delay, which was set up under the coalition government to give grants of up to £40,000 to disabled candidates for additional costs such as transport or sign language interpreters.The vital fund was frozen for review in 2015, and Penny Mordaunt, the women and equalities minister quietly announced a further 12-month consultation earlier this month.Candidates will be able to draw from a £250,000 fund for upcoming local elections but critics warned this must not be used to kick the issue of a long-term solution into the long grass.Parliament only has five openly disabled MPs, including Labour MP Marsha de Cordova, who is partially sighted, and Tory education committee chair Robert Halfon, who has cerebral palsy.In a letter to Ms Mordaunt, co-signed by Ms Cordova, shadow voter engagement minister Cat Smith and shadow women and equalities minister Dawn Butler, Labour said: “It is vital that the government finds a long-term solution to improve the substantial underrepresentation of disabled people in public life.“This 12 month public consultation period cannot be used as a way to defer government responsibility and kick this into the long grass.“Whilst all political parties can do more to reduce barriers facing disabled candidates, the extra campaign costs they incur as a result of their disability should be met by the government and not by political parties.“The Access to Elected Office fund must be fully restored without further delay.”Ms Smith told The Independent that delaying the decision added to “a catalogue of policies that have failed disabled people” by the government.She added: “Disabled people are shockingly underrepresented in public life and without additional financial support many talented candidates are prevented from standing for public office.“If the Tories are serious about delivering a fair and equal society, they will restore the fund as a matter of urgency.”David Buxton, who was the first deaf sign language-using parliamentary candidate in 1997, said the cost of paying for interpreters had dissuaded him standing for the Liberal Democrats in the upcoming Lewisham East by-election.Mr Buxton, who co-founded Liberal Democrats Disability programme, said: “I know the area well, having lived and worked there for years.“The hindrance was that I was unable to find enough funds to pay for BSLEnglish interpreters during the by election campaign, so I decided not to send the application an hour before the closing date.”He urged the government to reinstate the fund to allow him a final chance to stand for the next election, after 30 years of working in politics.He went on: “To date, parliament has only 5 disabled MPs in spite of the fact that Britain has nearly 20 per cent of people having a disability.“In other words, parliament could have 125 disabled MPs.“parliament should be seen as positive, strongly erse and well represented across all communities, fully embracing ersity, equality and inclusion”.Ms Mordaunt said the disabled population in parliament was “not sufficiently represented” but placed the burden on political parties to bring about change.Announcing the consultation in a statement earlier this month, she said: “The prime responsibility for this would sit with political parties themselves.“However, within this, there will be ways the government can help too, for example by looking at extending the support we already provide in other areas such as employment to enable other activities such as volunteering or representing their communities.”She added: “While this work is ongoing we want to ensure that disabled people can run for office, so we are announcing a fund of up to £250,000 to support disabled candidates, primarily for the forthcoming English local elections in 2019.“We will set out further details about the scheme in the near future and any measures taken to ensure such costs are not considered to be part of a candidate’s election expenses.”A\u0026nbspGovernment Equalities Office spokesperson said: “The first announcement the new Minister for Women and Equalities made was for £250,000 to support disabled candidates for elections held over the next 12 months.“This is so disabled candidates are not disadvantaged while the situation is improved.“We are not consulting for 12 months, but instead will work with disabled people’s organisations and political parties to ensure every disabled person who wishes to run for office can.“There is a role for government but the prime responsibility and financial burden lies with political parties themselves. They must properly support disabled candidates, and we will help them do that.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Certainly, opening bank accounts, and whether you can or cannot as an illegal immigrant, I’m not sure that the data that we have is accurate enough so I have suspended that for the time being.”However, he said he still wanted to maintain a distinction between welcoming people in the UK who are here legally and not tolerating illegal immigration.Mr Javid also said that overall net migration is still too high and needs to be addressed by policies to bring it down to a sustainable level.Asked if the “tens of thousands” was still a commitment he was happy with, he said: “It is a commitment in our manifesto … we are happy with our manifesto.”Earlier this week, Ms Davidson doubled down on her call for the “tens of thousands” target to be scrapped.She said in a speech: “I see neither the sense nor the need to stick to an immigration figure devised nearly a decade ago, which has never been met and does not fit the requirements of the country.“Setting an immigration target reduced to the tens of thousands is one thing when unemployment is running at 8 per cent. Refusing to review it when the country nears full employment and sectors are reporting skills shortages is quite another.”The Independent, along with the Open Britain group,\u0026nbsphas been running the Drop the Target campaign to scrap the “tens of thousands” net migration policy.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Firstly, set up an independent inquiry –\u0026nbspwe must investigate\u0026nbspinstances of Islamophobic conduct and isolate them swiftly,” Lord Sheikh says in the letter seen by The Independent.\u0026nbsp“Secondly the prime\u0026nbspminister should reach out to all outreach groups of the Conservative Party such as the Conservative Muslim Forum and actively engage in dialogue.”\u0026nbspThe comments come days after The Independent\u0026nbsprevealed that the\u0026nbspMuslim Council of Britain (MCB) had written to the Tories to\u0026nbspdemand an urgent inquiry into Islamophobia in the party.The organisation, which represents more than 500 mosques, schools and associations in Britain, urged the party to conduct a full audit to tackle the “more than weekly occurrences of Islamophobia from candidates and representatives of the party”.Lord Sheikh said the MCB\u0026nbspletter came “as no surprise to me and should not come as a surprise to the party either”.\u0026nbspThe MCB’s letter cited 10 examples of Islamophobia by members of the party that have been revealed in an eight-week period since 5 April.\u0026nbspHarun Khan, secretary general of the Muslim Council of Britain, said: “The Conservative Party prides itself in being against any form of bigotry and racism yet there are serious concerns that its best values are being disfigured by Islamophobic views.\u0026nbsp“We look forward to the party taking forward our suggestion of an inquiry into Islamophobia and we are happy to help support in any capacity we can.”A\u0026nbspTory councillor was suspended\u0026nbspthis week after he allegedly posted Islamophobic\u0026nbspcomments about London mayor Sadiq Khan on Facebook.Stephen Ardley, a councillor on Waveney District Council, allegedly said it was “unbelievable” that a Muslim had been elected and went on to describe those who voted for him as “blind”.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

In England, the net earnings threshold will be £7,400 whereas in Northern Ireland it will be £14,000.A government technical note published in May said that if the change had not been made, “around half of all (state school) children would become eligible for FSM and the meals would no longer be targeted at those who need them the most”.It said that in 2017 around 1.1 million disadvantaged children were eligible and received a free school meal, some 14 per cent\u0026nbspof all state-school pupils.But if the change had not been made the number of additional children who would have been eligible was between 2,300,000 and 2,600,000 by 2022.In a speech to the GMB’s Public Services Conference in Brighton on Sunday, Mrs Rayner will urge the Government to adopt Labour’s plan for free school meals for all primary school children.She will say: “Ministers said time and time again that no one would lose a meal, only for the IFS to reveal that one in eight children who were eligible will be stripped of their entitlement under the Universal Credit.“Now it appears that there would be millions more who could have had a meal but will be denied.“Even now, the\u0026nbspgovernment refuses to release their own calculations in full.“Their claims on school funding have collapsed and now their story on school meals is falling apart.”The technical note was published on the Government’s website after a Freedom of Information request for it by the GMB, the union said.Ministers have said it was never their intention for the temporary arrangements to remain in place and that an estimated 50,000 more children will receive free school meals by 2022, compared with the old benefits system.It comes after the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) warned in April that it expected there to be “losers” under changes introduced via UC, which sees six benefits rolled into one payment, despite 50,000 more children becoming eligible.GMB general secretary Tim Roache said the policy was “cruel, heartless and needless”.He said: “I can’t believe there’s even a debate about whether kids should go hungry or not.“In blunt and stark terms, this policy is taking food from the mouths of millions of children from poorer backgrounds.“Our members working in schools already encounter children with no food at home, they see packed lunches of no more than crisps or chocolate and buy snacks for their pupils out of their own pockets because too many parents are struggling to make ends meet.”Children and families minister, Nadhim Zahawi, said: “It’s right that we continue to support the most disadvantaged children.“Contrary to misleading statements, every child who currently receives a free school meal will continue to do so and as we have repeatedly made clear our data – which is publicly available – clearly shows that around 50,000 more children will benefit from free school meals by 2022.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

We feel that if we were classified a devolved region of the UK, Spain would show more respect for our sea boundaries and our border,\u0026ldquo he added.On June 19 South Thanet MP Craig Mackinlay will present a Ten Minute Rule Bill to parliament calling for debate of the issue.\u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove already crossed a rubicon - there is already an attachment between Gibraltar and the UK for European electoral purposes. This was considered the right thing to do, he said last night.\u0026ldquoIn addition Gibraltar is special because it is in Europe and is a large economy that sits in the Stirling zone.\u0026ldquoIt is feeling unloved and uncertain about its future I feel this would be a clear signal that Gibraltar is firmly part of the British family and that this will never change.He added: \u0026ldquoI would be very much like to see Gibraltar have he same devo- max type settlement that Scotland enjoys wth its own constituency.

It\u0027s easily the biggest wildlife petition ever in Scotland and for several days last week it was the most popular petition on the world\u0027s biggest petition website.

Sometimes, most of the time, life is more valuable than profit if you have the commonsense to see it.And David Mackay, from Inverness, added: The Scottish Wildcat is one of the last truly wild animals of note left in Scotland. It would be a travesty to lose it for the sake of a few tonnes of timber.Ian Adams, from Liverpool, said: Forest plantations are clearly a commercial undertaking but the loss of such a rare animal would be nothing less than a disaster. The Scottish Government must call a halt to this logging operation, even if compensation has to be paid. Does Nicola Sturgeon want to be the saviour or the assassin?A spokesman for FES said Clashindarroch was managed sustainably, leaving a mosaic of habitats including mature trees and replanted areas that was shown to be very beneficial for Scottish Wildcats.He added: It is heartening to know that so many members of the public have such a keen interest in wildcat conservation. The protection and conservation of the Scottish Wildcat is something we feel strongly about too.FES undertakes a huge range of actions to conserve wildcats and also other important species such as red squirrels, capercaillie and birds of prey \u0026ndash they all benefit from our conservation management.Clashindarroch is a working forest and is very important in terms of supplying materials to the timber industry in Scotland.

So would you if people were trying to kill you.”He admitted embellishing his past, including claims his parents died in a car crash and he was the son of an earl.He told the Old Bailey: “But I have not lied since that wretched man tried to kill me because I suddenly realised there was no point in all this lying.”Scott also revealed he had set up a riding school with his earnings from interviews, earning the scorn of the judge.Mr Justice Cantley told the jury Scott was A hysterical, warped personality... He is a crook. He is a fraud. He is a sponger. He is a whiner. He is a parasite.”Peter Bessell was a former Liberal MP and close friend of Thorpes.He told the court Thorpe had told him of his intention to kill Scott in a meeting at the House of Commons a decade earlier in 1969.Bessell said he was shocked when Thorpe had calmly told him murdering Scott was no worse than shooting a sick dog.His credibility as a witness was ripped apart by Thorpes barrister George Carman, who accused him of telling whoppers and branded him amoral for not raising his concerns earlier.It emerged Bessell had a huge £50,000 deal to write about the case for the Sunday  - but would only get half the money if Thorpe was acquitted.The trial judge, Sir Joseph Cantley, said Bessell was a humbug and suggested his evidence was a tissue of lies.It was the most controversial summing up in British legal history. Thorpe decided not to give evidence in his defence, which was seen as a huge gamble and tainted him in the eyes of the public.His barrister is said to have feared he would be ripped apart in cross-examination.It has also emerged Thorpe had written a love letter to a man he met in San Francisco in the early 1960s and could have been quizzed in court about his sexuality.After two days the jury acquitted all four defendants.Thorpe said the verdict was totally fair, just and a complete vindication.He never returned to public life and died in 2014.Scott still lives in Devon where he sells horses.Years after the trial he said of Thorpe:  “He ruined my life – all I’m remembered for now is Thorpe’s gay lover and that’s not something to be proud of.He must be a broken man and I know he must hate me just as much as I hate him.”Scott is played by actor  Ben Whishaw in the new BBC drama A Very English Scandal starring Hugh Grant as Thorpe."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000404794533-e1525902978417.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"george carman qc jeremy thorpe","story":"Among the famous names like Ken Dodd, Carman also took on high profile cases involving ordinary people, representing Carole Richardson, one of the Guildford Four.Carman was called to the bar in 1953 and spent most of his time doing criminal and personal injury work.He was made a Queens Counsel in 1971, and moved to Byrom Street chambers.Carman defended the manager of Battersea Fun Fair in 1973, when he was accused of manslaughter after a big dipper ride malfunctioned the previous year and resulted in the deaths of five kids.The case brought him to the attention of the London solicitor Sir David Napley, who instructed him to represent Jeremy Thorpe, the former Leader of the Liberal Party.Jeremy Thorpes trial was a cause célèbre and a high profile case which made Carmans name and he went on to feature in many high profile cases, often involving celebrities like Sir Elton John, Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman and Mohamed Al-Fayed.Despite the famous names he cited his 1981 case defending Dr Leonard Arthur, a consultant paediatrician, as his finest moment.

Some Italians told me unelected bankers and institutions in Brussels were being put first. They have a point.The EU and Italy’s President now need to tread incredibly carefully. The 5-Star Movement is already mobilising voters through street protests. The League party is calling on them to vent their frustration at the banks and financial markets.Yesterday, one EU official suggested the financial markets would teach Italian voters a lesson by withdrawing investment from the country. This will only pour gasoline on the populist fire.So, what happens next? The populists will almost certainly sweep to another victory at fresh elections, possibly triggering a new financial crisis and creating another major headache in Brussels. One of the parties might also propose a referendum on Italy’s euro membership.It seems very likely this chaos is not going anywhere anytime soon and the EU will soon be presented with yet another crisis.The events in Italy have clear implications for the Brexit debate. The EU has struggled to make sense of why Leavers opted for Brexit, just as today they are struggling to make sense of the mood in Italy.Many Leavers voted for Brexit because they felt the EU was not able to manage its own affairs, and they will see Italy as further evidence of that.But also many Leavers were anxious that the European Union allows very little room for other political views and they will see that as well in the Italy crisis.While the president was acting in the remit of his constitutional office, the problem is that many Italians and Europeans feel this is an example of Europe’s inability to accept any opposition to the euro single currency.It seems difficult to see how this crisis can be resolved without a more openly Eurosceptic Italy — and without a populist government at the head of the eurozone’s third largest economy.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I told him how much he was loved, how much he would be missed and how proud we all were of him, amongst lots of other things.I also made a number of promises to him.

These relationships are key in nurturing our school community.By ensuring that all students have access to a daily nutritious home-cooked family meal we ensure that all have this equality of opportunity.Reiterating the Halal kitchen policy, the document states this is to “celebrate the diversity of our country’s culture”.In 2013 a Government-backed report compiled by the founders of restaurant chain Leon encouraged more headteachers to consider banning packed lunches.It stated: We were approached by many free schools who wanted advice on setting up a first-class food service.Among other things, we always advised them to ban packed lunches from the start.The report noted the rising obesity rates with children and added: Many parents mistakenly imagine that a packed lunch is the healthiest option.In fact, it is far easier to get the necessary nutrients into a cooked meal – even one of mediocre quality.Only one per cent of packed lunches meet the nutritional standards that currently apply to school food."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/nintchdbpict000407604800.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"meghan markle doria ragland mum favourite royal wedding","story":"Aside from watching her daughter and Harry recite their vows, Doria Ragland said her highlight of the big day was meeting the Queen.Dressed in an Oscar de la Renta dress and coat, she was the only family member present to support Meghan at St George’s Chapel in Windsor Castle.A source told US Weekly: Doria is saying the biggest highlight of the wedding, of course after watching her daughter say ‘I do’ to the man she loves, was meeting the queen.It would have been extremely intimidating for anyone, but Meghan and Harry really did a marvellous job of preparing her (with) what to expect.The source added that Prince Harry told his new mother-in-law numerous stories about the Queen as a grandmother and what she (means)to him.Doria also met Prince William, Kate Middleton, Prince George and Princess Charlotte in the run-up to the wedding on May 19.The 61-year-old charmed her new in-laws - and now people are speculating about whether she might give up her life as a yoga teacher and social worker in LA and move to the UK to support Meghan.A royal insider told The Mirror: When she (Meghan) and Harry start a family it’ll be incredibly hard if her mum is 5,500 miles away.Doria was praised for rising above family dramas ahead of her daughters nuptials.Meghans dad Thomas pulled out of the ceremony following a heart op.And her half brother, Thomas Jnr, wrote a bizarre open letter to Harry, telling him to call off the wedding.While Meghans half sister, Samantha Markle, painted her as a pushy princess."},{"url":null,"title":"plane emergency landing los angeles road","story":"The Cessna 172 had just taken off from the John Wayne airport in southern California when it made the emergency landing in Huntington Beach, just outside Los Angeles.Dash-cam footage shows the plane suddenly appear overhead, forcing cars to screech to a halt.The aircraft is shown swerving left to right and back again as vehicles swerve to avoid a collision.The pilot managed to bring the plane to a halt on the road just before a set of traffic lights.

Because 17.4million of us voted to leave, to take back control of our money, our laws and our borders.Before the referendum vote, Parliament decided — quite rightly — that the British people had the right to decide whether we should leave the EU.That is why Parliament passed the Referendum Act and voted to trigger Article 50.And it is why both major political parties agreed in last year’s general election to abide by the referendum decision.Liam Fox says Britain has proved the doubters wrongThere is also great strength in the UK economy that should give us reassurance as we move towards a more independent future.Remember the dire consequences predicted if the British people decided to vote to leave? We were told investors would desert us.What happened?Last year we landed more inward investment projects than ever before, a vote of confidence from the international financial community.We were told we would face an employment crisis.What happened?Employment is up by 600,000 since before the referendum to 32.34million, with record numbers in work.Our manufacturing order books are at their highest for years and our exports have risen by about ten per cent in the past year.Remember how jobs would flood out of the City of London to Paris and Frankfurt?What happened?Last year saw more venture capital on tech, including financial technology, coming to London than all of Germany, France, Spain and Ireland combined.Thankfully, the British people had the sense and courage to ignore the prophets of doom.We can rightly be confident and optimistic about our future outside the EU — and the PM has set out a vision of what that will look like. The UK already has enormous advantages in a competitive global economy.Our system of law is admired across the globe. Our skilled workforce and universities are world class.We have fantastic research and development facilities, some of the best innovators and we are leaders in the digital revolution.And we speak English and are in the right time zone to trade with Asia in the morning and the Americas in the afternoon.The UK is in a strong position. We are not the dependent and supplicant country some would have us believe.We are a leading member of the Commonwealth, a grouping of 53 countries that is home to one third of the world’s population and half of the globe’s top 20 emerging cities.We are one of the highest contributors to Nato, have a permanent seat on the UN Security Council and are members of the G7 and G20.The UK’s future is, and needs, to be global. Based on International Monetary Fund data, it has been calculated that in the next ten to 15 years, 90 per cent of global economic growth will originate from outside the EU.That is where we must concentrate our efforts for exports and investment, alongside maintaining our ties of prosperity and security with our European neighbours. The well-being of future generations depends upon it.Sometimes it is difficult for people in Britain, or the rest of Europe, to grasp the scale of this growth.But when we understand that by 2025, China, alone, will have 221 cities with more than a million people, while the whole of the European continent will have 35, we can begin to see a fuller picture.Of course, the EU will continue to be an important economic and trade partner and we want to have a full, open and comprehensive trade agreement with it that puts the prosperity of European people before the ideology of the EU bureaucracy.But the truth is that our trade relationship with the EU has been changing over the years, since well before the referendum.In 2006, 54 per cent of our exports went to the EU. That has now fallen to 44 per cent, as markets elsewhere have expanded faster.One of the main benefits of Brexit, and being outside the Customs Union, will be having an independent trade policy for the first time in more than 40 years — made in Britain, for Britain.We need to have policies that ensure we are able to take advantage of the opportunities that will lie ahead as Asia and Africa develop growing middle classes with an appetite for the high-quality goods and services Britain provides.We cannot allow our future options to be constrained by the patterns of the past.As we leave the EU, we will take up our independent seat at the World Trade Organisation, the governing body of global trade.We will be champions of the free trading system that has helped take a billion people out over abject poverty over the past generation — one of the greatest achievements in human history.We believe protectionism will always fail and that spreading prosperity through trade is the best route to the global stability and security that is in all our interests.The UK can, and should, be a leader in that quest.It is time for our country to raise its level of ambition, take pride in our achievements and help shape our global future, joining the PM and the Government in delivering a Brexit that works for everyone — in Britain and beyond.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It had all these weird side effects,” Jeppesen says.“There were moments when I finally was alone and nobody was watching me, yet it felt creepy because I was so used to being watched.Also, even when you’re not being monitored, people are staring because I’m a white guy and they’re not used to seeing foreigners in North Korea.”On his first morning, he heard an eerie sound outside his hotel room at 5 a.m., then heard it again every day after that.The entire city, it turns out, is awakened by an instrumental version of the North Korean tune, “Where Are You, Dear General?” a salute to the countrys founder Kim Il-sung.“It’s very, very haunting, and very bizarre,” Jeppesen said.“It almost sounds like something out of a David Lynch movie. It’s one of the things that reminds you that Dear Leader is with you everywhere you go. At every moment.”What North Koreans didn’t have at every moment was electricity, which Jeppesen’s prestigious university was usually without.“The hallways were dark. There was no plumbing really in the bathrooms,” he says.“It hit home that this is a really poor third-world country. Everything is very bare-bones.”Every housing unit came with one official spy — usually a middle-aged or elderly woman — called the inminbanjang, whose job is to know everything about her residents and report back to the government.“Her job is to ‘heighten revolutionary vigilance,’ as one propaganda poster has it,” Jeppesen writes in the book.“[She keeps] a watchful eye over the comings and goings of her assigned unit, down to the smallest detail. A good inminbanjang knows exactly how many spoons and chopsticks are in each family’s kitchen and can spill that information on cue if the need should arise.Which is not to say the inminbanjang are always strict. Many let certain rules slide, such as the elderly woman Jeppesen met who was “known to rent out her second room as an hourly love hotel for extra income.”This is just one example of how life is becoming slightly less regimented for North Koreans.While virtually all citizens wore uniforms until recently, there is now a freer sense of fashion. Men wear “short-sleeve shirts of all colors and designs,” with Rolexes adorning their wrists for status (even if most are fakes from China).Women mostly wear skirts, although jeans are permitted for some in certain positions. The hot footwear fashion is high heels worn with socks.At the home of a government official, Jeppesen also got a look at the nation’s television habits. The evening news is a fawning, monotonous rundown of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un’s daily schedule while “cheery symphonic music” plays in the background.But as he watched, the official turned off the news and put on “a pirated copy of ‘Zootopia’ he bought at a DVD stall.Incredibly, given the horror stories we hear about North Korea, as well as Jeppesen’s own frequently fearful experience, he still wants to return.“I’ve developed this weird affection for North Korea, even though I know it’s a horrific place,” he says. “I feel like it’s changing every day, and I want to know and understand more. One of the best ways of doing that is to be there.”See You Again in Pyongyang: A Journey Into Kim Jong Un’s North Korea, is out now, published by Hachette."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/05/2048x1152/skynews-arkady-babchenko-ukraine_4324518.jpg?20180531175547 ","title":"arkady babchenko has made journalists jobs harder","story":"And many of his colleagues felt the same way when they heard the news last night of his apparent murder.I didn\u0027t know him but my Twitter feed was full of those who did, many of whom must have stayed up long into the night filing moving obituaries of yet another Kremlin-critic killed which were clearly painful to write.Relief is bitter sweet when there\u0027s the sense somewhere in there that you\u0027ve been taken for a ride.He said he felt he had no choice, he was told to co-operate with Ukraine\u0027s security services, so co-operate he did.And will the Ukrainian authorities provide evidence that they have in fact been able to identify the arrested man\u0027s handlers and convincingly finger the FSB in a wider plot aimed at destabilising Ukraine?Or will this all fizzle a little, like their investigation into Mr Sheremet\u0027s murder two years ago, which seems to have gone nowhere.Mr Babchenko posted on Facebook he promised to die at 96 and dance on Putin\u0027s grave."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/06/2048x1152/skynews-soyuz-iss_4327203.jpg?20180603150202 ","title":"astronauts leave international space station and return to earth after 2600 orbits","story":"The three occupants had been in space for 168 days.Three crewmembers remain in the ISS - Americans Drew Feustel and Ricky Arnold and Russian Oleg Artemyev.Another three astronauts are to be launched to the ISS on Wednesday.

And the emergency services themselves can be very nervous. It’s a very daunting time. But without fail, our emergency services step up. It was no different during the London Bridge attack. The policemen who answered - within minutes - the first call had no idea what they were going into. It’s times like that you really do see the best of our services. We must never take for granted the sacrifices they make.  Each time there is a terror attack or a tragedy like Grenfell, we see our emergency services doing us proud. You see off-duty medics, police, firefighters coming in to help their teams. And that’s to save as many lives as possible. I worked with Dr Martin Griffiths when I was at the Royal London and he’s a great example of this. Martin was off duty when the London Bridge call came in. He made his way there as soon as he heard the news. It’s so important that people like Martin are recognised for their work.

He said that he regarded the phrase as a negative term, a non-British term and said there were lessons to be learned from the controversy, in which Britons were wrongly expatriated to Caribbean nations.  Mr Javid, who replaced Amber Rudd after she resigned at the end of April, said he wanted to replace the hostile environment with a compliant environment that distinguishes between illegal and legal immigrants.  He told the BBC\u0027s Andrew Marr show: I\u0027m going to look at how it\u0027s been implemented. I want to review aspects of the policy. I\u0027ve already made some changes.  One of the changes is suspending the ban on illegal immigrants opening bank accounts, he said, saying the Home Office was not sure its data was accurate enough. He added: From Windrush, I think there will be lessons to learn about how that compliant environment policy is actually implemented. Is it working the way that it was intended? Mr Javid also said he would like to look again at the inclusion of foreign students in net immigration figures, saying it had a perception problem, but adding that it was not my most urgent priority. He also said he was taking a fresh look at the cap on tier 2 visas which allow non-EU foreign doctors to come to the UK.  Last week the The British Medical Journal said that between December 2017 and March 2018 more than 1,500 visa applications from doctors with job offers in the UK were refused as a result of the cap on workers from outside of the European Economic Area. Mr Javid told Marr: I see the problem with that and it is something that I\u0027m taking a fresh look at. I know a number of my colleagues certainly want me to take a look at this and that\u0027s exactly what I\u0027m doing.  Liberal Democrat Home Affairs spokesman Ed Davey said: The Home Secretary will have the support of almost everyone in Parliament to exclude students and medical staff from the immigration cap, but it\u0027s far from clear that the Prime Minister is willing to admit her long-cherished policy is wrong. I hope Parliament can get to vote on this as soon as possible. The \u0027Windrush generation\u0027 are British residents who arrived from Commonwealth countries before New Year\u0027s Day 1973. They are named after the Empire Windrush, the ship which brought some of the first Caribbean migrants to Britain in 1948. Anyone who arrived in the UK from a Commonwealth country before 1973 has a legal right to stay, unless they left the UK for more than two years. But they faced being threatened with deportation under new immigration rules despite living and working here for decades. People were ordered to prove they have the right to be in the UK to rent property, work or access services and benefits. The government failed to keep detailed records of Windrush arrivals, and landing cards were destroyed in 2010. The Home Office set up a task force with the aim of sorting out cases within two weeks. Windrush immigrants are also being granted fee-free citizenship and a compensation scheme, the rules of which have not been set yet.

The ‘doomsday’ scenario was produced by civil servants for Brexit Secretary David Davis, according to the Sunday Times.  They’re understood to have imagined three scenarios for what could happen if Britain crashes out of the EU without a deal - a mild one, a severe one - and one branded “armageddon.” Even the moderate case, they say, would see the port of Dover collapse on day one. The Times quote a source as saying: ”In the second scenario, not even the worst, the port of Dover will collapse on day one. The supermarkets in Cornwall and Scotland will run out of food within a couple of days, and hospitals will run out of medicines within two weeks.  The documents are thought to be so explosive they have only been shared with a handful of ministers, and have been “locked in a safe”. A spokesperson for the Department for Exiting the European Union confirmed the discussions had taken place, but denied the doomsday scenario would come to pass. They told the Times: “A significant amount of work and decision-making has gone into our no-deal plans, especially where it relates to ports, and we know that none of this would come to pass. In February, before the report was produced, David Davis used a speech in Vienna to reassure Britain it would not be plunged into a “Mad Max-style world borrowed from dystopian fiction” after we leave the EU. But the documents predict the severe scenario would see planes chartered to ferry supplies to the corners of the UK, and petrol running out by the end of the second week.  Brexiteer Tory Iain Dunan Smith accused the civil service of re-igniting project fear by setting out the dystopian nightmare. He said: “They should be planning for what happens if there is no deal, not scaring the pants off each other. We need people with imagination and courage, not frightened rabbits.” Best for Britain champion and Lib Dem MP Layla Moran demanded the government publish the papers.

And stats show his calamitous 2,099-day reign has seen soaring waiting times, cancelled ops, bed shortages and a 100,000 staff shortfall. Writing exclusively for the Sunday Mirror, Shadow Health Minister Justin Madders today asks: “How has this master of incompetence kept his job? “Perhaps Theresa May is so weak she cannot afford any more ex-ministers on the backbenches. We are used to Tory ministers taking no responsibility for their shortcomings.”  Mr Hunt was appointed on September 4 2012. Since then the number of people waiting more than four hours in A\u0026ampE is up 842 per cent. Then 9,022 people waited more than four hours – in March it was 76,054. An extra 1.4 million people are on NHS waiting lists compared to 2012. And the number of people waiting over two weeks for urgent cancer treatment has more than doubled from 53,738 in 2013 to 113,373 in 2018.  There are 7,000 fewer beds available in NHS hospitals now than in 2012 And bed occupancy at the end of last year was the highest recorded. Stats also show the waiting time measure for consultant-led treatment is at 22 weeks, and has been above the 18-week target since early 2016. Mr Madders said: “Nearly six years of Jeremy Hunt has taken the NHS to a place we haven’t seen since the last Tory Government nearly finished it.” Labour\u0027s view  By Justin Madders   Shadow Health Minister  Our NHS nears its 70th birthday in crisis – yet Jeremy Hunt today becomes its longest-serving Health Secretary ever. How has this master of incompetence kept his job for five years and 273 days of failure? Of successive unprecedented winter crises? Of an extra 1.4m people on the waiting lists? Of an 842 per cent rise in people waiting over four hours in A\u0026ampE? Or a staff shortfall of 100,000? Perhaps Theresa May is so weak she cannot afford any more ex-ministers on the backbenches.

Mr Javid, who is not a practising Muslim, but comes from a Muslim family, said he did not recognise claims of anti-Muslim sentiment in his party. It comes after former Tory Party chair Baroness Warsi said: “There is a simmering anti-Muslim underbelly of islamophobia within the party.” Speaking on the BBC’s Andrew Marr show, Mr Javid said: “I’ve got a lot of time for Baroness Warsi, but I’m afraid I do not agree with that. “For a start, let’s look at who the Home Secretary is in this country. As you described me, my name is Sajid Javid.

He said: “The Muslim Council of Britain does not represent Muslims in this country. You find me a group of Muslims who think they are represented by the MCB. “Secondly I would be very suspicious of anything they’ve got to say, not least because under the last Labour government, in a policy continued by us, we don’t deal with the MCB, and we don’t deal with them because too many of their members have had favourable comments on extremists and thats not acceptable.” "},{"url":null,"title":"meet pinkest woman world who","story":"NewsMeet the PINKEST woman in the world who has spent over £1 million on her home and wardrobeKitten Kay Sera, 54, is officially the pinkest person on the planet – she even dreams in pink…\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByKim Willis07:00, 3 JUN 2018Updated09:52, 3 JUN 2018NewsKitten Kay Sera has even spoken to Holly and Phillip about her obsession with the colour pink on \u0027This Morning\u0027 (Image: WENN)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailKitten Kay Sera awoke with a smile, reaching her arms across her pink bed as her pink hair fell over her pink pillow. Stretching lazily, Miss Kisses, Kitten’s pink dog, yawned. On Kitten’s pink bedside table, her pink phone sat beside her pink lamp. Sunshine was peeking through the pink curtains and as Kitten gazed across her pink room, she was in heaven.  Kitten’s pink pursuit began almost by accident 34 years ago. It was her 20th birthday and she was trying to work out what to wear to her party. She settled on a pink top, pink fluffy skirt, pink shoes and pink accessories.  I felt fabulous. I thought, if wearing that much pink could make me feel fantastic, why not wear pink every day? Going back to blue jeans and a white T-shirt seemed ludicrous to me. I didn’t want to wait until the next special occasion to feel pink-credible again. I wanted to feel and look pretty in pink every day. I sold my car so I had enough money to leave my hometown of Houston, Texas, and head for the bright pink lights of Hollywood, says Kitten.   I like to say I’m a flamingo in a world full of pigeons. When I walk down a busy street during the morning commute, everyone’s wearing grey and black. There’s no expression, no individuality. Yet people think I’m the crazy one! Over the years, Kitten estimates she has spent over one million pounds on pink paraphernalia and outfits.  That sounds like a lot, but if you break it down over the decades, it’s no more than anyone else is spending on cars, sofas and soft furnishings. The only difference is, for me every pound is spent on pink, she says.  From the moment you step over the threshold into her pink palace, everything is pink. Tickled pink From the front door to the TV to the loo roll, if it comes in pink you can bet your pink dollar I’ve got it. My hairbrush, my toothbrush, my kitchen utensils, you name it, it’s pink, enthuses Kitten.  My car is customised in pink, with pink chair covers and a pink gear stick. The number plate reads PINKEST, of course! Every item of clothing I own is a shade of pink. I have a pink whisk for when I bake pink cookies, a pink chair where I sit at my pink dressing table to apply my pink make-up. I have a pink throne and a pink crown bedazzled by pink jewels. I am the Queen of Pink, after all. I even use a safe, vet-approved, beetroot-based dye to colour my dog, Miss Kisses. I don’t have children but Miss Kisses is my baby, we go everywhere together. I have a recurring dream that I have a super power, where everything I touch turns pink, as if I’m magic, Kitten says.   It’s like the Midas touch but instead of everything turning gold like it does in the mythological story of the King of Phrygia, everything I touch turns a beautiful shade of my favourite colour. When I wake up, I can’t help smiling because I look around and think dreams do come true. Celebrities, including Paris Hilton and Carmen Electra, have flocked to Kitten’s home. But while most people find Kitten’s life entertaining, she is used to fending off criticism from those who think it’s all for show. Hollywood highlights  People think there must be days I’m feeling sad or just can’t be bothered to do the pink thing. They think sometimes I must just throw on a black tracksuit, but I say, \u0027Never!\u0027 It’s not for show, Kitten says.  Every day I wake up looking forward to the day. I couldn’t wake up in this pink world and feel anything but happy – it’s such a happy colour. It’s a privilege to run my hand over my rail of pink outfits and figure out what ensemble I’ll wear each day. I’m a fashionista and I make sure my outfit is well choreographed. Not every shade of pink complements every other shade of pink. My life is a carefully curated work of art.   Kitten has now made a name for herself as the Pink Lady of Hollywood. Every year, on America’s National Pink Day in June, Kitten is called upon as the world’s premier pink specialist.   When I pulled on that adorable pink outfit for my 20th birthday, I never could have imagined I could have a pink career but now, being pink is not only my passion, it’s put a pink roof over my head too, says Kitten. I earn money through my social media platforms. It still amazes me that a three-minute YouTube video can earn me money but that’s how the world works now. I’m an influencer – I didn’t even know that was a job but I’m just doing what I love and getting paid for it.  I also work as an actress and singer. My latest song, Queen Of Pink, has just been released. I’m a big fan of the Queen of England. She wears pink too. I would love the Queen of Pink to meet the Queen of England. We could swap fashion tips! Kitten’s Instagram page @kittenkaysera has over 70,000 followers and 52,000 people have subscribed to her YouTube channel. Videos chronicling Kitten’s pink life have been viewed millions of times – her fans are hooked on her every pink move.  Kitten even writes her emails in a pink font. She has several pink cases for her phone, pink sweets in jars on her pink kitchen surfaces, pink coats to go over pink tops. There are 30 pink sunglasses and lipstick in every shade of pink, to suit every pink mood she’s in.  There will always be haters. For some reason, people take offence when other people are too sure of themselves, too happy. I never let the trolls get to me. They’re just jealous that their life isn’t as colourful as mine, Kitten says.  I take their jibes with a pinch of pink salt. Seriously – even my salt is pink. It’s Himalayan rock salt, a beautiful, soft shade of pink. Kitten is single by choice but dates occasionally. Most men find her style fun but one gentleman came to Kitten’s house for dinner and didn’t comment on the extraordinary world he’d entered. After a while I had to ask him what he thought of all the pink and he looked at me blankly, before asking if I was wearing pink. He was colourblind! To him, my outfit and home seemed grey. He couldn’t appreciate it so I had to give him the pink slip, Kitten says. ‘I’m not looking for love and I wouldn’t want a man to wear pink for me but I can only ever imagine myself being with someone who sees the pink and loves me for it. A colourful life The evolution of Kitten’s taste has seen her go through soft pink and baby pink stages, but right now, she’s loving a neon vibe. The older I get, the hotter the shade of pink I am drawn to, Kitten says. I get sent pink gifts from fans all over the world and I can’t sell or give anything away. I rent a storage unit just to keep all my pink pieces. It used to be harder to find things in pink but these days there are 50 shades of pink for just about everything I could possibly need or want in life. I’m spoiled for choice.

The youngster, who got hooked after seeing adverts for betting websites at a football match, committed credit card fraud for a year. He blew \u0026pound60,000 in a week-long online betting binge which left his parents horrified. Today the lad – whose identity we are protecting – talks about his addiction as new Government figures reveal he is one of 25,000 children aged 11-16 who are hooked on gambling. The schoolboy started betting online after going with his \u0026shycompany director dad to Wembley, where he saw adverts for online bookies on screens and on boards around the pitch. He took pictures of his dad’s business credit cards on his smartphone and set up an \u0026shyaccount online under his parent’s identity. Within days he was hooked, getting a massive high from his wins – but placing bigger and bigger bets. He was staking as much as \u0026pound3,000 at a time and placing hundreds of bets a week. The boy, from Lancashire, said: “I had no idea that \u0026shygambling could be an addiction like smoking, drinking or drugs. It seemed like fun and I thought I would make money too. “It was just far too easy. I just had to put in dad’s name, \u0026shyaddress, date of birth and card details and checked a box saying I was 18 – it took literally seconds to register and start gambling.”  His spiralling losses were \u0026shydiscovered six months later when his father got a call from the bank questioning transactions and money missing from the account. By this time, the lad had \u0026shyalready accumulated losses in excess of \u0026pound20,000. Confronted by his parents, he instantly confessed. Following psychotherapy, his parents assumed their son had learned his lesson. But several months later he went on a week-long gambling binge \u0026shyusing the same card details, this time building up debts of a further \u0026pound60,000. Now the parents say they can \u0026shynever trust their son again as they are \u0026shycrippled by loans they were forced to take out to pay debts. Their son still only 15, said: “I am sorry for what I have done. I feel like I’ve ruined everything and our lives will never be the same again.” He spoke out with the agreement of his parents who want to warn other families about the dangers of online gambling – at any age. He said: “I remember being at Wembley seeing all those adverts, hearing guys around me bragging how much money they’d won and figured I’d give it a go. It seemed fun and easy. “I knew dad’s business was doing well and thought he’d be less likely to spot that than \u0026shymoney coming out of a personal account.” His father’s groundworks firm had a turnover of over \u0026pound30,000 a month and dozens of contractors so his betting went unnoticed at first.  He said: “I started off placing small \u0026pound5 or \u0026pound10 bets on football matches and horses, and had a few wins, which was a massive buzz. It felt like free money. I only regretted not placing bigger bets on my wins, ignoring my losses, and started going bigger and bigger. “I was placing \u0026pound100 bets, and then a few weeks later I was regularly betting \u0026pound1,000 a day. “By then I was down by several thousand pounds, and the only way I could think of \u0026shygetting it back was by more betting. “I was spending around six hours a day betting or researching bets. I missed football training, I skipped homework. Betting was the only thing I could think about.” When his father got the call from the bank and checked the statements, he and his wife knew straight away what was going on. The 43-year-old company \u0026shydirector said: “We were just so angry, not just at him, but also at ourselves for having been naive and trusting. “We had been so \u0026shypreoccupied with our own lives we hadn’t noticed his school grades going down.” The boy started weekly one-to-one sessions with psychotherapist Steve Pope along with weekly group sessions with other addicts. But five months later he had a relapse. He found his dad’s wallet with a credit card and went on a week-long \u0026pound60,000 gambling binge. He said: “It was like this monster in my head calling me to go back.”  A week later his dad had \u0026shyanother call from the bank saying the huge amount had gone. The father said: “I seriously thought our business and our house would be lost. “We had to make a couple of redundancies. We couldn’t even tell those employees the real reason why this had happened. We felt simply terrible.” The father says they will be paying back the loan for the foreseeable future. He said: “We are lucky that we didn’t lose everything. “Now other children might start stealing or securing loans to pay for their \u0026shygambling \u0026shyaddiction. “It’s as bad as \u0026shybeing a heroin addict – the lack of trust, the secrecy, the deceit, but without the obvious signs of drug addiction.” Politicians are calling for \u0026shybetting companies to face the same advertising regulations as tobacco firms in a bid to stem the epidemic of child gamblers. Earlier this week a cross-party group of MPs wrote an open letter to Culture Secretary Matthew Hancock insisting on a gambling ad ban during live sporting events and before the watershed. They claim that an increasing number of gambling adverts are now being aimed at children. The number of 16-year-olds hooked on gambling has risen by a third in the last three years, according to Government regulator the Gambling Commission. Telltale signs of a child addict How to spot signs your child is a problem gambler  Unexplained absences from school or classes Sudden drop in grades or failure to complete assignments on time Change of personality or behaviour Exaggerated display of money or other material possessions Unusual interest in newspapers/magazines/sports scores Borrowing or stealing money Withdrawing from family and friends Uncharacteristically forgetting appointments or dates  Therapist warns of epidemic The psychotherapist treating the schoolboy has warned that gambling is now causing more problems than street drugs among children. Steve Pope said: “These kids get hooked and once they feel the buzz they can’t stop. It’s a silent epidemic and we’re all walking blindly into this without a clue as to the real scale of the problem. “Gambling is just as damaging as cigarettes, or even more so because it’s openly advertised everywhere in such a fun, exciting way, but the long-term consequences are very, very real and disastrous.” Steve added: “I’ve been working in addiction recovery for over 30 years, and I’m staggered at how many gambling addicts under the age of 20 are coming through my doors.” "},{"url":null,"title":"disgraced solicitor who preyed sick","story":"NewsDisgraced solicitor who preyed on sick miners uses compensation cash to buy £2.8m mansion in WAG capital of UKAndrew Nulty snapped up a six-bedroom home with a pool, tennis court and sauna in an area favoured by multi-millionaire footballers and their wives\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByAlan Selby20:34, 2 JUN 2018Updated21:35, 2 JUN 2018NewsThe home in Wilmslow, Cheshire, which was purchased by Andrew Nulty\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA disgraced solicitor who preyed on sick miners has used compensation cash he skimmed off to buy a \u0026pound2.8million mansion in \u0026shyBritain’s WAG capital. Andrew Nulty snapped up a six-bedroom home with a pool, tennis court and sauna in an area favoured by multi-millionaire footballers and their wives. Stars who have lived in posh Wilmslow, Cheshire, include Wayne Rooney, David Beckham and Cristiano Ronaldo. Mr Nulty, 49, was branded a “disgrace to the profession” and struck off for breaking rules to amass his fortune from mine workers’ compo claims. Last night miners said the house was an insult after thousands he targeted died from horrific diseases they caught after inhaling pit dust.  Chris Kitchen, general secretary of the National Union of Mineworkers, said: “It’s wrong Mr Nulty is still living the high life off his ill-gotten gains, especially seeing as most of his claims were for people who are probably no longer with us. “We still deal with a lot of people suffering with pneumoconiosis. It’s not a nice disease.” Mr Nulty took home \u0026pound13million in a single year by exploiting the Coal Health Compensation Scheme. His firm raised \u0026pound40million by processing at least 32,000 claims from pitmen and their families after the scheme. He advertised his services as free, but as well as a flat rate from the Government he took 15 per cent of some payouts in fees. This was paid back in 2005.  He committed no criminal offence but the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal struck him off for breaching Law Society rules on a number of charges – including failing to give adequate information to clients and taking a 15 per cent cut of any damages some received. At the time a spokesman said: “He preyed on sick men who were not used to dealing with the legal profession and shafted them. “It was a total dereliction of a solicitor’s obligations to his clients.” "},{"url":null,"title":"everyone knows who done it","story":"News\u0027Everyone knows who done it\u0027: Holidaymaker claims whole neighbourhood knows who vandalised car with \u0027No Parking\u0027 paintBenny Finkelstein\u0027s car was daubed with paint after he parked it in a residential street and flew off on holiday\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByCharlotte CoxTim Wyatt20:59, 2 JUN 2018Updated22:53, 2 JUN 2018NewsTwo cars were vandalised with the words NO PARKING in paint when they were parked up on Lownorth Road in Wythenshawe.

The words \u0027No parkin\u0027 were slathered over Benny Finkelstein\u0027s red Hyundai in white paint last month. One of the car\u0027s tyres was also slashed. The 34-year-old had parked his car on a residential street in Wythenshawe around the corner from Manchester\u0027s airport before jetting off for an 18-day holiday in Israel. The Manchester resident said he was shocked to discover the damage on his return because he had used the area for free parking many times before.     The local police force tweeted an image of the cars and branded the incident completely unacceptable but Finkelstein said the police don\u0027t care about what had happened. I understand the frustration of citizens in this area but they can’t come and just do what they want to, he told the Manchester Evening News . “Does that mean I can go and start painting people’s houses in that area and have no penalty? “It feels like there are no rules in this neighbourhood. I’ve no doubt everyone who lives there knows who did this. But there is nothing being done by the police.”  He added: “All the cars have private driveways, nobody has the right to decide if I can park on the street or not It was parked legally, I’ve done it many times before.” Benny says he spoke to a resident who told him of their frustration over unofficial meet and greet firms using their streets to ‘dump’ cars. He added: “She knew who had done it, I think everyone in this neighbourhood does but they won’t tell.  “I’m pretty sure they are happy as it means they can get parking permits.” Benny says he paid \u0026pound100 for a car wash to remove the water-based paint but he’s yet to replace the tyre. The attack comes amid residents’ growing frustration over holidaymakers and airport staff parking their cars in communities around the hub.

Cops, their families and members of the public yesterday bombarded the firm\u0027s Facebook page with negative reviews in retaliation for an anti-police advertising campaign that accused officers of being paid to lie.   There was a huge backlash over the shocking posters that popped up in windows of Lush stores and appeared on the firm\u0027s website .  Lush argued it was simply shining a light on intrusive, abusive, political policing amid an ongoing public inquiry into undercover officers\u0027 secretive activities. But critics said the posters were a disgrace and an insult to hard-working, front-line officers. Police and their relatives got revenge by posting negative, one-star reviews on Lush\u0027s Facebook page, leaving the profile awash with scathing remarks. But some later claimed their reviews were deleted or their Facebook accounts suspended within hours of writing comments about Lush.  Lush however denies removing, blocking or deleting one-star reviews. One customer said: Last night I left a one-star review as a result of their recent campaign. I used to be a loyal customer, spent far too much of my hard-earned money in their stores. This morning, my Facebook account had been locked out following a report of suspicious activity. I had to change my password, verify comments I had made, and go through a lot of drama to get back into my account. My review of Lush UK has mysteriously disappeared.  Another asked: Are Lush just going to delete every one star review and negative feedback comment on Facebook, then block the person who leaves it, such as myself, my friends and police colleagues have been? One said: Dear Lush, why are you deleting and blocking anyone who has left you a 1 star review? Another accused Lush of falsely report(ing) peoples profiles as hacked so that you can delete their reviews and boost your ratings is disgraceful and totally unethical. A Lush spokesman said in response to criticism on Facebook: I can confirm that we are not removing or blocking any comments or deleting posts. This is not an anti-state/anti-police campaign. We are aware that the police forces of the UK are doing an increasingly difficult and dangerous job whilst having their funding slashed. We fully support them in having proper police numbers, correctly funded to fight crime, violence and to be there to serve the public at our times of need.  This campaign is not about the real police work done by those front line officers who support the public every day - it is about a controversial branch of political undercover policing that ran for many years before being exposed.  Our campaign is to highlight this small and secretive subset of undercover policing that undermines and threatens the very idea of democracy. There is an age old understanding that our government and public institutions are there to protect and preserve the rights and safety of the public.  In the case of these secretive undercover units, their work went well beyond the boundaries of acceptable police tactics and is now the subject of an ongoing public inquiry, which was instigated by Theresa May during her time as Home Secretary when the scale and scope of the breaches of protocols started to become clear.  This public inquiry needs help from the public to keep it on track and ensure that this one opportunity for full honesty and disclosure is not lost or squandered. All citizens should be concerned when human rights are abandoned by those in power. The police themselves have admitted in their public apology to seven of the females deceived into long-term relationships with police spies, that these actions were a violation of the women’s human rights, an abuse of police power and caused significant trauma”. In a recent court case the police admitted the actions amounted to inhumane and degrading treatment breaching Article 3 of the European Declaration of Human Rights. Those victims are now asking that the public inquiry demands that the undercover units release a full list of the undercover names used by their operatives, release a list of which campaign groups were targeted, and also that they release the information and data entries they hold on individuals whose lives and homes were infiltrated during these operations. Without this full disclosure there is no way of knowing the full extent of what happened during the dark years of this renegade secret policing operation - and that full disclosure might not happen unless the public demand it.

James Oliver says he was on a mission in the 21st century from the year 6491, but is unable to get home to his family and friends.  It sounds like something straight out of the plot of one of the Back to the Future films - but now there is evidence he may be telling the truth. Paranormal YouTube site ApexTV hooked him up to a lie detector test and claims he passed every question. His face is blurred out and his accent is a thick Birmingham one, which can sometimes sound American or Australian, and he has a slight lisp.  Your years are different to mine, he tells the presenter, whose face has also been blurred out. There is some obscurity as to whether he lives on planet earth or another planet, as he adds: Where I\u0027m from, the years are longer. My planet is further away from the sun than yours is, so it takes longer to get around. But we have gifted mathematicians who work to calculate our years from those from other civilisations. But he does, however, appear to be human. When he has finished speaking, the word TRUE appears on the screen over the video, but the camera never pans to the laptop to prove he is not lying. He says global warming is going to get worse and our planet is going to get hotter, and advises us to put a cap on carbon emissions. He goes on to say that everyone in the future has their own Artificial Intelligence system called Siri, which recognise users by their voice. He adds: We are constantly finding new planets and galaxies every day. Most of it is just nothing. Sometimes you hit the jackpot and find intelligent life on it. You find new planets, new eco systems. There are a lot of planets more intelligent than humans.  Planets are controlled by an umbrella of elected officials, similar to the United Nations, but all still have some independent control. When asked if there has been fights between humans and aliens, he says: Errr, I can\u0027t....yes, seemingly stuttering. But he then finds his confidence, adding: There have been some conflicts, but most of it has been put under control by the federation very quickly. The federation is there as a peace keeping vessel.  He claims to work for an alien research agency, specialising in the history and culture of the human race. When asked if he has ever met an alien, he replies: Personally? Several times. The definition of alien is something out of this world, so technically, I am meeting one right now. I have, on occasion. But the only time I meet them is when I am at home. It\u0027s the same sort of thing. They travel to where I live and I do know them.

The puppy was alive but sick when Robert Crossland allegedly threw it into the predator\u0027s tank at Preston Junior High School in Preston, Idaho. Horrified parents came forward to complain after the incident happened in March and he was arrested on Friday.  He faces animal cruelty charges and if found guilty, could be sentenced to six months behind bars and a $5,000 fine.  Snapping turtles have razor sharp teeth and powerful jaws, and are omnivores in the wild so they eat both plants and animals.  The turtle was later put down by the authorities because Crossland, who filled his classroom with a variety of animals, did not have the proper permit for it. An online petition calling for him to be fired was signed by 189,097 people, where his actions were branded sick and disturbing. But thousands of others have stood by a We Support Crossland petition, which had 3,700 signatures as of Friday afternoon. River McKay, who launched it, said: It\u0027s time to stand up for one of the best science teachers in the Preston Idaho District.

A dash-cam video shows how the light aircraft suddenly loomed over cars going to and fro, before screeching to a halt in the centre of the street. The Cessna 172 had just taken off from the John Wayne airport in southern California when it made the emergency landing in Huntington Beach, just outside Los Angeles. The owner of the dash-cam had just turned left at some traffic lights when the plane appeared out of nowhere overheard.  The aircraft plunges towards the centre of the road, swinging scarily from side to side as other vehicles swerved to avoid a crash. Somehow the pilot managed to bring the Cessna to a halt just before another set of traffic lights at the end of the road. Amazingly, no-one was injured in the landing and no damage was caused. The car driver can be heard exclaiming on the dash-cam footage I almost just got hit by a plane...what the hell, this guy almost ran into me!  Bill Castelblanco was at work on the same road when the extraordinary events unfolded. We heard everybody screaming at the same time, so we ran out right when everybody else did, he told the Orange County Register. While he did not see the plane touch down, it was still careering down the street. Obviously, they were screaming because there was a plane landing in the middle of the street, said Castelblanco, a pilot himself.

In the footage parents film the disturbing end-of-term production on their phones. The children, none older than five, wear camouflage army uniforms, cover their faces in balaclavas and carry imitation assault rifles. In the video they can be seen storming a cardboard house with mock explosives, \u0027shooting\u0027 dead an Israeli soldier - played by another pre-schooler - and then carrying out a \u0027hostage\u0027 dressed as an Orthodox Jew over their shoulders. The boys \u0027attack\u0027 is tightly-choreographed, suggesting they have spent several hours practising their parts in the macabre play.  Throughout the video tense music is played and there is a fusillade of mock gunfire and even smoke bombs set off. The performance ends with the youngsters placing a sign which reads, in Arabic and Hebrew, Israel has fallen on the back of the supposedly dead Israeli soldier. A speech by the dead former leader of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, Yasser Arafat, is then played while other kids point pistols at the crowd.  The disturbing scenes came at the graduation ceremony of the Al-Hoda nursery in Gaza, according to the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI) which popularised the video, also available on YouTube. MEMRI - which publishes English translations of videos, speeches and other material from the Middle East - describes itself as bridging the language gap between the Middle East and the West but was founded by a former Israeli military intelligence officer and has been accused of selectively translating only the output of extremists to pursue a pro-Israel conservative agenda. The scary show put on the nursery is not the first time it has produced a \u0027young jihadi\u0027 performance. In 2016 children at the nursery pretended to plant anti-tank mines, kidnap and kill Israeli soldiers, and launch mortars.

That was a major factor in coming here,” is how the left-back put it.And he was convinced that will be the case after a chat with United assistant boss Laurie Ellis.The pair know each other, having been team-mates at Raith Rovers during the 2013-14 campaign.“I knew Laurie pretty well from my time at Raith. We got speaking about the prospect (of joining United). Since then it has gone pretty quickly.“Coming to a club like Dundee United is really a pretty simple choice.”Ironically, with new Morton boss Ray McKinnon considering a move for his old work-mate Ellis, it could be the pair don’t end up working together again next season.If United can persuade their highly regarded coach to stay, McKinnon could team up with another of his former Tannadice backroom staff, Darren Taylor.Returning to Booth, after a year spent vainly scrapping to avoid the drop, the ex-Hibs, Arbroath and Brechin man is looking forward to a challenge at the right end of a table.“Last season was tough and we just couldn’t get away from that drop zone,” he added.“This will be a different type of pressure, being expected to win most weeks and one which I will relish.”Booth will battle for the left-back slot with youngster Jamie Robson, who himself last week signed up for another two years at Tannadice.Manager Csaba Laszlo is pleased to have that kind of competition in the squad and to get a man of Booth’s quality and experience.“I’m delighted to bring Callum to Dundee United,” he said.“He is an experienced left-back who has played in the Premiership.

I’m a great believer that if you’re good enough, you’re old enough.“I broke into the side at 17, 18. Back then it was almost sink or swim.“You have to have the right mentality and drive about you to survive in the first-team environment because I demand a lot from the boys.“The ones we accelerated into the first team first of all need to be thrown in to understand what it’s like to train at that level and what is expected to hit that first-team pitch.“I’ll find out very quickly if they can cope. Clearly there is a physical aspect and I need to know that should I need it or think he is ready ability-wise, is he physically ready?“There are boys there coming through our Development team and all have been told that in the upcoming season, you have to come in here in pre-season and tell me I am pushing.“There is no barrier. It’s not like ‘you’re only 16 or 17 and you’ve not really cracked it yet’, there’s nothing like that.“Come in for the four weeks of pre-season and blow the webs off it.”There might be no barrier but the level required from these young players and what the manager expects from every player, no matter the age, is extremely high.And it won’t take long for the youngsters to find that out.A prime example is 19-year-old Scott, a prolific goalscorer in the Development League, who featured for the Dark Blues in the final three matches of the last campaign.He came on against Partick Thistle in the last game of the season, replacing Craig Wighton after an hour, but failed to impress his manager.Neil said: “I’ll not tell you what I told Cedwyn after the Partick game but it was pretty stark.“If he is coming into my first team I expect him to score goals, create chances, to run after centre-backs, close down full-backs – he doesn’t get let off because he’s 18 years old.“He’s coming in during the summer and he’s got a short space of time to get in my face and say ‘I’m better than what you’re going to bring in. If you’ve not got anybody in yet, gaffer, I’m your man’.“All the boys that have made an impact in the first team have a real chance but they need to come back and be better than what I’ve got.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b111dfa0d8de.jpg ","title":"playpark becomes first in dundee to go smoke free","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA playpark in Stobswell has become the designated first smoke-free play area in the city.New signs designed by Glebelands Primary School pupil Weronika Soltys have been unveiled at the playground in Baxter Park.The signs will now be placed across parks throughout the city, restricting smokers from lighting up in play areas.Anne Rendall, neighbourhood services depute convener, said: “By introducing smoke-free playparks in Dundee, we are able to create children’s play areas that are cleaner as there is less chance of cigarette ends being discarded.“I believe these voluntary smoke-free zones will help improve people’s health across the city.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b10f80c669bf-e1527838783208.jpg ","title":"ralph signs but striker desired","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee have added left-back Nathan Ralph as their fourth signing of the summer – but a striker is still top of boss Neil McCann’s wishlist.The 25-year-old moves to the Scottish Premiership from the English National League after suffering relegation with Woking last season.And the Tele revealed way back in January that a move for the former Yeovil Town man was likely in the summer.Gaffer Neil, however, is still working on bringing a goalscorer to the club.He’s made no secret of the fact his team were short in the scoring department last season and adding somebody to put the ball in the net would help him achieve the top-six finish he craves for his side.The club have already made a move for Macauley Bonne.The Leyton Orient striker knocked in an impressive 22 goals in the National League last season and has drawn plenty of interest from English league clubs.The Dark Blues tried to get in there early.

Thailand is fantastic and the people are extremely friendly – you can get out there for 10 nights, staying in a three-star hotel, for £699.“You would often be more expensive holidaying in Europe.”Colin said the company had also seen a rise in people going on multiple “city break” holidays throughout the year.He said: “Popular destinations are Krakow, Prague and Budapest.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b11207a8cb4c-e1527854551371.jpg ","title":"today the mcmenace beano exhibition opens in dundee","story":"\t\t\t\t\tIt was born almost 80 years ago and has been delighting generations of children – and their parents – ever since.And to celebrate an icon of the comic genre becoming an octogenarian, Beano Studios and The McManus: Dundee’s Art Gallery and Museum have joined forces to create a bespoke exhibition dedicated to its best loved characters.To mark the Beano’s amazing milestone, the gallery will change its name to “The McMenace” for the duration of the exhibition, which launches today.A fun look at the Beano at 80, it will focus on The Bash Street Kids, whose creation was inspired by pupils at Dundee High School and their playground, just a stone’s throw from publisher DC Thomson’s HQ at Meadowside.The showcase will explore the birth of the Beano in July 1938, and show how it has developed over the past eight decades.   It will also look at the introduction of some of its funniest and most famous characters – Dennis and Gnasher, Rodger the Dodger, Minnie the Minx and, of course, The Bash Street Kids.Mike Stirling, head of Beano Studios, said: “The exhibition is amazingly detailed.“It means that real hardcore fans of the Beano and Bash Street Kids are likely to come more than once.“To me, it’s like reading the Beano – you read it the first time then go back and see a wee joke here or there that you maybe missed.“Those wee nuggets will be picked up the more detailed your visit to The McManus is.“The exhibition includes things from the archive that haven’t been seen for years, from the very first issues of the comic right up to the CGI from the Dennis and Gnasher Unleashed series from CBBC – so it’s really unique.”The Bash Street Kids, Beanotown’s most rowdy pupils, have featured in the publication since the 1950s.Mike said: “The Bash Street Kids strip started out life as ‘When the Bell Rings’ in 1954, and that was because the editor at the time encouraged staff to look out the window when the bell was rung at the High School of Dundee for inspiration for the zany antics of the children in the playground.“What the kids were doing ended up in the strip quite regularly and helped the design of the characters.“In 1956 they became the Bash Street Kids and began to focus on the group of kids in Class 2B that we still see today.“Since 1961, David Sutherland has drawn the strip. He ‘retired’ in 1998 but continues to draw it. He’s one of the few artists who still hand in a hard copy of their work – a true legend.“You can imagine how much of his work is included in the exhibition. We will be showing a special movie in which he stars, showing the strip being put together.“I think The McManus is the only place in the world suitable for this because the cartoons are really Dundonian in nature.“Many a time there has been someone walking up Reform Street who has been the inspiration for a character or scene in the Beano, so The McManus really is the only place to showcase this.“For 80 years the Beano has been regularly enjoyed by 27 million people in the UK, so there will be things that appeal to grand-parents and grandchildren, their own memories of the comic over the years as it has evolved.”Meanwhile, illustrator Nigel Parkinson has created an original comic strip starring The Bash Street Kids designing the new sign for The McMenace.The illustration shows them tangled in the “Waldella, Dundee” by artist David Batchelor, which is one of museum’s most popular exhibits.The exhibition runs until Sunday October 21 and entry is free of charge.For further information, visit beano.\t\t\t"},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7486028.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7590066.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"11 things you d only hear in Glasgow","story":"                          There are some things you will only ever hear in Glasgow or Glesga, as us locals call it,\u0026nbspand this is our definitive list of the best."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7608211.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Times Past gallery of the week  Glasgow theatres","story":"                          Evocative Images from the Archives of the Herald and Evening Times."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7151092.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Radical council plan to give residents control over budget spending","story":"                          Communities in Glasgow will get control of \u0026pound1m of council cash in a pilot scheme to give people more control over decisions."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7866672.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Can you help  Scotland  39 s top dance school needs a new home","story":"                          SCOTLAND\u0027S dance school is desperately seeking a new home with the closure of the Citizen\u0027s Theatre."},{"url":null,"title":"Cruel conmen convince Dennistoun woman  90  to hand over   600 for DIY work -

The intention is to change it to clear glass and make it more attractive entrance.\"The next phase would be to\u0026nbsp refurbish the shop fronts in Market Arcade and make them more in keeping with the building.It is hoped both phases will be able to secure funding from the Academy Street Townscape Heritage Project to regenerate that area of the city centre.With that funding due to finish in 2020, the proposed improvements are at the top of the list of priorities on the market action plan.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe third phase focuses on the market hall itself.\"This is the area potentially most subject to change,\" Mrs Murray said.\"We are going to look at having a feasibility study done to see what is physically possible and how much can be developed to create a better and more usable space, better units and a better environment.\"One idea, for example, is to look at whether a mezzanine floor would be possible.\"We also want to try and create a more open area which we could use as a venue, Mrs Murray said.She is particularly keen to see more cafes and restaurants and food units while zoned areas such as a restaurant quarter or a jewellery hub are another possibility.Rents could also be set according to whether units are assessed to be in a strong or weak location.Of the 36 units, 32 are currently occupied and there has\u0026nbsp also been interest from other prospective tenants.\"The Victorian Market is quite unique in Inverness and we need to exploit that,\" Mrs Murray said.\"We are trading healthily but we want to maximise our potential. With the future of the British High Street in decline at the moment, we need to look at as many options to make it viable for all business and attract new brands into the city centre.\"Sunday 3 Jun 2018 3:41 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04105000/04105690.jpg","title":"East of Inverness plans include bid for 3000 new homes","story":"\u0026nbspA VISION for 3000 new homes, three schools and a 30-acre district park for Inverness will be formally unveiled later this week \u0026ndash amid fierce opposition.While public feedback has included optimism about improved transport potential, fears have been raised that a fresh focus on the swathe of farmland between Barn Church Road and the Inverness College UHI could \"undermine investment confidence\" in the nearby Stratton new town project which is already under way.The Inverness East development brief prepared by Highland Council planners will be considered for adoption by city councillors on Thursday.The blueprint \u0026ndash which does not estimate the overall cost \u0026ndash aims to ensure expansion is \"co-ordinated, offering a clear vision and the right facilities to support new communities\".A draft version was approved for consultation last November. Public consultation followed with 328 nearby addresses contacted, prompting 104 formal responses.The report to the committee stressed that the brief \"does not seek to create competition between the two locations\".Stratton, it stated, \"has opportunity for larger footprint retail and community buildings whereas Ashton provides opportunity for education, park and higher density residential development\".The focus of development would be \"east Ashton\". The owners of the adjacent western part of Ashton Farm do not intend selling for development but to continue farming the land.Opportunities have been identified for improving public transport links, particularly for Inverness Campus users. Transport agency HiTrans will consider the provision of a new rail station at Seafield, the campus or Stratton.Discussions are underway with the college and Highlands and Islands Enterprise on the \"early delivery\" of sports facilities at the campus. A least one pitch plus associated buildings could cost \u0026pound4.7 million.The expansion also promises to include an upgrade to the busy Inshes roundabout layout.Planning officials are discussing road widening proposals with landowners. Council representatives will attend community council meetings in the coming months to assess local requirements.A 500-space park-and-ride facility was consented as part of the Stratton scheme.The report references a landowner who argued that the brief contradicts an existing development plan and \"fails to recognise Stratton and only refers to potential future development at Ashton Farm\".They also complained that the \"vision map does not reflect the original permission\u0027 town centre at Stratton or the development plan support for it\".Another considers \"Ashton centre\" to be \"an unreasonable competitor location to Stratton\" that \"undermines\" Stratton.It is unclear from the report what long-term employment would be created in the area \u0026ndash an issue raised historically by numerous city councillors who questioned council officials\u0026rsquo aspirations for growth.The report stated: \"Analysis identified that the optimum location for a new centre is at east Ashton.\"This location is, therefore, identified as the core area for new and existing communities to visit as a destination that has footfall generating uses including a new district park, high school and mixed-use centre that includes high-density residential uses.\"It emphasised that the Stratton site does not include provision for a district park or high school with community facilities like those at Inverness Royal Academy.The brief \"does not seek to create competition between Stratton and Ashton\", according to the development planning team.Public feedback has already established an aversion to more development in the area with calls for the focus to instead be on the city centre and brownfield sites, and concern that the recent demand for new homes could stall, leaving a surplus of residential properties.Other responses included a plea that \"pubs should not be allowed\".Smithton and Culloden Community Council chairman David McGrath welcomed the document, with a caveat that it improves access to the nearby Inverness Shopping Park with a short cut for existing residents.A spokesman for the Stratton developer Hazledene said: \"We don\u0026rsquot think it\u0027 appropriate that a competitor town centre should be introduced, as this would add uncertainty and confusion.\"These [Ashton] proposals are early stage proposals and we believe should not be given the same weight as the Stratton permissions already granted.

Russell clipped in the cross from the right and McBurnie\u0026#8217s powerful header from 10 yards bounced back off the right post.However, four minutes later the Scots were lucky not to be further behind. A counter-attack from a Scottish corner ended with Vela being free in the area.But rather than shoot Vela cut the ball back for Layun, but his effort from close range was blocked by a combination of Bain and Shinnie.On 65 minutes Scotland had another let off when Dylan McGeouch\u0026#8217s poor pass allowed Lozano in and after skipping away from Mulgrew he rattled the crossbar from 10 yards and then sub Marco Fabian blazed the follow up over.With 18 minutes left the ball was in the visitors\u0026#8217 net when sub Oribe Peralta knocked in the rebound after Lozano\u0026#8217s header was saved by Bain, but Peralta was flagged offside.Scotland tried their best to force an equaliser but another clear-cut chance wasn\u0026#8217t forthcoming and Mexico were threatening on the break.In the 90th minute sub Jesus Corona got clear and lobbed the ball beyond the advancing Bain but Mulgrew headed off the line.Mexico: Guillermo Ochoa, Jesus Gallardo, Carlos Salcedo (Rafael Marquez 46), Hugo Ayala, Miguel Layun, Edson Alvarez, Hector Herrera (Marco Fabian 57), Giovani dos Santos (Jonathon dos Santos 57), Hirving Lozano (Jesus Corona 73), Carlos Vela (Javier Aquino 63), Raul Jiminez (Oribe Peralta 57).Subs not used: Alfredo Talavera, Javier Hernandez, Erick Gutierrez, Jesus Molina.Scotland: Jon McLaughlin (Scott Bain 46), Stephen O\u0026#8217Donnell, Jack Hendry, Scott McKenna, Graeme Shinnie Johnny Russell, Dylan McGeouch, Kenny McLean (Chris Cadden 55), Callum Paterson (Charlie Mulgrew 55), Ryan Christie (John McGinn 55), Oliver McBurnie (Lewis Morgan 80).Subs not used: Jordan Archer, Jamie Murphy.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/06/IMG_2084-e1527853798398-780x564.jpg ","title":"beer of the week stone ipa","story":"\t\t\t\t\tStone Brewing, headquartered in California but brewing in Berlin, pops up regularly when chatting to bar staff about good beers.When I spotted their IPA on the shelf at Tesco (I had popped in for milk, honest) I thought I\u0026#8217d give this West Coast IPA a go.It fills the glass with a lovely antique gold, crystal-clear beer, topped with a pleasing white head.The nose is subtle, citrus lemon and a hint of Weetabix about it.It has great body and mouth feel with a juicy attack and those citrus notes are nicely sharp, then it\u0026#8217s washed away almost immediately with a huge hoppiness.

At times when the builders are working the gulls understandably leave the site but then return during the evenings and at weekends. Several birds were again sitting on apparent nests as recently as May 4, however it looks like many others may have moved elsewhere.Measures have since been taken by the builders to encourage the birds to leave the area prior to laying their eggs and to give them a chance of nesting elsewhere soon. Recently I had a meeting with SNH (Scottish Natural Heritage) and the RSPB and both were sympathetic and understanding of the situation.I also plan to meet with the Scottish Canals environmental scientist soon in the hope that perhaps provision can be made, within the scope of the hub project, to allow for a nesting area for the Common Gulls in future years at the site.This could give rise to an exciting opportunity enabling the public and visitors to the new heritage centre to view these gulls raise their chicks, for which is effectively the rarest colony of nesting birds in the Crinan Canal corridor.Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,This week Allt Dearg Wind Farm distributed over £135,000 to the Ardrishaig Community Trust, which holds the village\u0026#8217s share in this locally owned wind farm.Combined with the recent payments to the Tighnabruaich and Tarbert Trusts which hold similar shares in the neighbouring Sròndoire Wind Farm, together with the wind farms\u0026#8217 contributions to the local educational trust, this brings the total direct community benefit payments from these projects to well over £ 1 million.This is a significant milestone for the projects, and highlights the socio-economic advantages of local ownership in wind power. Despite its relatively small capacity Allt Dearg is the single largest contributor of community benefit payments in Argyll.This week the UK Government published the results of its latest tracking survey of public attitudes to energy and climate change. This shows continued growth in support for on-shore wind, and eight in ten agreed that renewable energy developments should provide direct benefits to the communities in which they are located.Some objections to wind farms remain, and our turbines remain visible in the distance. We hope that the views of Allt Dearg and Sròndoire might remind such objectors that we are economically dependent on what we can produce from the limited options available to us in remote rural areas. That our particular wind farms are able to make a significant contribution to local employment and deliver funding direct to our neighbouring communities, whilst supplying around 20 per cent of Argyll and Bute’s annual domestic electricity requirements from a clean renewable resource, is very satisfying.We would like to thank all those who have made these projects the successes they are, and in particular thank those local community councillors and trust members who have given so much of their time in recent years to make this all happen. For our part, we will continue our efforts to grow the industry and economic activity that provides secure employment and opportunity for our local community.We look forward to our community partners being able to invest the fruits of these wind farms into exciting local projects.Mary Broadfoot of Stronachullin and James F Lithgow of OrmsarySir,Loneliness is a major issue in society and affects everyone from all walks of life, regardless of age or ability.That’s why we’re pleased the Scottish Government is looking at the development of a new approach to tackling the issues of loneliness and social isolation – something we have first-hand experience of and how it affects many of the people we support in Scotland.Following a recent survey of over 150 service users of our homecare services in Stirling, Falkirk, Perth and Kinross, and Angus which focused solely on loneliness and social isolation, it was revealed that loneliest people receive far fewer visitors each week. While this is hardly surprising, we did find that those who either lived with family or had family close by were less at risk of loneliness and the negative health impacts associated. Our research also highlighted that respondents, in most cases, simply wanted a chat over a cuppa with someone their own age.Social interactions are something the vast majority of us take for granted as we all lead such busy lives, but for someone who is alone, watching time go by very slowly, it’s incredibly painful for them to sit at home day after day with no communication from the outside world.Charities such as Sue Ryder regularly arrange social events for our service users and their families.But if, as a nation, we’re serious about tackling loneliness as a public health issue then we need to be resourcing our local authorities to put in place services or to commission them from the third sector to ensure that no one feels alone and isolated in Scotland.Pamela Mackenzie, director of neurological services and Scotland, Sue Ryder, StirlingSir,This spring we hope your readers will celebrate the royal wedding with their very own Right Royal Tea Party in aid of Meningitis Now.Putting on a spread fit for a royal wedding is a piece of cake with our free fundraising pack and, as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have requested charity donations rather than wedding presents, you can fulfil their wishes whilst helping families affected by this devastating disease.A royal-themed Time4Tea can be held anytime, not just on Saturday May 19, the date of the Royal Wedding. And it can take place anywhere – at home, at work, at school.Just pop the kettle on, slice up a cake or two, homemade or bought (you have to have cake at a wedding) and invite friends, relatives and colleagues to enjoy a cuppa or perhaps even a glass of champagne.The serious point is that you’ll be helping to fight meningitis and move us one step closer to our vision of a future where no one in the UK dies from meningitis \u0026#8211 and everyone affected gets the support they need to rebuild their life.Sadly, despite developments in vaccines, meningitis and septicaemia continue to affect thousands every year and kill more under-fives than any other infectious disease.

But we slowly evolved within it.\u0026#8216It was open to the slates and the wind used to go straight up the length of the oyster bar. We had a hessian sack to keep down the draught, and it used to stand out at about 45 degrees a lot of the time. It was very primitive for many years, because we were skint.\u0026#8216People sat in their overcoats, but they liked the style. All of a sudden they could get local shellfish, and it just developed from there.\u0026#8217He continued: \u0026#8216Since my time the whole place has had a re-make and it is really, really nice.\u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s been driven by the volume of people wanting to dine here. I mean, you couldn\u0026#8217t keep up that slightly rustic look. It\u0026#8217s a cracking place now. Just superb.\u0026#8217Johnny Noble sadly died in 2002, aged just 66.\u0026#8216He was an inspiring, lovely man, said Mr Lane. \u0026#8216No matter what disaster befell us no matter what cock-up happened, he was ever-optimistic and just kept us going.\u0026#8216We would have our business meetings in the billiard room at [Johnny\u0026#8217s home] Ardkinglas House, and there would be a bottle of something. That just keeps the morale going.\u0026#8216He was a great man, and wonderful entertainment.\u0026#8217The stories of Johnny Noble are legion, and most are true.Andy Lane recalled: \u0026#8216In the days of the Oyster Bar in our old draughty building, everyone had to muck in. Johnny would go round being the wine waiter for a while. Until, that is, someone would choose an inappropriate wine. At that point he\u0026#8217d start a sort of genial argument with them. In the end he\u0026#8217d sit down with them and you\u0026#8217d never see him again for the rest of the evening.\u0026#8216I don\u0026#8217t think we realised just how important he was for the business until he was gone.\u0026#8217Now living a quieter life in Cornwall with his Dexters, Mr Lane concluded: \u0026#8216My wife and I changed tack in life, really, and it keeps us busy. And we\u0026#8217ve got our two boys, so we\u0026#8217re quite occupied.\u0026#8217\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"inveraray progress in camanachd cup","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 19/05/18, 7:41 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Inveraray 2 Glasgow Mid Argyll 0Two early goals gave Inveraray a win over Glasgow Mid Argyll on a heavy Winterton pitch.Craig Taylor put Inveraray ahead on four minutes, with the ball taking a wicked bounce in front of the keeper.Lewis MacNicol doubled his side\u0026#8217s advantage on 15 minutes with a strike from the left which went across the keeper into the far corner of the net.Mid Argyll were struggling at the back but settled into the game and had a chance close to half-time to cut Inveraray’s lead when they were awarded a penalty.

Therefore, we support separating pedestrians, cyclists and motorists through an expansion of the network of walking and cycling paths across Scotland.We would like to stress, however, that measures like these will not single-handedly lead to safer roads. The road mentality in Scotland still favours the motorist over more vulnerable road users, which presents a huge barrier to more people taking up active lifestyles.More needs to be done to change our road culture for people in Scotland to feel safer regardless of their means of transportation, ultimately empowering them to lead healthier and more active lifestyles.Perhaps it is time we started to beat the ‘presumed liability’ drum once again?Brenda Mitchell, Road Traffic Accident Law (Scotland) LLP, Edinburgh.Sir,Some people have difficulty getting up and down the steps on the Glasgow bus. We asked West Coast Motors about this and they gave us the answer we wanted.All Citylink buses are fitted with an access ramp, worked by the driver. A platform comes out on to the pavement, with a holding bar, and is then raised up to floor level. This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform. Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp. The telephone number is 08712 663333.Kirsty McCuaig and Patricia Crawford, Mid Argyll Buddies.Sir,The ongoing effects of weather, bureaucracy and concern for the future continue to put our countryside under pressure, with few avenues to turn to for support.This can have dramatic consequences for the rural economy and the people who live and work there.The Prince’s Countryside Fund is committed to supporting community-led projects that will re-invigorate and sustain farming networks and the countryside by providing services and amenities through its grant programme.Open for applications until June 14, grants are available for up to £50,000. If you are involved in a community-run or farming support project and think your organisation may benefit – or if you know someone who might –  visit  www.princescountrysidefund. org.uk/grants.The fund has supported a diverse range of projects, including a community transport app in Argyll and projects on Barra, Orkney and Shetland. We are proud to have distributed more than £9 million since 2010 to more than 250 projects led by these grassroots organisations.It is crucial we help rural areas during these times of change to retain a thriving countryside and encourage a sustainable farming sector in the UK and would encourage people to apply for our funding.Claire Saunders, director, The Prince’s Countryside Fund.Sir,At first sight, it seems odd that the controversy over the reported disturbance to common gulls, oystercatchers and black guillemots at the old oil depot in Ardrishaig is focused on a breeding colony of common gulls.I’m no bird expert and hadn’t realised common gulls are less common than the bigger varieties or that they’re a declining species.But among the reasons given for this are predation by mink and the loss of open rubbish dumps and both might be contributing factors in Mid Argyll.It’s surely hardly surprising that the only breeding colony along the canal is at the Ardrishaig end, where the urbanisation around the tidal flats of Loch Gilp and the Lingerton dump offer prime scavenging opportunities.I don’t know whether they lose out to the bigger gull species when it comes to local island nesting sites, or whether the old Gleaner site might offer other advantages, for example, maybe less vulnerable to mink predation – but could it be the gulls are there primarily because of man-made feeding opportunities and that they’ll find an alternative site that’s similarly convenient?Likewise, the smaller populations of oystercatchers and black guillemots, however, although they’re also both amber listed they don’t scavenge and seem to be more dependent on the sea and shore for their livelihoods.Their decline might be of more concern but they’re hopefully less swayed towards easy pickings around Loch Gilp and more evenly distributed to Loch Crinan.Perhaps Jim Dickson and Andrew Tongue can enlighten us further on just how endangered the populations of these three species are in Mid Argyll.Robert Wakeham, Lochgilphead.Sir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29.We are both keen to know this young person is alright as she appeared to be frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs.Knowing she was fine would put our minds at rest. We can still see her face full of horror and hear her cry.Otherwise we had a lovely holiday. You have a most beautiful part of the country to live in.Name and address supplied.Sir,It has been announced recently a Scottish Conservative government would invest £100 million into fixing potholes over the course of the next parliament.We all rely on our roads but they are now plagued with potholes which are damaging cars. Beyond our concerns for public safety, this systematic under-investment is slowing our economy and costing local councils a fortune in compensation for car owners.We recognise the importance of well-maintained roads and we are willing to invest in it.The SNP has consistently neglected Scotland’s roads and the results are obvious for everyone to see.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.On Monday May 14, I spotted six swallows over the rear of Meadows Place, hopefully heralding a decent summer.First seen this year.Mike Power, Lochgilphead.Sir,During this week\u0026#8217s Holyrood vote on the UK Government’s Withdrawal Bill, Labour, the Greens and LibDems joined the SNP in an overwhelming rejection of the UK Government’s currently-drafted Brexit plans, voting 93 to 30 against the bill.While the Scottish Government agrees in the need for UK-wide frameworks, it has described the retention of the overall control of agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement as a power grab.The Scottish Parliament has spoken loudly and clearly, and if the UK Government wants us to believe they value Scotland and devolution, they must respect the vote and remove the proposed power grab.Any constraints placed on the existing powers of the Scottish Parliament without consent would be a democratic outrage.During Prime Minister\u0026#8217s Questions, Theresa May failed to reassure us she will respect the decision of the Scottish Parliament. If she does choose to ignore the vote and force through this legislation, she will be breaking the conventions of the 20-year-old devolution settlement and imposing a power grab upon Scotland against our will.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters natures patterns","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 20/05/18, 11:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe natural world abounds in beautiful patterns, each evolved to enhance survival of a species \u0026#8211 the extravagant, iridescent peacock’s tail, which serves to attract a mate, while intricate orchid flowers entice pollinators and tigers’ stripes provide camouflage.But not all nature’s patterns are quite as showy it is the mathematical symmetries that I find most intriguing.Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci lived in 12th century Algeria when Indian numerals were introduced to the West via the Middle East.  In his book, Liber Abaci (published in 1202), he describes a numerical sequence, now called the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the previous two digits: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ad infinitum. He formulated this recurrence in relation to rabbit breeding, but it turns out to be exceedingly wide-spread in nature, from tree branching to mollusc shell growth to bee reproduction.Plant leaves are like solar panels, absorbing sunlight to power energy-providing photosynthesis.  Thus, leaves appear in a spiral around the stem, each positioned to optimise sunlight capture.  The ratio of leaves to turns is always a ration of Fibonacci numbers 3 leaves to 1 turn for hazel, 8/3 for pear and 13/5 for almond trees.  The angle between consecutive leaves is always close to 137.5o, called ‘the golden angle’ – perfect for maximising energy production.The number of petals in most flowers also follows the Fibonacci sequence: lilies have 3, buttercups 5, delphinium 8, common marigolds 13, asters 21.  But even more striking are the complex spirals of seed-heads of sunflowers, fir cones and pineapples.  In each case new seeds forming in the centre of the flower push older seeds out into mesmerising patterns of interlocking, clockwise and anticlockwise spirals.The numbers of spirals in both directions are consecutive Fibonacci numbers with 5 and 8 or 8 and 13 in pineapples, 8 and 13 in fir cones, and numbers as high as 144 and 233 recorded in sunflower heads.Why? Because these configurations pack in the most seeds.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 21/05/18, 3:33 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Some would argue it has been an eyesore that should have been knocked down long before now and replaced with a more modern building.But it\u0026#8217s sad to see the old Inveraray Community Hall crumble and rot with neglect.What makes the building\u0026#8217s current predicament all the more galling is that there was the chance, according to Inspire Inveraray, to make the building safe six years ago.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community. Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer. This can be anything from yoga, walking in the sunshine (I walk everywhere) or taking your favourite class at the gym.While you’re getting fitter and feeling healthier, you’ll be raising money to fund the highest quality research and essential information and support services that will save lives from bowel cancer.Take on the challenge and sign up at bowelcanceruk.org.uk/stepupfor30.Gaby Roslin, TV and radio presenterPICS:The common gull has been seen nesting at the disused oil depot. no_a21Gleanergull01Gulls at the former Gleaner site. no_a21Gleanergull02\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead kids get kitted out","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 30/05/18, 5:11 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowLochgilphead Soccer Centre is delighted to have taken delivery of a quality rain jacket for each of the kids associated with the centre and Red Star YFC.That’s 120 rain jackets in total.As well as making sure the kids look smart and feel part of the club they will also help keep them dry and warm when the weather is a bit wet and windy.The rain jackets have been sponsored by Mid Argyll Youth Development Services (MAYDS) and the Soccer Centre would like to say a huge thank you to MAYDS for this sponsorship and ongoing support.Five teams from Lochgilphead travelled to the Oban Football Festival on a Saturday April 28.

Elsewhere in the sheep classes, the Suffolks have their highest number in 10 years with 110 entries (90 in 2017). The Ryelands and the Rouges also see record numbers for the last decade, with 82 and 39 entries respectively (up from 65 and 34 in 2017). Commercial sheep entries are also seeing increased interest with 104 entries, up from 85 in 2017.  The North of England Mule class was introduced to the Show in 2011 and sees its highest ever entries, with 69 in the class.The Young Handler competition has 56 entries, illustrating the continued interest from the next generation particularly in this the Year of Young People.An exciting development is the interest in the goat classes with a ten-year high of 39 entries and the Boer breed, increasing from 16 to 27.  Six goat young handlers will also compete for the title.1,665 entries have been received in the light horse section, with the HOYS qualifying Mountain and Moorland Under Saddle section again dominating with 197 entries, up from 192 in 2017.The Heavy Horse section continues to have a strong presence, with 392 entries.

He said: “I don’t know what the future holds yet, mainly because we didn’t know what league we were going to be in. “We haven’t even spoke about it yet — we are still focused on the celebrations, to be honest.”  “The fans have been incredible all season and have always turned out in big numbers. “Especially away to Alloa, the turnout was just amazing. “The support have been amazing with me and have taken a real shine to me. “I have played well for Ayr and the fans have obviously recognised that, and it’s good to play for those fans. “This is my highest scoring season, but I was gutted not to get 30. “Although if I had a chance to get 30 it would have been in the play-offs, so I was happy to stay at 29.” "},{"url":null,"title":"ayr uniteds ian mccall lawrence","story":"NewsAyr United\u0027s Ian McCall and Lawrence Shankland bag Ladbrokes awardsIt comes after Ayr United won the League One title, with an impressive 124 goals in all competitions.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet15:23, 9 MAY 2018NewsAyr United manager Ian McCall and striker Lawrence Shankland win the Ladbrokes League 1 Manager and Player of the Year awards (Image: SNS Group)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyr United manager Ian McCall and striker Lawrence Shankland have bagged an awards double.

The prolific striker turned down Premiership riches and clubs in England to agree a one-year contract at Somerset Park on Tuesday. Shankland, 22, told the Ayrshire Post: “It’s a great club to be a part of. The main thing for this decision is that I am enjoying my football. The gaffer has been great with me and that’s why I came here. He gave me a chance to get back into football. I am happy and I don’t think there’s any amount of money that beats happiness. The fans have taken to me and that gives you confidence going into every game you play. Shankland smashed 29 goals en route to being named League One\u0027s player of the year as Ayr won the title.  Boss Ian McCall said: Lawrence could have doubled his money elsewhere and had offers from the Premiership up here and League One down in England. But the affection he has had from our supporters has played a huge part in his decision. It’s a huge piece of business for this club. Be in no doubt that Lawrence could easily have gone, but he has made a footballing decision. It is a big, big signing which shows our intent and now we need the fans to respond with an upsurge in season ticket sales.

The pair are both from Kilmarnock. “We met in the Brass \u0026amp Granite in 2010 at a pub quiz,” said Erin. “I worked part time in Tesco while studying and Stuart would come in and chat to me on a Sunday when he wasn’t offshore. “It wasn’t until 2015 when my gran met Stuart at a wedding and told him that I was single that he finally plucked up the courage to ask me on a date! “Stuart invited me to his house where he cooked me a lovely meal and the romance started. We moved in together early 2016 and then Stuart proposed whilst we were on holiday in Dubai in September 2016. “He bought me a pair of Valentino shoes and got down on one knee to put them on for me before pulling out my beautiful engagement ring that he’d designed himself and had made by a jeweller in Dubai.  The couple tied the knot on Saturday, February 24 this year, with the ceremony held at Glasgow University Memorial Chapel and the reception at Boclair House in Bearsden. Erin said: “It was a nice contrast of traditional and modern glam. “We were so lucky getting a beautiful crisp sunny day - right before the Beast from the East came later that week. “Stuart and I wrote our own ceremony and personalised vows. “We ended the night with [I want to spend my] Life with You by The Proclaimers. “It really was a perfect day and more than we could of dreamed of! The bride wore Everlasting by Caroline Castigliano, from The Bridal Garden in Glasgow, with her bridesmaids wearing customised blush Haley Paige dresses from Anne Priscilla, Glasgow.  Groom Stuart wore an Arran Mist kilt and plaid with matching navy jacket and gold tie. And the groomsmen wore Arran Mist tartan kilts with charcoal jackets and gold ties - exclusive to MacGregor \u0026amp MacDuff in Prestwick. The bridal party consisted of chief bridesmaid Eilidh McKenzie and bridesmaids Lynsey Ross, Raina Purba and Kirsteen Havlin. Making up the rest of the wedding party were best man Craig Marshall, ushers Les Lawrie, Dean Wear and Torin McKenzie, mother of the bride Una McKenzie and parents of the groom Yvonne and Fraser Murray. The couple celebrated being newlyweds with a trip to the sunshine. Erin said: “We squeezed in 10 nights in at the Centara Ras Fushi resort in the Maldives before Stuart went offshore again. “It was paradise! Our villa was right on the beach so it was perfect for watching the sunset.  Thistle \u0026amp Blink Photography from Kilmarnock captured the couple’s big day, leaving them with fond memories to relive. Emma Lawson of Betty Bluebell, based in East Kilbride, pieced together the bouquets with Ashley Nimmo, Ellis Dewhurst and Jett Paterson of Allure in Kilmarnock creating the hair and beauty looks for the day. As for their cake, the couple opted for four-tiers with all their favourite flavours, including red velvet. A local lady called Gianna made the cake, completed with a handmade topper by friend Rachel Currie. Erin added: “We would like to say a huge thank you to our families, bridesmaids and groomsmen for their help in the planning and execution of our dream wedding- it couldn’t have gone better! “Thank you to everyone who shared in our special day, your generosity and well wishes have been overwhelming.

Community leaders in Stranraer, desperate to lick their own sand back in shape, want to use the South Ayrshire model of success. It follows Prestwick’s hard fought battle to convince council bosses to clean up their rubble-strewn shore. Norrie Smith, vice chair of Prestwick South Community Council, performed the role of special envoy on a trip down the coast. He said: “The guys down there were very keen to talk to us about how we went about things. “Their problem is slightly different in terms of what they need to clean up, but the premise is the same. “They’ve got a fantastic community asset, much like ours, and it’s just about returning it to its rightful state and making the most of it.”  While weeds and silt are dogging Stranraer’s shoreline, Prestwick is facing the ongoing battle of mounting rubble. Already, more than 500 tonnes has been removed from the beach since council diggers were sent in to level the sand. Norrie added: “We’re delighted that our example has been recognised elsewhere. “People in this town campaigned long and hard to get where we are now, and if we can help others by sharing best practice then great. “I’m all for collaboration, whether it’s in your own town or further afield, so linking up like this can only be a positive thing.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"south ayrshire council bosses urged","story":"NewsSouth Ayrshire Council bosses urged to throw Ayr United a title partyCalls are mounting for civic head, Helen Moonie, to hold a bash at County Buildings, following Ayr’s first league title in 21 years.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson12:11, 9 MAY 2018NewsAyr United title celebrations (Image: SNS Group)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCouncil bosses have been urged to throw Ayr United’s champions an official party. Calls are mounting for civic head, Helen Moonie, to hold a bash at County Buildings, following Ayr’s first league title in 21 years. But the request could be snubbed in favour of a joint sporting celebration, the Post understands. A request for the engagement, lodged in the aftermath of Ayr’s success, is being considered by officials. Former cop Alasdair Malcolm, now a volunteer at Somerset Park, has called for the recognition. He said: “Every effort should be made to mark this fantastic achievement. “Ayr United are an integral part of the local community and, particularly through their Academy programme, have close working relationships throughout local schools and community groups. “The club, which has been a feature of the town since 1910, have had an outstanding season.” Ayr became the first club in the UK to score 100 goals in domestic competition en route to their title.  And their championship was the first to be clinched on home soil for 90 years. Mr Malcolm, secretary of the Ayrshire Golf Association, said: “It would be fitting if the local authority, by way of a civic reception or similar event, would mark the achievement of the management, players, officials and staff.” South Ayrshire Tory leader, Martin Dowey, added: “It is a wonderful achievement and one that is worthy of a civic reception. “A prosperous Ayr United is good for the town and we will be calling on all councillors to recognise the title win.” However, it’s believed there may be other invites on the guest list of any civic celebration. Carrick Rugby Club, three-time winners of the BT National Shield, and Commonwealth gold medallist Paul Foster, are among those in their thoughts. A council spokesman said: “A request has been received and will be considered in line with our civic hospitality guidelines.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"win a summer shopping spree","story":"NewsWin a summer shopping spreeTo help you get fashion and beauty- ready for summer, Debenhams at Ayr Central are hosting a fabulous VIP shopping event on Thursday June 7.\u0026nbspShareByAyrshire Post10:35, 30 MAY 2018Updated10:36, 30 MAY 2018NewsGet ready for summer and be in with a chance of winning a shopping spree\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailWIN A SUMMER SHOPPING SPREE!

Wren Kitchens will move into a 10,000sq ft unit at Heathfield this September, the Post can reveal. The firm, based in Lincolnshire, will make its first foray into Ayrshire when the store opens its doors. Its nearest outlet is currently more than 40 miles away at Abbotsinch, near Paisley. The addition comes as a welcome boost for park bosses, who are set to lose three retailers this year. Homebase will bow out on June 24, joining Carpetright and Maplin on the casualty list. The departures will see 50,000sq ft of trading space lost. However, Alastair Dickie, director at Heathfield’s developers Ediston Properties, said: “This is a positive piece of business. “Wren are an expanding company and this represents their first store in Ayrshire.  “They clearly view Ayr as a place to be and we are happy to have them on board. “It will mean jobs, not only in store but indirectly for fitters.” Wren will move into the unit vacated by the former PC World. The firm, which was founded in 2009, employs more than 4000 staff. It comes as park bosses prepare to seal a deal with another new name on site. Mr Dickie added: “Since acquiring the park we’ve let out ten units and don’t anticipate stopping there.” Ediston bought Heathfield in 2011 in a deal worth \u0026pound31.8 million. Retail giants such as M\u0026ampS, DFS and Costa have all moved in as part of the park’s overhaul in the intervening years.
