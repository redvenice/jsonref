One of the rooms at the hotel is pictured Rosbalt stated that Whelan, a corporate security executive, was \u0027caught red-handed immediately after receiving a media with information containing state secrets.\u0027It was about a list of persons that is not subject to disclosure and has long been the object of keen interest of US intelligence.\u0027As a source in the special services of the Russian Federation told Rosbalt, the operation to detain Paul Whelan took place in his room at the Metropol Hotel.\u0027Whelen - whose family insist he is innocent - had been engaged in secret activities for a decade, according to an intelligence source cited by Rosbalt.\u0027Whelan for 10 years led intelligence activities, and he found \u0027objects\u0027 (sources) to get the necessary information on the Internet,\u0027 reported the news outlet.\u0027It was a dream of mine to meet some of the sneaky...\u0027Paul\u0027s a kind soul, he\u0027s very generous\u0027: Brother of...Share this articleIn a follow-up report, Rosbalt claimed Whelan \u0027used quite unusual methods in his spying activities\u0027.The source said that about ten years ago he started registering on the various internet websites and forums attended by large numbers of Russians.\u0027The American man posted about his love to Russia, his wish to master the Russian language, to visit Moscow,\u0027 stated the report.Some of those Whelan befriended online were of interest to US secret services, it was claimed, and these people \u0027might have access to secret information\u0027.The report went on: \u0027Having established solid contacts with Russians online, Whelan began to visit Moscow in person.\u0027He pretended he had come to Moscow to have fun and he always met his internet friends.\u0027It was noticeable that Whelan was not at all interested in pretty Russian women but preferred to drink with his male friends.\u0027In these sessions \u0027the US citizen tried to understand if they possessed information interesting for US secret services, or if somebody from his close circle might have such access\u0027, it is claimed in the report.If the person looked potentially interesting, Whelan \u0027aimed to establish maximum trusting relations with them, (and) even attended family parties.\u0027At the same time the foreigner worked with them in order to receive the required information.\u0027No names were given of people Whelan had allegedly targeted. Nor was any proof given to support the allegations in the Rosbalt reports. Meanwhile, the Nezygar Telegram channel - seen as having insider information in Moscow - cited a source saying Whelan \u0027was involved in spying activities since his work in recruiting company Kelly Services that has an office in Moscow\u0027.The report predicted that law enforcement \u0027will have to go through the whole database of those recruited by Kelly\u0027 over a ten-year period.

He arrived December 22 and was scheduled to stay through Sunday.Whelan\u0027s family, in a statement that David posted on Twitter, said: \u0027We are deeply concerned for his safety and well-being. His innocence is undoubted and we trust that his rights will be respected.\u0027The Russian spying charges carry a prison sentence of up to 20 years.The Marine Corps on Wednesday released details of Whelan\u0027s service record. He served in the Marine Corps Reserves from 1994 to 2008 and was convicted of larceny in a special court-martial in January 2008. The Marine Corps did not immediately provide details of the court-martial conviction beyond saying it was based on \u0027several charges related to larceny.\u0027Whelan attained the rank of staff sergeant in December 2004 after the first of two deployments in Iraq. He was an administrative clerk and administrative chief. He was given a bad-conduct discharge in December 2008 at the rank of private. His last place of duty was at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in California.David said in an interview that his brother had been to Russia several times previously, so when a fellow former Marine was planning a wedding in Moscow, he was asked to go along to help out.David said that it was while searching the internet Monday that he learned of his brother\u0027s arrest.\u0027I was looking for any stories about dead Americans in Moscow, so in a way it was better than finding out that he had died,\u0027 he said.David said he has no idea why his brother was targeted by the Russian security services. Paul Whelan had traveled to Russia in the past for work and to visit friends he had met on social networks, his brother said.\u0027I don\u0027t think there\u0027s any chance that he\u0027s a spy,\u0027 David told CNN.Paul Whelan lives in Novi, Michigan, and is director of global security for BorgWarner, where he has worked since early 2017.\u0027He is responsible for overseeing security at our facilities in Auburn Hills, Michigan, and at other company locations around the world,\u0027 company spokeswoman Kathy Graham said in a statement.She said BorgWarner does not have any facilities in Russia.Paul Whelan previously worked for Kelly Services, which does maintain offices in Russia, his brother said.       Whelan\u0027s defunct website reveals his enthusiasm for the country and multiple trips there. His website, paulnwhelan.com, describes a 2006 visit to Russia, which appears to be his first trip to the country.

It is the successor agency to the Soviet Union\u0027s KGB. Currently, Whelan has an account on Russian social media site VK, where he has 70 friends and regularly posts updates in rudimentary Russian, including one that said \u0027President Trump Forward!!\u0027          Experts on the Kremlin quickly speculated that the arrest was bogus, and an attempt to create leverage against America in the case of Russian woman Maria Butina (above) He also posted a photo of himself on the site wearing a Spartak Moscow football jersey.

By comparison, the United States has just 15 departments to manage the Trump administration’s £3trillion federal budget.But any attempt to cut Whitehall down to size is likely to face fierce resistance from civil service unions and rival ministers, such as International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt, who risk having their Cabinet status downgraded.  The move will be led by Treasury chief secretary Liz Truss and Philip Hammond but final decisions will have to be agreed by Theresa MayMrs May has made it clear she is committed to the controversial target of spending 0.7 per cent of Britain’s income on foreign aid, which has seen the aid budget balloon to more than £14billion a year.The Treasury source said there was no reason the target could not be administered by a super-charged Foreign Office.Conservative MP Peter Bone, a long-time critic of the aid target, said handing control of the aid budget to the Foreign Office would be ‘a good first step’.Mr Bone said: ‘I do think it would be a good idea to get rid of Dfid. We don’t need a department to dole out foreign aid when we already have the Foreign Office, who have the experts on the ground who would be better at targeting resources to match our foreign policy.‘The real problem is that spending £14billion a year on aid is absurd, and linking it to GDP is absurd. But getting rid of one department and spending it more in line with our national priorities would be a good first step.’The rapid growth of Dfid has been a source of irritation to the Foreign Office for years. Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson tried to persuade Mrs May to give him control of the aid budget when he took office in 2016, describing the decision to hive off the aid budget into its own department in 1997 as a ‘colossal mistake’.The Prime Minister turned down the request. However, she agreed that two junior ministers at Dfid should also report to Mr Johnson.          New Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt is said to be more relaxed about the activities of Dfid, despite the fact its vast spending power now makes it an important arm of foreign policyNew Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt is said to be more relaxed about the activities of Dfid, despite the fact its vast spending power now makes it an important arm of foreign policy.Aid spending now dwarfs the £2billion annual budget of the Foreign Office. Rapid increases in foreign aid spending have led to widespread criticism that officials are more interested in spending the money than ensuring it is spent well.Last month it emerged that Dfid was able to volunteer 600 of its 3,000 staff to help other departments prepare for the possibility of a no-deal Brexit – fuelling concern it has grown too big. But the Foreign Office also has had a mixed record of overseeing aid spending in recent years.In a report last year, MPs criticised the department for continuing to use aid money in China, which Dfid stopped funding years ago.

Its mast snapped off in the wild weather that forced Sunderland’s rescue midway through her world record attempt to be the youngest solo sailor to circumnavigate the globe in 2010.Sunderland, who said she saw the footage of the rediscovered yacht on the news, said she was “very emotional”.“My heart skipped a beat,” she said in a statement. “It brought back many memories – good and not so good – but it was neat to see it after so long. It looked a little creepy but that’s to be expected after so long.”The yacht was spotted from the air by a tuna spotter plane about 12.30pm on Monday, 11 nautical miles from Vivonne Bay on Kangaroo Island. The South Australian police helicopter and two commercial fishing vessels were sent to investigate and identified the yacht.It had not been seen since Sunderland was picked up and rescued by the French ship Ile de la Reunion on 12 June 2010, midway between Madagascar and Western Australia.In a blog post written on the Ile de la Reunion hours after she was picked up, Sunderland said: “The long and the short of it is, well, one long wave, and one short mast (short meaning two inch stub.) ... am still trying to get over the fact that I will never see my Wild Eyes again.”A month later, after she had returned home to California, she said it was unlikely the boat would ever be found.“A lot of people have been asking about Wild Eyes,” she wrote on 5 July, 2010. “She was still afloat when I boarded the Ile de la Reunion. She could end up on a beach in Western Australia at some point, but it’s just a guess, we don’t know for sure.“She would have to be very lucky to wash up on a beach, and not get smashed on the rocks or something like that. While I do wish that she would be found and fixed up, it’s not all that likely she will be found.”Sunderland, now 25, set sail from Marina del Rey in California on 23 January in 2010 but had to restart her world record attempt at Cabo San Lucas in Mexico 10 days later due to electrical problems and higher-than-expected fuel and power use from her navigation and communication systems.Her family had bought the Australian-built Wild Eyes and in October the year before, just months after her elder brother Zach became the first person under the age of 18 to sail solo around the world, with stops and assistance, and kitted it out specifically for her journey.She said on Thursday that she was curious to see whether any of her video equipment, which was recording her journey, had survived. She had closed the hatch of the racing yacht before disembarking, which may have protected the inside.“It would be great to try and retrieve the boat but given the costs I don’t think that will happen,” she said. “I always knew the boat was high quality and very safe so it doesn’t really surprise me that it’s still floating.”Sunderland intended to beat her brother’s record and complete a non-stop circumnavigation, but had to stop in Cape Town for repairs in May. She activated her emergency satellite beacons after being tumbled about in 60-knot winds and 50-foot waves about 2,000 miles east of Madagascar.Her parents were heavily criticised for allowing her to undertake the attempt, and Sunderland in turn criticised the media saying that her age had nothing to do with encountering a storm in the southern ocean, something she said happened to all sailors.Australian Jessica Watson, who is just five months older than Sunderland, is the youngest person ever to complete a solo non-stop circumnavigation and arrived home in Sydney on 15 May 2010, three days before her 17th birthday and six days before Sunderland departed Cape Town."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83b07d3d686458b4d55e214cec03c8254c73576b/132_162_1298_779/master/1298.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e22d56fb8db4c45ccfe558f4a2a0dbb","title":"mr five per cent calouste gulbenian worlds richest man","story":"The story of the buccaneering Calouste Gulbenkian, wealthy oilman, who anticipated today’s unfettered global tycoonsWhat does the life of an Ottoman-born ethnic Armenian oil tycoon have to teach us about the modern world? Quite a lot, it turns out, judging by this fascinating biography of Calouste Gulbenkian, a dealmaker for the ages and, at his death in 1955, the world’s richest man.When the deal was signed, on the eve of the first world war, his stake didn’t sound like much, but he fought for decades to hang on to it and, by the 1950s, he had a shilling for every pound earned from some of the world’s richest oilfields. And that really added up. In modern terms, he died with a fortune of almost £5bn.He was clearly not an easy person to like, and fell out with almost everyone he came across, but his buccaneering qualities make him an extremely interesting person to read about. At one point, he exploited the young Soviet Union’s shortage of capital to build the nucleus of a world-class art collection. There are several Rembrandts missing from the Hermitage, thanks to his negotiating skills.When Gulbenkian was born in 1869, Armenians were a significant minority in Istanbul, and dominated the city’s commercial sector, having taken advantage of a series of reforms passed by an Ottoman government keen to expand its decrepit economy. By the 1880s, however, the city was becoming uncomfortable for them, with the start of a wave of pogroms that peaked in the infamous Armenian genocide of 1915-17.Gulbenkian had moved to London to study, and stayed, becoming a British subject, building his City career, and gradually abandoning the family’s merchant business. His life and career was, however, mostly transnational. “Empires and states, diplomats and statesmen, spheres of influence … all were distractions to Gulbenkian: to be ignored if possible, or else coached and co-opted,” Conlin notes.He liked some countries, particularly Britain and France, where he kept his artworks and built a pleasure garden, but avoided entanglements that might cost him money. This is why he spent most of the second world war in Portugal, then a neutral dictatorship, and leaned towards whichever side looked like winning.And this is why his life has such relevance today: he is a relic of a previous age of globalisation, the freewheeling days before 1939 when money flowed around the world as unhindered by regulation as it does now, and the powerful were able to seek profits where they liked, and to dodge laws however they felt fit. As his daughter Rita, with whom he had a more than usually complex relationship, explained: “laws are made for everyone but us.”Stripped of anachronisms, Gulbenkian looks remarkably like a modern oligarch, with his high-ranking connections in all countries, his border-straddling ambitions, his children at English schools, and his business interests in the liminal sphere we now call “offshore”. He used corporate structures to own property, and skilfully balanced his and his family members’ movements between countries to avoid being beholden to any tax authority.He owned his portfolio of shares and bonds via a Liechtenstein entity called Anstalt Vega, which meant he paid only 100 Swiss francs in tax in 1931 – on assets valued at £4.6m (£288m in today’s money). Much of his empire was structured and controlled via the UK, but he had no intention of paying for the privilege.After the second world war, with capital controls in force and countries trying to repair their economies while paying for welfare states, there was little tolerance for globe-trotting tax dodgers, so Gulbenkian stayed in Portugal, unwilling to risk the consequences of exposing himself to the revenue services of any of his former haunts. He flirted with the idea of endowing art galleries in London and the US but was concerned by the tax impact of visiting either country and, eventually, the Gulbenkian Foundation ended up in Portugal. It is now one of the largest sources of charitable donations in Europe, and the Gulbenkian is a major Lisbon art gallery.Conlin had access to the foundation’s archives, which did not give up their secrets without a fight. Some of Gulbenkian’s early correspondence was in Ottoman Turkish, a language no longer spoken, and written in Armenian characters, an alphabet few people know. Decoding all this, and making sense of the worlds that Gulbenkian moved in, is a remarkable feat of scholarship.Mr Five Per Cent is written precisely, with flashes of dry humour, and Conlin wears the depth of his research lightly. The story he tells is one of a businessman playing off great powers in the Middle East, exploiting loopholes in the world’s financial architecture, avoiding accountability, making a fortune for himself, and spending it on a life of luxury. Gulbenkian may have been a unique talent of a past age, but his heirs are all around us.• Mr Five Per Cent: The Many Lives of Calouste Gulbenkian, the World’s Richest Man is published by Profile.

Bound in red leather embossed with gold, the world’s smallest edition of Dante’s classic poem, which was printed by the Salmin Brothers in Padua, is one of almost 50 officially designated miniature books housed in the London Library. Nomenclature is important here: according to the US-based Miniature Book Society, a miniature book “is no more than three inches in height, width, or thickness”, and while the London Library has some 350-odd “small” books, of less than five inches, it has only 47 true miniatures. The library decided they were being overshadowed by their larger cousins, so now they are gathered together in a glass-fronted cabinet.Alongside the Dante, there is the smallest AuthorisedVersion of the Bible, first printed by David Bryce of Glasgow in 1896. Bryce said that when he “descended to the miniature, mite and midget size” he had “many a scoff and jeer as to the absurdity of the production”. This edition of the Bible, just an inch across, comes with a tiny magnifying glass tucked into a pocked in its cover (unlike the Dante, which is small but perfectly legible, this book would be impossible to read without one). There is also a miniature edition of Kate Greenaway’s Alphabet from the 1880s, and Dunia Garcia-Ontiveros, who looks after the London Library’s collection, points to the 1828 edition of Horace’s odes, the second book to be published using Henri Didot’s microscopic type. In a display of virtuosity, the text also contains a number of ornamental lines, the centre of which is formed by the letters “Henri Didot” printed even smaller than the type of the main text. I peer over the pages attempting to spot these at last, using the zoom function on my phone, I find them.“In its quality, it’s unparallelled,” says Garcia-Ontiveros. “He’s showing off. It was published in the 1820s, that’s quite early. I’m not surprised people called it a miracle.”The earliest miniature books in the collection date to the 16th century. Books were often made small, according to Garcia-Ontiveros, because they were religious texts – so people wanted to keep them close as they felt emotionally connected to them – or because they were controversial and had “to be secreted about one’s person”, such as Charles Knowlton’s 1832 guide to birth control, The Fruits of Philosophy.But miniature books have a much longer history. The British Library points to two small cuneiform tablets from ancient Mesopotamia. Both concerned with trading information about animals and provisions, one is dated to around 2325BC and measures 158 by 112 inches the other is dated 2200BC and measures 178 by 114 inches. In AD770, the Japanese empress Shotoku gave orders for the printing of 1m copies of a prayer scroll a mere 238 inches tall, the D’harani prayer. These writings were made miniature, writes the British Library’s Annalisa Ricciardi, “so that men and women of faith could easily bring with them their collection of psalms and devotional books, students could carry their small library in a pocket, smugglers of ideas could easily hide tiny booklets in a secret bottom of their cape, merchants could quickly retrieve from their belt a tiny but complete guide on the equivalence of grains prices, scales, measures and conversion, and foreign currencies value meanwhile closing a deal, or sharp businessmen could brilliantly define a legal contract”.Technological developments in the 1800s made it possible to print text even more. “That’s when you get the truly mind-bogglingly tiny books,” says Garcia-Ontiveros, citing everything from the Horace to Bryce’s Bible to a complete set of Shakespeare’s plays that can be held cupped in two hands.Simon Garfield, who recently published In Miniature: How Small Things Illuminate the World, says his favourite is the Sherlock Holmes story How Watson Learned the Trick, which was written in the 1920s by Arthur Conan Doyle. “It’s bound in red leather, measures under 4cm by 3cm and contains 503 words. That’s about one page of a regular book, but it’s handwritten and extends to 34 pages,” says Garfield. (The original can be found in Queen Mary’s Dolls’’ House in Windsor Castle.) “The title’s ironic: the story, composed almost entirely of dialogue, begins with Watson thinking he’s mastered the art of elementary detection, only to be deflated by Holmes proving him wrong on every count.”Around the world, collectors coo over the Salmin Brothers’ 1896 copy of Galileo’s 1636 letter to his friend Cristina di Lorena, which Louis Bondy writes in his history of miniature books “was considered the smallest printed from movable type” for many years: it is half the size of a postage stamp. A copy is in MIT Libraries, in Massachusetts, alongside a handful of other miniatures: four addresses by Abraham Lincoln and extracts from Calvin Coolidge’s autobiography. Both are as small as the Galileo, but neither were set from movable type. The National Library of Scotland has one of Bryce’s most famous publications, a miniature Koran printed in Arabic around 1900, copies of which, it says, were often given to Muslim soldiers fighting with allied forces during the first world war, the metal locket allowing it “to be easily worn around the neck of the soldier”.“The 19th century was absolutely the golden age, the heyday of miniature printing,” says Garcia-Ontiveros. “They were saying, we want to push this to the limit and see how far we can go.”Those limits have gone from inches to millimetres to micrometres. In 1952, a Munich publisher produced a five-by-five millimetre book containing the Lord’s Prayer in Dutch, English, French, German, Spanish and Swedish (it sold for £1,300 in London in 2006). Guinness World Records lists the smallest reproduction of a printed book as Teeny Ted from Turnip Town, which measures 70 micrometres by 100 micrometres and was etched using an ion beam. Russian scientist Vladimir Aniskin believes he has beaten this with Levsha, his 70-by-90 micrometres book. The pages are turned using a sharpened metal needle.What is it that makes the world of the miniature so appealing? “It’s the feeling that you can hold the entire works of Shakespeare in your hands,” says Garcia-Ontiveros. “Miniature books were never seen as serious books, they were curiosities, seen as fun objects, not the kind of books that would make it into libraries. They were the books people would have at home, and because they are tiny and often printed on cheap paper they don’t tend to survive, so in any age miniature books are very rare. And they get lost!

The Sports Direct chief executive, Mike Ashley, had also warned that dismal trading in November had been “unbelievably bad”.However, Next’s performance was in keeping with John Lewis, which on Wednesday reported a strong finish to a rollercoaster Christmas trading period, with a bumper sales fortnight as consumers made a late dash to the shops. The department store chain experienced big swings in trade during November and December, with a record-breaking Black Friday followed by several weeks of declining sales.Retailers are suffering as rising rents, business rates and wages drive up the cost of running physical stores at a time when shoppers are increasingly spending online. Last week HMV emerged as the first major Christmas casualty as it collapsed into administration for the second time in six years, putting more than 2,200 jobs at risk.“The ongoing shift towards online, fiercer competitor dynamics and softer consumer confidence have damaged in-store sales,” Lim continued. “This will likely set the tone for other retailers with a large physical footprint.

The weaker pound has made it less attractive for foreign nationals to come to Britain to work, while Brexit has also raised the prospect of tougher immigration rules in future.The BCC said the economy also appeared to be “stuck in a weak holding pattern” at the start of the year owing to Brexit uncertainty, with companies reporting stagnant levels of growth and faltering business confidence.While manufacturers are coming under pressure from labour shortages, the service sector, which includes banks, hotels and restaurants, and accounts for about four-fifths of the economy, reported weaker domestic sales.Production in the manufacturing sector hit its fastest pace of growth in six months in December as firms stockpiled in preparation for potential border holdups in the event of a no-deal Brexit.The IHS MarkitCips manufacturing purchasing managers’ index rose from 53.6 in November to 54.2 last month, beating all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists. Above 50 indicates economic growth.The latest snapshot raises the prospect that Brexit uncertainty may perversely benefit the economy in the short-term by prompting companies to raise their activity levels in preparation for potential disruption from the UK leaving the EU on 29 March without a deal.The Bank of England has previously said that the majority of businesses in Britain have done little to prepare for a no-deal scenario, while the government has started to tell more companies to make preparations as it steps up its plans.Economists, however, said the growth in activity was likely to be temporary. Disruption after 29 March could curtail activity, while any removal of Brexit risks could lead businesses to run down their stockpiled goods rather than placing new orders."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2deaf38b369e4b60dd1d07254d30b31e61251271/0_0_4471_2683/master/4471.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ce90c2ee5938bcb62ea6dbac10acf3a","title":"stocks under pressure after apple downgrade shock business live","story":"European markets fall following phonemaker’s warning of lower revenueThe first mega deal of the year has just landed in the US: pharma company Bristol-Myers Squibb plans to buy biotech firm Celgene for a cool $74bn.Giovanni Caforio, chairman and chief executive of Bristol-Myers Squibb (who cannot have had much of a holiday), said he was “impressed by what Celgene has accomplished for patients”.Just after midday, the European stock sell-off has accelerated in Germany and France.It’s a big anniversary today for the cryptocurrency world: bitcoin turns 10.The original distributed ledger currency has offered much – although what it (or the underlying technology) has actually delivered so far is a different question.

He said: “The construction sector has had little to cheer recently, but 2019 should be a better year.”Optimism among builders about the outlook for activity over the next 12 months rose to its highest level since April. While many were concerned by Brexit, others anticipated winning work related to some big-ticket transport and energy infrastructure projects in 2019.More detail on the Apple ructions, with European suppliers particularly in the spotlight, writes Mark Sweney.Chancellor Philip Hammond has appointed Dame Colette Bowe and Dame Jayne-Anne Gadhia as external members of one of the Bank of England’s top committees.They will join the financial policy committee (FPC), led by governor Mark Carney, which is responsible for monitoring financial stability.They will replace two men in the second half of the year. The Bank has faced persistent concerns about the gender balance in its top echelons. Of the 42 applicants to the jobs, 20 were women. Five women from 8 were invited to final-stage interviews.Bowe and Gadhia will start their new jobs shortly after the UK’s departure from the EU in March 2019. The Bank has braced itself for financial market turmoil if the UK leaves without a deal.Bowe is the current chairman of the Banking Standards Board and has served as a board member of the UK Statistics Authority and the Department for Transport. Gadhia was the chief executive of Virgin Money from 2007 until last year’s takeover by CYBG, and is one of the City’s most prominent business figures.They will replace Richard Sharp and Martin Taylor, who are stepping down at the end of the first quarter of 2019 and the second quarter of 2019 respectively.British builders are suffering from “an intense headwind” from – you guessed it – Brexit uncertainty, according to Tim Moore, economics associate director at IHS Markit. It was the weakest upturn in commercial activity for seven months.UK construction firms signalled a slowdown in housing and commercial activity growth during December, which more than offset a strong performance for civil engineering at the end of 2018.Despite the weaker housing market, housebuilding came in as the fastest growing sub-sector for builders during the course of 2018. Yet “residential growth remains much softer than the two-and-a-half year peak achieved last summer”, adds Moore.The growth of the British construction industry slowed in December because of subdued demand, according to the latest purchasing managers index (PMI) for the sector.IHS Markit’s closely followed barometer fell to a reading of 52.8 in December, down from 53.4 in November. The index remained above the 50 no-change mark, indicating the sector is still growing, but it came in slightly below economists’ expectations of 52.9."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db1a827b198d1b1ea54b6a71db8a68c8f2ae13ee/0_59_4905_2943/master/4905.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d8119a08dd3af28f7adad4319b4bfa39","title":"chris grayling cabinet minister rail fare hikes transport","story":"The unjustifiable train fare hike is the latest reason why he should resign as transport secretary, but still he staggers onWhenever I see that Chris Grayling – officially secretary of state for transport, unofficially minister for blunders, incompetence and general disaster – still has a job, I wonder what Hugh Dalton would think. Dalton served as chancellor of the exchequer in Clement Attlee’s post-war Labour government for its first two years, and was the initial architect of its progressive economic measures. But then, in the late autumn of 1947, Dalton inadvertently leaked some minor details of his impending budget to a lobby journalist. By today’s standards, we’d struggle to call it much of a leak: the papers hit the stands very shortly before Dalton stood at the dispatch box. Yet this was such a scandal at the time that he felt obliged to resign from the cabinet.Seventy years on, it turns out that Chris Grayling does actually serve a useful purpose, as a measure of the extent to which the resignation threshold has been raised. Maybe the transport secretary should lend his name to this political trend: the Grayling principle, perhaps. Come now, you protest, which government has offered the British public such a varied smörgåsbord of ministerial resignations? Yet many of those are Tory Brexiteers fleeing a crime scene, not honourably resigning office due to their own failures or ministers resigning over allegations of sexual harassment and misconduct or, in the case of Priti Patel, stepping down because of secretive meetings with a foreign government.Even former home secretary Amber Rudd – who was swiftly reinstated to the cabinet – was forced to resign over misleading MPs, rather than the substance of the Windrush scandal, which deprived British citizens of healthcare, left them homeless, or even deported them. In this context, that Grayling continues to be paid £141,000 a year is a sign not only of shambolic government, but of national and political decline too.Given the chaos we have become used to, when you hear that Grayling has awarded a £13.8m contract to charter extra ferries in a no-deal Brexit scenario to a company that doesn’t actually have any ferries, you simply exclaim: “But of course!” He isn’t entirely to blame. The government as a whole is spending vast sums of public money on a no-deal outcome, principally as an act of psychological warfare aimed at coercing MPs into voting for Theresa May’s deal. Yet committing taxpayers’ money to a no-ships company to help save Britain from a hypothetical self-inflicted meltdown would surely be a scandal in normal times.Consider Grayling’s wider record. Train punctuality has sunk to a 13-year low, while rail fares have again been raised in an era in which British workers have suffered the worst stagnation in wages since the Napoleonic wars. During the disruption last year, in which up to 200 Govia Thameslink services a day were being cancelled, Grayling defended himself as not a “specialist in rail matters”. According to an interim report from the Office of Road and Rail, “nobody took charge”. As a bare minimum, he should have stripped Govia Thameslink of its franchise, but instead the company was merely required to spend more on passenger improvements.In 2016, a leaked letter found that Grayling opposed devolving control of suburban rail to London’s elected authorities for partisan reasons: he wanted to keep it “out of the clutches” of a Labour mayor. Even a former Conservative vice-chair declared no confidence in him after that. Both Crossrail and HS2 have been beset by disastrous delays and budget overruns, but while chairman Terry Morgan bit the bullet, Grayling remains in place.Grayling is therefore a source of inspiration to mediocre white men everywhere who, however much they lack ability, can still look forward to wielding power. We live in a country, after all, in which the first black female MP is pilloried for getting some figures wrong in an interview, while Grayling can preside over abject chaos in Britain’s essential national infrastructure and still remain in post. In that sense, he sums up a twofold national decline: in the standards of a morally decrepit political elite, and in the provision of essential services in a supposedly advanced economy.Of course, it’s not just about Grayling. The privatisation of the railway system is one of the most vivid examples of how market ideology has set itself on a collision course with reality. Even a thoroughly competent politician would struggle to run such a fragmented mess. That Grayling is no such thing merely compounds a terrible national error. And so, along with rain on a bank holiday, it seems there are some new certainties in decaying Tory Britain: that trains are delayed and overcrowded, that fares are unaffordable, and that Chris Grayling keeps his job."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/965cfcbc7a7b05a88f7366e887b8178c57395c0e/0_0_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1837644eadc3e222940ef9dcb8134da1","title":"10th birthday bitcoin cryptocurrency","story":"Bitcoin, the Big Daddy of cryptocurrencies, which celebrates its 10th birthday today, rarely inspires temperate or informed debate.For its detractors – mostly elderly bankers and economists – it is tulip-mania, moonshine, hi-tech smoke and mirrors. For its most fanatical adherents – techies and latter-day hippies – bitcoin is not merely a viable currency, but salvation: a universal panacea, not just to combat governmental ineptitude or malevolence, and poverty, but to end them. Hallelujah and kumbaya.The sneerers cite the rampant criminality in the ranks of the cryptosphere. It is true, in the 10 years since bitcoin was born on a couple of desktop computers – becoming an entity worth more than the M1 money supply of Argentina – its retinue has accommodated an incredible rogues’ gallery. There have been old-fashioned cony-catchers, saltimbancos and bubblers who did a runner with other people’s money in the time-honoured manner, but also drug-dealers, murderers and blaggers – not to mention the lethal dreamers and false prophets.But as the stalwarts of crypto will gleefully point out, the desperados and flimflammery encountered in these new forms are but a mirror of the better-tailored dishonesty found in the City of London or any of the world’s financial centres. There is hardly a bank left that has not been caught money-laundering, market-rigging, misselling or involved in miscellaneous misdeeds.Cryptocurrencies are fiendishly complex – just a basic understanding requires a maths and IT background. And, like lawyers, even those developers who do know something rarely agree on anything. Eve if you do know something about the tech, it does not help much, because this is all new and unprecedented. When tech leaves the white paper and hits the street, no one knows what the result will be. There is a long trail of iniduals and companies who have been “rekt” as the industry parlance has it because of events: for example, the Bitcoin Cash civil war last November.The most impressive feature of bitcoin is that it is still there. It has survived crash after crash and state hostility. It has truly been battle-tested in the harshest of conditions. The identity-hiding creator of bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, wanted it to be a currency. That looks unlikely. In the near future, you won’t be buying a pint of milk with it at the corner shop.Admittedly, if you are willing to trawl the internet, and in no rush to get things, you can buy all sorts of products – but for everyday life, compared with a contactless Visa card, bitcoin is almost useless.One of the selling points of bitcoin (and other cryptos such as Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin and Dash) is that you can “be your own bank”. That has its attractions and advantages, but it also has a downside: it means having some understanding of the tech, and a willingness to take full responsibility when the bank robbers come.If something goes wrong, you are on your own. Again, compared with a credit card, bitcoin seems risky and hard work, unless you are really keen on buying drugs or tax evasion. On the other hand, bitcoin can be sent anonymously and fairly quickly to the other side of the world with low fees.2017 was the year when you couldn’t lose in crypto, but 2018 was the year when you couldn’t win. If you invested at the all time-high for bitcoin in December 2017, you will have lost some three-quarters of your investment (should you choose to cash out).But whether a bitcoin is worth £2,000 or £20,000 is not so important. The get-rich-quick speculators have probably abandoned the world of crypto. What counts now is adoption. Most of the action in the first 10 years has been in the US (it appeals to both the far left and the far right) and in east Asia (China, Japan, Korea, Singapore).While I find the claims that crypto can enrich the unbanked and poor ludicrous, it is likely that the future growth of bitcoin will be in countries with ailing, corrupt or authoritarian governments and wonky currencies. Latin America, Africa and the Middle East will be the places where citizens will value something the authorities will have a hard time getting their hands on. Venezuelans have recently had a crash-course in crypto.Is there a need for bitcoin? Probably not. Government-backed currencies work, whatever their shortcomings. However, bitcoin may well succeed as a digital gold: a store of value, a savings account rather than an everyday currency. And there is certainly room for a global cryptocurrency, whether it is bitcoin or one of its spin-offs or successors.The frenzy around crypto in the last few years meant that creating a currency was almost a cottage industry, even if some were clearly meant as a joke – ponzicoin for instance – though others, such as dentacoin (for dentists), were not. Most of the hundreds of current altcoins (ie not bitcoin) will wither, probably quite soon.But still they come. In two weeks’ time a new coin is due to be launched using the Mimble Wimble protocol (the cultural spectrum of the tech world does not seem to stretch much beyond Game of Thrones or Harry Potter), a turbocharged competitor to bitcoin that aims to return “power to the people” by keeping out big crypto-mining companies. It is called Grin – which, if nothing else, surely has the best name for a currency in the history of money."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5efe5349e8fe7ead21ed652b2c6083ea9dfd33e5/0_2_2834_1701/master/2834.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a7f422d089c818602a9bb56c009dbf16","title":"oxbridge universities colleges investment local communities","story":"Beyond the dreaming spires, colleges and universities badly need investment – and closer ties to their local communityElitism and Oxbridge: it is the hardy perennial of debate about the state of our universities. Last month yet another report – this one from the Sutton Trust – highlighted the extent to which Oxford and Cambridge remain dominated by students from the south-east of England, many of them selected from a small number of elite fee-paying and selective state schools.The stark inequity of Oxbridge and Russell Group admissions has been a recurrent theme for at least a decade. Despite genuine efforts to increase access for students from marginalised communities, progress has been achingly slow. So it’s easy to see why access to elite institutions has come to be seen as the litmus test of how equal our higher education system is. But a preoccupation with squeezing a few more poorer students through the narrow gates of elite colleges, desirable though that is, has eclipsed the real problem bedevilling our university system: a fair deal for the institutions that are educating everybody else.In post-1992 universities, funding has been slashed and finances threatened for access and foundation courses in further education colleges, and for learning courses in community centres. And in the post-2010 era of cuts, the notion of lifelong learning has virtually fallen off the radar. Combining an austerity agenda with increasing tuition fees was not compatible with an egalitarian notion of access to education. It was much easier to focus attention on numbers of young people from working-class and ethnic-minority communities entering elite universities, than on older students doing access courses at FE colleges or taking part-time degrees at former polytechnics or the Open University.The fairytale of social mobility for a few trumped the less glamorous reality of educational access for the many. As a result, education policy has become dominated by the impossible dream of perfect social mobility. Of course there is no doubt about the need to ersify elite institutions and change their cultures, but the danger is that we then see educational inequality as solely a problem of inidual success stories rather than collective provision. There is nothing democratic or egalitarian about concentrating vast financial resources in the education of a narrow elite while dismantling the educational institutions that serve the rest. The cultural and economic democracy we need is not compatible with a model of higher education that is so deeply hierarchical.Our priority should be to increase the prospect of good jobs and fulfilling careers, especially in the marginalised communities that have expressed their anger through the Brexit vote. We don’t need to redouble our attention on wealthy elite universities in south-east England. What we need is to redistribute cultural and economic wealth away from these bastions of privilege.Faiza Shaheen, the director of the Class thinktank, has spoken about the need to go beyond the language of social mobility and think about what collective success in education looks like. The alternatives to a hierarchical system are not hard to find. A recent book by Bristol academics, Who Are Universities For?, outlines a flatter model in which, crucially, it is far easier to move from work into education and back again. The argument is that, in recruitment to higher education, students from local communities should be a greater priority – meaning inclusive curricula which reflect the intake.Instead of deep isions between academic and vocational courses, a modular system of credits for inidual courses would allow greater movement between different institutions and subjects. Eventually the old isions characterising the traditional degree structure would dissolve into a more fluid model of education, which people dip in and out of over the course of their lives.Yet the educational solutions we need cannot stop with fairer access. We also need universities that are run democratically in the interests of students and staff – and serve their local community. At the University of Leicester in 2016, staff and local people campaigned against the university managers’ decision to close down the lifelong learning centre, Vaughan College. The managers ignored the voices of staff and students, and the centre will finally close in 2020. But staff from the college have refounded it as a cooperative, running courses for adult learners with the aim of continuing to provide access to higher education for adults in the city.Similar experiments in cooperative education have been developed in Lincoln, and a separate project to establish a cooperative university with full degree-awarding powers is currently under way. These are the kinds of projects that can really contribute to a more egalitarian university system.In a country that has been ided by Brexit and is still to find its post-industrial identity, we need to jettison the idea of universities as the dreaming spires to which a lucky few can find their way. This means dismantling and transforming our ideas about what education is and who it is for.The beginnings of a new educational politics are visible in places like Lincoln and Leicester what is needed among researchers and policymakers is the courage to respond collectively to foster and deepen these ideas. If education is to be transformational and to play a role in the economic, social and regional redistribution our country needs, then those who work in universities have to question what our collective role is and what we want it to be. And the answer has to be bigger than widening access to Oxford and Cambridge.• Sol Gamsu is a sociology lecturer at Durham University and a researcher on education and inequality•\u0026nbspThis article was amended on 3 January 2019, correcting the claim that Lincoln is the site of a project to set up a cooperative university with full degree-awarding powers "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b2ddb2b769f8c3f34184e0e18891ccbf7b0b72b/29_0_1050_630/master/1050.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b708ba23b1eae5c1fa340d98c67e31b4","title":"space race china change 4 us russia moon","story":"China’s achievement in landing a spacecraft on the far side of the moon, announced by Beijing’s state media this morning, has ramifications that go far beyond the simple statement of this being a “first” for mankind. It puts China on the map of international space exploration on a par with the existing space powers of the United States and Russia – the European Union to a lesser extent – but also adds a new dimension. It is the first time a landing has been attempted on the far side of the moon, with the particular communications challenges this entails, and it has been a success.The first response from the US space agency, Nasa, was generous, as scientists to scientists: what China had managed was a “first for humanity and an impressive accomplishment”. The response in political and military quarters in Washington, as in Moscow, however, is likely to reflect trepidation. There is now a serious newcomer to be considered.China was late into space, sending its first astronaut into orbit in 2003 – 40 years after the Soviet Union and the US were embarking on their space race. Now Beijing has done something neither of the other two space powers has done – that may well be because they had other priorities for their space programmes, such as manned flight, human survival in space and the fascination with distant planets, first of all Mars. After Neil Armstrong became the first human to walk on the moon – a US triumph that provided some consolation for the shock that a Russian, Yuri Gagarin, became the first man to go into space – there was a sense that the moon had been “done”. Greater challenges awaited. Will that change now, and could the moon become a potentially contested territory?At a popular level, space has not lost its power to fascinate. The proximity of the moon and the mystery of its far side guarantee that China’s latest mission will command global attention beyond the scientific space fraternity. It will enhance China’s international standing, and could well inspire an interest in China and space among young people, as the US-Russia space race once did.The mix of admiration and anxiety that accompanied early Soviet space successes helped prompt the government of the then UK prime minister Harold Wilson to encourage (and fund) Russian teaching in the country’s schools and universities – and is one reason why I, and other Britons of my generation, had the opportunity to study Russian. Today the challenge, the excitement, and to some the perceived threat comes from a rising China – and now not just on planet Earth.An open question is how far China will be welcomed – or not – into the existing space “club”. After the no-holds-barred space rivalry of the US and the Soviet Union that constituted a part of the cold war, the US and Russia have settled into a more collaborative relationship in space that has largely withstood the worst of diplomatic tensions. The US suspended its space shuttle programme in 2011, but it has continued to send astronauts into space using Russian rockets, and the International Space Station has remained in use as a shared venture. Diplomatic expulsions, accusations of election interference and terrestrial disputes most recently over Ukraine and Syria have not affected cooperation in pursuit of national scientific and security interests in space. Space has remained a sanctions-free zone.It has taken more than half a century for US-Russia space cooperation to reach this point of relative equanimity, but the arrival of China as a serious player – graphically illustrated by its latest success – has the potential to disturb this. Will Russia, for instance, see China, with its recent successes and innovations, as a future partner in space or a deadly rival? The US – through its long-Sinophobic Congress – seems already to have made up its mind. Not only is it increasingly treating China as an economic and military competitor, but President Donald Trump recently ordered the creation of a new Space Command for the US armed services, suggesting the direction of his thinking here, too.So far, China’s precise ambitions for its space programme remain unclear. Establishing itself as a space power is surely one – but is it as a space power, or the space power? The equipment it has now sent to the moon suggests that communications and new natural resources are priorities. How far will the US, in particular, be prepared to watch and wait while Beijing potentially races ahead in these sensitive areas?

Artist and designer Yinka Ilori goes in search of galleries, boutiques and hip hangoutsAmsterdam’s always been one of these places friends keep telling me is amazing, while I’ve just nodded and gone: “Yeah, I’ll go there someday.” So it was about time I did. Getting there by Eurostar, without the faff of going to the airport, taking off your jacket and dealing with security makes all the difference. I constantly get inspired by things when I go away, and I’m always bringing back loads of stuff, from trainers to magazines, food and drink, so I love not being hampered by airlines’ weight restrictions. This time, though, I didn’t actually buy that much – I was too busy checking out some incredible places. Here’s my pick of where to go.Be a culture vultureI love photography, and so, it seems, does Amsterdam there are certainly plenty of places that focus on it. Don’t miss Foam, on Keizersgracht. It’s only a small gallery, but it has an impressive collection of work, built up since its opening in 2002, including images by international photographers such as Noémie Goudal, American artist Daniel Gordon, Dutch photographer Viviane Sassen and – a favourite of mine – Brit Juno Calypso. There’s such a good mix of work: black and white, colour, different themes and formats.You almost don’t need to go inside modern art museum Stedelijk its newest wing, unveiled in 2012, looks like a sculpture in itself (or a bathtub, according to some locals). It’s an impressively big, white structure that contrasts with the original, 19th-century building it’s attached to. Venture inside and you’ll find art, design and photography from a lot of people I admire, including Keith Haring, and Arthur Jafa, who’s worked on videos for Jay-Z and Beyonce.Art in the red light district? It exists W139 is an artist-run space on Warmoesstraat. Back when it launched in 1979, you could find anything from painting to spoken-word performances or punk rock, and it’s still got a fairly anarchic vibe today.Wine and dine, Amsterdam styleAmsterdam’s foodie scene isn’t only about great meals there are some awesome interiors too. I really appreciate good bar and restaurant design – it creates an atmosphere of its own, and none more so than at Café-Restaurant de Plantage, a gorgeous greenhouse-like structure in the middle of the city’s beautiful botanic gardens I could see flamingos strutting around outside from my table. The food’s mainly Mediterranean – think handmade ravioli stuffed with fennel sausage, or Spanish fish soup. It’s rightly jammed, and the service is fab and friendly, without being fawning.For a similar feel, try the jade-green-hued Bar Botanique, in the Eastern Docklands, which is hung with plants and bamboo trees, and serves a mighty fine negroni. The Kanarie Club on Bellamyplein is an old tram depot – you can still see tram tracks on the floor – and its vast, industrial space is softened with ropes of lights, and vibrantly painted steel beams. Upstairs, by the bar, is an empty swimming pool, which is a bit bonkers. But I found the way they’ve used the space inspirational it used to be derelict, and home to squatters – but the way they’ve given it a new lease of life echoes what I do, upcycling furniture. Also, they do the best burger I’ve ever had.I was really taken with the ethos of A Beautiful Mess, located a little outside the centre in a former prison. All the food is made by refugees from places such as Afghanistan, Somalia and Syria, and the experience they gain in the kitchen here paves the way to viable careers in hospitality. You’ll get everything from Lebanese flatbreads to chapatis and curry. Also, the interiors are very colourful – which always earns extra points from me.Round off your night with a visit to Hiding in Plain Sight (if you can find it). It’s undercover, like a speakeasy, with a louche feel. The barmen are great, and it feels like a locals’ place a really secret address.Explore new neighbourhoodsYou could spend a whole morning or afternoon checking out the NDSM district, reached by a ferry from near the train station. Formerly home to Amsterdam’s shipyards, it’s been transformed into a buzzing cultural hotspot with bars, cafes and pop-up shops. The IJ-Kantine bar and restaurant is located in the building that once housed the shipyard offices and workers’ canteen, and PLLEK, another hangout on the waterfront, is made out of shipping containers.There’s even a hotel in a crane the Faralda Crane Hotel has three plush suites inside, and you can bungee jump off it, too (I didn’t). This district is one of those places where you can just wander around for ages soaking up the atmosphere, gazing at the street art, having a beer and people-watching for hours. It’s no surprise that festivals and outdoor performances are regularly held here, and once a month there’s a massive flea market.Back over the water, I loved cycling round the charming neighbourhood of Jordaan, to the north-west of the city centre. It’s got a lot of history, including the Anne Frank Museum, and all the culture, food and shopping you could want. Lose yourself in the Nine Streets, a little network of passageways between the canals, crammed with independent homeware, fashion and interiors boutiques, but don’t leave without making a pilgrimage to Winkel 43. Why? Quite simply, it does the best apple pie you’ll ever eat. I had one slice there, and bought another to take home, it was that good.On my return Eurostar to London, I make the most of the journey. Getting inspiration down on paper while it’s fresh is important for my work, so, wherever I go, I’m always drawing and working. When you travel by plane, the lack of space can make that quite stressful, so being able to plug my phone and laptop in – with enough room to work properly – really was the icing on the cake – or perhaps the sugar on the Oliebollen, if we’re being Dutch about it.Getting thereEurostar has a twice-daily direct service from London St Pancras to Rotterdam and Amsterdam Centraal, with prices starting from £35 one way. On the return journey, passengers will need to take a Thalys train from Rotterdam or Amsterdam to Brussels-Midi for security checks, before boarding the Eurostar to London.

Here are the best wraps, salads, sushi and moreFrom Spam Appreciation Week in March to June’s National Fudge Day and Sourdough September, every day of the year seems to have an (often baffling) link to a foodstuff. On the  food desk, we take this with a pinch of salt – and not just on National Salt Awareness Week (from 29 February) – lest your year in recipes and food articles becomes subsumed by commercial partnerships.But Veganuary, the movement encouraging us to try cutting out animal protein and produce for the first month of the year (in the hope that we’ll keep it up), feels a bit less silly. If adopted by enough people, veganism presents a viable way to offset environmental damage. It hit the mainstream in 2018, with conscious cooks and eaters embracing meat, fish, dairy and egg alternatives – from jackfruit to pulses – in their thousands. The Vegan Society says the UK’s vegan contingent has grown fourfold in just four years, from 150,000 in 2014 to over 600,000 now, while last year Waitrose became the first supermarket to have a dedicated vegan section in 134 of its stores.Going vegan does, however, demand a level of organisation and planning – and Veganuary is no exception. Where can you buy cashew cheese? What are the non-vegan ingredients everyone forgets about? Who writes the best (and easiest) vegan recipes? And, if you aren’t cooking and need a speedy feed al desko, where can you find the best vegan lunch to go? To answer that last question, I ate a dozen lunches from outlets near the office, and here’s what I found …It may be hard to balls up a hummus wrap, but I do think this one is pretty good for the price – it hits the spot, ranking low on imagination, but higher on palatability. The vegan chilli is very good – in spite of my objection to the side-soup format (taking more than half the price of the full-size option from customers for what seems like less than half the volume), and despite my hankering for an unvegan dollop of sour cream on top of it.45Sushi has an unfair advantage over other lunch options: douse with enough soy sauce, wasabi and ginger, and it always tastes good. This is as true of the vegan stuff as it is of fish, so I enjoyed this spread of rice, seaweed, vegetable and tofu concoctions, in spite of the whole premise of “takeaway sushi” somehow seeming wrong (given it is traditionally defined by the care, attention and precision with which it is made).45A paltry boxful of autumn and winter hues, this is tasty, but not one for the hungry. It has four components, of which the kale and lentil salad is the high point. The curried squash is nice, the hummus fine (you can’t go wrong), but there are two dried-up falafel-brown orbs of vegetal dust. I’m generally very keen on Leon’s vegan offering, but this isn’t their strongest option.35Soft tacos need to be heated to stop them falling apart. These had a split second on the grill before being loaded with a dead weight of loveless roasted veg and guacamole, and seasoned with bitter disappointment (but no salt). At £6.30, this is at the dearer end of the spectrum, and that’s not including the (vegan) cereal bar I had to buy afterwards to cheer myself up.15A generous box of orzo in tomato sauce, peppered with tired roasted veg and some arbitrary spinach leaves. This comes with an abundance of very sweet dressing which imparts flavour to something that would otherwise be bland – but it’s far too sugary. I sense the boxed pasta salad might have had its time there’s something outdated about this – which perhaps says all you need to know about Eat, really.15So good. Leon manages to make its vegan boxes delicious and desirable in their own right – quite a feat. These beans, seasoned with hot smoked sweet paprika (the spice used in chorizo) have a “meatiness” and are served over brown rice for a result that is wholesome, filling and satisfying. For the price, you won’t find a better vegan feed.55A better Mexican than Benito’s Hat, ticking the vital boxes that lunch should tick: tasty, sustaining and affordable. The wheat tortilla is made of pumpkin, which, though doughy, has a little more chutzpah on the taste front than wheat wraps usually do. Filled with black bean paste, cumin roasted butternut squash, chipotle salsa, spinach and coriander, it tastes freshly made and has plenty of flavour. Might be interesting to try the filling with a corn tortilla, though, for something gluten-free as well as vegan.45Has the visual appeal of a molehill, but is better in the mouth. The red lentil hummus needs seasoning, but I like the fact that this is filling and has lots of different textures, colours and flavours to keep me interested. I’m disappointed by the packaging, which I’d expect to feel a little more sustainable.35I had to have some jackfruit at some point – it was the darling ingredient for vegans in 2018, and is said to be a plant-based answer to pulled pork. I thought this was delicious, but it needed the addition of zingy guacamole and crunchy coleslaw at the till – to accompany the sweetness of sweet potato mash and the spicy jackfruit curry. The ingredients are, however, largely cheap, so I would say this is £1 too expensive.45I like the M\u0026ampS two-for-£4 deal – a bargain. I’m less impressed by the packaging – which not only sounds my eco alarm bells, but makes the food look so much less appealing. The Thai flavours in the salad (ginger and soy) are quite simply delicious, while the “meh” Mexican rice (I have decided all Mexican lunches need to come with extra lime for some zing) at least offers up the bulk I need. I was surprised not more of M\u0026ampS’s options were vegan they could do with a couple more.45I’m a big fan of Gail’s and this feels fresh, hearty and good for me, with lashings of roasted cabbage and pecan pesto dressing. I think it’s a bit underseasoned and could do with a more generous dollop of the pesto, on which it relies for its character. Were it not a vegan number, they would probably have thrown some crumbled feta over, but given the plant-based straitjacket, they need to make up for the flavour deficit.45We eat with our eyes as well as our palates, and I find it difficult to see past this bowlful’s lack of visual appeal, with its limp assembly of veg and herbs – another example of plastic packaging really not helping the dish out. But it’s worth doffing our caps to Tesco for having a relatively extensive line of affordable vegan lunch options, created for them by Wicked Kitchen. My rainbow curry bowl is full of flavour, with curried lentils and chickpeas, (slightly soggy) onion bhajis, mango cubes and minty dressing – but I wouldn’t go so far as to say the simply roasted sweet potato is “tandoori style”.25"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ad509f259d6d437a02cef0a94ab6c9833ea0411/14_189_2793_1676/master/2793.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c9da065c1acb2b81ebc4ac478580b8f0","title":"craig bellamy cardiff steps down pending investigation","story":"Craig Bellamy says he has stepped down from his role as Cardiff City Under-18s coach as the club investigates alleged bullying. The former Wales forward has “categorically” denied the claim and vowed to clear his name in a statement released on Thursday morning.Earlier this week, it was reported that the parents of a young English footballer have complained to the Premier League club about Bellamy’s behaviour towards their son, who has since left the club.“I am aware of allegations that have been made against me via the media,” he wrote. “I understand the need for Cardiff City to undertake a full investigation in response to these allegations and – at my own suggestion – I have temporarily removed myself from my coaching position in order to cooperate fully with the club’s inquiry.“Obviously, I am saddened both by the allegations and the manner in which they were made and I categorically refute them. I fully expect to return to my coaching role and have sought legal advice as to my position. I will be making no further comment until the full investigation by the club has concluded.”The former Wales captain Bellamy, who won 78 caps for his country and counted Liverpool, Manchester City and Newcastle among his clubs, was appointed as Cardiff’s player development manager in 2016. At the time, the club’s chief executive, Ken Choo, said: “It’s felt that having somebody of Craig’s stature in this role can be of huge significance to us moving forward. We hope that our younger players will see Craig as a role model, somebody who’s playing career they want to emulate.”A regular pundit on Sky Sports, Bellamy scored 19 goals in 78 games for Wales and also had successful club stints with Liverpool, Manchester City and Newcastle.

A subtle operator among the standout performers who generates few headlines and even fewer accolades. But the fans love him, as does the manager, because they know without him there would be no success, no glory, no shiny silver trophy in the middle of May.It is too early to decide who that figure is in Liverpool’s current side, mainly because it is too early to say for sure that Liverpool are going to win the title. But ahead of Thursday’s potentially pivotal game against Manchester City there is, it feels, a standout candidate. He has featured in all but one of the leaders’ league fixtures this season and been central, literally as well as figuratively, to everything that has gone right for Jürgen Klopp’s side. Yet praise has not come his way, certainly not compared to that which has been received by many others in red. He is the near-invisible man in English football’s most striking team right now and his name is Georginio Wijnaldum.Put simply, without Wijnaldum there would be no unbeaten run, no string of clean sheets and no stream of goals for the current pace-setters. He more than anyone has stitched together Liverpool’s excellent defence with their excellent attack and is a certainty to face City in the Merseyside club’s biggest game since May’s Champions League final. Klopp confirmed as much by substituting the Dutchman with 12 minutes of Saturday’s 5-1 victory over Arsenal remaining. It was a clear case of “rest up for Thursday, Gini” after yet another superb display from Liverpool’s No 5, and as he departed from the pitch there came a standing ovation from the home crowd, followed by a blast of the Wijnaldum song. They’ve been singing it for some time at Anfield.It has not been easy for Wijnaldum since he joined Liverpool from Newcastle for £25m in July 2016. Indeed, there was a level of scepticism to his very arrival given the player’s generally underwhelming displays for a Newcastle team that were relegated during his one season on Tyneside. He scored 11 goals in 38 league appearances, an average total for an international attacking midfielder, and particularly so given all of those goals came at home, with four arriving in one game – against Norwich.But that did not deter Klopp, primarily because he recognised there was more to Wijnaldum than meets the eye. “He can play a few positions and players that come through the Dutch system usually have a good tactical understanding,” he said upon acquiring the player, and increasingly the 28-year-old has vindicated his manager’s belief in what he can provide the team.Under Klopp, Wijnaldum has operated in both a two-man and three-man midfield, most often as a playmaker but also, on occasion, in a purely defensive role. The emphasis has shifted from scoring goals to providing and preventing them as required in a system underpinned by hard-running and aggressive counterpressing. It’s a lot to take in and, understandably, Wijnaldum initially struggled to adapt. But as his displays this season have shown, Klopp was right to believe that the man who captained PSV Eindhoven to the Ereisie title in 2015 had the required aggression, stamina, work-rate, discipline, assurance in possession and all-round football intelligence to do so.Wijnaldum has completed 90 minutes for Liverpool on 18 occasions this season, including five of their six Champions League games. The only league game he has not been involved in was the 3-1 victory over Burnley last month and that was as part of a host of changes made by Klopp in order to keep his key men as fresh as possible. Practically ever present, the Netherlands international is also Liverpool’s best midfield performer in a number of notable areas, including most completed passes (906) and most completed dribbles (12 out of 19), showing his ability to not only keep Liverpool’s attacking momentum’s ticking over but also drive it forward.“Gini can switch from one mindset to the other and that is pretty good for us,” said Klopp of the player in August before going onto describe him as “outstanding” in the win over Arsenal, Liverpool’s eighth in succession in all competitions. He certainly was and what makes Wijnaldum’s form throughout the season especially noteworthy is he came into it with his place in the side under threat following the summer arrivals of Naby Keïta and Fabinho. His game-time and influence on Liverpool was meant to reduce but instead it has grown to the point where he is the most reliable, consistent and versatile midfielder for the team leading the way.And now for City. Wijnaldum will almost certainly find himself operating in a three-man midfield and tasked with putting pressure on those in blue when they have the ball – specifically the two Silvas, David and Bernardo – and then, when possession is overturned, getting Liverpool’s front three on the front foot as quickly as possible. Disrupt, distribute, run and rotate instructions Wijnaldum has been following to a tee for some months now. About time more people noticed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d272b80e3d728e8f8989318fc012fee6831ed98d/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa9ab1115183e9065c612528052d4c44","title":"what would you like us to cover in 2019 share your thoughts","story":"We want to know what you hope to make space for next year and what you would like to see us cover Last year we published a piece detailing readers’ hopes for 2018’s  coverage, from continuing the fight against fossil fuel disinvestment to “making space for all things vegan”.We now want to hear what you would like us to report on in 2019.

The brand’s recent Redux Grunge collection features several items that resemble the Seattle grunge band’s black-and-yellow iconography, Forbes reports.Representatives for the group, which split in 1994 following the death of frontman Kurt Cobain, claim that Marc Jacobs’ unauthorised use of “Nirvana’s copyrighted image on and to promote its products is intentional”. The suit claims that the use of Nirvana’s iconography, which the group has used since 1992, is to “make the ‘Grunge’ association with the collection more authentic”. has contacted representatives for Nirvana and Marc Jacobs.The suit also cites the use of Nirvana references in Marc Jacobs marketing materials, including a meme posted to the brand’s Tumblr account featuring a clip of the group’s 1991 hit, Smells Like Teen Spirit, and an image of Jacobs wearing a T-shirt above the words Come As You Are, the title of a 1992 hit by the trio.The suit describes Marc Jacobs’ actions as “oppressive, fraudulent and malicious” and claims that they “have caused Nirvana to suffer irreparable injuries” and “threaten to dilute the value of Nirvana’s licenses with its licensees for clothing products”.The department stores Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus are also included in the suit for selling the items that allegedly infringe the band’s copyright. The group is seeking monetary damages, the removal of sale of any such items and the removal of Nirvana references from promotional materials.Nirvana’s iconography is subject to regular bootlegging: the hoodies found on market stalls worldwide are seldom licensed items. The group would be unlikely to pursue these vendors because of the low possibility of recovering significant damages, says Alexander Ross, a partner at music lawyers Wiggins LLP.“Suing a major brand for alleged infringement, however, makes more sense from a financial perspective, and for PR and scale purposes, assuming of course that the action is successful,” says Ross. “It also sends a message to other players in the fashion industry that the IP in question is jealously guarded against infringement.”In 1992, at the height of Nirvana’s fame, Marc Jacobs was fired from designer Perry Ellis after showing his infamous grunge collection, which mixed plaid, silk and skull caps. “Grunge is anathema to fashion,” said American fashion critic Cathy Horyn. Jacobs started his own line a year later, launching his debut collection in 1994.The Nirvana suit is the latest controversy to hit the designer. “The label is turning out clothes and accessories that lack a compelling point of view, failing to generate the excitement created by younger peers Alexander Wang and Joseph Altuzarra,” New York Times reporter Steven Kurutz wrote in June. Kurutz cited luxury goods research by Exane BNP Paribas that estimated the brand had been losing more than £45m annually over the past few years.By contrast, the value of band merchandise continues to grow, becoming increasingly important to artists’ revenue streams following the decline of physical media and the impact of streaming on the market.Partnerships between bands and fashion houses have proven lucrative, such as Canadian rapper Drake’s collaboration with winter wear brand Canada Goose. Official artist merchandise can attain the status of high fashion, a charge led by the designs produced for Kanye West’s tour in support of his 2013 album Yeezus.The market for vintage band T-shirts is also booming. In 2011, an anonymous Australian buyer spent $10,000 on a Led Zeppelin T-shirt from the group’s 1979 gig at Knebworth."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22b2808c2c88b1b78a6aaba538108350bc7fbfed/488_29_1772_1063/master/1772.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e6cfa9f09d1f978cbe724684fc5f6f4c","title":"why exercise alone wont save us","story":"Sedentary lifestyles are killing us – we need to build activity into our everyday lives, not just leave it for the gym. By  Vybarr Cregan-ReidThis is the time of year when trainers are mined from under beds and gym kits are disinterred from the bottom drawer. Google searches relating to physical fitness peak in January. Many people even trawl the web to find out about “desk exercises” and “workouts on the go” in case they are too busy to use their new gym memberships.Our relationship with exercise is complicated. Reports from the UK and the US show it is something we persistently struggle with. As the new year rolls around, we anticipate having the drive to behave differently and become regular exercisers, even in the knowledge that we will probably fail to do so. Why do we want to exercise? What do we expect it to do for us? We all know we are supposed to be exercising, but hundreds of millions of us can’t face actually doing it. It is just possible the problem lies at the heart of the idea of exercise itself.Exercise is movement of the muscles and limbs for a specific outcome, usually to enhance physical fitness. As such, for most of us, it is an optional addition to the working day – yet another item on a long list of responsibilities alongside the fulfilment of parental duties or earning money to put food on the table. But because the principal beneficiary of exercise is ourselves, it is one of the easiest chores to shirk. At the end of the working day, millions of us prefer to indulge in sedentary leisure activities instead of what we all think is good for us: a workout. Fitness crazes are like diets: if any of them worked, there wouldn’t be so many. CrossFit, the intensely physical, communal workout incorporating free weights, squats, pull-ups and so forth, is still less than 20 years old. Spin classes – vigorous group workouts on stationary bikes – have only been around for about 30. Aerobics was a craze about a decade before that, although many of its high-energy routines had already been around for a while. (The pastel horror of 1970s Jazzercise is probably best forgotten.) Before that, there was the jogging revolution, which began in the US in the early 1960s. The Joggers Manual, published in 1963 by the Oregon Heart Foundation, was a leaflet of about 200 words that sought to address the postwar panic about sedentary lifestyles by encouraging an accessible form of physical activity, explaining that “jogging is a bit more than a walk”. The jogging boom took a few years to get traction, hitting its stride in the mid- to late-80s, but it remains one of the most popular forms of exercise, now also in groups.The exercise craze that dominated the 1950s was, oddly, not even an exercise. The vibrating exercise belt promised users could achieve effortless weight loss by having their midriffs violently jiggled. It didn’t work, but you can still find similar machines available for purchase today.These fads even came with their own particular fashions – legwarmers, leotards, Lycra. So is our obsession with fitness doomed to be the stuff of embarrassing passing “phases”? Is exercise itself a fad?It is not news that we are becoming more sedentary as a species. The problem has been creeping up on us for generations. As industry and technology solved the physical demands of manual labour, they created new challenges for the human body.Evidence about bone strength and density gleaned from fossils of early humans suggests that, for hundreds of thousands of years, normal levels of movement were much higher than ours today. And the range of work required of the human body to subsist was sizeable: everything from foraging for food and finding water to hunting, constructing basic shelters, manufacturing tools and evading predators. The fossil record tells us that many prehistoric humans were stronger and fitter than today’s Olympians.A hundred years ago, while life was easier than it had been for our hunter-gatherer forebears, it was still required that shopping was fetched, floors scrubbed, wood chopped and washing done by hand. Modern urban environments do not invite anything like the same kinds of work from the body. It is not easy to clock up those miles when cities are built to prioritise cars and treat pedestrians as secondary. We are not assisted by our environments to move like we used to, for reasons tied up with motivation, safety and accessibility.Technological innovations have led to countless minor reductions of movement. To clean a rug in the 1940s, most people took it into their yard and whacked the bejeezus out of it for 20 minutes. Fast-forward a few decades and we can set robot vacuum cleaners to wander about our living rooms as we order up some shopping to be delivered, put on the dishwasher, cram a load into the washer-dryer, admire the self-cleaning oven, stack some machine-cut logs in the grate, pour a glass of milk from the frost-free fridge or thumb a capsule into the coffee maker. Each of these devices and behaviours is making it a bit more difficult for us to keep moving regularly throughout our day.As we step through various innovations, we tend to think of the work that is no longer required as “saved”. Cleaning a rug once burned about 200 calories, while activating a robo-vac uses about 0.2 – an activity drop of a thousandfold, with nothing to replace it. Nobody, when they buy a labour-saving device, thinks: “How am I going to replace that movement I have saved?”As a result of our leisurely lifestyles, our bones are thinner and our muscles weaker, and while these are not problems in themselves, they are part of the larger, fleshier story whereby the diminution of movement is shackling humans to the very biggest global killers. Heart disease and strokes are responsible for about 17 million deaths a year, according to the World Health Organization.All-day activity trackers like the Apple Watch and the Fitbit (which is only a decade old this year) have attempted to make an intervention into this sandpit of sedentariness. Widespread use of wearables may be helping people to move more, but technology created this problem of sedentary work and leisure, and cannot solve it alone.Exercise, in these terms, is not a fad, or an option, or an add-on to our busy lifestyles: it is keeping us alive. But before it can work for us, our whole approach needs to change.As a result of the Miracle Cure report, doctors were urged to promote regular exercise among their patients. Humans obviously need regular activity, but the modern world strives to take exertion out of our lives. Modernity is characterised by imperatives to simplify, improve and maximise efficiency. In much the same way, medical bodies trying to motivate the population to exercise promise big results with the absolute minimum of disruption to our busy, seated lives.Anyone researching exercise strategies this new year will find that the government recommends “at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity such as cycling or brisk walking every week and strength exercises on 2 or more days a week that work all the major muscles (legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders and arms)”.If 150 minutes – or half an hour five times a week – is too much for you, and the data suggests that for most of us it is, another public health strategy promotes the efficacy of being active for just 10 minutes a day. Public Health England launched its Active10 campaign on the grounds that just 10 minutes’ brisk walking each day “counts as exercise” and “can reduce your risk of serious illnesses like heart disease, type 2 diabetes, dementia and some cancers”.Even less time is required for high-intensity interval training (HIIT), which can involve bouts of just 20 seconds of intense effort a few times a week. It seems there is good evidence for the efficacy of very short bursts of strenuous anaerobic exercise, such as sprinting or cycling hard, followed by a brief recovery period. Interval training may improve insulin sensitivity and oxygen circulation, and increase muscle mass. But one of the early researchers into HIIT, kinesiologist Dr Martin Gibala, worried that despite its benefits, it required “an extremely high level of subject motivation”, because all-out exertion is unpleasant and can lead to dizziness, vomiting or injury. “Given the extreme nature of the exercise,” he wrote, “it is doubtful that the general population could safely or practically adopt the model.”While all of these three modes of exercise are effective in different ways, and each has its proponents and committed followers, none is an all-round solution for a “fit” human body. But the problem is not really with the exercises themselves it is what we tend to do in between those bursts of activity.The health effects of being sedentary are as common and recognisable as they are serious. Anxiety, depression, heart disease, breast and colon cancer, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity, osteoporosis, osteoarthritis and the leading cause of global disability, back pain, are all driven by sedentary behaviours.For our bodies to function properly, they operate on the assumption that we will be burning calories throughout the day, and not in short bursts. It is clear that periods of sedentariness are bad for the human body, and some exercise is always going to be better than none the issue is not really to do with the types of exercise, but with our approach to them and what we expect them to achieve. We know from the data that the human relationship with exercise is predominantly characterised as both optional and additional to an otherwise sedentary life, which itself causes a ton of problems. As long as physical activity is orced from the real work of our lives, we will find reasons for not doing it.The rise of exercise is synonymous with the rise of leisure. We associate this with the start of the Industrial Revolution, but in fact it dates from much earlier. Once humans settled and began to build, several thousand years ago, hierarchies began to form, particularly in cities, as did the gap between master and servant. To be one of the elite meant others were doing the physical work for you. For the masters, there was time to fill, and into this space grew the idea of leisure. Exercise also emerges here, in the imbalance created in the spread of labour performed across a population. Ever since, we have seen a powerful link between exercise and inequality.The wealthy men of ancient Greece, deprived of work by their slaves and with little else to do, invented a new place called the gymnasium, an open space in the city where they could strip off and gambol about naked, competing in made-up challenges to keep each other fit for war.Later, the Romans also celebrated the value of exercise. Cicero, the Roman politician and lawyer, said: “It is exercise alone that supports the spirits and keeps the mind in vigour.” Pliny the Younger, a writer and also a lawyer, said: “It is remarkable how one’s wits are sharpened by physical exercise.” Like their Greek gym buddies, these men were privileged and wealthy. They understood that even though the slave class did their work for them, exercise and physical activity were essential for a long and sane life.After the Greeks and Romans, exercise all but disappeared from western culture. It didn’t resurface properly until the 18th century, when inactivity became a problem for a certain class of gentleman. In 1797, the Monthly Magazine announced a new patent for Francis Lowndes’ Gymnasticon, the earliest of the static exercise machines – a frame in which the user sat, turning a spindle with his arms and operating a treadle with his feet. The article noted that “when peculiar or sedentary occupations enforce confinement to the house, it promises to be equally useful to the healthy as to the sick. The merchant, without withdrawing his attention from his accounts, and the student, while occupied in writing or reading, may have his lower limbs kept in constant motion by the slightest exertion, or, the assistance of a child.” The handle on the contraption’s lower spindle was arranged so that, if desired, a child could be employed to turn the wheel, to save the user valuable energy.In the early 20th century, calisthenics became popular among people with limited means of expending physical energy. In the opening pages of EM Forster’s Howards End, from 1910, we are introduced to the Wilcox family as they come and go in their country-house garden. They are “new money” they see the world instrumentally, and are mostly allergic to it, too. A visitor reports the scene in a letter: “Then Evie comes out, and does some calisthenic exercises on a machine that is tacked on to a greengage tree – they put everything to use – and then she says ‘a-tissue,’ and in she goes.” Like inactivity, hay fever only seemed to afflict those higher up the social scale.In 1831 the Journal of Health defined calisthenics as “a reasonable, methodical, and regular employment of the exercises best calculated to develop the physical powers of young girls, without detriment to the perfecting of the moral faculties”. Its adoption was necessary because “young girls have not the same freedom as boys in their outdoor exercise, and their customary amusements and occupations, when not at school, are of a more sedentary nature”.Since our modern way of life denies many of us the physical exertion that kept our ancestors healthy, one way to gain social capital is to add it back in.Any kind of communal exercise gives us a sense of belonging, of shared values and endeavours, aside even from its more general physical and mental benefits. When people gather together in a gym or in an exercise class, at least one aspect of what they are doing is joining together in a civic activity that ensures their collective survival, just like the ancient Greeks before them.If being fit promotes long life, you might expect being an elite athlete to help you reach a ripe old age. It doesn’t. Olympians buy themselves an extra 2.8 years on average, according to a 2012 study. Devoting your life to sport and exercise will buy you more time, but once you factor in the Olympians’ lifelong sustained attention to diet and healthy living, as well as tens of thousands of hours spent training, 2.8 years might not really seem sufficient recompense.Instead, the fittest and healthiest people on the planet have never been to a gym. These people, who report high levels of wellbeing and live extraordinarily long lives, inhabit what have been called “blue zones” – areas where lifestyles lead to peculiar longevity. The term was coined by two demographers, Gianni Pes and Michel Poulain, who, while collecting data on clusters of centenarians on the island of Sardinia, identified places of especially high longevity on their map with a blue felt-tip pen. Because clusters of long-lived people are often found in geographically remote places (also including parts of Okinawa, Costa Rica and Greece), jackpot genes seem like a strong candidate to explain their longevity. But a famous study of Danish twins has concluded that a long life seems to be only “moderately heritable”. Over the years, many studies have looked at the lifestyles of people in “blue zones” and found that a number of their customs and habits contribute to a long life (everything from a sense of belonging and purpose to not smoking, or eating a predominantly plant-based diet). In the list of contributory factors, there is a noticeable absence of exercise.In my conversation with Pes, he repeatedly stressed that while diet and environment are important components of longevity, being sedentary is the enemy, and sustained, low-level activity is the key that research by him and others has uncovered: not the intense kinds of activity we tend to associate with exercise, but energy expended throughout the day. The supercentenarians he has worked with all walked several miles each day throughout their working lives. They never spent much time, if any, seated at desks.Pes has recently been studying workers in one of the island’s regions of longevity, Seulo (population around 1,000). He discovered one group of women who had spent their working lives seated, but nonetheless reached a great age. They had been working treadles (pedal-powered sewing machines), which meant they had regularly burned sufficient calories to derive the longevity benefits of remaining active. (Lowndes’ Gymnasticon, which works like a treadle, is starting to look a little less ridiculous as a solution for sedentary workers.)For all the trillions invested in healthcare year on year, there are regions in high-income nations (such as the UK and the US) where life expectancy is still as low as it was in the mid-60s. In Tower Hamlets, one of the poorer parts of London, men can only expect an average of 61 years of good health – and women just 56.So far, researchers agree that sustained periods of low-level activity seem to work well. Aiming for 10,000 steps a day is a good idea, but 15,000 better resembles the distances likely covered by our prehistoric ancestors, and indeed by those Sardinian centenarians.For those of us who can’t move to Sardinia and become a shepherd, a review published in the Lancet in 2016 found that “high levels of moderate-intensity physical activity (ie, about 60-75 min per day) seem to eliminate the increased risk of death associated with high sitting time”.So even if we go to the gym on a Saturday morning, our absolute inactivity at other times can still be damaging to the body. Low and moderate activity for longer or sustained periods seems to produce the best results. It looks like excessive high-intensity activity (the kind we see in elite athletes) drives metabolism and cell turnover, and may even, when all factors are taken into account, accelerate the ageing process.As those all-day activity trackers continue to mature into their second decade, they will no doubt find better ways of encouraging us out of our chairs. At the moment, though, they can only count the things we have done, not the opportunities for movement we have missed. They make us more likely to be attentive to our activity than our inactivity.After two centuries of trying, we should accept that exercise is not working as a global fitness strategy while it remains an addition to the working day. In the long view, it is starting to look a lot like a fad. Government guidelines in the UK and other countries that encourage sport and exercise are failing. These strategies struggle because we are trying to get people to give up what little leisure time they have to pursue activities that require substantial additional effort.Perhaps instead we should encourage people to make the kinds of daily decisions that result in a healthier life. What is needed are the kinds of strategies that would make exercise unnecessary. Urban planning that better addresses the outdoor experience and encourages movement would be a key part of this change. But on an inidual level, we can think about returning a little of the friction that technology has so subtly smoothed out for us, and make it easy to get things done. Exercise becomes physical activity when it is part of your daily life.A year ago, my car lease came up for renewal. I had been a driver for nearly 30 years, but after all the alarming research I had read about the impact of modern lifestyles, I could not possibly keep it. I now walk miles more than I used to. Without a car, getting to the gym involved a 70-minute round trip. By the time I had walked there and back, the workouts seemed less necessary, so I cancelled my membership.I tried other things, too. I experimented with a standing desk, but I knew from Pes’s research in Sardinia that it is not sitting itself that is bad, but the inactivity associated with it. Standing in one place for hours is only marginally better than sitting there. The Gymnasticon is also making a comeback. Its new incarnation is the treadmill desk, which seeks to keep office workers permanently on the move. From a health perspective it seems superb, but it is hardly practical. Getting a less comfortable office chair would probably be as effective a strategy, making it less easy to settle into for long periods of immobility.You don’t have to join a gym this year. The numbers tell us that exercise is not the solution to the problems associated with physical inactivity, for the simple reason that these two things are not opposites. The antidote is activity: to find and recover some of the movement that modern life has been taking from us for centuries.Vybarr Cregan-Reid is the author of Primate Change: How the World We Made Is Changing Us, which is available to buy at bookshop• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e0f0f60d130e8c0762d1e7f774567f040f0f01c/0_142_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d9ee9495722e3f0329c8970ccd0153d6","title":"brexit freight ferry firm appears all geared up to deliver pizzas","story":"Terms and conditions on Seaborne website seem to be intended for food companyFirst, it emerged that the “startup” company hired to operate extra ferries as part of no-deal Brexit planning had no ships.Now, new questions are being asked about the readiness of Seaborne Freight to handle the £13.8m contract after it turned out that terms and conditions on its website appeared to be intended for a food delivery firm.“It is the responsibility of the customer to thoroughly check the supplied goods before agreeing to pay for any mealorder,” read part of the text on the company’s website.Another section, which appeared to be constructed with a view more to mitigating against the impact of prank pizza orders than transporting goods across some of the world’s busiest shipping lanes, warned: “Users are prohibited from making false orders through our website.”“Seaborne Freight (UK) Limited reserves the right to seek compensation through legal action for any losses incurred as the result of hoax delivery requests and will prosecute to the full extent of the law,” it added.Among those criticising the company after the curious language on the terms and conditions was first pointed out by Twitter users was Labour’s deputy leader, Tom Watson, who said: “Seaborne Freight.

It would hit worst those who are our smaller farmers and farm businesses.”He said tariffs, border checks, potential delays for recognition of organic products and labour pressures would all add to costs for food producers.“Nobody can be blithe or blase about the real impacts on food producers in this country of leaving without the deal,” he told the Oxford Farming Conference.Gove said leaving the EU would rejuvenate the UK’s democracy and free the country from the “bureaucratic straightjacket” of Europe’s common agricultural policy. The UK would also “develop a more vibrant farming sector with access to technologies on which the EU is turning its back”, he said.“Leaving the EU will end support for inefficient area-based payments, which reward the wealthy and hold back innovation, and we can move to support genuine productivity enhancement and public goods like clean air, climate change mitigation or the improvement of soil, or water quality or improvements to pollinator habitats,” he said.Brexit also offered an opportunity to support organic farming, landscape restoration and improving public access, Gove said. “All of these are real gains that our departure from the EU can bring, but these real gains risk being undermined if we leave the EU without a deal.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33ef8293d390036efb913582bab1fe14a49702a6/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7bd6bff9b6d97e373633138718518c2","title":"publicity drive to prepare uk public for possible no deal brexit","story":"Whitehall departments and health regulator to publish guidance on potential impactWith less than three months until Britain is due to leave the EU, the government is launching a publicity drive to prepare the public for a possible no-deal Brexit.The Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, said Whitehall departments and the health regulator would begin publishing guidance on how the public can get ready for potential issues that may arise from a disorderly break from Europe.The public information campaign will also include radio broadcasts and social media posts.Barclay said no-deal would become “far more likely” if MPs reject Theresa May’s proposed Brexit deal in a vote in the Commons due the week beginning 14 January.“The pace and intensity of the work we are doing reflects the potential scale of this disruption to people and businesses across the UK that a no-deal scenario could bring,” Barclay wrote in the .“The Home Office will next week be publicising guidance on new passport rules for people travelling to many European countries.

Now he argues we are in a ‘golden age’ for older peopleRead inspiring stories of four of Carl Honoré’s ‘ageing heroes’Three years ago, Carl Honoré, the journalist whose series of books, starting with In Praise of Slow in 2004, has made him the guru of slow living, had an epiphany. Like a true Canadian, though one born in Scotland and domiciled in London, he adores ice hockey, and still plays hard and fast at the age of 51. But one day, at a tournament in Gateshead, someone pointed out that he was the oldest player among the 240 competitors. “I knew that I was one of the oldest, but being told in such raw terms that I was the oldest – it just shook me. It knocked me for six in a way that shocked me.”Honoré was 48 at the time, “the big 50” was looming, and what he calls “the terrible weight of the number” started dragging him down. Was ageing really going to be as bad as everyone said? Was all he had to look forward to now decline, decrepitude and death? On the train back to London, as his team-mates knocked back the beers, he decided to embark on a book on the subject.“I’ve found with all my books that they start with what is almost an out-of-body experience when I see myself in sharp relief from the side,” he tells me. “I needed to understand my own relationship with the number, with what ageing means, and where I was going to be in 10 or 20 years.” The result is B(older): Making the Most of Our Longer Lives – a call for society to become less ageist and for iniduals to stop worrying about the process of ageing and wring every drop out of whatever time is allotted to us.Honoré has travelled the world in search of active, high-achieving older people, but he stresses that he doesn’t want to hold the “outliers” up as the norm. He is more interested in a state of mind in which the average 70- and 80-year-old goes on working if they want to, volunteering, starting their own enterprises, playing competitive sport, having great sex – and society doesn’t bat an eye. It is ageist, he argues, to stop people being able to do those things but it’s also ageist to make a big deal of it. Still having sex at 80, still making TV programmes at 90, even running marathons at 100? Why shouldn’t they be?The conclusion Honoré came to, after three years of research and an examination of the way older people are treated around the world, was that it was in many ways a golden age for “the old” (a term he would never use): there were more of them, they were healthier, more active and many were better off than in previous generations. They could no longer be ignored or marginalised. But, in his view, that is just a beginning. “It can be so much better,” he says, “if we move a lot of goalposts and change the way everything from healthcare to politics to the business world to education is organised.” He argues that the idea of being educated between the ages of five and 21, working for 40 years and then retiring on a pension at 60 is completely out of date, imagining a much more fluid way of life where we dip in and out of education and the job market and never formally “retire”.I ask Honoré at what age we become “old”. He refuses to supply a number. “I use the word ‘older’ in a very elastic way,” he says. “The definition is so fluid, and to box people in and say: ‘This is old’ narrows horizons. What do we gain by saying: ‘This person is old’?” He believes ageism is lessening but remains endemic. In fact, he says that when he began the book he was one of its worst proponents. “When I was younger, I was so ageist. I had a dread of growing old. I had bought into that idea that you hit 35 and it’s just a downward spiral. I used to think of old people as just sad and cantankerous. But, if you look at the stats, the people with the highest levels of happiness and life satisfaction in Britain are the over-60s. That doesn’t take away from the fact that many people will be very unhappy, but the story we are told and that we tell ourselves is that everyone is unhappy. It’s always the worst-case scenario: that’s what we are contaminated by.”Honoré no longer frets about ageing. “My biggest worry was that I would end up in a gloomy place,” he says, “but, thankfully, the opposite is true – I feel so much more optimistic now than I did when I embarked on the book. We have created a culture where ageing is seen as a chamber of horrors. There is no chink of light in it. I suspected that was not true, and along the way I found it to be utterly untrue.”B(older): Making the Most of Our Longer Lives is published by Simon \u0026amp Schuster (£16.99)1. If you think of yourself as old, you will be old. The media will bang on about dementia and loneliness, but ignore them. Concentrate on the upside.2. Take yourself out of your comfort zone. Resist being pigeonholed keep experimenting challenge yourself and society’s stereotyping of you.3. Try to stay healthy. Eat well and take lots of exercise – it’s good for brain and body. Exercise doesn’t have to mean playing competitive ice hockey the odd brisk walk will keep you in shape.4. Look for positive role models. Helen Mirren, David Attenborough and, best of all, Michelangelo, who lived until the ripe old age (in 16th-century terms) of 88 and spent the final 20 years of his life designing and overseeing the construction of St Peter’s Basilica in Rome. Now that’s a way to go out.5. Seek to become the person you always wanted to be. One reason many people are at their happiest in their 60s is that they feel freer and less beholden to others. They contain all their previous selves and can start to make sense of them.6. Don’t just maintain social connections with your own age group: mix across the generations as much as you can. Inter-generational contact has become increasingly difficult, but if we can do it we benefit – and society benefits.7. Be willing to let stuff go. If that friendship isn’t working, drop it. Streamline your life. There is less time left, so make it count.8. Ageing should be a process of opening rather than closing doors. “We will lose some things – speed, stamina, a bit of mental agility – but in many other respects we gain,” says Honoré. We learn new skills, have greater social awareness, are likely to be more altruistic, are “lighter” in our approach to life – because we are less hung up on creating a good impression – and can see the bigger picture. It may be that we are in a position to make a greater contribution to society in our 60s and 70s than in our so-called prime.9. Honesty is the best policy. Don’t try to pretend you are not 75 or 85 or whatever age you are. “As soon as we start lying about our age, we’re giving the number a terrible power – a power it doesn’t deserve,” says Honoré. People do it because there are so many ageist assumptions attached to age, but the way to fight back is to subvert those assumptions.10. Society tells us that sex, love and romance belong to the young, but it’s not true. Plenty of older people continue to experience the joy of sex. But there are no rules: have as much – or as little – as you want. Some older people see it as a blessed release to escape the shackles of falling in love (and lust), but others can’t imagine life without it. Whatever turns you on.11. Ignore people who say you can’t teach an old dog new tricks. You can. Despite the common perception that creativity is the preserve of the young, we can get more creative as we get older. Our neural networks loosen up and we have the confidence and freedom to challenge groupthink. Honoré was encouraged last year when the Turner prize abolished its age limit for artists. Michelangelo could have been a contender.12. Don’t pretend death isn’t coming. Embrace it – just not yet. “It’s useful to know our lives are bookended,” says Honoré. “When time is running out, it becomes more precious. It gives life shape and, in some ways, meaning.” Don’t dwell morbidly on it, but don’t shy away from it either. The closer you get to it, the less you are likely to fear it and the greater your focus will be on the things that really matter."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0777d3533126c2fdc0c86b30ed9f35a4626786ab/0_216_3468_2081/master/3468.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da0ee16321bc2055f2c8894db1babb8b","title":"england women rugby union elite player contracts","story":"Katy Daley-Mclean, who earned her 100th cap during the autumn internationals in November, the captain Sarah Hunter, Marlie Packer, and Vicky Fleetwood have been joined by 2017 World Cup finalists Sarah Bern, Rachael Burford, Vickii Cornborough, Abbie Scott and Lydia Thompson in the England Women’s elite player squad for 2019.The 35-player squad includes 28 full-time professionals, supplemented by seven EPS agreements, with players who will come into camps and England training, but not the full-time programme.In addition, the 2017 World Cup finalist Amy Cokayne will form part of Simon Middleton’s squad under an EPS agreement, allowing her to continue her commitments to the Royal Air Force alongside international rugby duties.Three players are returning to 15s from the sevens programme as the 2014 World Cup winners and 2017 finalists Natasha Hunt and Emily Scarratt join Jess Breach in the move back to the 15s setup.“The introduction of full-time contracts will take time to embed but will unquestionably help us to accelerate the development process,” Middleton said. “This is a huge opportunity and we recognise the expectation that comes with the investment. It is now down to us as a management and playing group to meet those expectations.”There are six new names named in this year’s EPS, including five players who made their England debuts during the 2018 Quilter Internationals. Firwood Waterloo back-row forward Sarah Beckett, Loughborough Lightning centre Carys Williams and Gloucester-Hartpury centre Tatyana Heard have been awarded full-time contracts, while Ellena Perry, the Wasps scrum-half Claudia Macdonald and uncapped Saracens prop Bryony Cleall are also named under the EPS agreements.The squad comes together on Thursday at its new base at Bisham Abbey National Sports Centre for January testing, before three-days of training start on Friday before the 2019 Women’s Six Nations which kicks off against Ireland in Dublin on Friday 1 February.“I am confident that this group of players have the potential to grow into the world-class squad we will be looking to take to New Zealand in 2021,” said Middleton. “Congratulations to all those selected, every player has worked hard to rightly earn their place. As a player and management group, our immediate focus is very much on the Six Nations and the continued development of what is a still a very new squad of players.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39795a8714565a5bc7fb7c496fbb5e6c60d40bad/0_150_3086_1852/master/3086.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de02e17701abb827ae9ccb244e91d2a3","title":"michael schumacher turns 50 fa cup third round shocks sneaky drinks classic youtube","story":"The German legend in F1 – and chariot – action, plus: shock cup exits, tumbling, sneaky drinks and dazzling darts1) Today, Michael Schumacher turns 50. He won a grand prix for the first time at Spa in 1992 for Benetton. He’d go on to win five more in Belgium, and another 85 elsewhere. He didn’t win at Spa in 1998 though, and was ultra-keen on telling telling David Coulthard all about it after colliding with the Scot. (They made up in later years.) His ludicrously storied career could keep you occupied for days. To start you down the rabbit-hole, here’s a look at his cars that took the chequered flag at Spa. Schumacher v Senna in the Brazilian’s backyard in 1992. Tears post-race at Monza in 2000 after equalling Senna’s tally of 41 race wins. He didn’t win the Australian Grand Prix in 1994, but his collision with Damon Hill in Adelaide decided the championship in his favour. A fabulous ding-dong with Jean Alesi at the Nürburgring in 1995. Stunning overtaking to squeak by Mika Hakkinen at Monza in 1998. Fast hands in the cockpit on his pole lap in Malaysia in 1999. Keeping Fernando Alonso at bay at Imola in 2006. He retired following a dominant decade with Ferrari that season, but after being tempted back first by the makers of Asterix at the Olympics Games for a chariot-racing cameo, and then by Mercedes, he waved goodbye again three seasons later with a farewell lap at Interlagos.2) Ladies tumbling! Men tumbling! Ascoli goalkeeper Filippo Perucchini: stumbling! Fielders fumbling, too, before one of the weirdest run outs of the festive season which saw Alex Carey dismissed after two failed attempts to fell the stumps at the other end. Elsewhere, in the Big Bash, there was a big bash to the helmet for Jason Sangha after a mean delivery from Jhye Richardson. Jos Buttler, meanwhile, is having loads of fun.3) “Can I check your bag, madam? Just binoculars, carry on.”4) It’s been a great couple of weeks of darts, capped by Michael van Gerwen sealing his third PDC world title against Michael Smith. Here’s the Dutchman with back-to-back nine-darters in 2013, and attempting the round-the-clock challenge – trying to hit every double, in order, with the fewest darts.5) FA Cup third round klaxon! So time to revisit Ronnie Radford doing pretty things in the mud in 1972, Sutton United, Matthew Hanlan and all that v Coventry in 1989. Mickey Thomas’s rocket-boosted effort for Wrexham to see off Arsenal in 1992. More recently: freshly-in-the-league Stevenage 3-1 Newcastle in 2011. Eden Hazard got up from a Phil Jones special to win it from the spot for Chelsea last year, and meanwhile here are some of the best strikes from the second round this season.6) When Aurélien Rougerie played his final game for Clermont Auvergne after 19 years with the club, it all got a touch emotional. The 38-year-old made over 400 appearances for the French club and also earned 76 international caps for France, with colleagues and rivals paying their full respects.1) How to save yourself from a tricky situation with just a golf club for company.2) Ronnie O’Sullivan at his best, redubbed with choice excerpts of John Virgo overexcitement.3) Fascinating al-Jazeera doc on west African footballers finding their way in Thailand.Do subscribe if you fancy.Do subscribe if you fancy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cccd110cb655bde883e8f604c3d7c69b7ada44ff/0_583_2476_1485/master/2476.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=602da5a421c8dc4bb50411ca18afffe0","title":"talking horses some good things in racings shifting tv presence","story":"There is something to be said for the changes made this week by both of racing’s dedicated channelsFor someone who’s instinctively resistant to change, I find myself surprisingly unworried about all this week’s shifts in the landscape of racing broadcasting. Could it be that, from the viewer’s perspective, progress is being made across the board? That is, apart from the loss of replays of past Irish racing, which I was ranting about on Wednesday.The thing I like most, so far, is the fact that Sky Sports Racing have installed cameras that look directly across the finishing line at all the tracks they cover, having taken over from At The Races. They now show slow-motion replays of all the runners crossing the line just seconds after it has happened.Really, we ought to have got to this years ago but we didn’t, so this counts as a big step forward. In future, we’ll be spending less time standing before our tellies, trying to puzzle out which horse won a close finish while watching from 50 yards to one side. It gave me a crick in the neck.Meanwhile, Racing TV had a predictably hectic time on New Year’s Day, trying to cope with live racing from six tracks in one afternoon. It led to a lot of split-screen action and they weren’t helped by delays at two of the tracks as the afternoon progressed. But by my reckoning there are only two days in the year when their schedule will be as jammed, the other being Boxing Day although they have other crowded afternoons in the summer, those centre on Flat tracks with much shorter races.It won’t suit everybody but I like that RTV is offering dedicated feeds direct from each track, accessible by various means but not necessarily through your TV. Their RTV Extra service allows viewers to watch feeds from up to four tracks simultaneously and I plan to make use of that one of these Saturdays.In the broad, it seems to me that both channels have enough action to keep them going and both are making visible efforts to improve things for viewers I should point out that I’ve done bits of work for both in the past year, so someone else will be needed if you want an entirely independent assessment of their work. Meanwhile, ITV Racing seems to be steadily increasing its audience, so there’s some good news around.RTV have met some resistance in Ireland to the wholesale switch of the sport there away from At The Races, as was. In an effort to change some minds, they’re offering a free trial through January to Sky and broadband viewers in Britain and Ireland, while the channel is free to view for those in the Republic of Ireland for three hours each day this month, timed to coincide with the racing.In other good news, racing goes ahead at Ludlow, which offers our jump racing for the day. Le Precieux (1.15) is napped at 5-2 for a four-runner race in which the betting finds something nice to say about each of the runners.There will be more juice in the ground than when he scored with authority at Leicester last week but I don’t think it’ll stop a horse who looks well treated, now that he’s going the right way. He was a stone higher when he arrived from France last season.Kim Bailey could do well in the next two races. Silver Kayf (1.45) did not cope well with a hot novice chase last month but this return to hurdles for his first handicap should suit a lot better. He won here in a novice race in March and is 5-1 to go in again.Agent Memphis (2.15) showed more promise when she went over fences last time and an extra half-mile should help her today. She’s 5-2."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49eef654dbe73fa10866e6bad1b711547461df4f/1_0_3870_2323/master/3870.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7303695388b7dd7d02fc313a814e779c","title":"how can you tell if a mobile phone has good reception before you buy it","story":"Paul lives in a signal black spot where his wife’s smartphone still works. Is there a way to find if phone has good reception?I have a Moto 3 smartphone and my wife has a similar earlier model. We are right on the edge of reception from EE. I can just get a very weak signal if I attach my phone to a selfie stick and lean out of a window, or walk up the bank behind the house. This is not ideal.Away from home, sometimes my wife’s phone can get a strong signal whereas mine can’t get a signal at all. This made me wonder if there was a measurement to assess how good a mobile phone is at receiving signals in areas of poor reception before you buy it … and if there is an easy way for an ordinary punter to understand it. PaulPhone manufacturers and others can and do test their phones, usually for certification purposes. The performance test results you want, if you can get them, are the Total Isotropic Sensitivity (TIS) value for reception and the Total Radiated Power (TRP) for transmission.These probably don’t qualify as easy for an ordinary punter to understand. Also, they are derived by testing performance in ideal conditions with a simulated base station in an anechoic chamber, not with a fading signal on a wet and windy hillside.Either way, I don’t think phone manufacturers are likely to use TIS in their marketing. There are too many variables for it to be a reliable guide to real-world reception. For example, studies have found significant differences between holding a phone in the left hand and holding it in the right hand, which I assume is connected with the way manufacturers position their antenna(s). The size of your hands and the angle at which you hold the phone also make a difference.The tests were created by the CTIA – originally the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association – to certify wireless devices’ over-the-air performance, and a brief glance at the 591-page PDF will show how complicated it is. For example, you could measure peak performance with a directional aerial, but then users would have to orient the phone towards the unseen transmitter for the best results. Instead, the CTIA requires the “average spherical effective radiated receiver sensitivity (TIS) to be measured”. This should mean a phone works equally well in all directions, but it’s complicated to calculate and still a compromise.Another problem is making antennas work with different 2G, 3G and 4G phone networks that operate at different frequencies. A phone that works well with GSM 900 might be terrible with UMTS 2100. The downside of having a phone that talks to most networks is that it won’t be optimised for the one you actually use.Also, because human bodies have not been standardised, TIS and TRP measurements are made with dummy heads and hands filled with liquid. Results may vary if you use real people.In the end, the only measurements that matter are the ones you get with your head and hands with the specific frequencies used by your EE network. We are left with “ask a friend” and the not-very-helpful “try it and see”.I couldn’t find much public research into mobile phone reception with commercial phones, presumably because of some of the problems mentioned above. Professor Gert Frølund Pedersen tested nine phones in Denmark in 2012 (PDF), while in the UK, Ofcom used the CTIA test to check 10 off-the-shelf phones in 2016 (PDF).Ofcom withheld the names of the phones it tested because there weren’t enough samples to show statistically significant differences – it tested three of each device – and because “no handset outperformed the others across different frequency bands and technologies”. Knowing the names would therefore not help consumers.However, Ofcom did point out that the non-smartphones outperformed the smartphones, and that “some of the smartphones tested required over 10x (10dB) more power than the best performing non-smartphone”.You could always buy a cheap Nokia for making voice calls.Last year, Ireland’s ComReg (Commission for Communications Regulation) tested 71 mobile phones that were available on the Irish market in June 2017. The aim was to “quantify the minimum signal level(s) required to make or receive a mobile call and to stream data” (PDF).ComReg names names and gives results, but only for TRP (active transmission) not TIS (reception). It doesn’t explain why. The CTIA test recommends that TRP and TIS are tested concurrently, because a phone’s internal components (processor, memory and so on) generate electrical noise that affects reception.StellaDoradus has published a table of the results, which includes some strikingly low numbers for some popular phones. I wouldn’t use it as the sole basis for a purchasing decision.Most tests assume that all models of a particular phone will perform in the same way, but Ofcom found differences. As with other products, phones that look identical can vary. In some cases, they may have been assembled in different countries, and use slightly different components. In others, the circuitry may have been revised between editions. Even if the internal components seem to be the same, there could be some sample variation, without a phone actually being faulty.This makes me wonder if your Moto 3 is below average in reception performance. In most cases, no one would ever know, but you are literally an “edge case”. With a new phone, it might be worth asking the supplier for a different sample, but it may be too late for that.It would be interesting to know what would happen if you swapped phones and sims with your wife. You may have a bigger capacitance than your wife, electronically speaking, and possibly much bigger hands. Both can and do affect reception. If your Moto 3 works better in her hands, then either you or your sim are degrading the performance. It might be worth getting a new sim.As you already know, using your phone on a selfie stick can improve performance. You may also get better reception by not touching the phone and using the built-in speakerphone.You could also try using a signal booster or repeater. These used to be illegal, but on 12 April last year, Ofcom approved the use of some models in homes and road vehicles “but not in boats or static caravans”. However, check carefully because illegal signal boosters are still available.Have you got a question?

We’d like your help in documenting their recoveryEngland and Wales have about 140,000 miles of footpaths, but it is estimated more than 10,000 have been lost from current maps. Volunteers have been working tirelessly to rediscover them and put in legal applications for the recovery of lost paths before a government deadline in 2026 after which claims will no longer be accepted.If you have already found a lost footpath, how did you find and identify it? If you put in an application for a path to be recovered we’d also like to hear about it.Below are some tips on how to rediscover a lost footpath:1. The first port of call is the Ramblers, whose website gives clear advice on how to identify a lost path and make an application. The method involves comparing new and old maps, plus examination of historical sources. Walking and exploration is involved, but don’t forget that a lost path has to be proven before you can use it, otherwise you are trespassing.2. It is also important to be sure you are not replicating work already underway. This government website can give you information on current applications.3. You may also know of paths that are used regularly, but are not on the definitive map (you can ask your local council to see that map). Any footpath walked by the public for 20 years without any attempt by the landowner to prevent access can be made a right of way. Check your local walking groups for people actively walking along unmapped routes to help establish this right.You can share your tips and stories with us in the encrypted form below.

It is set in the fictional kingdom of Agrabah, and was filmed in Wadi Rum in Jordan, where the protected desert landscape, sandstone and basalt mountains, canyons and otherworldly rock formations – such as Burdah Rock Bridge, one of the highest natural arches in the world – create a dramatic landscape.Exploring by 4x4 is recommended, and visitors can also stay in a Bedouin desert camp, go camel riding, and visit the 4,000-year-old rock drawings at Khazali Canyon. Booking directly with the Jordan visitor centre on arrival is advised, or with a tour company in advance (such as Jordan Tracks, 1 day 1 night, cameljeep tour from £90).• Released May 2019Quentin Tarantino’s ninth (and supposedly penultimate) film has a stellar cast including Brad Pitt, Leonardo DiCaprio, Margot Robbie and Al Pacino. Full details of the crime drama have yet to be unveiled, but last April the director told the CinemaCon convention: “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood takes place in 1969, at the height of the counterculture, hippy revolution and the height of new Hollywood. Street by street, block by block, we’ll transform Los Angeles into the Hollywood of 1969.”Photos and videos have surfaced showing a stretch of Hollywood Boulevard, between Las Palmas and Cherokee, transformed with period cars, shop fronts and cinemas. But while most of the sets are temporary, it is possible to visit some permanent fixtures featured in the film, including Hollywood’s oldest restaurant, Musso \u0026amp Frank Grill, which opened in 1919 and whose reputation was set during the golden age of Hollywood, visited by stars such as Charlie Chaplin.Other Hollywood locations for reliving the retro vibe include Dan Tana’s Italian in West Hollywood, the city’s first late-night restaurant, where stars would dine in anonymity: it celebrated 50 years last year. Next to the art deco Pantages Theater, there’s Hollywood’s oldest e bar, Frolic Room (which originally opened as a speakeasy in 1930, was a bolthole for Barfly writer Charles Bukowski, and featured in LA Confidential). And the Hollywood Museum in the restored art deco Max Factor building, has tons of memorabilia and a historic pink lobby.• Released July 2019Almost 25 years after the animated classic hit the screens, a CGI version featuring the voices of Beyoncé, Donald Glover, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Seth Rogen is being released. Research trips for the original animated film took place in Kenya’s Hell’s Gate national park in Kenya – though Pride Rock was a fictitious element added by the animators.Hell’s Gate national park,90km from Nairobi, is named for the intense geothermal activity within its boundaries. The spectacular landscape includes deep, twisting gorges, volcanic rock towers and plumes of steam. ABig cat numbers here are low, which means that, uniquely in Kenyan parks, pedestrians are allowed full access. But other wildlife is abundant, with more than 103 species of birds, buffalos, zebras, gazelles, hyenas, antelopes and baboons. Hire bikes and local guides (for hiking and walking safaris) are available at the entrance those wanting to explore by car can hire 4x4s at Nairobi airport). If a distant hyena lullaby sounds appealing, there are three campsites in the park (Endachata, Naiburta and Oldubai) and more options at nearby Lake Naivasha. • Released July 2019Jessie Buckley stars as a Glaswegian ex-con and single mum who dreams of breaking into the country music scene in Nashville. But Glasgow has its own Grand Ole Opry, a country and western club started in 1974 in a former cinema and still putting on gigs every Friday and Saturday. In March, the city, along with London and Dublin, will co-host Europe’s biggest country music festival C2C: Country to Country (8-10 March at SSE Hydro) with Keith Urban and Lyle Lovett on the bill. Glasgow is also a Unesco city of music, putting on more than 150 gigs a week in around 40 venues across the city. Music hotspots include King Tut’s Wah Wah Hut, Broadcast, Bloc+, SWG3, Stereo, Maggie Mays, and Mono, which is also a record store and vegan cafe.• Released April 2019The original film title – Everest – might have given a clue to the location of this animated film from DreamWorks. Although story details have yet to be disclosed, it is thought to follow a group from the streets of Shanghai who trek 3,000 miles to reunite the mythical Yeti with his family at the highest point on Earth, in the Himalayas.Since the first successful ascent to the summit of Everest in 1953, the Himalayas have become more accessible, with walking routes across Nepal, India, Pakistan, Tibet and Burma, and varied options depending on season, budget and ability. Trekking in China more specifically includes a multitude of routes around Tiger Leaping Gorge in Yunnan province, taking in deep ravines, snow-capped ranges, rivers, forests and remote rice terraces. Alternatively, there are routes at Sichuan’s Gongga Shan, the King of Mountains, passing glaciers, temples and views over the Tibetan meadows or in the far north-west of China in Kanas national park, in the Altai mountains that creep in from Siberia.Tours of the Himalayas in Nepal, India, Pakistan, Tibet and Burma, range from self-guided trekking suitable for families (World Expeditions, £990pp, 11 days B\u0026ampB), to trekking up to an altitude of 5,364 metres to Everest Base Camp (£1,740, 17 days, including all meals and accommodation).• Released September 2019Calanque de Méjean, an picturesque inlet near Marseille in southern France, was the location for this family drama by veteran director Robert Guédiguian. The tiny port beside the towering arches of a large viaduct sets the scene for the reunion of several siblings, who return to the family home when their father suffers a stroke.Guédiguian said Méjean had always reminded him of theatre: “The colourful little houses built into the hills seem to be no more than facades ... A viaduct overlooks them and its trains look like child’s toys the openness towards the sea transforms the horizon into a backdrop ... like painted canvases ... especially with the winter light, when everyone has gone. It becomes an abandoned set – melancholy and beautiful.”Méjean is one of several coastal hamlets along Provence’s Côte Bleue, with a picturesque railway route hugging the shore.• Released January 2019Another homecoming film, this time from Iranian director Asghar Farhadi, following Laura (Penélope Cruz), who travels from Buenos Aires back to her childhood home in a village near Madrid to attend a wedding. Abduction, threats and former lovers (namely Paco, played by Javier Bardem) play out in this Spanish drama filmed in the village of Torrelaguna 40 miles from the capital.Torrelaguna has a beautiful traditional plaza, atmospheric 15th-century church, a Roman bridge, a 10th-century watchtower, and other historic buildings mixing gothic, baroque and neoclassical architectural styles. Restaurants serving Spanishspecialities include Alfoli de la Sal and Casa Moraleda there are horse riding and walking routes in the surrounding meadows and hills and the views from the nearby black-slate village of Patones de Arriba are worth a trip too.• Released March 2019Set in Port Isaac, Cornwall, this feelgood British comedy drama is based on the true story of a group of fishermen who were given a record deal after singing sea shanties in their local pub. On the Atlantic coast of north Cornwall, the tiny village of Port Isaac is a popular filming spot, already featuring in Poldark, Doc Martin and Saving Grace.During the making of Fisherman’s Friends, the original fishermen worked on the boats with the film crew, helped with singing coaching and consulted on accents and dialects. If visiting the area, expect a bit of a sing-song in the local pubs, or during the summer (depending on the weather) you might be lucky enough to catch the Fisherman’s Friends giving a performance of sea shanties on the platt (dock). These shows are free, with donations going to charity. There are boat and fishing trips from the port depending on weather and season, and Polzeath beach, one of the best surfing spots in north Cornwall, is five miles away.• Released March 2019 This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

There are a number of former members of the military and intelligence services, many of them women. There are seasoned veterans of past presidential administrations and a handful of political neophytes who never held office before running for Congress in 2018.A record 102 women will be sworn into the House on Thursday, 35 of whom were elected for the first time in November in a historic wave of success for female candidates.“We’re in the building. Swearing in tomorrow,” the congresswoman-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York captioned a photograph of her and five incoming female colleagues, posing in the US Capitol.The arrival of this large new group will significantly alter the balance of power in Washington, where the federal government is currently paralysed by a shutdown stretching into its 13th day.Democrats will regain control of the House on Thursday eight years after losing power. Their takeover was fuelled by 63 Democrats whose victories in the November midterm elections helped the party win by the largest margins since the Watergate scandal in 1974.Nancy Pelosi is all but assured of reclaiming her former title as speaker of the House. She made history in 2007 as the first woman to hold the position, before handing over the gavel when the GOP won the House in 2011. The Republicans will be led by Kevin McCarthy of California.“When our new members take the oath, our Congress will be refreshed and our democracy will be strengthened by the optimism, idealism and patriotism of this transformative freshman class,” Pelosi is expected to say on Thursday, according to a preview of her remarks. “Working together, we will redeem the promise of the American dream for every family, advancing progress for every community.”As in years past, proud relatives and curious members of the public will fill the House and Senate galleries as the 116th Congress is sworn in and new leaders are elected. But this year the faces will look different – more erse and more female.Rashida Tlaib, an incoming Democratic congresswoman from Michigan, announced on Instagram that she would wear a traditional Palestinian thobe – a long-sleeved, ankle-length garment – when being sworn in. Ilhan Omar, an incoming Democratic congresswoman from Minnesota, will swear the oath of office on her grandfather’s Qur’an.In an Instagram post, her father recounted the family’s journey from a refugee camp in Kenya to the US, where they first arrived at an “airport in Washington DC”.“I could never have dreamed that 23 years later I would return to the same airport with my daughter Ilhan by my side, the day before she is to be sworn in as the first Somali-American elected to the United States Congress,” he wrote.Congressman Jim Langevin, a Democrat from Rhode Island and the first quadriplegic person elected to Congress, will preside over the chamber on the first day.After the speaker is elected, the newly empowered Democratic majority will vote on an internal rules package designed to bring more transparency to congressional governance, a measure that has already exposed ideological tensions within the party. Two prominent progressives, Ocasio-Cortez and Congressman Ro Khanna of California, said they would oppose the package, arguing that the rules would hinder liberals’ ability to advance their ambitious social agenda.Democrats will then turn to their first major order of business: a spending package that would end the government shutdown.The party is unified on the legislation but Donald Trump has said he will refuse to sign the bill, which does not include funding for his border wall.The vote will be the first test of their power – and an indication of the battles to come in a newly ided government."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f74a09f1cf2796fe3c00ac48ffab8a30489d97e8/0_95_4225_2535/master/4225.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=668619bd01a0fe4c4eb4124de6a9f8b7","title":"mexico flayed lord temple fertility god skinned human corpse","story":"Two skull-like stone carvings and a stone trunk depicting the Flayed Lord were found during excavation in Puebla stateMexican experts say they have found the first temple of the Flayed Lord, a pre-Hiic fertility god depicted as a skinned human corpse.Mexico’s National Institute of Anthropology and History said Wednesday the find was made during recent excavations of Popoloca ruins in Puebla state.The institute said experts found two skull-like stone carvings and a stone trunk depicting the god, Xipe Totec.

The trial of the alleged Sinaloa cartel chief Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán – which resumes on Thursday – has been no exception. The proceedings have offered extraordinary detail of the workings of a Mexican cartel, but have been hallmarked by what is unseen – and kept that way by Judge Brian Cogan.Day-to-day testimony has been like a Netflix thriller, yet it has obscured  the nexus of top-level corruption the world’s biggest criminal organisation operated north and south of the US border.The detail from cartel “snitches” testifying for the prosecution against their old boss or partner has been riveting. Guzmán’s first employee, pilot Miguel Ángel Martínez, described a trip with Guzmán to Japan, Thailand and Macau, and a visit they made to Los Angeles to spend $6m on planes before a gambling spree in Las Vegas. Guzmán went to Switzerland, he said, for cellular anti-ageing treatment.Guzmán ran a private zoo, and distributed bonus diamond-studded Rolexes and fancy cars to favourite underlings. Cocaine was smuggled to the US in what looked like cans of jalapeño peppers. Even Guzmán – usually pensive – laughed when his lawyer William Purpura, picked up one of the cans entered in evidence, and told the court: “I’ve been dying to hold this one.”The former chief of Colombia’s Norte del Valle cartel, Juan Carlos Ramírez Abadía – alias La Chupeta, the Lollipop – gave enthralling evidence about one of the most important partnerships in narco-trafficking history, after Guzmán impressed the Colombian with his insistence on only the best-quality product, speed of delivery – and his demand for an extra percentage.Ramírez, his face disfigured by plastic surgery, boasted about the 400,000 kilos of cocaine he had moved, and 150 executions he had ordered – including a family in New Jersey. His testimony also traced Guzmán’s takeover of Colombian distribution networks in the US while Ramírez did a short stretch in jail. Another Colombian narco, Jorge Cifuentes, testified to having furnished rightwing Colombian paramilitaries with 5,000 AK-47 assault rifles with which to fight leftwing Farc guerrillas, but then arranging a cocaine deal between Guzmán and the Farc. The first we heard of Guzmán’s voice was on a wiretap, expertly haggling with the comrades.The narco witnesses have offered detailed, sometimes darkly funny testimony they are proud of what they did. Asked at one point about the killing of two female Colombian police agents, Chupeta gave a thumbs-up. His only apparent remorse was at the loss of two loads to US authorities.The star turn was the Sinaloa cartel accountant Jesús Zambada García (brother of the drug lord who probably betrayed Guzmán and now leads the cartel, Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada), who testified with cool aplomb about his “investors”, “costs” and “returns”.In his coverage of the trial, David Brooks of the Mexican daily La Jornada wrote: “Chapo Guzmán was one of the successful impresarios of a Mexican neoliberal model, heading a transnational commercial and financial operation dedicated to satisfying an insatiable demand in the US, generating hundreds of millions of dollars monthly for Mexico.”But Guzmán must go down as a big-catch criminal, and that is where the riptides beneath the surface matter.Italian mafia parlance calls it “dietrologia” – “behindology”, the science of what lies behind appearances. And what lies behind the Chapo trial comprises the corruption of the Mexican state, what became of Guzmán’s money, the role of the turncoat witnesses – and that of the US government in running and recruiting them.Zambada García admitted bribing airport authorities, federal police and even Interpol, and said the cartel’s man in government, Genaro García Luna, was paid one instalment of $3m while head of the federal investigation agency, then another after being appointed minister for public security. Similar allegations against García Luna had previously been made in Mexico, including in two books by the journalist Anabel Hernández. In a statement to Mexican media, García Luna denied the allegation, which he described as “a lie, defamation and perjury”.But Zambada García also alleged that García Luna was paid $56m by Guzmán’s affiliates the Beltrán Leyva brothers, one of whom, Héctor, was responsible for paying off politicians. Héctor Beltrán Leyva died in a Mexican jail the night before Zambada García’s testimony.According to discussion during a sidebar between counsel and the judge, Zambada planned to go one better and elaborate on a $6m payment to an “incumbent” Mexican president. He was stopped from doing so by a prosecutors’ motion, upheld by Judge Cogan, “protecting iniduals and entities who are not parties to this case and who would face embarrassment”, he said.The trial chamber – and the Mexican people – cannot, then, know which president was allegedly paid by Guzmán, and for what. A subsequent sidebar discussed the contents of a prosecution memorandum submitted under seal the transcript of the sidebar was then itself sealed.When John Gotti – head of the Gambino mafia clan – went on trial in this same New York courthouse in 1992, it took just one “cooperating witness” to convict him.In Guzmán’s trial, Mexican narcos are lining up to testify: six so far, and as many as 10 more to follow.Guzmán’s lawyer Jeffrey Lichtman calls them “degenerates” who will say anything to get sentences commuted. During the first week of the Guzmán trial, on 9 November, Vicente Zambada Nieblo – “El Vicentillo” – pleaded guilty in Chicago to overseeing logistics for the Sinaloa cartel and trafficking vast quantities of cocaine and heroin through that city. Vicentillo is El Mayo’s son, and the accountant’s nephew.His 19-page plea was entered suddenly, a year after Vicentillo had agreed with US authorities to cooperate “in any matter” – making him conveniently available to testify against Guzmán in New York. Vicentillo does not contest a staggering $1.3bn forfeiture.But Zambada Nieblo is more than just a turncoat: a year-long investigation by the Mexican newspaper El Universal, published in October 2017, established definitively that Vicentillo had worked for the DEA while conducting his duties for the cartel.Guzmán’s lawyers may not get to pursue these relationships, which complicate the usual narrative of good, honest DEA detective work, even though an addendum to a Department of Justice audit of the agency, published in March 2017, voiced “specific concerns about how the DEA used and paid confidential sources”, with “potential implications for national security”.Also excluded was an attempt by the defence to ask prosecution witnesses about “Operation Fast and Furious”, a project run by the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to allow weapons to enter Mexico illegally, through cooperating straw-buyers, in hopes of catching their final recipients.Of the 2,000 guns allowed to “walk” between 2007 and 2011, only 665 were recovered, one of them in Guzmán’s’s lair in 2014 – but none of this can feature at trial.The evidence about money has been detailed when it is “back in Mexico”, but coy when it moves beyond there. Martínez flew planes loaded with cash – between $8m and $10m from Tijuana three times a month – and hauled a Samsonite case filled with $10m to “a Mexico City bank” monthly. Cash deposits are described hidden beneath beds and even underwater.But there the money-trail ends, though the US Senate’s and Department of Justice’s own investigations have established that hundreds of millions proceeded through the Wachovia and HSBC banks north of the border – these play no part in evidence hitherto.So the Guzmán trial, as the US government and Judge Cogan conduct it, follows the focused “kingpin” strategy, which supposes that once a cartel leader is taken down, the war on drugs is being won. Yet more cocaine is leaving Colombia than ever, and last year was Mexico’s most violent since this phase of the drug wars began.As his trial resumes next week, Guzmán is old news back in Mexico: initiative is with the rising Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generación and its leader, Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes, “El Mencho”. One day, El Chapo himself might testify against El Mencho – if he ever gets caught that may be Guzmán’s only chance of seeing his seven-year-old twin daughters as a free man."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab29605115ac624af1012b5757a9358979f5b5e2/0_161_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7b9a83caa6177e7618381ef8aec56ead","title":"delhi air pollution surges to emergency levels","story":"Air quality index at 12 times US government-recommended level and visibility lowDelhi residents woke to a thick, grey smog on Thursday as air pollution in the Indian capital surged to emergency levels.The state-run Central Pollution Control Board’s air quality index, which shows the concentration of poisonous particulate matter known as PM 2.5, stood at 440, up from 430 on Wednesday and about 12 times the US government-recommended level of 35.Pollution levels hit 500 in some parts of Delhi, and there was very poor visibility in some areas. Last year the high was 450 on 23 December.A sharp drop in temperatures and wind speed, combined with vehicle and industrial emissions, dust from building sites and smoke from the burning of waste, has increased pollution over much of north India including Delhi, which is home to more than 20 million people.The cold weather has forced some people, especially those spending the night in the open, to burn small fires to keep warm, adding to the smog. In October and November as pollution spiked, the government adopted measures ranging from a temporary ban on construction activities and waste burning to a clampdown on polluting industrial plants such as coal-fired power stations.Critics say the measures were inadequate and poorly implemented, largely because of a lack of resources and political will.“Climatic conditions have contributed to the crisis, but let’s admit that most steps announced in 2018 have failed miserably,” said Sunil Dahiya, a senior campaigner with Greenpeace."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4b10af085f2d6f2361f7c89219cec889f69fa17/0_5_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c34c344ea415d51d74d32599ce04e58","title":"thailand tourists flee as tropical storm pabuk set to bring seven metre waves","story":"Thousands leave spots including Koh Phangan and Koh Tao as area’s first tropical storm outside monsoon for about 30 years loomsTens of thousands of tourists have fled the Thai resort islands of Koh Phangan and Koh Tao in a mass exodus ahead of Tropical Storm Pabuk which is set to bring heavy rains, wind and seven-metre (22ft) waves.The islands, hugely popular with holiday-makers especially during the peak Christmas and New Year season, have emptied out since Wednesday as tourists packed onto ferries bound for the southern Thai mainland, with swimming banned and boats set to suspend services.Pabuk, Thailand’s first tropical storm in the area outside of the monsoon season for around 30 years, is poised to batter Koh Phangan and Koh Tao as well as Koh Samui on Friday night, before cutting into the mainland.No official evacuation order has been given but tourists are leaving in droves.“I think the islands are almost empty ... between 30,000 to 50,000 have left since the New Year’s Eve countdown parties,” Krikkrai Songthanee, Koh Phangnan district chief, told AFP.The acting mayor of Koh Tao, one of Southeast Asia’s finest ing spots, said boats to Chumphon on the mainland were crammed with tourists, but several thousand guests were still on the island likely to brave the storm.Pabuk was packing winds of 104km per hour (65 mph) but was unlikely to intensify into a full blown typhoon, according to forecasters.“But we expect waves as high as five or seven metres near the eye of the storm. Normally in the Gulf of Thailand there are only two metre high waves,” Phuwieng Prakammaintara, director general at the Thai Meteorological Department, told reporters.“It’s difficult to predict the severity of the storm so people should comply with authorities’ recommendations.”On Koh Samui, the closest of the trio of islands, a Russian man drowned on Wednesday after his family ignored warnings not to go into the sea.“A family of three went swimming but the strong current caught a 56-year-old man who drowned,” police captain Boonnam Srinarat of Samui Police told AFP.“Island officials announced the warning and put up the red ‘danger’ flags ... but maybe the family did not think the situation was that serious.”Authorities on the island said they were preparing shelters for any tourists who decide to wait out the storm.Pabuk, which means a giant catfish in Lao, is also expected to dump heavy rain across the south, including tourist hotspots in the Andaman Sea such as Krabi and the southernmost provinces bordering Malaysia of Pattani, Narathiwat and Yala."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af24f4769acc653c32759678792c85556c63c879/465_930_2341_1404/master/2341.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a445ee97211918934720545db3592659","title":"seaching for scrap in guatemala city in pictures","story":"Workers known as guajeros descend daily to search for recyclable items at one of the biggest rubbish dumps in Guatemala City.

Photograph: South Australia PoliceEPAMore than eight years after it was abandoned in the middle of the Indian Ocean when 16-year-old solo sailor Abby Sunderland had to be rescued in rough seas, a yellow yacht named Wild Eyes has been found floating upside down off the coast of South Australia.The 40-foot yacht was encrusted with barnacles, the signature eyes on the hull scratched and faded. Its mast snapped off in the wild weather that forced Sunderland’s rescue midway through her world record attempt to be the youngest solo sailor to circumnavigate the globe in 2010.It was spotted from the air by a tuna spotter plane about 12.30pm on Monday, 11 nautical miles from Vivonne Bay on Kangaroo Island. The South Australian police helicopter and two commercial fishing vessels were sent to investigate and identified the yacht.It had not been seen since Sunderland was picked up and rescued by the French ship Ile de la Reunion on June 12th, 2010, midway between Madagascar and Western Australia.In a blog post written on the Ile de la Reunion hours after she was picked up, Sunderland said: “The long and the short of it is, well, one long wave, and one short mast (short meaning two inch stub.) ... am still trying to get over the fact that I will never see my Wild Eyes again.”A month later, after she had returned home to California, she said it was unlikely the boat would ever be found.“A lot of people have been asking about Wild Eyes,” she wrote on July 5th, 2010. “She was still afloat when I boarded the Ile de la Reunion. She could end up on a beach in Western Australia at some point, but it’s just a guess, we don’t know for sure.“She would have to be very lucky to wash up on a beach, and not get smashed on the rocks or something like that. While I do wish that she would be found and fixed up, it’s not all that likely she will be found.”Sunderland, now 25, set sail from Marina del Rey in California on January 23rd in 2010 but had to restart her world record attempt at Cabo San Lucas in Mexico 10 days later due to electrical problems and higher-than-expected fuel and power use from her navigation and communication systems.Her family had bought the Australian-built Wild Eyes and in October the year before, just months after her elder brother Zach became the first person under the age of 18 to sail solo around the world, with stops and assistance, and kitted it out specifically for her journey.Sunderland intended to beat her brother’s record and complete a non-stop circumnavigation, but had to stop in Cape Town for repairs in May. She activated her emergency satellite beacons after being tumbled about in 60-knot winds and 50-foot waves about 2,000 miles east of Madagascar.Her parents were heavily criticised for allowing her to undertake the attempt, and Sunderland in turn criticised the media saying that her age had nothing to do with encountering a storm in the southern ocean, something she said happened to all sailors.Australian Jessica Watson, who is just five months older than Sunderland, is the youngest person ever to complete a solo non-stop circumnavigation and arrived home in Sydney on May 15th, 2010, three days before her 17th birthday and six days before Sunderland departed Cape Town. - "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

though some suggest these figures are an overestimate.But in the first study to track the strain of cholera responsible for the outbreak, scientists using genome sequencing have found that migration is behind the introduction of the disease into the country.The strain originated in South Asia in 2012, according to the research published in Nature journal on Tuesday, but spread to Yemen from East Africa. Yemen has long been a crossroads for trade and communications between Africa and Asia, and the current epidemic is closely linked to recent outbreaks in Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya. Cholera is a diarrhoeal disease, transmitted through contaminated food and water, which is most prevalent in regions with poor sanitation. In Yemen, where there has been more than three years of conflict, around 16 million of the 29 million inhabitants have no access to safe water and basic sanitation. “We know that a lack of sanitation and hygiene, population displacement and war are directly linked to large-scale outbreaks,” said Professor Nick Thomson, one of the report’s lead authors. “The difference is that we now know that it’s the movement of the bacterial agent causing cholera across and between countries that links these large-scale outbreaks together.”“In the past we have considered that we are in essence victims to fortune for local pools of the bacterium causing cholera, but we now have a new window into the disease,” he added. Prof Thomson said the research will allow better targeted interventions against cholera and help estimate the risk of future outbreaks in regions like Yemen -potentially reducing the impact of future epidemics. But the researchers, from the Wellcome Sanger Institute and Institut Pasteur, also found that the strain in Yemen is more susceptible to antibiotics than other types of cholera. “Surprisingly, we discovered the cholera strain causing the Yemen outbreaks is less resistant to antibiotics than related strains,” said Dr Daryl Domman, a visiting scientist at the Wellcome Sanger Institute. “The strain causing the Yemeni cholera epidemic has deleted four genes responsible for resistance to clinically relevant antibiotics, making itself more vulnerable to treatment.”Newsletter promotion - global health security - end of article Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Ireland wants hundreds of millions in EU aid to mitigate damage of no deal BrexitGang steals €2.3m from security van in Italy, ripping the back open \u0026#39like a can of tuna\u0026#39Chris Packham fails to convince 250-year-old New Forest hunt to chase him \u0026#39instead of a fox\u0026#39What is the Brexit deal, and what will happen if Theresa May loses the vote in Parliament?England Rugby head chef forced himself on woman in hotel room, court hears as he denies sexual assaultNazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe to go on hunger strike in Iran prison over lack of medical careMan stabbed to death \u0026#39by teenager\u0026#39 at Church of Scientology in SydneyUltima Thule: First photographs taken by New Horizons spacecraft reveal distant world resembles snowmanSaudi Arabia seeks death penalty for Khashoggi murder suspectsComment: Brian May’s New Horizons are truly out of this worldChina lunar mission: probe makes historic landing on far side of moonComment: Happy birthday to the euro, destined to stagger on and condemn Europe to further disasterComment: Small-screen drama all the rage as literature languishes on critical listHundreds of thousands of school days lost in Scotland thanks to teacher mental health problemsSir Billy Connolly: I\u0026#39m near the end but I don\u0026#39t fear deathNorth Korea\u0026#39s top diplomat in Italy \u0026#39seeking asylum in high-profile defection bid\u0026#39MPs call for fuel price \u0026#39Kitemark\u0026#39 to stop petrol stations overchargingFive year-olds to learn first aid under new rules for school curriculumTransgender people do not have enough access to basic healthcare, senior Tory MP saysWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"china lands far side moon important step countrys space programme","story":"A Chinese spacecraft has made the first successful landing ever on the far side of the moon, a mission seen as an important step as the country looks to push forward its space programme. The lunar explorer Chang\u0027e 4 touched down at 10:26 am and relayed a photo of the dark side of the moon to the Queqiao satellite, the official China Central Television reported on Thursday.The moon is tidally locked to Earth, rotating at the same rate that it orbits our planet, so the far side - or the dark side - is never visible from Earth. Previous spacecraft have seen the far side of the moon, but none has landed on it.The landing lifted the mysterious veil from the far side of the moon, and opened a new chapter in human lunar exploration, the broadcaster said. China launched the Chang\u0027e-4 probe earlier this month, carried by a Long March-3B rocket. It includes a lander and a rover to explore the surface of the moon.An image taken by China\u0026#39s Chang\u0026#39e-4 probe after its landingThe far side of the moon is a rare quiet place that is free from interference of radio signals from Earth, mission spokesman Yu Guobin said, according to Xinhua. This probe can fill the gap of low-frequency observation in radio astronomy and will provide important information for studying the origin of stars and nebula evolution.Unlike the near side of the moon that offers many flat areas to touch down on, the far side is mountainous and rugged.The tasks of the Chang\u0027e-4 include astronomical observation, surveying the moon\u0027s terrain, landform and mineral composition, and measuring the neutron radiation and neutral atoms to study the environment on the far side of the moon.The near side (l) and far side (r) of the Moon show marked differencesChina aims to catch up with Russia and the United States to become a major space power by 2030. It is planning to launch construction of its own manned space station next year.However, while China has insisted its ambitions are purely peaceful, the US Defence Department has accused it of pursuing activities aimed at preventing other nations from using space-based assets during a crisis.Apart from its civilian ambitions, Beijing has tested anti-satellite missiles and the US Congress has banned Nasa from bilateral cooperation with its Chinese counterpart due to security concerns.A simulated landing process of Chang\u0026#39e-4 lunar probe is seen through the monitor at Beijing Aerospace Control Center in BeijingThe United States is so far the only country to have landed humans on the moon. US President Donald Trump said in 2017 he wants to return astronauts to the lunar surface and establish a foundation there for an eventual mission to Mars.It was not until 1959 that the Soviet Union captured the first images of the moon\u0027s mysterious and heavily cratered dark side.No lander or rover has ever previously touched the surface there, and it is no easy technological feat - China has been preparing for this moment for years.The first image of the moon\u0026#39s far side taken by China\u0026#39s Chang\u0026#39e-4 probeA major challenge for such a mission was communicating with the robotic lander: as there is no direct line of sight for signals to the far side of the moon.As a solution, China in May blasted the Queqiao (Magpie Bridge) satellite into the moon\u0027s orbit, positioning it at a \u0027Lagrange point\u0027 so that it can relay data and commands between the lander and Earth.A Lagrange point is a location in space where the combined gravitational forces of two large bodies, such as Earth and the sun or Earth and the moon, equal the centrifugal force felt by a much smaller third body. The interaction of the forces creates a point of equilibrium where a spacecraft may be parked to make observations.In another extreme hurdle, during the lunar night - which lasts 14 Earth days - temperatures drop to as low as minus 173 degrees Celsius (minus 279 Fahrenheit).Long March-3B rocket carrying Chang\u0026#39e 4 lunar probe takes off from the Xichang Satellite Launch CentreDuring the lunar day, also lasting 14 Earth days, temperatures soar as high as 127 C (261 F).The rover\u0027s instruments have to withstand those fluctuations and it has to generate enough energy to sustain it during the long night.The pioneering landing demonstrates China\u0027s growing ambitions as a space power. In 2013, Chang\u0027e 3 was the first spacecraft to land on the moon since the Soviet Union\u0027s Luna 24 in 1976.China plans to send its Chang\u0027e 5 probe to the moon next year and have it return to Earth with samples - the first time that will have been done since 1976. Please review our commenting policyIreland wants hundreds of millions in EU aid to mitigate damage of no deal BrexitGang steals €2.3m from security van in Italy, ripping the back open \u0026#39like a can of tuna\u0026#39Chris Packham fails to convince 250-year-old New Forest hunt to chase him \u0026#39instead of a fox\u0026#39What is the Brexit deal, and what will happen if Theresa May loses the vote in Parliament?England Rugby head chef forced himself on woman in hotel room, court hears as he denies sexual assaultNazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe to go on hunger strike in Iran prison over lack of medical careMan stabbed to death \u0026#39by teenager\u0026#39 at Church of Scientology in SydneyUltima Thule: First photographs taken by New Horizons spacecraft reveal distant world resembles snowmanSaudi Arabia seeks death penalty for Khashoggi murder suspectsComment: Brian May’s New Horizons are truly out of this worldComment: Happy birthday to the euro, destined to stagger on and condemn Europe to further disasterComment: Small-screen drama all the rage as literature languishes on critical listHundreds of thousands of school days lost in Scotland thanks to teacher mental health problemsSir Billy Connolly: I\u0026#39m near the end but I don\u0026#39t fear deathNorth Korea\u0026#39s top diplomat in Italy \u0026#39seeking asylum in high-profile defection bid\u0026#39MPs call for fuel price \u0026#39Kitemark\u0026#39 to stop petrol stations overchargingFive year-olds to learn first aid under new rules for school curriculumTransgender people do not have enough access to basic healthcare, senior Tory MP saysBritish Army targets \u0026#39snowflakes, binge gamers and me, me, me millennials\u0026#39 in new recruitment driveWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 3 january 2019","story":"The container ship MSC ZOE, which has lost up to 270 containers in a storm in the North Sea. Ireland wants hundreds of millions in EU aid to mitigate damage of no deal BrexitGang steals €2.3m from security van in Italy, ripping the back open \u0026#39like a can of tuna\u0026#39Chris Packham fails to convince 250-year-old New Forest hunt to chase him \u0026#39instead of a fox\u0026#39What is the Brexit deal, and what will happen if Theresa May loses the vote in Parliament?England Rugby head chef forced himself on woman in hotel room, court hears as he denies sexual assaultNazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe to go on hunger strike in Iran prison over lack of medical careMan stabbed to death \u0026#39by teenager\u0026#39 at Church of Scientology in SydneyUltima Thule: First photographs taken by New Horizons spacecraft reveal distant world resembles snowmanSaudi Arabia seeks death penalty for Khashoggi murder suspectsComment: Brian May’s New Horizons are truly out of this worldChina lunar mission: probe makes historic landing on far side of moonComment: Happy birthday to the euro, destined to stagger on and condemn Europe to further disasterSir Billy Connolly: I\u0026#39m near the end but I don\u0026#39t fear deathComment: Small-screen drama all the rage as literature languishes on critical listHundreds of thousands of school days lost in Scotland thanks to teacher mental health problemsNorth Korea\u0026#39s top diplomat in Italy \u0026#39seeking asylum in high-profile defection bid\u0026#39MPs call for fuel price \u0026#39Kitemark\u0026#39 to stop petrol stations overchargingFive year-olds to learn first aid under new rules for school curriculumTransgender people do not have enough access to basic healthcare, senior Tory MP saysBritish Army targets \u0026#39snowflakes, binge gamers and me, me, me millennials\u0026#39 in new recruitment driveWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/04/15/bitcoin-price-latest-news-update.jpg?width=1000\u0026amp;height=614\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;crop=16:9,offset-y0.5  on= tap:gallery-lightbox-6258776  role= photo  tabindex= 0  layout= fill  alt= Satoshi Nakamoto creates the first bitcoin block in 2009  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/04/15/bitcoin-price-latest-news-update.jpg","title":"bitcoin price forecast 2019 prediction usd chart analysis latest cryptocurrency","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

After the highs of 2017, which saw the price of bitcoin surge to $20,000 (£15,700), the world\u0027s most valuable cryptocurrency is currently trading close to its lowest point in 16 months.Bitcoin has fallen\u0026nbspby 3 per cent over the last 24 hours, adding to losses of 5 per cent in the last week, 10 per cent in the last month and almost 80 per cent over the last year – leaving little doubt\u0026nbspthat last year\u0027s peak was indeed the result of an over-inflated bubble.There have been five major price spikes in bitcoin\u0027s 10 year history, and after each previous crash the market has managed to recover to even higher levels.

Business communities won\u0027t forgive politicians who allow this to happen, by default or otherwise.Given the magnitude of the recruitment difficulties faced by firms clear across the UK, business concerns about the government\u0027s recent blueprint for future immigration rules must be taken seriously and companies must be able to access skills at all levels without heavy costs or bureaucracy.Suren Thiru, the BCC\u0027s head of economics added: Our latest survey suggests that UK economic conditions were worryingly subdued in the final quarter of 2018, with a number of key indicators continuing to weaken under the weight of persistent Brexit uncertainty and rising cost pressures.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CHIt was Andy Warhol who wanted Lou Reed and John Cale to let his beautiful new friend Nico sing with their avant-garde rock band. Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood.

Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CHFor a fleeting moment, Bros were the biggest band in Britain. Between 1987-89, they achieved eight UK top 10 singles, sold out London’s Wembley Stadium,\u0026nbspand enjoyed a huge fanbase, dubbed “Brosettes”. Their debut album\u0026nbspPush\u0026nbsptopped the charts in 19 countries, and sold more than seven million copies.\u0026nbspAfter the Screaming StopsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

It also vacated its big city centre department store premises like Briggate in Leeds\u0026nbspin favour of open single-storey shops.At the turn of the millennium, the company tried various means to stay afloat, attempting to rival Argos with a “Big Red Book” ordering scheme and hiring oddly matched celebrities like\u0026nbspJackie Chan and\u0026nbspKelly Osbourne\u0026nbspfor their advertising campaigns.\u0026nbspBy late 2008, administrators Deloitte had been called in and all remaining 807 stores were gradually closed, resulting in 27,000 job losses.

Previous studies have discovered that blue light emitted from the screens of laptops and smartphones can contribute to\u0026nbspblindness.\u0026nbspIn August, research by scientists from the University of Toledo, Ohio, revealed that prolonged exposure to the short-wavelength light triggers the generation of toxic molecules in the eye\u0027s light-sensitive cells.\u0026nbspIs Facebook finished? \u0027We\u0027re not far from Zuckerberg subpoena\u0027This process can lead to macular degeneration, a condition that results in blurred or no vision in the centre of the vision field.While it is thought that dark modes can help reduce eye strain, no studies have provided conclusive proof of whether the feature helps prevent this type of blindness.Facebook Messenger follows several other popular apps to introduce the feature, including YouTube, Google Maps and Firefox.WhatsApp, which is also owned by Facebook, is expected to introduce a similar feature later this year.As well as avoiding shining bright screens into people\u0027s eyes, dark modes can also improve battery life. Phones that use OLED displays do not need to light up parts of the screen that are black, potentially reducing the energy needed while the app is open.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debate"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2017/06/28/17/canterbury-housing.jpg","title":"first time buyer level uk property market research","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

But getting on to the housing ladder is still not an easy step for many young people, as demonstrated by the increasing numbers who have received help from the bank of mum and dad.”\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The major update – which would have been perhaps the biggest change to Instagram ever – was so widely despised that numerous users suggested the app is now dead.But very shortly after, the change appeared to be reverted and the feed went back to normal. And now it appears all of that happened by accident.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trial“Sorry about that, this was supposed to be a very small test but we went broader than we anticipated,” Instagram head Adam Mosseri wrote on Twitter, alongside an awkward-looking emoji. The change went to “a few orders of magnitude more people than intended”, he wrote.He said the change “should already be rolled back”. If it is still appearing, he told users they should “simply restart your app and you should be good to go”, Mr Mosseri advised.Created with Sketch.11 useful Instagram features you didn\u0027t know existed Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.111 Hide and reorder filtersFilters are a core part of Instagram, but there are so many available it can be easy to get lost. You can change the order in which they appear, and even hide the ones you never use, to speed up your photo-sharing process. On the filters page, scroll to the end, tap Manage, then drag and drop the ones you want to reorder, and un-check the ones you want to hide. Instagram controversially ditched its reverse-chronological order feed for a new order determined by an algorithm, making it easy to completely miss some posts. To make sure you never miss a certain somebody’s updates, you can set up notification for them by visiting their profile, tapping the three dots in the top right-hand corner and selecting Turn On Post Notifications.If you’re worried about how much of your mobile data Instagram saps, you can limit it by sacrificing the speed at which the photos and videos in your feed load. Go to your profile, tap the three dots in the top right corner, open Cellular Data Use and choose Use Less Data.411 See your LikesIt’s easy to lose track of your friends’ old posts on Instagram, but if you know you Liked it, you’ll be able to track it down easily. Just go to your profile, hit the three dots at the top and select Posts You’ve Liked. You can also save posts in a folder only you can see by tapping the bookmark icon underneath it. Take a look at everything you’ve bookmarked by tapping the same icon that sits near the top of your profile.Everyone knows you can expand the reach of your posts by using a number of relevant hashtags, but what those are aren’t always glaringly obvious. You can easily find the right ones for you by typing a keyword into Instagram’s search bar, selecting a hashtag from the list and swiping along the Related row that appears at the top of the screen.611 Clear your search historyWhatever your reasons are, you can clear your recent searches by going to your profile, hitting the three dots in the top right and selecting Clear Search History. To go a step further and hide your Suggested searches too, go to the search page, tap and hold the account you want to hide, and choose Hide from the pop-up window.Tagged photos on Instagram aren’t as prominent as they are on Facebook, but anyone can still browse through other people’s pictures of you by visiting your profile and tapping the photo of you icon. If you’re tagged in a picture you don’t want other people to see, go to your profile, hit the photos of you icon, tap the three dots at the top of the screen and choose Hide Photos.811 Secure your accountMake your Instagram account much harder to hack by enabling two-factor authentication, a security feature that protects you even if your login details are stolen. Go to your profile, tap the three dots, open Two-Factor Authentication and toggle it on.911 Share lots at onceIf you want to upload a bunch of related pictures and videos without flooding everyone else’s feed, you can shared them all as one post. Hit the + icon, select Gallery, choose Select Multiple, pick out up to 10 of the pictures and clips you want, tap Next and reorder them by dragging and dropping.Instagram Stories has been a massive hit since it came out last year, but you might not know that you can record Stories clips without having to hold one of your digits on the record key. On the Stores screen, just swipe through the options at the bottom until you get to Hands-Free. Most people know you can delete any of the images you’ve already posted, but not everyone is aware that you can also edit them.

The alteration was just intended as a test, he said, giving no indication that it would be rolling out widely and properly any time in the near future.An Instagram statement suggested the change was a bug, rather than an accident, but both Mr Mosseri and the company\u0027s spokespeople were presumably referring to the same incident.“Due to a bug, some users saw a change to the way their feed appears today, the\u0026nbspstatement read.\u0026nbspWe quickly fixed the issue and feed is back to normal. We apologise for any confusion.Confusion as new Instagram appears and disappearsMr Mosseri only recently took up his position as Instagram’s boss, though he has worked for a long time at Facebook, most recently as the head of its News Feed. He was moved into his new\u0026nbsprole after Instagram’s founders left the company, reportedly in the wake of disagreements over its future direction.The roll-out of the change to the feed had already appeared strange: Instagram does usually allow small groups of people to test out new features, before slowly rolling them out to everyone who uses it. But this time around the update appeared to arrive on everyone’s phone all at once, dropping rapidly on Thursday afternoon UK time.When the change happened, it came with a screen that explained why it had arrived and how to use it. That suggested the change was not the result of a bug or that it had happened by accident, but presumably the same screen was only meant to be seen by the small number of people who would get access to the altered feed.Soon after, the new feed started reverting back to normal, before Instagram chose to announce that the update had been a mistake.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debate"},{"url":null,"title":"instagram update new scroll left right sideways feature explained","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

In a strange run of events, Apple froze trading on its stock and was forced to announce that its results were about to disappoint its investors.The announcement was meant primarily for Apple\u0027s shareholders, and the wide circle of analysts and financial markets that revolve around them. Tim Cook\u0027s letter announcing the change was addressed to its investors, and included information intended for them.For investors and Apple itself, it\u0027s a worrying statement about the future of the iPhone, and an admission that it was not going where it thoughtFor exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialBut the announcement could make a difference to Apple fans and iPhone users in a wide variety of not immediately obvious ways, some of which could be positive. It is one of the most important announcements about the future of its star handset that Apple has ever made, and so will matter in some small way to everyone who uses an iPhone or will do in the future.It matters, primarily, because Apple said that people are not buying as many iPhones\u0026nbspas expected, or as it needed to sell to ensure that its investors were happy. That, in turn, means that it will most likely adjust its strategy to try and make people buy more.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 42Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.5G wireless internet is expected to launch in 2019, with the potential to reach speeds of 50mbsUber has halted testing of driverless vehicles after a woman was killed by one of their cars in Tempe, Arizona.

But others revolve around central parts of Apple\u0027s strategy, which touch on all of its customers.In his letter announcing the weaker than expected results, Mr\u0026nbspCook cited a number of reasons to the drop. He pointed above all to weakness in China\u0027s economy – in part caused by an ongoing trade war between it and the US – but he also said that there were problems elsewhere, too.Chief among the other reasons for Apple\u0027s weaker than expected performance is likely to be the higher prices that it has started to charge for its iPhones, as well as other products.Gradually, Apple has pushed up the prices for both the cheapest versions of its new phones and the ones at the very top of the line. Over the last couple of years, Apple has changed its pricing strategy so that the cheapest model of the phone – the XR, which starts at $749 – would have been at the top end in the years that went before.As well as leading people to think twice about whether they can afford or want to pay that much for a new iPhone, the higher prices came at the same time Apple announced a wide-ranging and heavily discounted program to allow people to replace their phone\u0027s batteries. That came in response to a controversy that raged at Christmas last year, amid\u0026nbspsuggestions that Apple was intentionally slowing down old phones.Apple suggested that a higher-than-expected number of people taking up that deal – presumably in part because the battery replacements were so cheap, and a whole new phone was so expensive – had also helped dampen demand. At the same time, Apple made keeping an old phone more appealing in other ways, such as the new iOS 12 update that sped older handsets\u0026nbspup dramatically.That as well as other factors mean that people are holding onto their old iPhones for a longer period of time. And that means they\u0027re not buying new ones, hurting Apple.The company\u0027s response is still unknown and could come in a variety of forms. Apple might choose to cut the price of its most expensive models in future, for instance, meaning that the next phone will cost less it could also try and ramp up improvements in the coming years to ensure that the new handsets remain more compelling.Whatever happens, Apple appears to have been forced to realise that it has pushed the top end of the iPhone\u0027s pricing too far. Customers have given their verdict by just not buying the phones – and it will now be Apple\u0027s turn to try and convince them otherwise.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debate"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/10/29/17/iphone.jpg","title":"iphone apple battery replacement cheap last date price swap store","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

For the moment, a new battery costs only £25 – but once the new year arrives, that will rocket up to as much as £65.Old batteries can cause significant problems for their owners as iPhones age. With use, the power begins to drop – something that can lead to phones lasting for much less time, and to Apple having to slow down phones to ensure that they don\u0027t crash because they\u0027re not getting enough power.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialIt was the revelation that Apple was doing that – throttling performance on older phones, in line with more spectacular rumours that swirled before it was admitted – that led to the cheap repairs in the first place.When that story came out over the Christmas period in 2017, Apple apologised and said that as part of a range of ways of making it up to customers it would knock down the price of replacements, allowing people to restore their phone\u0027s performance if their battery had been degraded.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 42Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.5G wireless internet is expected to launch in 2019, with the potential to reach speeds of 50mbsUber has halted testing of driverless vehicles after a woman was killed by one of their cars in Tempe, Arizona.

Once the programme is over, the same service will cost £45 for most phones, and a full £65 for the iPhone X.Apple gives governments increased access to phone dataThe iPhone X recently became eligible for the throttling, which Apple still applies to more strained batteries to ensure they perform properly. One of the other forms of restitution offered to users was the option to turn that off, which can be found in Settings.Phones that are covered by its warranty period or extended AppleCare coverage will remain free, as they always have been.As the end of the year approaches, Apple Stores appear to be especially busy with users rushing to take advantage of the offer. Genius Bar appointments can be few and far between, though some customers have had success turning up at stores.The replacements require that a battery is sufficiently degraded, which will be checked by Geniuses at the store but can be seen by heading to the Battery options in the Settings app. But some customers appear to have successfully had batteries that are not under the critical 80 per cent mark swapped out all the same.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debate"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/12/27/12/samsung-galaxy-s10-leak-camera.jpg  width= 1254  height= 836  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/12/27/12/samsung-galaxy-s10-leak-camera.jpg","title":"samsung galaxy s10 release date price camera specs camera screen leaks","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

The new picture shows the latest object – floating millions of miles from Earth – which sits in the distant and mysterious Kuiper Belt on the edge of our Solar System.This flyby is a historic achievement, said New Horizons principal investigator Alan Stern. Never before has any spacecraft team tracked down such a small body at such high speed so far away in the abyss of space. New Horizons has set a new bar for state-of-the-art spacecraft navigation.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThe object had previously been compared to a peanut for its long ends and thin middle. But the newest pictures show it being shaped more like a snowman, made up of two rounded spheres that are connected in the middle.Nasa said Ultima\u0026nbspThule\u0026nbspwas once two separate objects, made up of what Nasa\u0026nbspcalls a contact binary. It was probably formed when a cloud of smaller, icy objects swirled around and began to combine – eventually, they formed two bigger bodies that swirled around each other until they touched and created the world that New Horizons has since explored.The two objects have probably been joined up for 99 per cent of the length of the Solar System said, Nasa said, nudging rather than smashing into each other in the beginnings of our neighbourhood. As such, it could be a way of looking back into the beginnings of our planets and those that surround us.New Horizons is like a time machine, taking us back to the birth of the solar system. We are seeing a physical representation of the beginning of planetary formation, frozen in time, said Jeff Moore, New Horizons Geology and Geophysics team lead. Studying Ultima Thule is helping us understand how planets form — both those in our own solar system and those orbiting other stars in our galaxy.The team behind the mission have dubbed the big sphere Ultima and the smaller one Thule. The name was bestowed on the object after a public competition in 2018, and is a reference to a Latin metaphor for places beyond the edges of the known world – though has drawn some criticism for its connection to Nazi imagery.The images were taken from just 17,000 miles away, of an object stretching only about 20 miles in length. (Ultima is roughly 12 miles up, while Thule makes up the other nine.)Still, the best colour close-ups won\u0027t be available until February. Those images should reveal whether Ultima Thule has any rings or moons, or craters on its dark, reddish surface. Altogether, it will take nearly two years for all of New Horizons\u0027 data to reach Earth.\u0026nbspThe observations should help scientists ascertain how deep-freeze objects like Ultima Thule formed, along with the rest of the solar system, 4.5 billion years ago.\u0026nbspAs a preserved relic from that original time, Ultima Thule also promises to shed light on the so-called Kuiper Belt, or Twilight Zone, in which hundreds of thousands of objects reside well beyond Neptune.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.130 Earth from the ISSFrom the International Space Station, Expedition 42 Flight Engineer Terry W.

Although NASA\u0027s Voyagers crossed the Kuiper Belt on their way to true interstellar space, their 1970s-era instruments were not nearly as sophisticated as those on New Horizons, Weaver noted, and the twin spacecraft did not pass near any objects known at the time.\u0026nbspThe New Horizons team is already pushing for another flyby in the 2020s, while the nuclear power and other spacecraft systems are still good.\u0026nbspBowman takes comfort and pleasure in knowing that long after New Horizons stops working, it will keep going on and on.\u0026nbspThere\u0027s a bit of all of us on that spacecraft, she said, and it will continue after we\u0027re long gone here on Earth.Additional reporting by agenciesOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

On first glance, the clan at its centre are just like any other, but their impulsive decision to take in a missing girl begins a series of rug-pulls you wouldn’t expect from a film such as this. A complex heartbreaker, albeit one that starts out looking like the more modest family dramas Kore-eda is known for.  “We knew there was a bad version of this movie that could exist,” said Game Night’s co-director John Francis Daley (the kid from Freaks and Geeks). This certainly isn’t it. Starring Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams as a competitive married couple who mistake an actual kidnapping for a particularly immersive role play game, Game Night is snappy, witty and fully committed to its brilliant, tonally unsettling conceit.  315 13. Isle of DogsAny Wes Anderson film is likely to be offbeat, fastidiously stylish and shot through with the auteur\u0027s understated drollery. Isle of Dogs is no different. A stop-motion story of abandoned canines taking on a corrupt human government, it\u0027s set in a futuristic Japan and deals with some pretty heavy themes (fascism, ethnic cleansing). Funny and full of heart.Peter Jackson’s First World War documentary is a remarkable step-forward for historical filmmaking. The Lord of the Rings director breathes new life into black and white archive footage from the Imperial War Museum, digitally restoring and smoothing the grainy source material before adding colour and sound. The result is a stunning cinematic experience that vividly brings the past into the present. By using the voices of veteran British soldiers interviewed about their experiences in the trenches, Jackson also includes a fascinating narrative that’s both gripping and informative. A wonderfully apt way to mark the centenary of the Great War. Nobody knew if Paul Schrader still had it in him to make a film as angry or as barbed as First Reformed. There is the same raw power here as found in his earlier features about tormented loners. Cinephiles will delight in the (sometimes a little self-conscious) references to Ingmar Bergman and Andrei Tarkovsky, but you can’t help but relish the intensity and intelligence in Ethan Hawke’s performance as the tormented, guilt-ridden priest.There were two Marvel films released this year, one of which – Avengers Infinity War – was an over-crowded, if ambitious, sequel. The other was a landmark film – not just for Marvel, but for cinema. Black Panther was fit to bursting with selling points, all combining to deliver the studio’s best film: Michael B Jordan’s standout villain, scene-stealing performances from Danai Guria and Letitia Wright, plus the direction of Creed’s Ryan Coogler who proved an inspired appointment. Wakanda forever, indeed.Pawel Pawlikowski’s Cold War, shot in the sleekest black and white, is an effortlessly stylish and romantic drama set in a period of political convulsion. It offers everything from Polish folk music to the sultriest Birth of the Cool-style jazz. Pawlikowski includes moments of reckless hedonism alongside scenes of exile and imprisonment. Best of all, the film has a truly wonderful performance from Joanna Kulig as Zula, the free-spirited young folk singer turned femme fatale.There are no two ways about it: Bradley Cooper\u0027s rock star Jackson Mane inviting Ally – a small-town waitress played by Lady Gaga – onto stage to sing her song in front of thousands of his fans is movie magic. Regardless of your stance on the film\u0027s back half and pretty maudlin ending, A Star is Born is an old-fashioned success story with an intensity that brings up the hairs on the back of your neck.Director Chloé Zhao took a gamble casting a real-life family in this modern-day western about a cowboy named Brady Blackburn (Brady Jandreau). It pays off – this an authentic portrait of contemporary rodeo life in South Dakota. From her amateur cast she somehow coaxes performances more memorable than most pros manage in their entire careers. As moving as it is bold, The Rider also offers an all-too-rare female perspective on masculinity. Eight years after Winter’s Bone made a star of Jennifer Lawrence, Leave No Trace – director Debra Granik’s first feature film since then – should rightly make a star of Thomasin McKenzie too. Based on the book My Abandonment by Peter Rook, Leave No Trace is virtually a two-hander between McKenzie and Ben Foster. They play a PTSD-suffering war veteran and his daughter, who live in the forests of Oregon, fending for themselves. Even when the two are arrested and placed in government housing, the film refuses to be anything other than understated and is all the more beguiling for it.1115 5. The Shape of WaterLoneliness can sometimes feel like your soul has been chained to the bottom of the ocean, at other times it can feel like you’re speaking a language no one else understands. Guillermo del Toro beautifully illustrates both these nuances in his Oscar-winning fantasy romance, in which a mute woman (Sally Hawkins) unexpectedly falls for a strange aquatic creature (Doug Jones), the only one who sees her as she truly wants to be seen. Theirs is a love so mystical, so overwhelming, that it can only be communicated through the language of dreams. Lady Bird will always be close to our hearts. There are times when it feels less like a film, more like a hand tracing delicately through memories, of what it felt like to grow up, to say goodbye, and to find one\u0027s own place in the universe. Greta Gerwig’s story of a teenager, played by Saoirse Ronan, desperate to escape her hometown and seek the intellectual haven of the East Coast colleges (“where the culture is”, she argues) may be specific in its layout, but it is universal in its emotions. Whenever Lynne Ramsey attaches her name to a film, you know to expect something special. You Were Never Really Here marks a career-high for the British auteur, who manages to condense the violent story of a former military man searching for a stolen girl into a viciously edited 90-minute thriller. Joaquin Phoenix makes for the perfect enigmatic leading man, while Jonny Greenwood’s mechanical, piercing score adds to the decidedly eerie atmosphere.Should Phantom Thread really be Daniel Day-Lewis’s final film, then the actor can retire knowing that Reynolds Woodcock ranks among his greatest roles. Day-Lewis plays the egomaniacal fashion designer with a childish whimsy, but there\u0027s also a spectral quality to him that looms in every scene. Lesley Manville’s deliciously funny Cyril and Vicky Krieps’s superbly sharp Alma offer two cunning counters to Reynolds’s growing appetite for self-destruction, making for some wonderfully heated confrontations. Paul Thomas Anderson’s direction allows each character to blossom on screen, in a film that makes for a masterful study of poisonous relationships.Loosely based on his own childhood, Alfonso Cuaron\u0027s follow-up to the Oscar-winning Gravity is a gorgeous piece of film-making, a quiet paean to the women who raised him. It\u0027s a neorealist masterpiece, shot in 65mm black and white, and built from detailed vignettes of domestic life in early 1970s Mexico City, a time there of great social unrest. Savour every scene: the camera takes it all in, as we follow a young Mixtec woman named Cleo (wonderful newcomer Yalitza Aparicio) who looks after a well-to-do family she comes to think of as her own. It\u0027s about love, grief and resilience: it will slay you.Japanese filmmaker Hirokazu Kore-eda’s Shoplifters could be the year’s most disarming film. On first glance, the clan at its centre are just like any other, but their impulsive decision to take in a missing girl begins a series of rug-pulls you wouldn’t expect from a film such as this. A complex heartbreaker, albeit one that starts out looking like the more modest family dramas Kore-eda is known for.  “We knew there was a bad version of this movie that could exist,” said Game Night’s co-director John Francis Daley (the kid from Freaks and Geeks). This certainly isn’t it. Starring Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams as a competitive married couple who mistake an actual kidnapping for a particularly immersive role play game, Game Night is snappy, witty and fully committed to its brilliant, tonally unsettling conceit.  315 13. Isle of DogsAny Wes Anderson film is likely to be offbeat, fastidiously stylish and shot through with the auteur\u0027s understated drollery. Isle of Dogs is no different. A stop-motion story of abandoned canines taking on a corrupt human government, it\u0027s set in a futuristic Japan and deals with some pretty heavy themes (fascism, ethnic cleansing). Funny and full of heart.Peter Jackson’s First World War documentary is a remarkable step-forward for historical filmmaking. The Lord of the Rings director breathes new life into black and white archive footage from the Imperial War Museum, digitally restoring and smoothing the grainy source material before adding colour and sound. The result is a stunning cinematic experience that vividly brings the past into the present. By using the voices of veteran British soldiers interviewed about their experiences in the trenches, Jackson also includes a fascinating narrative that’s both gripping and informative. A wonderfully apt way to mark the centenary of the Great War. Nobody knew if Paul Schrader still had it in him to make a film as angry or as barbed as First Reformed. There is the same raw power here as found in his earlier features about tormented loners. Cinephiles will delight in the (sometimes a little self-conscious) references to Ingmar Bergman and Andrei Tarkovsky, but you can’t help but relish the intensity and intelligence in Ethan Hawke’s performance as the tormented, guilt-ridden priest.There were two Marvel films released this year, one of which – Avengers Infinity War – was an over-crowded, if ambitious, sequel. The other was a landmark film – not just for Marvel, but for cinema. Black Panther was fit to bursting with selling points, all combining to deliver the studio’s best film: Michael B Jordan’s standout villain, scene-stealing performances from Danai Guria and Letitia Wright, plus the direction of Creed’s Ryan Coogler who proved an inspired appointment. Wakanda forever, indeed.Pawel Pawlikowski’s Cold War, shot in the sleekest black and white, is an effortlessly stylish and romantic drama set in a period of political convulsion. It offers everything from Polish folk music to the sultriest Birth of the Cool-style jazz. Pawlikowski includes moments of reckless hedonism alongside scenes of exile and imprisonment. Best of all, the film has a truly wonderful performance from Joanna Kulig as Zula, the free-spirited young folk singer turned femme fatale.There are no two ways about it: Bradley Cooper\u0027s rock star Jackson Mane inviting Ally – a small-town waitress played by Lady Gaga – onto stage to sing her song in front of thousands of his fans is movie magic. Regardless of your stance on the film\u0027s back half and pretty maudlin ending, A Star is Born is an old-fashioned success story with an intensity that brings up the hairs on the back of your neck.Director Chloé Zhao took a gamble casting a real-life family in this modern-day western about a cowboy named Brady Blackburn (Brady Jandreau). It pays off – this an authentic portrait of contemporary rodeo life in South Dakota. From her amateur cast she somehow coaxes performances more memorable than most pros manage in their entire careers. As moving as it is bold, The Rider also offers an all-too-rare female perspective on masculinity. Eight years after Winter’s Bone made a star of Jennifer Lawrence, Leave No Trace – director Debra Granik’s first feature film since then – should rightly make a star of Thomasin McKenzie too. Based on the book My Abandonment by Peter Rook, Leave No Trace is virtually a two-hander between McKenzie and Ben Foster. They play a PTSD-suffering war veteran and his daughter, who live in the forests of Oregon, fending for themselves. Even when the two are arrested and placed in government housing, the film refuses to be anything other than understated and is all the more beguiling for it.1115 5. The Shape of WaterLoneliness can sometimes feel like your soul has been chained to the bottom of the ocean, at other times it can feel like you’re speaking a language no one else understands. Guillermo del Toro beautifully illustrates both these nuances in his Oscar-winning fantasy romance, in which a mute woman (Sally Hawkins) unexpectedly falls for a strange aquatic creature (Doug Jones), the only one who sees her as she truly wants to be seen. Theirs is a love so mystical, so overwhelming, that it can only be communicated through the language of dreams. Lady Bird will always be close to our hearts. There are times when it feels less like a film, more like a hand tracing delicately through memories, of what it felt like to grow up, to say goodbye, and to find one\u0027s own place in the universe. Greta Gerwig’s story of a teenager, played by Saoirse Ronan, desperate to escape her hometown and seek the intellectual haven of the East Coast colleges (“where the culture is”, she argues) may be specific in its layout, but it is universal in its emotions. Whenever Lynne Ramsey attaches her name to a film, you know to expect something special. You Were Never Really Here marks a career-high for the British auteur, who manages to condense the violent story of a former military man searching for a stolen girl into a viciously edited 90-minute thriller. Joaquin Phoenix makes for the perfect enigmatic leading man, while Jonny Greenwood’s mechanical, piercing score adds to the decidedly eerie atmosphere.Should Phantom Thread really be Daniel Day-Lewis’s final film, then the actor can retire knowing that Reynolds Woodcock ranks among his greatest roles. Day-Lewis plays the egomaniacal fashion designer with a childish whimsy, but there\u0027s also a spectral quality to him that looms in every scene. Lesley Manville’s deliciously funny Cyril and Vicky Krieps’s superbly sharp Alma offer two cunning counters to Reynolds’s growing appetite for self-destruction, making for some wonderfully heated confrontations. Paul Thomas Anderson’s direction allows each character to blossom on screen, in a film that makes for a masterful study of poisonous relationships.Loosely based on his own childhood, Alfonso Cuaron\u0027s follow-up to the Oscar-winning Gravity is a gorgeous piece of film-making, a quiet paean to the women who raised him.

Clunge. Muffwagon. Goodness, it’s been a long time since we’ve heard those creative expressions of male sexual frustration, and it\u0027s\u0026nbspnice to hear them again, like old friends, or “Fwends” in this case. The Inbetweeners are back. Sort of.Even by the usually self-congratulatory standards of tellyland, the total of four hours and 10 minutes of airtime devoted by Channel 4 to their 2008 hit The Inbetweeners\u0026nbspis\u0026nbspa tad self-indulgent, though it is one of the channel’s recent glories.\u0026nbspHosted, inevitably, by the roughly contemporaneous Jimmy Carr, the first two hours of this teenage marathon, The Inbetweeners: Fwends Reunited, is given over to a sort of mix of This is Your Life, An Audience With..., and Radio 4’s The Reunion. That is followed by four full episodes of the series, mostly for the devotees, I imagine, as well as any stray viewers unfamiliar with this comedic landmark to judge this odyssey of pubic discovery, adolescence and embarrassment at first hand.\u0026nbspFor exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialIn all, The Inbetweeners ran to three series and two films, predominantly onanistic in tone, and most of the cast and creators turn\u0026nbspup for this celebration of its 10th anniversary. The Fwends Reunited show is dominated, naturally, by the four sixth form virginal idiots a good shag would have probably sorted out, but who, fortunately for us, never got lucky. Simon Bird (as Will McKenzie), Joe Thomas (Simon Cooper), James Buckley (Jay Cartwright) and Blake Harrison (Neil Sutherland) confirm the impression that they were basically playing themselves in The Inbetweeners and haven’t changed much since the last piece was smut was propelled like a flying turd into the public’s consciousness in 2014. I just hope their real-time personas have managed to “plunge some clunge” as they approach early middle age. Not sure, though.Given the vast prairie of time to fill, the producers plunder every known format to maintain some kind of momentum, and mostly to good effect, \u0026nbspthanks to the timeless quality of the original gags. So there is a series of “Awards” for stuff like “best bodily malfunction”, and I for one will never tire of seeing Simon projectile vomiting semi-digested creme de menthe on his girlfriend’s six-year-old brother nor of Simon’s left testicle hanging forlornly from his posing pouch in the school fashion show nor of watching Will tearfully confessing to his teacher that “I thought it was a fart”, as he had to be escorted from the A level exam room. You can almost smell the, er, shame.\u0026nbspThe 10 best TV shows of 2018The Inbetweeners\u0027 James Buckley \u0027could have died\u0027 filming boat scene There is a mini-quiz segment too, featuring Inbetweeners “super fans” whose programme knowledge exceeded that of the cast themselves, with a scholarly textual grasp of lines such as: “What is Swansea. Is it an animal?” “What\u0027s this pesto stuff? Is it for humans?” and “Just cos you’ve had your first puff on your first joint it doesn’t make you Kurt Cobain.”One super fan even had a tattoo of a grinning Jay with the inscription “CLUNGE” garnishing her upper thigh – ironically about as close as Jay ever got to a lady’s bodily treasure.The quiz “prize”, won by a Will lookalike in specs and a blazer, is a bright yellow M-reg Fiat Cinquecento Hawaii Edition, complete with “tape deck” and red passenger door.This runabout is also the co-star of the Fwends show and features in the freshly filmed sequences, such as their nostalgic trip back to Rudge Park Comprehensive\u0026nbsp(, as Carr puts it “in a car none of them owned to a school none of them went to”. Will relives the moment when he shat himself, which is, well, moving.Created with Sketch.Best TV of 2018 Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Lennie James\u0027s missing-child thriller Save Me looked as though it might be a paint-by-numbers affair. Instead it was a gripping start to Sky Atlantic\u0027s impressive run, with James taking the lead as Nelly, the womanising bum who gains a new lease of investigative energy when his estranged daughter Jody vanishes. A smart script kept us guessing right up to an ending that denied us the closure we had expected. A second series has been commissioned.  210 9) Cunk on BritainHow much you enjoyed Philomena Cunk\u0027s history of Britain depended on how funny you find Diane Morgan\u0027s resting confused face. I find it hilarious. Her interviewees are kind of in on the joke but clearly briefed to take it as seriously as possible. They’ll be mid-flow and she will cock her head and drain all the interest from her face. “What\u0027s the most political thing that\u0027s ever happened?” she asked Robert Peston, who did his best to answer with a straight face. Co-producer Charlie Brooker\u0027s fingerprints are everywhere in the way Morgan\u0027s vain, poorly informed, easily distracted Cunk operates within a ruthlessly satirical production, which sends up the tropes and cliches of every dodgy documentary and history programme. She might not be the comic creation we need, but she is the one we deserve right now. You either love Julia Davis or think her sick filth ought to be banned. Sally4Ever proved yet again that there is nobody working today – or at least nobody with the same platform – with a blacker sense of humour. Sally (Catherine Shepherd) was already surrounded by monsters: her loser of a boyfriend (Alex MacQueen) and tricky colleagues played by Julian Barratt and Felicity Montagu. Then Emma (Davis herself) arrived, a tornado of sex and bad intentions. Beneath the shagging, drugs, excrement, manipulation and malice were pockets of tenderness, but you had to look pretty hard to see them. Luckily there were also gales of laughter. N.b. If you have yet to see it, please do not watch it with your parents or children on Boxing Day and then write in to complain.This was a spiritual successor rather than a sequel to The Night Manager. It was still a Le Carré adaptation on the BBC sprinkled with famous faces, but the differences were as pronounced as the similarities. Park Chan-Wook, the Korean auteur, directed with a high sense of style. Florence Pugh was dazzling as the ingenue actress Charlie, recruited for a dangerous mission across Europe, ably supported by Alexander Skarsgard and Michael Shannon as her spook handlers. Some viewers switched off after the first episodes, which took time to set the scene. They missed out on a vivid, beautifully told thriller. Hugh Grant… can act? That was the first surprise in this smooth, stylish BBC retelling of the Jeremy Thorpe scandal. He burst convincingly out of the charming fop mould he has slept in so comfortably for thirty years. What have we been missing all this time? The other shock was remembering how recent it all was. The government is still up to a lot of nonsense, but the days of this kind of cover-up, for these reasons, is surely over. Or is it?Edward St Aubyn\u0027s Patrick Melrose novels have the kind of precisely drawn interiority that makes any kind of adaptation seem doomed to fail. Instead, the Sky Atlantic series brought them convincingly to life. It is not a happy tale. In flashback we saw Patrick\u0027s childhood in the shadow of his monstrous father David (Hugo Weaving), and the decades of self-loathing and substance abuse that followed. At the centre of all this was Benedict Cumberbatch, as good as he\u0027s ever been. His Patrick could be brilliant, witty, cruel and pitiful, sometimes in the same smack-addled sentence. Weaving, Jennifer Jason Leigh as David\u0027s wife Eleanor and Pip Torrens as his ghastly friend Nicholas Pratt all put in memorable performances, too. At an age where most of us are long past doing anything, David Attenborough is still changing our expectations of what a nature documentary can do. Like The Rolling Stones, he has been on his farewell tour since about 1970, but unlike Jagger \u0026amp Co, the returns are not diminishing. Is he fuelled by anger at the world\u0027s response to climate change? Or simply driven by some massive internal dynamo, a soul-quest to improve our ability to relate to penguins? Whatever the motivation, Dynasties was wonderful, telling complex stories of the animal kingdom with beautiful photography. It\u0027s unusual for a TV writer to attract more attention than the stars or director. Perhaps the world is changing. Or perhaps it\u0027s simply that the writer of Killing Eve was Phoebe Waller-Bridge, star of Fleabag, Star Wars and one of the country\u0027s outstanding new talents. Here she turned her hand to a spy thriller, an adaptation of Luke Jennings\u0027 novels about a beautiful assassin, Villanelle (Jodie Comer), and the MI6 agent given the task of hunting her down, Eve Polastri (Sandra Oh). Both leads demanded attention: Comer the magnetic murderer, Oh the harassed but brilliant spy. The script swerved between comedy, action and drama often enough to keep everyone guessing.  Yes, the national team have played on television in a World Cup before, but I\u0027m including this because the outcome, an England penalty shoot-out victory, was so unusual as to count as a whole new format. At a time when we all watch things at different times, here was something unmistakably live. We watched Gareth Southgate\u0027s men knowing that the rest of the country was, too, poised in living rooms and pub gardens, ready to bury their heads in a sofa or throw their pints in the air. No other TV programme sold as many waistcoats. The ageing patriarch and his scheming children. Not an original concept. Trust, the drama about the last days of Getty family, proved that it was possible for a series built on this premise to have actors, scenery, direction, script, etc etc, and still somehow fall short. Succession, by comparison, felt alive. If US production values and ambition gave it its scale, its heart was dark and British. We can thank Jesse Armstrong, co-creator of Peep Show, and his all-star line-up of British writers, including the Lucy Prebble, Tony Roche and Georgia Pritchett. They made the Roy family expats themselves, and you could hear the old aristocratic froideur in every withering put-down. But we cared for them, too. One of the many TV professionals I consulted for this list thought Succession was so much better than everything else this year that the top 10 should just have it listed in bold and then nine blank spaces. I wouldn\u0027t go that far but it\u0027s certainly at the top.Lennie James\u0027s missing-child thriller Save Me looked as though it might be a paint-by-numbers affair.

I wouldn\u0027t go that far but it\u0027s certainly at the top.The talking (dick) heads are good too, especially when creators Damon Beesley and Iain Morris explain the genesis of some of the set pieces, often based on their own life experiences. Beesley, for example, confesses how he had ranted some foul-mouthed sarcastic abuse at some hapless kids for pushing in at an amusement park before bullying his way onto the ride. Smug, he turned to them and only then discovered that the selfish bastards were at the front of the rollercoaster because they had Down syndrome.\u0026nbspGreg Davies’s presence as the bad-tempered teacher Mr Gilbert is also enjoyable. No wonder that Davies went into comedy having himself been a bad-tempered teacher (“a living hell” in his seemingly sincere description). Waen Shepherd (Mr “Paedo” Kennedy) is extremely game to join in the fun –\u0026nbspperhaps surprising given the times we live in. Indeed, I wonder, only a few years on, if phrases such as “spaz” and “rapey” could be scripted now.You could call it a retrospective then, if you were pretentious enough, or “going in balls deep” if you’re Jimmy Carr. Although it lacks a certain pointfulness - the cast are even more absurdly old to play adolescents again and there will \u0026nbspbe no more episodes or movies \u0026nbsp- and all concerned refuse to take itself too seriously, which is just as well. Like a more successful sort of school reunion.\u0026nbspThere’s nothing more tedious than people earnestly trying to deconstruct comedy: much better instead just to get on with the clips and the poo jokes. And so they do, and so does Will get a high speed turd in the face from a water chute, and suddenly we are all back in the sixth form disco again.\u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

What the hell is this?!” someone wrote.Another person wondered: “Why does everyone seem like they don’t want to be there?”“All they had to do is write an hour long episode about a school reunion and everyone would’ve been happy,” someone else tweeted.\u0026nbsp”But NO, we get this rubbish.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

And the betting markets think there is a 40 per cent chance of it happening. But how could it come about?\u0026nbspThe first problem is time. There isn’t time to hold a referendum on a normal timetable, which would take at least six months. Of course, Greece held a referendum on the 2015 bailout in just eight days, but in Britain simply getting the legislation through a hung parliament would be impossible before exit day, 29 March.\u0026nbspIf such an obstacle arose, the UK would have another way to gain more time, by cancelling its notice to leave altogether. The European Court of Justice last month confirmed that we have a unilateral right to do so, but that does mean that, if the people voted again to leave, the Article 50 procedure would have to be started again from the beginning.\u0026nbspHow, then, could a double decision\u0026nbsp– to postpone Brexit in order to hold a referendum – happen? The first attempt will probably be on the day of the big vote on the Brexit deal, which is expected to be on 14 or 15 January. Sir Vince Cable, leader of the Liberal Democrats, is likely to table an amendment calling for a new referendum, which will be voted on first. It is bound to be defeated, because Labour will not, at this stage, support it.\u0026nbspPressure on Corbyn as Labour members back fresh Brexit referendumAfter the motion to approve the prime minister’s deal goes down to its predicted defeat, however, things could change. Once Labour has tried and presumably failed to force a general election, Jeremy Corbyn will have to decide the party’s next step. This is the significance of the YouGov\u0026nbspsurvey of Labour members, carried out last month for the ESRC-funded Party Members Project run by Professor Tim Bale of Queen Mary University of London.\u0026nbspThis found that 72 per cent of party members want a new referendum (18 per cent do not 10 per cent don’t know), and that Corbyn’s rating among them has fallen from 80 per cent in March to 65 per cent now. Having said he would respect the will of Labour members, Corbyn would be under pressure to support a referendum. At the moment, Labour policy is simply that it is one of the “options remaining on the table” if a general election is not possible.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Final Say petition delivered to Downing Street Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Today the Independent\u0027s Final Say campaign and People\u0027s Vote delivered to 10 Downing Street their respective petitions calling for a public referendum on Theresa May\u0027s Brexit dealL to R:  Christian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney, Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna, Lara Anne Spirit from People\u0027s Vote, Caroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Holly Baxter, Co-Editor Independent Voices and Christina Koci-Edwards from People\u0027s Vote hand in a petition to Downing StreetFront row L to R: Christina Koci-Edwards from People\u0027s Vote, Caroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna, Christian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Vince Cable Lib Dem MP for Twickenham, Lara Anne Spirit from People\u0027s Vote and Justine Greening, Conservative MP for PutneyThe Independent\u0027s editor Christian Broughton delivered over one million Final Say signatures and People\u0027s Vote spokesman Chuka Umunna MP delivered 300,000 signatures to Downing Street on Monday December 3 at middayA supporter of the second referendum helps Vince Cable Lib Dem MP for Twickenham out of the rain during a protestL to R:  Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna, Lara Anne Spirit from People\u0027s Vote, Christian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Caroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney and Christina Koci-Edwards from People\u0027s Vote on their way to hand in a petition to Downing StreetChristian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney and Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna hand in the petition to Downing StreetCaroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna and Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney hand in petitions to Downing StreetToday the Independent\u0027s Final Say campaign and People\u0027s Vote delivered to 10 Downing Street their respective petitions calling for a public referendum on Theresa May\u0027s Brexit dealL to R:  Christian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney, Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna, Lara Anne Spirit from People\u0027s Vote, Caroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Holly Baxter, Co-Editor Independent Voices and Christina Koci-Edwards from People\u0027s Vote hand in a petition to Downing StreetFront row L to R: Christina Koci-Edwards from People\u0027s Vote, Caroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna, Christian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Vince Cable Lib Dem MP for Twickenham, Lara Anne Spirit from People\u0027s Vote and Justine Greening, Conservative MP for PutneyThe Independent\u0027s editor Christian Broughton delivered over one million Final Say signatures and People\u0027s Vote spokesman Chuka Umunna MP delivered 300,000 signatures to Downing Street on Monday December 3 at middayA supporter of the second referendum helps Vince Cable Lib Dem MP for Twickenham out of the rain during a protestL to R:  Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna, Lara Anne Spirit from People\u0027s Vote, Christian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Caroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney and Christina Koci-Edwards from People\u0027s Vote on their way to hand in a petition to Downing StreetChristian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney and Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna hand in the petition to Downing StreetCaroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna and Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney hand in petitions to Downing StreetIf the shadow cabinet backed the policy, it is possible that there would be a majority in the House of Commons in favour of a second referendum – although we haven’t even considered the awkward question of what the question on the ballot paper would be. If that can be overcome, it would still require a large number of Conservative MPs to back it, to offset the unknown number of Labour MPs who\u0026nbspwould vote against.\u0026nbspConstitutionally, Theresa May could ignore such a vote, but politically it would be unthinkable to defy the majority of the Commons – and, if she cannot win the vote for her deal, it must be suspected that she would rather go for postponement and a referendum than for a no-deal Brexit.\u0026nbspThe chances of a new referendum depend, therefore, on Jeremy Corbyn and the precise numbers of anti-referendum rebel Labour MPs versus pro-referendum Tory MPs.\u0026nbspGot an unanswered question about Brexit?

We should then go back to the EU with a discussion about a customs union.”Mr Corbyn also urged Labour supporters demanding he stop Brexit to “recognise a number of things”, saying: “About 60 per cent of Labour voters voted remain, about 40 per cent voted leave. We have to recognise why people voted in those directions.Conservative and Labour MPs join forces to stop no-deal Brexit“Labour is unique as a party, because it’s got to bring all sides together – hence my view on a customs union, on access to the market.”However, some estimates have put Labour voters’ backing remain at more than 60 per cent – while one recent poll found their support for a further referendum to be 80 per cent.The interview triggered a backlash from some Labour MPs, Chris Leslie, the Nottingham East MP, tweeting: “If Jeremy Corbyn facilitates Brexit he’ll share responsibility for the job losses, trade barriers and decade of austerity to come.Angela Smith, the Penistone and Stocksbridge MP, said: “We need to get the message over to Jeremy Corbyn that Labour members and supporters want a People’s Vote.”Created with Sketch.Newspapers react to Theresa May pulling the vote on her Brexit deal Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.And Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, said: “There you have it, Jeremy Corbyn refuses once again to take the blinkers off. He is ignoring the concerns of his own supporters and the economic damage experts warn Brexit will do to the UK economy.”In reality, the chances of a snap election in the new year are slim, with Theresa May having ruled it out – and many Tories opposed to her deal happy to run down the clock to a no-deal Brexit.Instead, Mr Corbyn is under pressure to swing behind a fresh referendum if – as seems certain – the prime minister loses the “meaningful vote”, in the second week of January and his vote of no confidence in her government fails.Some Labour insiders believe Labour backing for a referendum is all-but certain in those circumstances, given the party\u0027s inability to set out what the other “options on the table” it could pursue might be.Expats set to lose healthcare under no-deal Brexit, NHS toldThink homelessness is bad now?

Everything up until now – the endless disputes, crises and resignations, the huge cost, both in gold and other reforms forgone, are just a prelude for the tougher task ahead.If the UK leaves the EU this year, it will do so with no blueprint for its future trading terms, after Brussels comprehensively torched the Chequers plan in September.To give one example of the tortures ahead, the Commons would have to decide, in the summer of 2020, whether to implement the Irish border backstop the following January – the key controversy currently obsessing MPs.Created with Sketch.

It will take many more years than that.Even if the UK ever puts forward realistic proposals, trade talks will be held up by MEP elections and the appointment of new commissioners – creating a vacuum ripe for new more Tory Euro-wars.And the alternative to embracing the backstop – the UK staying under EU rules beyond 2020, while paying tens of billions of pounds more for the privilege – is scarcely more appealing.Turn a corner? The reality is the same road, stretching far into the distance – but strewn with even bigger potholes and boulders.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

By the time\u0026nbspthe brand’s popularity peaked in the 1960s, the company had 1,141 branches around the country.\u0026nbspKirkby New Town, Lancashire, in 1967 (George W HalesFox PhotosGetty)Woolworths\u0026nbspbegan to run into trouble in the 1980s\u0026nbspand responded by pulling\u0026nbspout of the Irish market and abandoning its out-of-town hypermarket format stores as a failure. It also vacated its big city centre department store premises like Briggate in Leeds\u0026nbspin favour of open single-storey shops.At the turn of the millennium, the company tried various means to stay afloat, attempting to rival Argos with a “Big Red Book” ordering scheme and hiring oddly matched celebrities like\u0026nbspJackie Chan and\u0026nbspKelly Osbourne\u0026nbspfor their advertising campaigns.\u0026nbspBy late 2008, administrators Deloitte had been called in and all remaining 807 stores were gradually closed, resulting in 27,000 job losses.

We’ve just accomplished the most distant flyby.”Nasa administrator Jim Bridenstine said: “In addition to being the first to explore Pluto, today New Horizons flew by the most distant object ever visited by a spacecraft and became the first to directly explore an object that holds remnants from the birth of our solar system.“This is what leadership in space exploration is all about.”The radio message from the robotic craft was picked up in Madrid by one of Nasa’s big antennas. The data took six hours and eight minutes to traverse the massive breadth of space between Ultima and Earth.According to Nasa, scientists had not discovered Ultima Thule when the probe was launched in 2006, meaning the mission was unique. In 2014, astronomers found Thule using the Hubble Space Telescope and selected it for New Horizon’s extended mission in 2015. “Anything’s possible out there in this very unknown region,” said John Spencer, deputy project scientist for New Horizons. Launched in January 2006, New Horizons embarked on a 4 billion mile journey towards the solar system’s frigid edge to study the dwarf planet Pluto and its five moons. The spacecraft, which is the size of a baby grand piano, flew past Pluto in 2015, providing the first close-up views of the planet. During the flyby, the probe found Pluto to be slightly larger than previously thought. In March, it revealed that methane-rich dunes were on the icy dwarf planet’s surface.After trekking 1 billion miles beyond Pluto into the Kuiper belt, New Horizons will now seek clues about the formation of the solar system and its planets.There is a great deal scientists can learn from Ultima and the hundreds of thousands of similar bodies scientists deem to be in the solar system. Hal Weaver, project scientist on the mission, told the BBC the rock is “probably the most primitive object ever encountered by a spacecraft, the best possible relic of the early solar system”. The object is officially known as 2014 MU69, but was nicknamed Ultima Thule, a Latin phrase which means “beyond the borders of the known world”.Additional reporting by ReutersOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Previous spacecraft have seen the far side, but none have landed on it.The landing lifted the mysterious veil of the far side of the moon and opened a new chapter in human lunar exploration, the agency said in a statement on its website, which included a wide-angle colour picture of a crater from the moon\u0027s surface.Chang\u0027e-4 lunar probe (EPA)The probe, which has a lander and a rover, touched down at a targeted area near the moon\u0027s south pole in the Von Karman Crater after entering the moon\u0027s orbit in mid-December.The tasks of the Chang\u0027e-4 include astronomical observation, surveying the moon\u0027s terrain, landform and mineral makeup, and measuring the neutron radiation and neutral atoms to study the environment of its far side.In a tweet, Nasa\u0027s administrator, Jim Bridenstine, praised China for its impressive\u0026nbspaccomplishment.\u0026nbspChang\u0027e-4 probe after its landing (AP)Congratulations to China’s Chang’e-4 team for what appears to be a successful landing on the far side of the Moon. This is a first for humanity and an impressive accomplishment!The landing is a milestone for China in its race to catch up with Russia and the US and become a major space power by 2030. Beijing plans to launch construction of its own manned space station next year.While China has insisted its ambitions are purely peaceful, the US\u0026nbspDefense Department has accused it of pursuing activities aiming to prevent other nations from using space-based assets during a crisis.Chang\u0027e-4 made the first-ever landing on the far side of the moon (AP)Besides its civilian ambitions, China has tested anti-satellite missiles, and the US\u0026nbspCongress has banned Nasa\u0026nbspfrom two-way cooperation with its Chinese counterpart over security concerns.As competition accelerates in space,\u0026nbspDonald Trump seeks to create a new Space Force by 2020, as the sixth branch of the military.China lands spacecraft on far side of moon in world firstBut the private space race is also heating up, as numerous companies aim to commercialise space travel, such as California-based SpaceX, which has upended the industry with its low-cost reusable Falcon 9 rockets.The US\u0026nbspis the only country to have landed humans on the moon, and Mr Trump said in 2017 he wanted to return astronauts to the lunar surface to build a foundation for an eventual Mars mission.Nasa\u0026nbspadministrators have said people could be put on Mars by as soon as the mid-2030s, with the agency having landed eight spacecraft there, the most recent in November.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Two men walk past a damaged cargo train after an accident in Nyborg, Denmark.

We want the government to:Together, these changes will help Make Universal Credit Work.Join our Universal Credit Facebook group or email UniversalCredit@the-sun to share your story. Getting Brits paid faster would also help stop thousands from falling into debt when they move over.The Sun has told how countless Brits have been pushed into debt waiting for the first payment to come through.Ministers are already paying  weeks of extra benefits to those claiming housing costs when they transfer, and those on ESA and JSA will get an extra payment by  too, it was confirmed in the Budget.If the payments were also extended to cover those on working tax credits at the moment, it could help  million people who claimed them in  .The DWP could also speed up the time to process payments by using the Faster Payments process for all claims - they currently use them only when payment is needed the same day.The BACS payment they currently use can take up to three days just to clear. The Resolution Foundation is also calling for single parents to get their own work allowance of at least  hours on the minimum wage.Experts calculate that raising the work allowance - the amount people on Universal Credit can earn without losing any benefits -  would help , employees.That means a single mum who was renting could get an extra £, a year - more than £ a month.They also argue that introducing a second earner work allowance of  hours on minimum wage would boost the income of a family with a child by £, a year too.It would cost £.billion to put in place, RF calculated.Laura Gardiner said:“The Chancellor’s recent decision to reinvest in Universal Credit by increasing Work Allowances will deliver a £ living standards boost to millions of families, and shows where further support should be prioritised. "},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT000459022098.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"2019 is full of hope","story":"We have much to look forward to in the months ahead.You would scarcely believe it when listening to the Remain doom-mongers but away from the Westminster bubble, Britain is thriving.Today, Brits have never had more cash in their pockets.

It was, in fact, built  years ago to house a gentlemans fossil collection.“Of course, now it has become something of a relic itself.“Its a building that doesnt want to stand up anymore. It just wants to fall over in two big halves. Well, its going to as its owners are going to try and repair it.”Jimmy told the MailOnline: “The project was more transformative than we had originally anticipated as we had our second child during the house build. We are now a happy and growing family of four in a two-bedroom house, so it is time for us to move on to the next stage in our lives.“This is a beautul and award-winning house, ideal for a couple looking to live in a unique place that is truly inspiring.”There’s a compact kitchen on the ground floor with an octagonal living room on the first and two bedrooms on the second.It also features a terrace roof with a seating area and a staircase on the outside leading to the main entrance.The couple had originally set a budget of £, for the renovation and had to borrow £, from Jimmy’s parents to keep the work going.The family eventually moved into the property in March  after a number of delays.Annabel Dixon, of property website Zoopla, said: “This is a beautully-renovated property.

After the clock struck , the fire brigade was called for burning rubbish bins in the Etangs Noirs borough.At the spot in Rue Piers we saw a number of youths. There was quite a lot of smoke by fireworks on the streets, even though that is forbidden.Multiple rubbish bins and also a Christmas tree were on fire. There was a huge number of youths on the street, but the police were nowhere to be seen.According to Labourdette, the firefighters had to call off their mission because their safety could not be guaranteed.On their way back, their fire truck was reportedly attacked with projectiles and stones thrown by the youths.Labourdette said: At all sorts of events they [firefighters] get stones thrown towards their heads.A football match which ends thousands of kilometres away: the fire brigade is attacked with stones. A rapper who calls for a gathering in the centre of Brussels: the fire brigade is attacked with stones. New Years Eve: the fire brigade is attacked with stones.It has almost become a game and unfortunately a daily occurrence for the fire brigade in the capital of Europe.Computer shop owner Hassan Zenague said looters managed to take computers, mobile phones and other electronic devices.I arrived at .am and everything was completely smashed just  minutes later, he said.

The EU will be guided through its many problems by a basket-case country with a pygmy economy, most of whose citizens are desperate to get the hell out and reach the UK.Every time you might doubt we did the right thing in voting to leave, the EU comes up with another brilliant reason not to stay in.Romania, with its beleaguered government and wealth per person lower than Trinidad  Tobago and Kazakhstan. That’s who will be running the show.Right now, though, we have to get our act together. In the middle of this month there will be a debate in Parliament about Theresa May’s “new” deal for us to leave the EU.Government ministers have been whispering that May has won some concessions from the EU negotiating team. I hope so. But I kind of have my doubts.As Lord Sugar might put it, she couldn’t sell prosecco to a hen party. But it’s time to get behind her. Time, too, for arch-Brexiteers to cease being so self-indulgent and vote through a deal that is the least-worst option.Sure, I’m no fan of Theresa’s Pedigree Chum plan ­— a dog’s dinnerever there was one. Truth be told, I’d rather we crashed out with no deal at all.But that would be more dangerous — for the British economy and even for Brexit.And waiting in the wingsthe Prime Minister fails to get her plan through is Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party.Frankly, I would rather stay in the EU than have Jezza as Prime Minister. As Tom Harris, a Labour Brexiteer, put it, May’s deal gives us Leavers slightly more than half of what we voted for. And given the result of the referendum two years ago, that seems about right to me. None of us get exactly what we want.But we do leave the EU and we retain control of our borders. And soon we’ll be free to strike our own, independent, trade deals. Reach out to the rest of the world. That seems to me a decent compromise.The problem lies in convincing the arch-Brexiteer Conservative MPs that now is the time to give up the fight. I understand their many reservations. But the reality is the deal May puts before the House of Commons is about the only solution that stands a chance of winning a majority.And we are in this position largely because the Tory Brexiteers never managed to sort themselves out. At every stage, they were ided among themselves and too often concerned about their political careers.Sothis isn’t the deal we all wanted, they have themselves to blame.Our negotiations with the EU should have been done with confidence and self-discipline.Instead, we were always on the back foot because of Conservative in-fighting.Now it’s time to get serious, at long last. Becausewe don’t push this deal through, we may not get Brexit at all.MY wish for the New Year is that someone might tell me what Kendall Jenner, Rita Ora and Ferne McCann actually do for a living. Other than this kinda thing.That’s wish No. Wish No is that Gary Lineker takes a self-awareness course and discovers he’s a bumptious t***er who knows next to nowt.Most of my social-media friends went to bed at pm to avoid seeing London Mayor Sadiq Khan’s ludicrous fireworks display.And all the downstairs lights were off in the houses in my street.Are people getting bored with New Year’s Eve, do you reckon Our Foreign Secretary has just landed in Singapore to drum up more trade for Britain post Brexit.This tiny country – just a city state – is a major economic force and an important ally.It’s also a good lesson for those whining lefties who blame colonialism for the desperate plight of Africa.Singapore was founded as a British trading post exactly  years ago. It was under British control until .It has a booming economy, one of the world’s highest le expectancies and a top standard of living.So it’s not done too badly, has it The truth is colonialism is NOTHING to do with the failure of African countries. It’s about good government.Theres going to be a gay bar in EastEnders.This is an innovation dreamed up by the new script editor, Kate Oates.It’s intended to make the programme more closely represent the area in which it’s set.Ha! Here’s a tip, Ms Oates. If you want EastEnders to truly reflect the borough in which it’s set – Tower Hamlets – you need a few more sweeping changes.Fewer than a third of Tower Hamlets’ residents are white British, so that’s most of the cast gone.Almost  per cent of the people there are Bangladeshi, so the programme should be broadcast in Bengali, not English.Come on, Kate. You want EastEnders to be more real Then make it REALLY real.Lets be honest. It’s not just whichever oaf parked Paul Pogba’s car in that disabled bay who is doing it.When I go to my local supermarket, all the disabled bays are full, every time.No stickers in the car windows.And the people inside the store don’t seem to be limping very much. Sometimes I fantasise about waiting by their cars, with a hammer, for them to emerge with their shopping.“Disabled, huh  Well, you are now.”But one of the problems, I think, is that we have too many disabled bays.And so people don’t take them seriously.Quite clearly, the French are doing nothing whatsoever to deter them.It wouldn’t surprise methey were actually herding them on to the dinghies.“Go on, monsieur, you can see the clfs over there. It’s not far. Bon voyage, mon ami.”It’s another two fingers from the hopeless French because we’re leaving the European Union.What we should be doing is towing the migrants all the way back to Calais.I know living in France is probably a “cruel and unusual punishment” under United Nations laws. But it’s time the French took their responsibilities a bit more seriously.Another year dawns with something  to be terried about.Evil Chinese mussels have invaded British waters, apparently. They smother our decent, God-fearing British scallops and oysters.By the time you read this, they will probably have made their way up the Thames.It’s time we took a stand against these vile, bivalved b******s.Leave our oysters alone, you Commies!

Women are finding their voice.And the most important thing is we are getting heard.We are not going to accept mansplaining or being ­spoken down to “stupid woman”.Feminism is the word of the year, with more and more women standing up for themselves and demanding equality, and I predict that process is going to continue in .Now that I think about it, there were other good things about .It was the year we rediscovered hope in football during the World Cup.We did better than we thought we would — and it’s not often we can say that.The England team and manager Gareth Southgate restored our ­national self-esteem and gave us something to cheer about when there really was not much .The World Cup showed us nice guys can win.Sure, we didn’t bring home the trophy but it’s fair to say Gareth Southgate’s a winner in everyone’s eyes.And it’s not over yet:  is the women’s football World Cup — so that’s something to look forward to with hope.Hope is an important word. And now, more than ever, we need to find a way to hang on to the things that make us feel optimistic about the future.There were other hopeful things about .This was the year that gave us the breath of fresh air that is Meghan Markle — and it also saw the most stylish royal wedding this country has probably ever seen.Meghan was a signier of change for the Royal Family, which needed to modernise.And while I know some people have decided she is “pushy”, or criticise her for her relationship with her father, I think Meghan is one of the best things that has ever happened to our royals.We also had a royal baby — Prince Louis — and now we have another one on the way, which is happy news.My personal highlight of  was having lunch at Buckingham Palace with the Queen.It really was a wonderful occasion, spending intimate time talking to such an inspiring woman.And now here we are, poised on the brink of .I’m not a New Year’s Eve ­person.

MPs are finally supposed to vote on the deal in the week of January  after the Prime Minister delayed it by a month, knowing she would lose. But David Davis speculated the vote could be put off yet againMrs May looks likely to lose it, as is still the case. The PM refused before Christmas to give a cast-iron guarantee the vote wont be delayed. And Chris Grayling, the Transport Secretary, similarly didnt give such a guarantee yesterday. Today the Prime Minister is preparing to meet EU leaders and seek further clarications in a bid to persuade sceptical MPs to back her deal.   She was expected to speak this week to EU leaders including German chancellor Angela Merkel, Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte and European Council president Donald Tusk in an attempt to break the logjam, the Financial Times reported. Yet a European commission spokeswoman told thetoday that no further meetings are foreseen between UK and EU negotiators because negotiations have concluded. Thereports every Tory MP will be invited to No for a drinks party next week in a last-ditch charm offensive.  And Mrs May is determined to win over the DUP in the hope others will follow suit. But a Brexiteer source told the newspaper: No one is changing their minds about this deal because the deal itself remains the same. MPs from both Leave and Remain are against the -page withdrawal deal - which ensures basic terms, a poundbn orce bill and a transition period to December  - because of a backstop clause that could trap the UK under EU customs rules indefinitely. That would mean Britain was unable to strike its own trade deals with countries like the US.  Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay today tried to threaten Remain MPs into backing the deal as he warned voting down the deal will make a No Deal Brexit far more likely. A major public information campaign will begin on Tuesday explaining how the public can prepare for leaving without an agreement on March . And Environment Secretary Michael Gove today warned a No Deal Brexit will cause considerable turbulence in the farming sector. Mr Davis, in a column for the , insisted a deal will be reached at the eleventh hour because the EU is worried about losing the pound billion orce payment that would come with aBrexitdeal.  The vote, which was delayed at the last minute in December, is currently scheduled for the week beginning January . Mr Davis said: The Withdrawal Agreement does not respect the referendum result. That is why the meaningful vote had to be delayed and one wonderseven the January vote will go ahead.  Attempts to frighten MPs into supporting it are unlikely to work, because voting down this substandard deal will not result in noBrexit. Urging Mrs May to take her time to get a better deal, he adds: We know that the EU is worried about the loss of the pound billion orce paymentthere is no deal... so this is the moment to be hard-nosed about these issues. The more we prepare to leave the EU without a deal, the more likely a good deal becomes. Jeremy Corbyn wants the vote to go ahead, and for the deal to be defeated, so he can try and force a full no confidence vote in the government for the first time. But yesterday he rebuffed calls for an immediate second referendum on Brexit, after a poll claimed % of Labour members want the party to fully back one. Instead he said Mrs May should go back to Brussels after a defeat and renegotiate.

Its time to for us to discuss Chris Grayling. A man with the body of Donald Trump and the IQ of a roll of Sellotape, seeing him in a hi-vis jacket is as much reason to despair as spotting lumps in the groin: a sure sign that something is amiss.From Carillion to the criminal justice system, from the welfare state to the prison service, and to Gatwick Airport by way of London Bridge, theres nothing Grayling has touched and not cocked up.And now, despite a long history of incompetence and twattery, he has decided to ring in the New Year the same way he ended the last one. Doing stupid things stupidly, and spitting out another stream of sticky stuff in a vain attempt to hold all the stupid bits together long enough for something even more stupid to happen. In his two years as Minister of State at the Department for Work and Pensions he helped sacked , JobCentre staff, meaning they all had to go to, well, the JobCentre. Which was shut. When he was put in charge of the poundbn Back to Work programme getting the long-term unemployed into jobs, he was told they were genuinely sicker than expected. His response was to tighten the criteria, making their illnesses bureaucratically unnoticeable, and arguably, it must be said, making them sicker.He was called the worst Lord Chancellor since . He tried to charge defendants to plead not guilty, forcing the poor to admit crimes they may not have committed. He slashed legal aid for domestic abuse victims and banned books for prisoners. It was all deeply stupid, and very horrible. And as person in charge of the legal system, he tried to restrict the legal systems ability to scrutinise politicians. And throughout it all, he yanked a never-ending stream of sticky tape out of his mouth to bundle it all up in one big, sticky mess. As Shadow Home Secretary he was found to have used dodgy and misleading statistics on violent crime, claiming it had risen under Labour when, er, it hadnt. He claimed Moss Side was in the grip of an urban war like that of The Wire. It was left to the Manchester Evening News to point out Baltimore had  gun murders the previous year, while the Mancs suffered the grand total of zero.I pay the same train fares as you! he squeaked this time last year, failing to mention that unlike the rest of us he had a salary of pound, from the public purse, could claim his train fares on expenses, and in any case had the use of a ministerial car. All of which, you would think, would be enough to convince anyone that the best use for Chris Grayling would be as ballast in the foundations of a motorway flyover, rather than the complicated job of handing out big-money government contracts. Instead he was made Transport Secretary, a job he has truly made his own in that he has curled one out on everything thats crossed his desk.In July , now-notorious firm Carillion issued a profit warning that saw its market value drop by poundm. A week later Grayling gave it a pound.bn contract to build tunnels for HS.Grayling claimed he had secure undertakings the contract would be delivered. At the time, there was a poundm hole in Carillions books and it was  months from liquidation. Last month a drone closed Britains second-busiest airport, stranded , passengers a week before Christmas, and cost millions. CSI Gatwick was reduced to standing in fields staring at the sky, and Grayling was offered the services of a crack RAF team of specialists to find the culprit.Its been reported Grayling quibbled for  hours because his department would have to pay for it. By the time the experts were finally called, the drone and its operator had all but disappeared and the governments costs were sky-high. Now, for the second year in a row, he has marked the New Year rail fares increase by disappearing to Qatar on what is claimed to be a post-Brexit trade mission. Why he has tohaving done the same last January, and why it is always arranged during the most indefensible thing he would otherwise have to defend, is not clear. But at the same time, fairly obvious.  All of this could have been predicted some years ago,anyone had noted his , pre-politics job as business development manager for a short-lived experiment called BBC Select. It was an overnight service aimed at professionals who, it was envisioned, would record educational programmes on their VCRs .All well and good, except the business plan young Grayling was tasked with developing involved charging a subscription for it - despite the fact that the BBC, rather famously, is already paid for by everyone with a television.Unsurprisingly, BBC Select closed after  years. More astonishingly though, Grayling was elevated to the lofty position of borough councillor, MP, shadow minister, the Privy Council and then some of the most important offices in the land.  The question is not why he does the stupid things he does, but why anyone lets him play with this stuff. Either he has found something to blackmail Theresa May with, or shes using him to destroy the country so that Brexit doesnt seem so bad. But raise your head from the desk for there are two reasons to hope that the cold, stupid hands of Oh Christ Not Grayling may soon be removed from the tender neck of the British state.The first is that he has awarded a poundm contract for a vital post-Brexit shipping service to a firm that has no ships. This is standard Grayling stupidity, buta deeper scandal is uncovered he might, finally, have his ministerial career terminated. The second is that we may be getting to the end of that roll of Sellotape. Tackled about his avoidance of the train fares rise, Grayling uttered the truest words he has ever spoken: My presence in the country doesnt make any dference. Hes wrong, of course. His presence only makes things worse. Buteven HE realises hes not helping, perhaps one day soon he will do the decent thing and scuttle back to whichever village will have him."},{"url":null,"title":"how prepare no deal brexit","story":"NewsHow to prepare for a no-deal Brexit: Government to issue guidance as vote loomsBrexit Secretary Steve Barclay said that no deal will be \"far more likely\"MPs reject the Prime Ministers agreement when a vote is held in the week beginning January ShareCommentsByRyan Wilkinson:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video countdown-brexit--days-until-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe Government is launching a publicity drive to prepare the public for a possible no-deal Brexit.

The source told The Sun that Mr Javid has referred to himself as The Sajid in private meetings. Thats right - The Sajid.   The rival told the newspaper: He uses phrases like, ‘Just you watch what The Sajid is going to do about this’, or ‘The Saj will sort that out’.It’s bizarre.

Gerard Batten wants to lt a ban on the EDL founder, real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, joining the anti-EU party by holding a postal ballot of all UKIP members. Thats prompted speculation Robinson could go for the top job - with the next leadership election due in April. Sources told The Sun that was the hard-right leaders ultimate plan because he and Robinson are best buddies after he hired him as an aide, shared several s with him, and took him for lunch in the House of Lords. One source told the Mirror: I do think its something Gerard would like to see.  But Mr Batten tweeted: Fake news! The story is a lie from start to finish. He added: No one should be UKIP leader without years of loyalty  work behind them. Mr Battens backing for the anti-Islam firebrand has prompted fury in UKIP and triggered the resignation of former leaders Nigel Farage and Paul Nuttall. Scottish UKIP leader David Coburn also quit the party, despite claiming months earlier that Robinson was standing up for people who are being ignored.” Former English Defence Leagueand British National Partymembers are banned from joining UKIP under party rules.  Mr Batten wants to change that rule through a vote of party members - but UKIPs ruling NEC delayed the idea due to Brexit. That means the discussion is set to take place at UKIP NECs first meeting after March , only shortly before the party is due to pick its next leader. It is understood Mr Batten wants to host a postal vote to ask membersthey will change the rules just to let Robinson in - and keep all other EDL members out. Its on the radar but has taken a back seat due to the uncertainty over Brexit, a source said. But Mr Batten - who took over unopposed as leader after Henry Bolton was forced out - has not yet confirmedhell stand down as leader - meaning he could fight again. In politics there are very few certainties and this is not one of them, a source said. Nigel Farage quit the party last month saying Robinsons entourage includes violent criminals and ex-BNP members. Mr Farage added: He is entirely unsuitable to be involved in any political party. UKIP won more than million votes at its height but trailed on just % in a recent YouGov poll.

The families were forced to give up Tax Credits and join the new system with no transition payments - risking debt and destitution. Existing benefit claimants are meant to share in a poundbn fund to stop their income suddenly dropping when they move to UC. But they dont get that helpthey have a change in circumstances, like moving house or changing working hours. Now the Department for Work and Pensionsadmits it moved , Tax Credit claimants onto UC without any transition payments between December  and November . Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Margaret Greenwood slammed the vast figure. She said: “It is unacceptable that hundreds of thousands of workers are being pushed onto Universal Credit without any protection.   Universal Credit has caused poverty and hardship to families across the country. The Government must immediately stop the roll out.” It comes a day after we reported dad Dean Lovell-Payne, , tried to kill himself while on the phone to the DWP after he waited  weeks for his first UC payment to arrive. The ex-ambulance worker - who was unable to walk and switched to UC from legacy benefits after moving house - finally received his benefits the same day.  Our figure, obtained by Labour under the Freedom of Information Act, covers people who were on Child Tax Credit and Working Tax Credit. That means all those affected were either in work, have a family or both. And it comes despite Tory ministers handing most existing benefit claimants extra help in a climbdown last year. Managed migration of existing claimants will now only start rolling out fully in , and those hit will get transition payments. Yet natural migration - for people whose circumstances change - is unchanged. That means million new and existing claimants will have joined UC without transition payments by December .   Citizens Advice policy chief Kayley Hignell warned the Mirror before Christmas: Were really worried about this. Its a huge amount of people going through the system. And it makes those fixes that are really fundamental around payment timeliness and the like really urgent. We are raising that repeatedly. Tory MP Heidi Allen added: I am dealing with cases where a seemingly harmless change has resulted in claimants suddenly and unpredictably being hundreds of pounds worse off each month. A DWP spokesman said: People only move onto Universal Credit from existing benefitsthey have a change in circumstances – this ensures they’re receiving the right level of support.

It hit us hard this year, really hard, because you know we’ve got two teenagers and it’s teenagers things, and you’ve got a six and a seven-year-old as well, and they’re up as well, I mean it was hard this time round.” “For the first time ever I’ve got a night nurse.”  Looking after three ones under the age of five has been such a breeze for Kim Kardashian, , she and Kanye, , are having a fourth. Abbey Clancy, , and footballer Peter Crouch, , are also expecting a fourth because “a hat-trick just won’t do”. Coleen and Wayne Rooney welcomed their fourth son two years ago, while Katie Price says she would like to add to her gaggle of five. Angelina, , hired one nanny each for each of her six children Maddox, , Pax, , Zahara, , Shiloh, , and ten-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne. Recently she fired her brother from the role as head nanny and hired two further nannies. Home le still sounds chaotic, with one former nanny saying: “In the middle of the night they’re running down the hallway waking their parents up and trying to get into their beds.”  So is a big brood the ultimate celebrity status symbol  Why  Is it that so many celebrity dads are alpha males, driven by competitiveness  Are some mothers simply in love with the feeling of being “mum”  Andyou adore the unconditional love of a baby in the cold world of showbiz, why not have another... and another... and another  Or is it because only healthy couples with meticulously organised lives can cope with the chaose of having so many little monsters.

It’s posts of Victoria baking unicorn biscuits with daughter Harper that leaves us saying, ‘How on earth does she do it ’. The more children, the greater our admiration.

Kevin Saunders, , criticised the coffee chain after he says he was shocked to see so little turkey, bacon and cranberry sauce in his sarnie. He visited a branch with his family in Clarks Village, Somerset, before Christmas but was so appalled at his meal he posted about it on social media. The Ultimate Christmas Toastie drew the most criticism for the minced turkey in minuscule amounts barely covering half of the sandwich. Kevin spent pound for a round of drinks and sandwiches but was disappointed by the lack of value for money.   The software support analyst from Wednesbury, West Midlands, said: I know its not a million pounds, but it was still pretty bad. “I don’t normally post or moan, but it was the fact that there wasn’t even a slice of turkey, it looked like turkey mince. “I only posted it because I wanted to highlight what I was given for how much they were charging. “When you pick a big brand place and you don’t get value for money, you have to thinkyou go to your local shops you get a lot more for your money.” He says he is not normally a fussy eater but wanted to rebuild the sandwich because it was a bit messy. After lting up the top I was like ‘Oh, ok’, it looked like it turkey mince rather than sliced turkey and there was such a tiny, little amount, he added.   “There was such a small amount that there wasn’t even enough to cover the sandwich, there wasn’t even enough for half of the sandwich. “Turkey is not something I normally have, but at this time of year you think bacon, cranberry sauce, turkey and so of Christmas, it was disappointing. Kevin, who has vowed to not eat at Costa again, said other people agreed with his evaluation of the meal and sympathised with his feeling of being ripped off. You normally pay over the odds for coffee but at least know what you’re getting with that. “But at pound for a sandwich, that is nowhere near the standard you expect from a company like Costa,” he said.

Last year, Kate spent her big day with husband Prince William and their two children, George and Charlotte, in a low-key affair as she was pregnant with Louis. It is not known yet what she will be doing this year but her sister Pippa, , may be absent from any potential partying as in recent days she has been photographed on holiday in St Barts with husband James Matthews and his family. Talk has also turned to what Meghan may buy Kate as last year she picked a very personal gt. A pal revealed to The Sun: Meg had bought Kate a small birthday present – a very smart leather-bound ‘dream diary’ for her thoughts and ideas which Kate loved.  Rumours of a feud between the pair have been re in recent months. But according to the latest reports, the royal wives are working through their dferences and apparently patched things up over the festive period. On Christmas Day at the Queens Sandringham estate, the sisters-in-law are said to have bonded over board games, and even teamed-up to play Scrabble. “If German and British troops could put their dferences to one side to play football during World War One, the feeling was Kate and Meghan could follow suit for Scrabble, a source reportedly said. “After watching the Queen’s speech, the board games were brought out and both women got stuck in. The insider added to The Sun: “They were chuckling along together. You wouldn’t know there was any tension between the two. It was a wonderful day and night.”  The Duchess of Cambridge, , and the pregnant Duchess of Sussex, , have been at the centre of a number of reports, which claim the women are very dferent people and dont get on. Two people have told theKate was left in tears at one of Princess Charlottes bridesmaid dress fittings ahead of Meghans wedding. Rumours were further sparked by the news Meghan and Harry will no longer be moving into an apartment next door to Kate and William. They will move to the stunning Frogmore Cottage in Windsor instead, which will undergo a huge refurbishment before they move in. The Queen and Prince Charles however are said to have made it clear that any disagreement between the two duchesses must be kept out of the public eye. The two seemed to take the advice on board as they were seen looking like best friends as they arrived at the Royal Familys Christmas Day church service.  The pair were all smiles and chatted as they walked shoulder-to-shoulder, along with their husbands, in front of an adoring crowd of hundreds. All eyes were on Meghan and Kate as they made one of their first public appearances together since the claims of a fallout emerged. At one point, cameras captured the moment Meghan placed a friendly hand on Kates back as they appeared to share a joke. However, royal fans spotted another potential rt after a video emerged of Prince Harry and William, along with their other halves, leaving St Mary Magdalene Church in Sandringham. In the footage the Duchess of Sussex appears to turn to her brother-in-law to engage in conversation. But the future King, , seemed more focused on fixing his scarf than catching her eye.  In the video he is seen fidgeting with the accessory before getting into a waiting car. And royal fans believe that Prince William may have been deliberately trying to ignore his sister-in-law. The two Dukes have been reported to have suffered tensions in their relationship this year after William questioned Meghans suitability as his siblings we. They reportedly had a big falling out shortly after Harry announced his engagement to Meghan Markle last year. According to one of their mutual friends, Harry didnt believe his big brother was making enough effort to welcome his new fianceacute into the family. The pal said: Harry felt William wasnt rolling out the red carpet for Meghan and told him so, reports Vanity Fair. They had a bit of a fall out which was only resolved when Charles stepped in and asked William to make an effort.

Eight weeks later, the -year-old nursery cook went on her first date since he died. Although it didnt progress into a relationship, Natalie claims the criticism she faced then and still faces today has been devastating. Despite receiving support from most of her family, Natalie said that she had a hard time from friends and family - especially those on Tims side. Now happily married for the second time after finding love online, Natalie is speaking to encourage others to stop being so judgemental about love after berevement. Natalie, from Stalybridge, Greater Manchester, said: When Tim took ill in the August, they told me pretty early on what the outcome was going to be. I did my grieving in those four months while he was still here. I knew what was coming and I had to stay strong for our son Oliver.  When Tim died, my friends didnt call because they didnt know what to say, so they didnt say anything at all. I was in shock and so lonely. Eventually I got to the point where I did want to go out and so I went on a date with a local man. It didnt go anywhere but it caused people to say I had disrespected my husband. I had every respect for him - but I knew he was never coming back. I couldnt sit alone in my house crying. I went out and enjoyed myself for a few weeks. People avoid you when a loved one dies. Soon after Tim passed away I was walking down the street and people would cross over because they didnt know what to say. You do feel isolated. If you havent been through it you can never understand. [Finding love again] doesnt mean Ive no respect for Tim. Some people were judgemental, especially at work. I had got a job after he passed. People would say its only been two years but Id say exactly. Do you want me to sit on the sofa wearing black and never go out  People are so quick to judge. Its not right. In the summer prior to his death, Tim and Natalie had been on holiday to Spain with their four-year-old son Oliver while Tim did some painting work.  The couple were away for a week but days into the trip, Natalie noticed her husband was behaving really weird and had been acting daft. A desperate Natalie even called her dad saying she wanted to come home and when the family ed to the UK, Tim visited the doctors. Natalie said: We went on holiday in  to Spain which is when Tim started behaving really weird. Hed be walking with his head on the side orI gave him his lunch on a plate, hed look at me and tip it all on the floor. Wed gone over there because hed agreed to do some work on a villa.  As the week went on, he hadnt done any painting and was just behaving really daft. I began to notice something wasnt right. When we got back, I took him straight to the doctors and they thought hed had a stroke. He went into hospital that night and he was soon diagnosed with a brain tumour. The specialists said that because wed been on holiday the air pressure on the plane had accelerated the tumour. He went to The Christie in Manchester but there was nothing they could do. They gave him chemotherapy but it wasnt doing anything at all. I did mourn. From getting the brain tumour, each of the words that came out Tims mouth you couldnt take seriously. It was like talking to an older person with dementia. He wanted me to be happy and move on.  That December, Natalie scrambled around to afford Christmas presents for Oliver as her husband lay in his hospice bed. During what should have been a happy time of year, she agonised over how to tell her little boy that his dad might not make it through the month. Natalie said: It was horrendous, especially during that Christmas. I was trying to keep things jolly for Oliver but I was struggling for money. Sadly Tim was soon transferred to a hospice. He couldnt speak or move around. It was just terrible. Oliver understood what was happening. He asked me is my daddy going to die . I could have lied and said no. But I sat him down and explained in terms a four-year-old would be able to understand. Tim had been the breadwinner and Id been at home with Oliver, so people rallied round us to make sure he got some Christmas presents. Tim survived through Christmas but the week later he went downhill. On New Years Day  he passed away.  Suffering with the crippling loneliness and grief, Natalie decided to begin dating again just eight weeks later. However when her first dates didnt come to anything, she focused on helping her son Oliver come to terms with losing his dad. By , Natalie decided to get out there once again and started dating again. Although it was almost two years since Tim had died, Natalie claims she was still judged by family and colleagues - even after her she married Paul  months later. Natalie said: At the end of  I joined Plenty of Fish and thats where I met Paul. It was a happy ending. Paul is a lovely man and from the start I told him the whole story. I explained I had a son and he might be sensitive to the situation, but Oliver took to him straight away. It just progressed from there and soon it became our new normal. When we got married it was really sweet.  At the wedding reception looked up at us and said can I play out  He ran over to Paul and said Daddy, can we play out . Oliver still talks about Tim. He has his watch and we speak about him everyday - night and day. Oliver is now eight years old. A lot of people, especially family, we dont speak to. Tim had older children - he was  years older than me. He had five, including Oliver. Im still in contact with two of them now. They were really supportive from the beginning and came to my wedding in the evening. [Some other people on Tims side of the family were] really unsupportive and quite disrespectful. When Natalie got a new job as a nursery cook, she was also questioned about how quickly she had found a new partner. Despite losing some friends and family, Natalie claimed her own family were there for her and believes Oliver was helped by seeing her smile again. Natalie said: I just feel like [those that criticised me about starting to date again] need to take a step back and think. God forbidthey were in that position. You just cant say that. I did join Plenty of Fish but I didnt go out looking for love. I still post about him. I posted on Facebook on New Years Day last year its been nearly three years since you passed and I hope that youre looking down on me on my wedding day. I got a lot of comments - none to my face. My family were so supportive. I think its helped Oliver to see his mum happy again.

At almost  stone and a size  she knew she must make changesshe was to wear it for her celebrations. Self-confessed carb queen Jill feared she’d never slim down as every weight-loss plan she tried restricted her beloved pasta, rice and potatoes…until she found Slimming World. Now she’s lost st and eats carbs every day! And she’s not the only one who spent years trying and failing to cut out carbs unnecessarily. New research from Slimming World and YouGov found more than a third of people who tried to lose weight have attempted to follow low-carbohydrate diets.   However people said they were dficult to follow, left them feeling hungry, bored and restricted in what they could eat. Just like Jill who, as a self-confessed carbohydrate queen, feared she had no hope of losing weight because every diet she had tried restricted the amount of carbs she could eat, making her miserable. But now Jill has lost seven stone – giving her a whole new lease of le. “I don’t know what the final straw was,” Jill says. “I’ve been big all my le. Looking back at pictures I was a chunky child. But I got to the point where I thought I am kidding myself that I am happy like this.”   By following a Slimming World Food Optimising plan, where unrefined carbs such as rice, pasta and potatoes are ‘Free Food’ , Jill is now a trim size -. “I remember shopping for holiday clothes just before I joined Slimming World and there was nothing that fitted and anything I did get just looked like a sack,” she recalls. Then dont miss out on your free Slimming World mini mags, inside your Daily Mirror and Sunday Mirror this weekend.There are recipes, tips and loads more inspirational stories - so be sure to grab yourself a copy.Inside your paper on Saturday January , Sunday January , Saturday January  and Sunday January ,   “I was  and I thought I am not going to be like this when I am . I’d seen a dress on a website before I started losing weight that I loved, and I thoughtI ever got to a size  I would get it. So now I’ve got one – it’s a s style, fitted with a fur collar, and I love it.” For years Jill had been pretending that she was happy despite her size – even when the scales tipped st lb.  But when she finally decided to make a change she struggled to find a diet plan that would fit in with her love of carbohydrates. She explains: “I am a carb queen, every meal I have has carbs in it. I suppose it was the way I was brought up – you have carbs on your plate and everything  goes round them. “If someone said I had to cut them out I just couldn’t do it. It makes me shymiserable. I had tried losing weight with other plans and it was all weighing, measuring, counting. “Everything had a value, and I just found I had to restrict my carbs too much and I couldn’t do it.   “I got obsessed with counting, weighing everything where it got to the point it was all I could think about all day long. I used to thinkI eat that now, then I can’t eat later in the day. “I realised it just wasn’t healthy so I gave up – until I found Slimming World.” The plan was Jill’s dream because she could still enjoy her favourite foods and lose weight too. She says: “At Slimming World, carbs are unlimited. The plan is put together where you fill a third of your plate with fruits and veg or salad, then the rest of your plate is made up of Free Food which have no limit on them, and then your ‘Syns’ so you have a set number of Syns each day which are things you would expect, like fats and sugar. “But carbs are free foods – bread is restricted but you can have rice, pasta and potatoes. So that’s why it works for me because I can still eat my carbs.”   Jill swapped her usual sugary cereals and blueberry muffin breakfasts for high-fibre cereals, fruit and yoghurt – and sometimes even a healthy version of a full English. She explains: “You can have a big cooked breakfast with no guilt at all – lean bacon, poached egg and baked beans.” Instead of having a big sandwich and a packet of crisps at lunch, she now has a jacket potato topped with tuna or beans. And for dinner she still has her favourite rice and pasta dishes, but she has ditched high fat, creamy sauces for low-fat versions.  Instead of eating chocolate and crisps for snacks at work, train planner Jill now finds that she doesn’t really get peckish between meals. The mum of one from Leeds, says: “Your taste buds really do change. I’m finding with the meals I’m eating now I feel fuller for longer so I don’t really snack as much, butI do it tends to be raw veg, or Slimming World high-fibre cereal bars.” Whereas before she used to hate shopping and wore baggy clothes to hide her figure, now she loves nothing more than hitting the high street and shopping for clothes she once never dreamed she could wear. The -year-old says: “I couldn’t believe it the first time I pulled on a size  dress. For a long time I just carried on wearing the same baggy clothes I had always worn because I just couldn’t see the shydference in myself.  “When you lose that amount of weight a big shypsychological switch has to flick at some point for you to realise what you have done. For a long time when I looked in the mirror I didn’t see a dference at all – even when I had lost six stone. went on a shopping trip with a friend I had made at Slimming World and I tried on things I had never tried before – it was just an amazing feeling to be able to try on a size  dress. “Since then I’ve got into size s as well. I feel fantastic, I can walk into a shop and I can buy clothes that I like the look of. “I don’t just buy stuff because it fits, I buy stuff because I like it. “I had a photoshoot done in November which I would never have done before and I love the pictures.   “It has given me a new shyconfidence. I go running two or three times a week and I did a k in November, so losing weight has completely transformed my le. I feel like a dferent person.” And it’s not just Jill who is reaping the benefits – husband Andy, , is a fan of his we’s slimmed-down look. “My husband is loving it. He works away a lot but when he is at home he eats the same as me. He’s happy,I’m happy. I feel amazing.” "},{"url":null,"title":"norovirus reported across uk what","story":"NewsNorovirus reported across UK - what you need to know about vile stomach bugSome people left bedridden over the festive period said \"Christmas was cancelled\", with others having to ask neighbours to help them get food and medicine supplies when whole families became too ill to leave homeShareCommentsByAbigail OLeary:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror incoming video everything-you-need-know-norovirus-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailNorovirus brought misery to many over the Christmas and New Year period as some were struck down by the vile bug.

In the Royal Bolton Hospital, eight wards were closed over New Year after an outbreak of the bug - with staff urging patients families to stay away. Visiting restrictions were put in place and anyone with symptoms of norovirus were told to avoid the hospital for at least  hours after they had subsided. The bug is often called the winter vomiting bug, but you can catch norovirus all year round.The NHS advises not going to your GP, as norovirus can spread to others very easily. Call your GP or NHS you’re concerned or need any advice. The latest NHS norovirus report says: Reports of suspected and confirmed outbreaks of norovirus in hospitals in England to week , are currently at lower levels than the average number for the same period in the previous five seasons from season   to season  . Symptoms of norovirus You’re likely to have norovirusyou experience: suddenly feeling sick, projectile vomiting, watery diarrhoea. Some people also have a slight fever, headaches, painful stomach cramps and aching limbs. The symptoms appear one to two days after you become infected and typically last for up to  or  days.  What to doyou have norovirus If you experience sudden diarrhoea and vomiting, the best thing to do is to stay at home until you’re feeling better . There’s no cure for norovirus, so you have to let it run its course. You don’t usually need to get medical advice unless there’s a risk of a more serious problem. To help ease your own or your child’s symptoms: Drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration . You need to drink more than usual to replace the fluids lost from vomiting and diarrhoea – as well as water, adults could also try fruit juice and soup. Avoid giving fizzy drinks or fruit juice to children as it can make their diarrhoea worse. Babies should continue to feed as usual, either with breast milk or other milk feeds. Take paracetamol for any fever or aches and pains. Get plenty of rest.  If you feel like eating, eat plain foods such as soup, rice, pasta and bread . Use special rehydration drinks made from sachets bought from pharmaciesyou have signs of dehydration, such as a dry mouth or dark urine. Adults can take antidiarrhoeal and anti-emeticmedication – these aren’t suitable for everyone though, so you should check the medicine leaflet or ask or your pharmacist or GP for advice before trying them. Babies and young children, especiallythey’re less than a year old, have a greater risk of becoming dehydrated.

You can catch itsmall particles of vomit or poo from an infected person get into your mouth, such as through: close contact with someone with norovirus – they may breathe out small particles containing the virus that you could inhale touching contaminated surfaces or objects – the virus can survive outside the body for several days, eating contaminated food – this can happenan infected person doesn’t wash their hands before handling food A person with norovirus is most infectious from when their symptoms start until  hours after all their symptoms have passed, although they may also be infectious for a short time before and after this. You can get norovirus more than once because the virus is always changing, so your body is unable to build up long-term resistance to it. Stay off work or school until at least  hours after the symptoms have passed. You should also avoid visiting anyone in hospital during this time.

It lasts for five months and has a % fail rate – and this year, in a landmark and controversial moment for the British Special Forces, it will be open to women too. Female candidates will face excruciating physical tests such as the infamous km Fan Dance across the highest mountain in the Brecon Beacons, and the top-secret mental assessment carried out as part of a -hour interrogation process. And in the new season of hit TV show SAS: Who Dares Wins – which starts on Sunday – women will also compete on the show with men for the first time.  It provides the first snapshot of what they might facethey want to succeed in joining the elite unit - and it includes humiliation, mental abuse and gruelling physical challenges. For the first time in TV history in a non-dramatised programme, a man is also seen punching a woman in the face during the fighting challenge. One of the show’s stars, Royal Marine Commando and Special Forces Sergeant Jason Fox, known as “Foxy”, says: “Everyone was inidual, there were some weak women, there were some strong women, there were some weak men, there was some strong men. In the end it wasn’t really about gender.”  He thinks for a moment. “Well, it was, but it wasn’t. We didn’t want it to be about gender – we wanted it to be about whether you could get to the end of the course. We knew there would be women who couldn’t do it, but we also suspected that there would be women who could do.” Andanyone thinks women would be treated dferently, think again. It seems the opposite is true. In the first episode alone, the entire team is punished because some of the women keep their wet underwear on rather than going braless after ing into a freezing river in the Andes. Chief Instructor Ant Middleton is seen telling the female recruits: “I thought you f*****g women would be a bit more switched on, a bit more f*****g smart, obviously not. “I didn’t want to do this, have this men and women thing, but you f*****s are doing it.”  During a brutal km mountain trek pulling a kg sledge, Middleton screams at the last four recruits: “Lo and behold the last four are f*****g chicks. Surprise f*****g surprise.” As I join some of the first-ever female recruits on a training day in a military base in West Sussex, one says that throughout the controversial interrogation scenes, during which she was forced to strip naked, she wasn’t given any allowances for being on her period. And as much as Foxy and his fellow comrades Matthew “Ollie” Ollerton and Mark “Billy” Billingham insist gender isn’t important, there are many aspects of the new selection process which clearly make them feel uneasy.  While Ollie agrees that there are “some advantages” to women joining the special forces, he argues that they could change the “emotional dynamic of male and female interaction”. Foxy says: “I would say emotional relationships are not a good thing when you’re getting shot at.” Billy says: “The other issue we’ve got is that % of our work is beyond the enemy lines. There’s a % chance every time we go there of getting captured. Imagine a woman getting captured as part of our patrol  How we would feel  How the world media would feel ” This year’s show follows a group of  men and women into the punishing Andes Mountains in Chile – the longest and toughest course ever designed. Over  days winter warfare environment, with high altitude and snow storms, the recruits are tested to the extremes of their physical and mental capabilities. As part of a special training day, I got just a tiny glimpse of the conditions the recruits faced.  Dressed in my army fatigues and weighed down by a big Bergen pack, Foxy, Ollie and Billy put me through my paces as I jogged, lunged, squatted and burpeed up acres of hilly forest. I have run marathons and consider myself to be fairly fit, but I felt far from it as I was ordered to haul a huge log up uneven terrain and thick mud. And this was nothing compared to the real SAS selection candidates have to endure – I wasn’t even carrying the full kgload on my back throughout the ordeal. But no amount of running can prepare you for a breathtaking e in deep, freezing waters in late December. And then came the interrogation after we were captured by the “enemy”. We were bundled into the back of a van as gunfire and explosions rang out, with bags put over our head and headphones blaring white noise put over our ears to rob us of our senses.  It’s this emotional and mental test which is somehow worse than the physical challenges. But the women taking part are undeterred and determinedly unintimidated. One of this year’s recruits, -year-old midwe Louise Gabbitas from Cornwall, says: “I am stronger than some men that I know, physically and mentally.” And recruit Vicki Anstey, , from London, adds: “At no point did I ever feel patronised by any of the guys, no-one was trying to help me out.” The idea of women in the SAS might be a controversial one, butthis is anything to go by, they certainly seem to be able to hold their own. • SAS: Who Dares Wins starts on Sunday January  at pm on Channel .

Iain was widely praised for his actions after he managed to get specic details about his identity and location and a producer contacted emergency services while he kept him on the phone for  minutes until help arrived. Iain, who appeared on Im A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! last year, revealed that after help arrived Chris was incubated for two days where it was touch and go whether Chris would survive. But he later tweeted: Hes alive. Hes at home. And he was blown away by all your support and love. Hes got a lot of work to do but hell get there. Its very complicated.  In the latest call Chris told Iain he was now back home in Cornwall with his carer. He also described the incident in London that had first caused his mental health breakdown. He added: “I was witness to a person under a train. That person was around mid s or early s – which is the age of my eldest son. “I saw that person on the track lying in front of the train completely leless. That was the first time I had ever been involved in anything like that. It had such a detrimental affect on me that I just started drinking heavily. I was drinking a bottle of vodka a day.” He was eventually dismissed by London Underground and his marriage broke down and he moved to Cornwall.He says his biggest fear is not being able to see his -year-old daughter again. Iain told Chris he felt he needed help for alcohol addiction.He ended the call saying: “Don’t die. Take care brother. Hang in there.” This time of year can be especially hardyou are struggling. But there is always help available - the Samaritans operate a free   phone line on   that you can call for a listening ear, or alternatively email jo@samaritans.org."},{"url":null,"title":"what norovirus stricken families describe","story":"NewsWhat is norovirus  Stricken families describe symptoms of vile bug sweeping UKNorovirus left people bedridden over the festive period and caused violent vomiting and diarrhoea for daysShareCommentsByBradley Jolly:,  JAN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror incoming video everything-you-need-know-norovirus-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailNorovirus blighted families over Christmas - and the highly infectious bug is continuing to sweep the UK. More and more hospitals are recording confirmed cases of the vile stomach bug and some have even been forced to close wards as a result. Ward  at Stracathro Hospital, in Angus, Scotland, had to close last month and Royal Bolton Hospital, in Manchester, was also affected. The misery led to Christmas being cancelled in many households while families, including young kids, repeatedly rushed to the toilet or struggled to get out of bed. Stricken sufferers have contactedwith their gruesome experiences, including cases of kids being admitted to hospital and graphic details about how the infection spread through the body. Nine members of Jan Asshetons family, one of whom is just -months-old, were struck with norovirus for days. Have you been affected by norovirus this winter  Get in touch webnews@trinitymirror  Ms Assheton said: This bug went though our family like you wouldn’t believe. My niece was hospitalised with the stomach cramps and it’s affected nine of us aged  months to  years, one after the other over Christmas. [Its] despite scrupulous hand-sanitising and handwashing. Another sufferer, Dave Roberts, told how his three-month-old daughter was dashed to AE on Saturday with violent symptoms. The boss of a theatre company said: My three-month-old daughter started being violently sick last Saturday evening to the point where we rushed her to AE at am. The amount of fluid coming out of her was extreme to say the least. We brought her home and it happened a couple of times more but with a bigger gap of time. Then on Monday morning my we started being sick and having diarrhoea, making her bed bound the whole day. By pm she seemed to be able to make it downstairs for some water. At pm, I started vomiting quite violently. Once I got up  times to go to the bathroom, I stopped counting. I was actually sick on the stroke of midnight and could hear fireworks whilst I had my head in the toilet, so happy new year to us.  Craig Simeon, , suffered for two days during the festive period. The dad, from Irvine, North Ryrshire, told : All my children bar one got violently sick but none seemed to get diarrhoea. My seven-year-old son, Leon, got sick first, very late at night. My stepson Noah, who is , was sick not long after my son that same night, then I got it the next morning. I couldn’t keep anything down and was constantly running to the toilet every five mins. It honestly felt like I was dying. I had no energy, I couldn’t be bothered talking to anyone, I couldn’t even play games with the kids or anything. I couldn’t leave the house and kept feeling cold then warm then cold. Anthony Conway told how his baby was struck with norovirus. He said: My one-year-old son has been down with it for  days and today is the first day he’s managed to eat or drink, lost lots of weight and was so poorly. The bug is often called the winter vomiting bug, but you can catch norovirus all year round. The NHS advises not going to your GP, as norovirus can spread to others very easily. Call your GP or NHS you’re concerned or need any advice. The latest NHS norovirus report says: Reports of suspected and confirmed outbreaks of norovirus in hospitals in England to week , are currently at lower levels than the average number for the same period in the previous five seasons from season   to season  .  Symptoms of norovirus You are likely to have norovirusyou experience: suddenly feeling sick, projectile vomiting, watery diarrhoea. Some people also have a slight fever, headaches, painful stomach cramps and aching limbs. The symptoms appear one to two days after you become infected and typically last for up to three days. What to doyou have norovirus If you experience sudden diarrhoea and vomiting, the best thing to do is to stay at home until you’re feeling better.There is no cure for norovirus, so you have to let it run its course. You don’t usually need to get medical advice unless there is a risk of a more serious problem.  To help ease your own or your child’s symptoms: Drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration. You need to drink more than usual to replace the fluids lost from vomiting and diarrhoea – as well as water, adults could also try fruit juice and soup. Avoid giving fizzy drinks or fruit juice to children as it can make their diarrhoea worse. Babies should continue to feed as usual, either with breast milk or other milk feeds. Take paracetamol for any fever or aches and pains. Get plenty of rest. If you feel like eating, eat plain foods such as soup, rice, pasta and bread.Use special rehydration drinks made from sachets bought from pharmaciesyou have signs of dehydration, such as a dry mouth or dark urine. Adults can take antidiarrhoeal and anti-emeticmedication – these are not suitable for everyone though, so you should check the medicine leaflet or ask or your pharmacist or GP for advice before trying them. Babies and young children, especiallythey are less than a year old, have a greater risk of becoming dehydrated. Norovirus can spread very easily, so you should wash your hands regularly while you are ill and stay off work or school until at least  hours after the symptoms have cleared to reduce the risk of passing it on.

Laura Kreuzter, , from Selm, Germany, first met the love of her le three years ago on a bus that she took every day. Kai Semmelmann,  was the bus driver and after locking eyes several times in the rear-view mirror, Laura plucked up the courage to speak to him. She tracked him down on Facebook and a couple of days later, the pair met for a coffee and fell head-over-heals. The -year age gap didnt worry Laura at all, but Kai was slightly apprehensive at first as he was worried about what people would think of them.  Lauras parents were not impressed by her relationship and didnt talk to her for a year when they first got together and still refuse to speak to Kai today. Despite this, the couple live together and have been through more than most after Kai suffered a heart attack in April last year. Kai said: My girlfriend Laura always had to travel by bus and she would always take my bus.She thought that I was really nice but she didnt care to talk to me very much.  But one day, she wrote to me on Facebook and we met a few days later for a coffee and then fell in love with each other. It was love at first sight. Laura loved my looks and personality right from the start and the same goes for me. We were attracted to each other from the start. Our age dference is twenty-two-years and for Laura, this was not a problem but I struggled because of what people might think of us. Lauras parents were so outraged and the contact between Laura and her parents was put on ice. After about a year, Lauras mother ed to Laura and started talking to her again. I still have no contact with Lauras family, because they do not want to accept me.  Laura said: For me, it was a very bad situation because parents should actually be happytheir daughter is happy and they are at their happiest when in a relationship. It was terrible because Kai is the love of my le. When Kai had his heart attack, I was with him for every second and I supported him wherever I could. I was scared to death that I would lose him and I wouldnt have been able to handle that so I helped him where I could. Laura and Kai do receive funny looks when they are out and about in public but they are now looking forward to moving into a new apartment at the start of the year.  I suffered a heart attack in April  and that was very bad for Laura because I could not work. I had to visit a rehab centre in Ennepetal so she was heavily burdened during this time and wasnt expecting something like this to happen because she was so young, said Kai. We have been living together for almost three years now and have finally found a new apartment and move into it at the beginning of the year.  There are people who say nothing but give us stupid and contemptuous looks when they see us out and about. There are also people who look the other way and there are the people who smile when they see us. Our message to the rest of the world and to the people who criticise us, we have love to give each other and no one in the world is going to stop that.

Bringing in the right people who have been there and done it, have got the drive to take the ball and make something happen and can make the flash that gets us back into the game will make us a lot stronger.”Woods has made a real impact on the side since penning a short-term contract that expired after the weekend loss.Even in that defeat, the former Partick man drew the only positive shout from the crowd as he squared up to a couple of St Johnstone men with the yell ‘at least he’s showing a bit of fight’ coming from the home support.“I would agree with that,” Woods said.“That was out of pure frustration. The crowd in the main have been absolutely brilliant and that’s just not me trying to be the good guy and get everybody up.“I think they’ve been really good for the position the club is in.“They just want people battling, people at it, giving their lot – that’s the least you should be giving. I think those will be the types the manager is after in January, giving what he is like as a guy and what he demands of people.“He’ll want people to go and give their lot, it might not be perfect every week, but they’ll give their full lot and they’ll have some guts.”Though he’s not signed yet till the end of the season, Woods says he’s keen to stay on.He added: “We spoke after the game and that’s ongoing just now, we’ll see what happens.“I’ve loved my time here, the fans have been great with me, the boys have been great, too, getting me right in the mix straight away.“The manager has been really good, I know what I’m getting from him but I think he needs a bit of help so, hopefully, he gets that this month and gets a few boys in who are up for the challenge.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee people inviting space for young families","story":"The world as a new parent can be incredibly daunting – even outings which used to be simple such as meeting your friends for a coffee now seem impossible.However, Butterfly Cafe is there to help with its open invitation to new parents, grandparents and all their kids.The cafe on Commercial Street was opened in  by husband and we team Dom and Christine Anderson.Dom said: “We wanted to create more than just a cafe – we wanted to make a space for mums or anyone with a small child to feel comfortable in.“It can be a lonely time not only for mums but any parents.

If I got a phone call to say that has changed I would be over the moon. But I don’t think we can sit back hoping for the phone to ring.“We have just got to be as active as we can to bring in another left-back.“Max would be my first choice to come back because he was magnicent for us. He was such a good kid to work with, but I think that ship has sailed unfortunately. Max is now trying to get himself into Derby’s team.”Left-back is unlikely to be the only position McInnes will move to strengthen this month.McInnes has admitted he would like to add “one or two” signings in the January window ahead of the second half of a campaign where Aberdeen sit just three points behind Premiership leaders Celtic and Rangers.Following the injury to Bruce Anderson in the - defeat of Livingston the Dons gaffer has admitted he could be forced to move for a striker in the window.Lowe is currently out injured having suffered a groin strain in the - defeat of Hearts. He pulled up in the Pittodrie clash and was taken off and missed games against Celticand Livingston .The injury to Lowe is a yet another blow for Derby boss Lampard, with left-back Scott Malone recently sustaining a groin injury that could rule him out for up to six weeks.Derby have not had much luck with left-backs this season as Scotland cap Craig Forsyth is recovering from knee surgery and is out for the campaign.Swedish international left-back Marcus Olsson has not played since the end of last season due to a knee injury. Olsson couldthis month, but he will need time to build match fitness and sharpness.Calum Macdonald, Derby’s left-back in the under-s, is injured.Right-back Andre Wisdom has played on the left recently.Such is the high regard Lampard holds for Lowe, who started the first two Championship games of this season, he tied him up on a new three-year contract less than  hours before he moved on loan to Aberdeen at the end of the summer window.Lampard hopes Lowe will be available within two weeks.Lampard said: “Max has a small groin injury.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13713656.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_CP43067514.jpg","title":"ayr united players pose inbetweeners","story":"NewsAyr United players pose as Inbetweeners stars on hilarious Christmas party nightHigh flying Ayr United hit the town with some of their squad bearing a resemblance to the cast of the Inbetweeners.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsAyr playersJames Hilton, Liam Smith, Daniel Harvie and Michael Rose\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTheyre flying high in the Scottish Championship.

And the health board have been asking young interns with additional support needs, and no training, to deal with the problem. Pictures seen by the Standard show dozens of ‘sharps’ boxes filled with hypodermic needles stacked up in full view of the public at a number of sites.  They also show hundreds of rubbish bags bursting from containers with incontinence pads, fluid bags, and materials soaked in blood and other bodily fluids not securely contained. That’s despite medical waste having to be dealt with under the strictest of safety and hygiene conditions. Now Chief Executive John Burns has been forced to issue reassurances to staff and the public, saying the problem had been “addressed immediately”.The Standard can exclusively reveal the extent of the problem faced by waste management operatives on a daily basis, with unions raising “grave concerns” at their exposure to a number of serious health risks. A dossier of evidence submitted to health bosses from UNISON showed project SEARCH interns had been tasked with dealing with the specialist problem. The project helps those aged  to  with additional needs – including those on the autistic spectrum – gain work experience and placements. In his submissions to senior management, Robert Rae, UNISON regional organiser, said the youngsters had been “primarily placed” to deal with disposal tasks. Mr Rae added: “We are calling upon John Burns to take immediate action to address the serious concerns we have with regards the potential risk to safety and wellbeing of staff and patients within NHS Ayrshire and Arran.  “Our members and the patients they serve should not be exposed to any potential risk of infection or injury due to the shambolic way the current waste crisis throughout the UK has been dealt with in NHS Ayrshire and Arran this past week.” Images show orange and yellow bags marked ‘clinical waste for alternative treatment or incineration’ overflowing from container cages at Crosshouse, Ayr and Ailsa hospitals. Another shows ‘sharps’ boxes piled up on top of an industrial freezer next to staff lockers. Cages containing ‘sharps’ boxes, cytotoxic, and used drug vials with the remnants of drugs, can be seen next to a perimeter fence with high banking, meaning anyone could lean over and access the boxes. Glass drugs vials, blood, incontinence pads, and other medical waste can also be seen on the ground.UNISON have raised concerns with the training, protocols, and risk assessments being applied to the disposal and handling of waste. Their report says that bags are being ‘inappropriately handled, stored and transported,’ citing instances where they have been thrown into cages or onto the ground, where they “cannot possibly only be handled by the neck” – the agreed safe method of handling such medical waste. Complaints to health bosses also show “blood spillages are often left untreated all day, despite being seen by supervisors”. Mr Rae added: “A supervisor was unable to advise of the procedure or cleaning agents used to clean this. “It is also concerning that the supervisor himself, when questioned, was unable to provide information on how spillages should be dealt with. “Staff have not been informed nor advised that they should be changing out of their work clothes which are clearly being exposed to spillages and they are travelling home in this clothing.

The transformation of an old lodge house on the site in Ayr’s Seafield has joined the existing mansion buildings of Carleton Turrets and Craigweil House. Headmaster Simon Johnston opened the new building, called Craigweil Lodge, last week. He believes it is a signicant step and provides extra classroom space and better single campus. He said: “It provides us with additional accommodation of the highest quality, but it also forges a link between the existing buildings of Carleton Turrets and Craigweil House. “Wellington now has a single, coherent campus and the development potential of this wonderful seafront site has been well and truly unlocked.” The school is working in partnership with architects Austin-Smith: Lord on a long-term masterplan for the campus and this is very close to publication.  The new Lodge contains an additional P classroom and this year the school has three P classes for the first time. It also contains an additional social studies classroom, a staff work room and an attractive new Support for Learning Hub. Equally signicantly pupils will be able to move freely between buildings without having to go out onto the public pavement along Craigweil Road. Jenner Simpson, Board of Governors chairman,has been instrumental in developing the plans for expansion.

Irsquom all for what is being proposed but in the interest of fairness we need to go back to the public on this.However, some councillors have spoked out in opposition to introducing any anti-alcohol by-laws at all.In particular, Jedburgh and District councillor Scott Hamilton said the by-laws would contravene personal liberties, and tabled a motion calling for the proposals to be scrapped altogether.He told fellow councillors: ldquoBy agreeing to move these by-laws forward, we will be starting a process which barbarously pushes back our freedoms and personal liberties.ldquoIt is the freedom of choice which has underpinned the very ethos of le in the western world, and we this morning seek to change a liberty.

It strengthens the case, very strongly, for extending the railway to Carlisle, so I am incredibly supportive, as yoursquod expect. I think this helps us grow the Borders on to success.ldquoThe stats sound almost academic and meaningless, but wersquore talking about a development here of hundreds of jobs.ldquoThat is a huge leap for the Borders, especially when these better, higher-paid jobs come in. It gives us a business space of a quality which we donrsquot currently have in the Borders, and it gives us control over a potentially fantastic housing site.ldquoThis is positive and a good news story.Council officers estimate that developing the estate would cost an extra poundm on top of the price of the land but would potentially generate poundm of gross value added for the regionrsquos economy.However, Tweeddale East councillor and opposition leader Stuart Bell claims the estate is valued at much less than the council paid for it.Mr Bell also revealed that Scottish Governmentrsquos district valuation service, a body offering impartial advice on how public money is spent, also told the council the property was not worth what it has paid for it.He told members: ldquoThe Lowood Estate acquisition, which we are undertaking by ourselves, remains a tortured tale.ldquoThe pound.m outlay, plus expenses, plus cost of maintaining the land and assets, plus the cost of borrowing, means wersquoll need to sell it all for over poundm just to break even. ldquoReports we have seen in private say there will also be signicant infrastructure costs to develop the site.ldquoI donrsquot believe this site is worth pound.m when you go into the detail of the terms and conditions of the sale, and that was the opinion of the district valuer, whose assessment with vacant possession, which we will not have, was much lower than pound.m.ldquoEven when adjusted up for a special assumption, the district valuer still valued the land at a price lower than we are paying.ldquoThis is a speculative and risky expenditure of public money at a time when, quite apart from Brexit, there is shuddering uncertainty in markets. ldquoHouse prices and land values can go down as well as up. We should not be spending public money on buying this estate at this time for more than it is worth.ldquoIn what alternative opportunities could we invest poundm ldquoThis council should invest enough in roads to signicantly improve the road condition index, but we cannot afford to do that.ldquoThis council should commit to four new high schools in  years, but you wonrsquot make that commitment.ldquoI will not tell the electors in Peebles, as you will have to, that they cannot have a new high school within  years when you have tied up poundm for  or so years in Tweedbank.ldquoWe canrsquot even cut the grass properly in our cemeteries, but this administration glibly spends poundm on buying a private estate.ldquoThis is a decision I fear you may come to regret.In reply, East Berwickshire councillor Jim Fullarton defended the deal, claiming that pressures on local government spending made such projects necessary, saying: ldquoWersquove had several briefings on this subject, and officers have presented us with an excellent paper on the future benefits of developing this site, especially with the council in control.ldquoNow councillor Bell is scaremongering about service cuts, but this is a smokescreen to keep us away from the real issue at hand, which is the financial pressure being passed down to Scottish local authorities by his SNP colleagues.ldquoScottish local councils are currently expected to continue services while facing continuous cuts.ldquoIt will be very interesting to see what opposition councillors bring to the table for their budget proposals. No doubt there will be some vanity projects.The Tweedbank masterplan, going hand in hand with the Borders Railway blueprint programme, includes earmarking residential and business space on the estate, as well as expanding Tweedbank and rebranding the current industrial estate there as the Borders Innovation Park.The deal agreed with the estatersquos owner, Alexander Hamilton, is for the remaining  acres still in private hands to add to the  acres bought from then owner Constance Hamilton using compulsory powers by the former Roxburgh County Council in the early s to create Tweedbank.The land will now be owned by Lowood Tweedbank, a company set up and owned by the council."},{"url":null,"title":"royal-scots-history-is-on-parade-at-peebles-library","story":"AN historic link between Peebles and what was Britains oldest infantry regiment was further strengthened this week with a presentation at the towns library.The Royal Scots was raised by Royal Warrant in  and subsequently served with distinction for almost four centuries through many campaigns across the globe.The Regiment continued to recruit almost entirely from Edinburgh, the Lothians and Peeblesshire until its amalgamation just over a decade ago.During the First World War the Regiment expanded to  battalions in which over , men served.During the - conflict a total of , Royal Scots made the ultimate sacrice - many from the Borders, including  from Peebles,  from Innerleithen and  from Walkerburn.The Royal Scots served in most of the campaigns of the First World War, from the Western Front to Bulgaria.To mark the close connection with the area the Regiment was awarded the Freedom of Peebles in .As the centenary year of World War I ending draws to a close this month, a presentation was made on Tuesday by representatives of The Royal Scots Association at Peebles Library.Nick Edwardson and Alex Dockar presented a rare three-volume History of the Royal Scotsto head librarian Alison Tait.Mr Edwardson told us: \"The presentation of the volumes acknowledges the contribution made by the county of Peeblesshire to the story of Britainrsquos senior infantry regiment.\"The Regiment was amalgamated in  but its long history of proud service continues today as part of st Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland.The Colours of the Regimentrsquos th Battalion which historically had a particular association with Peebles were laid up in the town in .And they are now displayed outside the entrance to the library in the Chambers Institute.The three-volume History of the Royal Scots will now be available for everyone to read in the library."},{"url":null,"title":"chance-for-parents-to-register-children-for-nursery-places","story":"PARENTS in the Borders are being invited to register their children for a place at nursery.Enrolment week takes place from Monday, January , to Friday, January .

how important this project is to Jedburgh which is why a public vote will be held to choose a winning name of this exciting community asset.ldquoWe look forward to further engagement with the community on this project next year, which will see this innovative facility move closer to completion.Work on the new campus is progressing well, with the frame of the new building - which will replace Jedburgh Grammar, Howdenburn and Parkside primaries - being installed.The games hall section of the new campus has been completed with work continuing on the atrium, canteen area and the nursery area.The campus will have provision for nursery, primary and secondary school children alongside further education.Community facilities will include a multi-use games area, a G hockey pitch, G

water treatment work in the Borders has proved its number one when it comes to number twos, as it celebrates a green efficiency milestone.Galafoot Waste Water Treatment Plant in Galashiels has become one of Scottish Waterrsquos most self-sufficient energy sites, generating more energy than it uses.Using a technique called Combined Heat and Power , the site generates electricity from sewage sludge, the semi-solid by-product of waste water treatment.On average the Galashiels site generates more than , kWh week of renewable energy - which is enough to power  homes for a year.The site does still have to import a small amount of power to the site when the CHP needs maintained, but the consumption of imported power to the site has dropped by a dramatic two thirds since the CHP was installed three years ago.Only two operators work at the Galashiels site which processes an average  m of sludge every day. The sludge is created as part of the water treatment process at the site ndash which serves a population equivalent of around ,. It also treats sludge from most other parts of the Borders, from Eyemouth in the east to Newcastleton in the west.Brian Reavely, better known as Fudge, has worked as a Site Operator at Galafoot for  years. He says one of his proudest achievements is seeing how the site has transformed the way it operates ndash and ensuring it becomes a green as it can.The -year-old, who lives in the town, said: ldquoTreating waste uses a lot of energy,you think about what we are dealing with and the dferent processes it has to go through you get an idea. Added to that this site operates round the clock every day, so it needs a lot of power.ldquoWe take our environmental responsibility very seriously here, even down to recycling items like cans and bottles and packaging in our kitchens.ldquoAnd one thing we have started doing is working with our neighbouring works to ensure that the sludge dry solids are as high as possible when they arrive at our site -ndash to save on energy use, reduce our carbon footprint and minimise vehicle movements.ldquoThings like this can make a real dference. The imported sludge is mixed with the on-site, indigenous sludge. This feeds the digestor which produces the gaswhich is the fuel for the  kW capacity CHP.ldquoWe are very green-aware here and proud of what has been achieved, so much so I have made signs reminding us of how self-sufficient the site is.ldquoI also thought it would be a good idea to let people in the town and the many people who visit here know about our achievements and it was decided a plaque highlighting how energy efficient we are would be a good way to let people know.Another addition to the site is a collection of items that have been put down toilets which enter the sewer network in the town these include a number of rubber ducks,  teeth, plastic toy figures, tennis balls, a dogrsquos chewy toy and ious sized toy cars.Fudge said: ldquoWhether these things have been put down accidentally or not they can block our drains and do real damage to the network. So we do urge folk to be careful what goes down their toilets and sinks.ldquoBut it is baby wipes which are our biggest headache these days, the number of items put into the sewer is unbelievable.ldquoThey do not break up ndash where do people think they go  They just clog up our machines and causes blockages that can lead to flooding and bursts.ldquoOne of my biggest hopes for the new year is for more people to get the message that they have to be more careful what they put down their loos and sinks, be that baby wipes or sanitary products or fats and oils and grease.More than  of Scottish Waterrsquos water and wastewater treatment works are either self-sufficient or partly sufficient in their power requirements, leading to lower operating costs and a more sustainable business.Galashiels is one of the top five that offset most of the sitersquos use as well as being able to export to the gridndash others include Glencorse Water Treatment Works, near Edinburgh and Loch Turret Water Treatment Works in Perth and Kinross.Simon Parsons, Scottish Waters director of strategic customer service planning, said: ldquoTo keep the cost of our services as low as possible it is essential we develop our approach to energy management and continue to reduce our carbon footprint.ldquoWhere appropriate, like at Galashiels, wersquore exploring opportunities to export energy to the National Grid, showing that itrsquos possible to maximise the economic advantages of Scotland water resources in the spirit of a Hydro Nation and contribute to national renewable energy targets.ldquoScottish Water is committed to continuing to reduce its energy bill and further increase renewable generation ndash and Galashiels is a wonderful example of what can be achieved.Three years ago Borders College in Galashiels became the first organisation in the UK to benefit from a waste water heat recovery system, installed in partnership between Scottish Water Horizons and Shark Energy.It extracts the natural warmth contained in waste water in the sewer and transfers the heat to the clean side of the heating system via a heat exchange mechanism. The recovered heat is then amplied via pumps to generate appropriate temperatures for use in buildings.The heat produced is being sold to Borders College producing savings in energy, costs and carbon emissions. The system now provides around  per cent of the heat needed by the Galashiels campus.Earlier this year Scottish Water achieved a major energy milestone when it was announced the amount of renewable energy the company generates and facilitates is now more than double its electricity consumption. It now generates and hosts  Gigawatt hourper annum of renewable energy - enough to power more than , homes for a year."},{"url":null,"title":"galashiels-woman-loses-six-stone-at-slimming-club","story":"A GALASHIELS woman who lost a staggering six dress sizes is encouraging people to join her in dropping the pounds.Jacqui Porteous decided  was her year to lose weight and has so far managed to sht a whopping six stone after signing up to her local Slimming Word class in Galashiels.Jacqui said: ldquoI joined Slimming World after I saw photo of myself that made me realise how overweight I was, as well as how much my health was deteriorating.

We now look forward to the merriment of Hogmanay! These days in between, traditionally known as the Daft Days, are my favourite of Yule time.Yet not so long ago the most popular focus of festivity was neither Christmas nor even Hogmanay, it was Handsel Monday.It fell upon the first Monday after New Year, although there was some dispute as to the exact Monday it should be celebrated, for some measured the date by the old calendar.This was the case for the country folk in East Lothian, or Haddingtonshire as it was then known. So Auld Handsel Monday fell for them on the first Monday after January .It was the country folkrsquos winter holiday because Christmas and Yule festivities had for so long been banned by the Kirk.The word Handsel apparently comes from an old Saxon word which means to give by hand.On Handsel Monday the family gathered together and shared gts and social time, which for much of the th century remained the main winter festival of the rural poor in East Lothian.The East Lothian writer and poet James Lumsden captured the atmosphere of this now forgotten holiday in one of his poems about the day.He tells us the children would wake up all excited, and the merriment would begin as the dawn of this winterrsquos day heralded a special time of conviviality and reunion:ldquoBy screich o morn the bairns are up,\"And loud the auld folk rousin\"What braws are donnd, what sangs are connd,\"What daffin an carousin!\"It was a time when family members made huge efforts tohome and celebrate together. Food had been specially kept for the occasion and those at home awaited the arrival of others who they had perhaps not seen since the previous Handsel Monday.Lumsden says streams of young folk left the towns for their homes in the countryside. Domestic servants, shop assistants, apprentices all set off in the early hours on Handsel Monday ason a pilgrimage, to share in the celebrations:ldquoSune ran we hame wi anxious haste\"For our grand Hansel denner,\"Pork chops and dumplins ndash lord a feast ndash\"A gorge for saunt or sinner!We can picture the scene as daughters and sons ed, greeted by parents and younger siblings, grandparents and old friends. It was a time of gt giving, with family and neighbours sharing treats.But the rich were expected to give too, as it was the tradition that masters and employers would give gts of drink, food and even a financial contribution to the communityrsquos festivities. In fact, the social norms were often overturned on this day, with the landowners serving and working for the poor on this one special day.While it had no religious content, Handsel Monday was in its own way sacred. It was a longed for day off for those who worked hard with little in the way of holidays. It was Christmas Day, Boxing Day and Hogmanay all wrapped into one.And as the day wore into evening, the merriment would build. People made the most of this precious social time together, with stories, dance and song:ldquoSyne sune wi reels, an strathspeys even,\"The wee cot housie dirled,\"As a the blasts o yearth an heaven\"Were gainst its boukie hurled\"Braw lads and lasses lap and skirled.As is always the case with such gatherings, time flew and too soon the day would draw to a close:ldquoBut daffin jigs, an sangs, an tales,\"Sped far too swith the hours on.Sad farewells would have to be made. Mothers and fathers hugged tightly their grown children as they prepared to set off back to their employment.

Like the Ides of March, Britains fate must be sealed on Brexit day in only  weeks time.Will May finally win parliamentary support for her Withdrawal Deal  Will she be ousted in a cabinet coup  Will there be a repeat referendum  Will Britain end up revoking Article   These are the options, broadly speaking. About the only thing that seems pretty certain to me is that there will be no General Election and no ldquoNo Deal Brexit. I simply cannot see parliament or the country accepting the chaos, cost and potential suffering of crashing out of the European Union without any negotiated settlement.True, planes wouldnt fall out of the skies and trade would continue, somehow, but the disruption would create enormous stress. There is a strong possibility of food shortages, and people with medical conditions would suffer needless anxiety over medicine supplies. The fact that the Government is preparing to put the army on the streets and ports testies to the risk of civil disturbance. There would be a hard border in Northern Ireland overnight and a resumption of sectarian tensions. Small firms would go bust and big firms would leave.So, I am confident that MPs and ministers will prevent this happening,necessary by removing Theresa May and forming the equivalent of a wartime coalition. Working back from that the most probable outcomes look like: Revoking Article  or Mays Withdrawal Deal. And, it will be Labour, not Theresa May, the Tory Brexiters or the DUP, who decides which.Brexiters hate the Withdrawal Deal, which they think chains Britain to the EU, and Jeremy Corbyn does too ndash and for rather similar reasons. He thinks the state aid rules would prevent a Labour government nationalising the utility companies, and also believes that a permanent backstop would give Britain ldquono say on any future trade deals. Mays Withdrawal Deal should therefore be defeated by around - votes.Corbyn will then finally table that motion of no confidence in the government which he delayed in December. May will assuredly win that vote, because the last thing Tory MPs and the DUP want is general election, a Corbyn government and an even worse deal. May will now have won confidence votes from her own MPs and from the House of Commons. That will make her immovable ndash at least for the time being.Armed with this she willto Brussels and stage another televised spat with Jean-Claude Juncker. The  will probably have something  up their sleeves . Perhaps Michel Barnier will propose amending the Political Declaration to include a -month limit to the Irish backstop. This was dropped from the final draft of the December communique.The  could also extend the transition period making a commitment that negotiations must be concluded by March . This is already in the Political Declaration, but it could be built into a firm commitment and subject to independent arbitration. The Irish backstop would thus become a last resort and triggered only in the event of a total breakdown of time-limited trade negotiations.This will be the moment of truth for Labour, as Theresa May brings her amended deal back to the Commons in February. The hardline Brexiteers and the DUP will not be persuaded because the legally-binding Irish backstop will still be there in the Withdrawal Agreement. The future will be in Labourrsquos hands. Many pro-Europeans tell me that Corbyn will at this point ldquopivot to a referendum, voting down the Withdrawal Deal a second time, and backing a cross-party amendment for a Peoples Vote.But while he doesnt accept Mays Withdrawal Deal, still less Norway Plus, nor does Corbyn favour remaining in the European Union. Before Christmas, he caused widespread dismay among pro-Europeans by confirming that, evenhe were to win a general election, Labour would still be committed to Britainrsquos departure from the European Union.The Labour leaders instinct will surely be to secure concessions from Theresa May on the future trade negotiations. A closer alignment with the single market and a permanent customs deal, is what he wants. To get her business through, she would surely end up agreeing. Deal done. Britain leaves as planned. Pro-European Labour MPs would rebel, but that would be unlikely to scupper the governments pro-Withdrawal majority.Alternatively,Jeremy Corbyn stands firm and pivots to a referendum, there will be unprecedented turmoil in parliament, not least over what the question should be. Theresa May will stand down and there will be a political vacuum. As the clock ticks down to Brexit day, a new parliamentary party could emerge: the Europe Party, uniting all the pro-Remain MPs, and dedicated to a second referendum. The choice for voters would be Revoking Article  or No Deal. Mayrsquos deal, it seems to me, would be a dead duck by this stage.By Revoking Article  Britain would retain its opt-outs from the euro and its budget rebate and there would be no disruption of trade. It would be asBrexit never happened. Brussels would happily delay Article  for a referendum. However, this referendum would be like an offer voters canrsquot refuse, because MPs in the ldquoRemaniac Coalitionwould have to resign en massethe country opted for No Deal.It would be terrible campaign, exactly three years after the original referendum, with the far right raging about immigration. It would take years, decades for the bad will to subside. But faced with the prospect of a chaotic No DealI suspect voters would back Revoke. There is nothing undemocratic in having a final say. Parliament has failed to find a credible formula for leaving the EU. The only way end this agony and confusion is for Britain to accept that Brexit is just too costly, too dficult, too unpredictable and too all-consuming. The message would be: For Gods sake, lets just stop this madness and get our lives back."},{"url":null,"title":"Today   s feminist activists are wrong to exclude men","story":"Anne Widdicombe might have dismissed it as trivial and whingeing ndash and some #MeTooers undoubtedly deserve that label ndash but the culture of sexual harassment and abuse it calls out is far from unimportant. Equally crucial are other issues that have vexed women for decades,not centuries, among them equality of pay, professional respect and opportunity.So far, so reasonable. Yet, when I heard Mary Robinson, former President of Ireland, talking last week about Mothers of Invention, a podcast she has set up that focusses exclusively on womenrsquos efforts to address climate change, my heart did a double skip: one for delight, two for despair. Delight that women are getting involved directly in trying to help reduce our carbon footprint, without a doubt the most urgent of the worldrsquos ails, but despair at Robinsonrsquos smug assumption that ldquoitrsquos women who change behaviour, in the family and the community.Letrsquos put aside for a moment the fact that, as Robinson reveals in her recent book, Climate Justice, her own awareness of environmental calamity dawned on her like a Damascene conversion astonishingly late in the day. What sets my teeth on edge is the sanctimonious way in which women are increasingly frequently being portrayed ndash mostly by other women. Itrsquos asthere is a collective halo that needs constant polishing, lest it lose its lustre. Indeed, it seems you cannot these days be a female in a position of influence or authority without feeling the urge ndash or the pressure ndash to add a stone to the cairn of womenrsquos rights, entitlements and endeavours.Donrsquot misunderstand me. I am an old-style feminist, and decry utterly the unfair, oppressive and sometimes iniquitous treatment of women in our and other societies. Men have an awful lot to answer for, today and in the past. But I get decidedly uneasy at the perceptual ide that appears to be widening between the sexes. Climate change, said Robinson, is ldquoman-made, and she enjoys using the term, even though admitting it embraces men and women. But apart from this deliberate provocation, is she really correct in assuming that women change attitudes more widely than men Maybe it depends on what sort of country yoursquore living in. When I look around the UK, I donrsquot recognise that stark distinction. Plenty of men seem to be trying to bring about green change, ethical enlightenment, societal improvement, better childcare and education, and are working towards this alongside women. Sometimes, for heavenrsquos sake, they are even taking the lead.Meanwhile, children in two-parent families are open to influences from both parents. While women still tend to spend more time with their young, this does not necessarily equate to a more lasting influence on their behaviour or outlook. The other day my husbandrsquos granddaughter rushed to interrupt her mother who was on the phone to announce that Liverpool had just scored a fourth goal against Newcastle ndash whose influence was that We are going through a phase where almost every interview with a woman politician or banker, entrepreneur or artist, includes the obligatory question about #MeToo, in the same way that every American is asked their opinion of Trump. And while it obviously takes women at the top to help bring about change for those lower down the ladder ndash or in the community at large ndash it is surely not a sacred obligation placed upon each of them. To assume that is to be sexist and discriminatory. Itrsquos certainly not an expectation placed upon men.Yet to listen to some womenrsquos outrage, yoursquod think therersquos a contract, signed at birth, that insists women pay especial attention to female issues eventhere are things that interest them more. Florence Nightingale and Elsie Inglis personally helped save hundreds of lives, and their influence rippled down the decades to the benefit of all, women as much as men. Yet their initial impulse was not to improve things for their own kind, but to help wounded soldiers and the sick and dying. In other words, to improve the conditions of humanity as a whole, not one gender or the other.Of course splinter groups and special interest parties can make things change ndash just look at Dr Inglisrsquos formidable all-women hospitals. There is a galvanising power and collective spirit in female solidarity that nobody can deny. So letrsquos hear it for women tackling climate change. And for men too.In these unsettling and perilous times we surely need to remember that we are all just people. Our identity is not primarily male or female, trans, intersex, other, or whatever label fits. We are simply and essentially human, with all the complexities of personality, type, and biases that entails. Since wersquore in it all together, thatrsquos also how we should sort things out."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9237872.jpg?type=article-full","title":"how-scotrails-bid-to-create-best-railway-scotland-has-ever-had-remains-off-track","story":"Today we examinehow ScotRail is performing as it looks for the highest of standards on Scotlands railways.IT was billed as the improvement plan to usher in faster trips and build the \"best railway Scotland has every had\".But Dutch transport firm Abelliorsquos control of the ScotRail franchise has come under fire from all directions as disruption went on for a rd day on Hogmanay following the introduction of a new winter timetable.The new timetable, timed to coincide with the introduction of faster and more environmentally friendly trains, were set up after railway consultant Nick Donovan carried out an independent review of the performance ofAbellioand Network Rail, which is in charge of track infrastructure.This resulted in a series of accepted recommendations primarily to improve train reliability and to suspend skip-stopping, except as a last resort.@ScotRail .

Andrea Leadsom, the Commons Leader, is due to tell MPs, probably in her weekly business statement on Thursday, just when the key vote on Mrs Mayrsquos plan will be during the following week.However, there is a deal of uncertainty hanging over the whole issue with much resting on whether or not the desired change to the proposed agreement, that could come in the form of a legally-binding addendum, is forthcoming and will satisfy the concerns, in particular, of Northern Irelandrsquos Democratic Unionists, on whom the PM relies for a Commons majority, as well as the Tory Brexiteers.It is not impossible that Mrs May will make a statement to MPs, informing them of the progress or otherwise, of the talks with the EU. Failure to get the necessary changes will place the PM in a dire situation she will be in the same position as last month when just before MPs were due to vote on her proposed deal, she postponed it to avoid a humiliating defeat.Mr Hunt said: \"We have a clear opportunity to leave the EU on March . It has the vast majority of things that people wanted not absolutely everything.\"The question is, can we turn this into something that gives us absolutely everything we wanted  I believe we can.\"There will be some tough negotiations to follow in the years ahead but getting this clearer language on the backstop will help to get it through Parliament.\"The Foreign Secretary confirmed the UK Government was continuing to try to change details of the backstop within the Withdrawal Agreement.\"Theresa May has been very clear this isnt just about words but about text which has legal force, he explained.The Secretary of State, who is on a visit to Singapore, denied that he wanted the UK to follow the island city states social or political model post-Brexit but said he admired its economics.\"We do not want and do not seek to emulate the social or political model of Singapore, declared the Cabinet minister.\"I was Health Secretary for nearly six years, I am a passionate defender of a health service that is free at the point of use and,you remember, I secured quite a lot of extra money for the health service during my tenure, so those things are very dferent, he told BBC Radio rsquos Today programme.\"But in terms of their economic model, there are some things we can learn.\"Mr Hunt praised Singapores education investment and \"long-term approach\" to economic development, particularly in fibre optics."},{"url":null,"title":"snp-urge-jeremy-corbyn-to-drop-bewildering-approach-to-brexit-and-back-peoples-vote-following-labour-poll","story":"The warning, from the SNP, comes after the Labour leader continued to oppose a second EU referendum despite a poll suggesting almost three-quarters of his partyrsquos members want one.A survey of more than , party members found  per cent would like to see their leader throw his weight behind a Peoples Vote.However, Mr Corbyn has long resisted such calls and, asked todayhe would change his stance, replied: \"What we will do is vote against having no deal, well vote against Theresa Mays deal.\"And at that point she should go back to Brussels and say this is not acceptable to Britain and renegotiate a customs union, form a customs union with the European Union to secure trade.\"At last years Labour Party conference a motion was passed which saidanother general election were not called, then Mr Corbyn should pursue another referendum on Brexit.John McDonnell, the Shadow Chancellor, has suggested that in these circumstances, a second EU poll would be ldquoinevitable. It is thought other senior Shadow Cabinet members such as Tom Watson and Sir Keir Starmer are supportive of a Peoples Vote should a general election fail to materialise.Speaking about Labourrsquos conference motion Mr Corbyn told reporters the policy was \"sequential\" on a range of issues, explaining: \"The issue of another referendum was, of course, one of the options, but that was very much after the votes have taken place in Parliament.\"We havent yet had a vote and the Government really should be ashamed of itself.\"This vote has been delayed and delayed and delayed.

That is not acceptable, this vote should have taken place more than a month ago, declared the Labour leader.\"This Government is just trying to run down the clock and create a sense of fear between either no deal or Mays deal. Well, both of those options are completely unacceptable,\" he added.But the SNP and pro-EU campaigners urged the Labour leader to listen to his members.Stephen Gethins, the Nationalistsrsquo Europe spokesman, said as the clock ticked down to March , the UK was perilously close to crashing out of the EU without a deal a situation, he said, would be devastating for jobs, public services and household incomes.ldquoWe need to find common ground across the political ide to stop that disaster and the SNP has been leading efforts and liaison with other parties to try to achieve this.ldquoA second EU referendum would give the public the chance to reject the  choice of Theresa Mayrsquos unwanted deal or an extreme no deal scenario.ldquoWith his own party members and voters overwhelmingly supportive of this approach, itrsquos bewildering that Jeremy Corbyn insists that a good Brexit is possible it appears that everyone accept Jeremy Corbyn and the Tories knows there is no such thing as a jobs-first Brexit, declared the Fe MP.ldquoLabour must come off the fence and stop letting the UK Government get away with its disastrous plans or theyrsquoll be every bit as culpable as the Tories, he added.Labour backbencher Phil Wilson, speaking on behalf of the Peoplersquos Vote campaign, noted how his own partyrsquos leadership had ldquotoo often hidden behind myths that Labour is almost evenly ided on this issue when the clear evidence from this and other polls shows that it is the leadership which is increasingly out of step with its supporters\".Urging Mr Corbyn to listen to Labour members, the Sedgefield MP added: ldquoLabourrsquos leadership now has a huge opportunity to be at the front of a popular campaign against the Governmentrsquos Brexit deal and make sure the public are given the right to have the final say in the form of a Peoplersquos Vote. I urge Jeremy to seize this chance to change the course of history, before itrsquos too late.\"Eloise Todd, head of the pro-EU Best for Britain campaign, said: ldquoLabour members are clear about what they want. Jeremy Corbyn has run on a ticket of party democracy so that party policy will reflect the views of ordinary members more than ever before. Brexit is his chance to deliver on that promise and with a majority of the country now wanting to stay in the EU that leadership is needed more than ever.\"The clock is ticking and Labour must change tack in the New Year by securing a public vote on Brexit and campaigning to reflect what its members and families and communities around the UK want: to stay in the EU and rebuild Britain from within, she added.The poll, carried out by YouGov for the Economic and Social Research Council-funded Party Members Project, also found backing for a second vote among Labour supporters with  per cent of current Labour voters and  per cent of those who backed the party at the  election wanting Mr Corbyn to \"fully support\" a fresh referendum.It also suggested that tens of thousands of Labour members could be prepared to quit the party over the leaderships approach to leaving the EU.Some  per cent of Labour members put the party leaderrsquos failure to back a second referendum down to a belief that he supports Brexit.Some  per cent opposed the stance the party has taken on Brexit and  per cent of those told researchers it has caused them to consider quitting.

A clear majority of the pupils really enjoy taking part in all of the science activities listed. Doing experiments in class was the most enjoyed activityldquoP-P pupil beliefs regarding science were generally positive. There was a strong indication that many of the pupils were keen to be involved with science when they left school.ldquoHowever, there was little indication that they could see themselves as a scientist in the future, which may coincide with the relatively low levels of those who know someone who works in science.Researchers said a key strength of the new approach in Raise schools was the use of primary science development officersto help teachers expand on existing science education.These officers are supported by a national education officer for primary science, employed by The Wood Foundation, but seconded to national schools body Education Scotland.The Robert Owen Centre report concluded: ldquoThe evidence to date strongly indicates that the PSDOs are working effectively to promote Raise objectives and that the national education officer has had a critical role in ensuring the coherence of the overall approach and in supporting the development of the PSDOs.Sharon Smith, the PSDO for West Dunbartonshire Council, believes the Raise approach is having a signicant impact.She said the key to success was engaging with families as early as possible to ensure they had a positive attitude towards the study of science.ldquoWe have been holding science open evenings to get whole families to come to school and take part in experiments. We had families building model propeller boats and getting them to move across a water trough, she explained.ldquoI had a grandmother try out the experiment and she said she had always been rubbish at science at school, but was delighted she could do it and that is the key.ldquoBy involving the parents and the grandparents you are starting to re-write some of the mindsets they have from their own experiences of much more traditional science experiments.Mrs Smith said modern science lessons should be focused on investigation to allow pupils to come up with their own ideas for research and then back it up with experiments.ldquoIt is trying to build up the habits of trial and error in a group setting where they are working as a team and learning from mistakes. We find a lot more buzz about the lessons and much more of a focus on on investigating and being curious.Headteachers in West Dunbartonshire have welcomed the new approach. Karen Hollern, headteacher at Balloch Primary, said: ldquoThe programme has permeated our whole curriculum and our pupils have benefited hugely from being involved in it.ldquoThey have gained in confidence, engaged with teachers and have shown great enthusiasm for the ious dferent experiments and practical projects we have undertaken.A spokeswoman for The Wood Foundation said the creation of strong foundations for science in primary was critical to developing the workforce of the future. She said: ldquoNurturing natural curiosity and building upon the interest in Stem from this early stage will help raise aspirations and broaden future employment opportunities.The Raise project is currently running in Higland, Moray, West Dunbartonshire, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Angus, Dumfries and Galloway and Fe councils."},{"url":null,"title":"2018-tory-brexit-pyschodrama-notches-up-political-casualties-from-beginning-to-end","story":"The latest twists and turns in the Tory psychodrama over Brexit began in January with a reshuffle, which simply emphasised how Theresa May was getting weaker and weaker.Jeremy Hunt refused to be moved from Health to Business and, instead, got Social Care added to his brief. Justine Greening refused to move from Education to Work and Pensions and so left Government, the first of several.Just to underline how reshuffles are iniably fraught affairs, the Prime Ministerrsquos decision to appoint Maria Caulfield as the new Conservative vice-chairwoman for women was hit by a tide of criticism from womenrsquos campaigners given the Sussex MP opposes the decriminalisation of abortion. Ironically, her tenure would last just six months. She resigned in July. Over Brexit. What  At the end of January a leaked government paper showed that Brexit would damage the UK economy no matter what kind of deal was agreed as much as eight per cent of GDP growth would go up in smoke within  years.In the spring, tensions mounted as the Lords inflicted a series of defeats on the Government on, among others, the customs union, removing the March  exit date and citizensrsquo rights they would later be overturned in the Commons. But the heat was rising.At the May elections in England, the Tories avoided a humiliating result, losing only  seats while Labour and the Liberal Democrats gained  and  respectively. Naturally, they talked up the results but in the past the Opposition have picked up hundreds of seats at the governing partyrsquos expense.By July the Tory psychodrama moved into a key act with a marathon Cabinet meeting at Chequers and the agreement on the way forward: Mrs Mayrsquos deal or no-deal.Yet, within  hours David Davis, the Brexit Secretary, would resign, followed by his Brexit department colleague Steve Baker. The plan for a free trade area was too much as it would bind the UK to EU rules this was not aof sovereignty, insisted the departing ministers, but vassalage.Then  hours later Boris Johnson resigned as Foreign Secretary, denouncing how the Brexit ldquodream is dying. Within another  hours Ms Caulfield and Ben Bradley had resigned their Tory Party positions as vice-chairmen.But the resignations stopped there the Tory avalanche did not happen even though the damage was bad enough. Two of the original Brexiteers, Gove and Fox remainedAs the UKrsquos long hot summer rolled on, relief was at hand.Donald Trump finally turned up on British shores to give the Brexit soap opera a bit of American pizzazz not that it needed it. The US President demanded tea with the Queen and teed off at Turnberry. In between, there was the little matter of a meeting with Mrs May at Chequers ndash where  The US Presidentrsquos guile as a businessman meant he sought to disorientate his host even before the summit had begun with an interview with the Brexit-friendly Sun in which he damned the PMrsquos Withdrawal Plan, saying it would \"probably kill\" any trade deal with America.He then sought to brand the interview ldquofake news even though what he was complaining about was all on tape. Which gave us an insight into how Mr Trump handles the Press.It also emerged The Donald had given The Theresa a bit of helpful advice: sue the EU.Just before the summer recess the PMrsquos Chequers Plan was formally declared dead as the Government accepted changes to its plan on trade by Jacob Rees-Moggrsquos European Research Group. No  insisted the changes were consistent with Mrs Mayrsquos proposal but it looked like many to a cave-in to keep the hard right-wingers on board.The Government began its tranche of technical notices on what would happenthere were a no-deal, including sending in the Army to deliver food, medicine and fuel supplies. Supermarkets were also beginning to stockpile.There have, of course, been the occasional distractions from the runaway train that is Brexit some offering genuine relief to the Tories and others just piling on the pressure.They included the plunge in UK-Russia relations over the attempted poisoning of the Skripals using a military grade nerve agent and the subsequent murder of Dawn Sturgess the Windrush scandal that cost Amber Rudd her job as Home Secretary the purported ldquoend of austerity with pay rises for public sector workers official approval of the third runway at Heathrow and the football World Cup.Then, of course, there was Ruth Davidson and her uplting announcement that she was pregnant Finn duly arrived in October, meaning that during the ongoing psychodrama at least one senior Tory was back stage, tending to other, more important matters.As the conference season got underway, Brussels delivered its own rebuff to Mrs May, rejecting her Chequers Plan. By the time it came to her keynote conference speech even twinkle-toes Theresa could not bear to mention the phrase by name.As October progressed, the Tory leader was looking for a way out of the seemingly intractable backstop issue and suggested perhaps extending the transition period.Despite her assurances, particularly to the Scottish Conservatives, that Britain would become an independent coastal state by the end of the transition period in December , she conspicuously failed to say what would happenthis were extended. The assumption, certainly in Brussels, was thatthe transition period were extended, then so too would the UKrsquos alignment with the hated EU Common Fisheries Policy. Scottish Secretary David Mundell wrote to the PM, making clear that reneging on commitments to Scotlandrsquos fishermen would be a resigning matter.As autumn progressed pressure was beginning to build from all sides.In late October, some , people marched in London in support of a Peoplersquos Vote anathema to Mrs May.The Confederation of British Industry reported  per cent of UK firms had cancelled or delayed investments due to Brexit uncertainty double the figure from a year earlier.Mid-November saw another landmark Cabinet meeting when, we were told, senior ministers backed the PM and her plan following a ldquolong, detailed and impassioned debate\".But as with Chequers beforehand, the aftermath saw the resignation of another Brexit Secretary, Dominic Raab. His Cabinet colleague Esther McVey bailed out too as did two junior ministers.Crucially, the others on resignation-watch did not follow suit most notably Michael Gove, who stayed on as Environment Secretary to fight to change the deal in the mid to long term. If he had gone, then the Scot might have sparked the departure of others and brought Mrs May down.At yet another EU summit, the EU agreed the PMrsquos Plan, the ldquobest and only deal possible.Tensions mounted in SW as the anti-EU Tory European Research Group boasted the  signatures needed to mount a no-confidence vote were in but then had to back down. Their day would come though.By now the pyschodrama was entering the beginning of its most crucial act at Westminster.After yet another ministerial resignation, Sam Gyimahrsquos - the th - the Government was found in contempt of Parliament for failing to publish in full the Attorney Generalrsquos legal advice. MPs also voted for the amendment tabled by former Tory Cabinet Minister Dominic Grieve to give Parliament control should Mrs Mayrsquos Plan be rejected.The next day, the Government published the legal advice, revealing the backstop could ldquoendure indefinitelyno agreement was reached.The following week saw the most dramatic -hour period in the psychodrama to date.On the day the European Court of Justice ruled Britain could cancel Article  without the consent of the EU, the PM called an emergency Cabinet meeting and announced the postponement of the vote on her deal, knowing she was facing a humiliating defeat.The next day, Mrs May was in Brussels trying to improve the deal, most notably on the backstop, but without joy. At Westminster, MPs debated her decision to pull the vote. Some ministers began to air alternatives to the PMrsquos plan a sure sign she had lost control.Rumours that the  signatures to call a no-confidence vote in the Tory leader abounded and were confirmed the following morning by Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the  Committee. By that afternoon the vote was taken and the PM won the vote. Yet,  Conservative MPs said they had no confidence in her more than a third of the party. She battled on but her authority was badly dented.Jeremy Corbyn tabled a no-confidence vote. But it was not in the Tory Government as a whole, rather in Mrs Mayrsquos leadership alone. This meant, by parliamentary convention, the Government did not have to allow Commons time for a debate and a vote. Critics said it was nothing more than an empty gesture.And now as we gird our loins for the next intensive episode of what has become a national psychodrama, who knows how many more political casualties there will be. By the end of this month Mrs May could well be one of them."},{"url":null,"title":"disappointed-by-tv-version-of-les-mis-here-comes-the-real-thing","story":"ldquoThose pictures looked exactly like the set of Les Miserables, says the composer of one of the most iconic pieces of musical theatre in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries.ldquoFirst of all it made me realise that Les Miserables is still relevant. Secondly, it also made me realise that in  years we have learnt nothing.Maybe this is why the current year-long UK tour of Les Miserables, originally adapted by Schonberg and writer Alan Boublil from Victor Hugorsquos  novel, has pretty much sold out already.Arriving in Edinburgh this month for the first time in  years for a month-long run, the English-language version of Boublil and Schonbergrsquos show has been a fixture of the London theatre circuit since Trevor Nunn directed a co-production between the Royal Shakespeare Company and Cameron Mackintosh at the Barbican in .This makes it the second longest-running musical in the world.Despite the success of putting Hugorsquos story charting ex-convict Jean Valjeanrsquos travails through poverty-stricken France onstage, Schonberg for one isnrsquot quite sure of the reasons why it happened.ldquoItrsquos a phenomenon I donrsquot really understand, the now -year old composer admits of a creation which introduced the world to songs now regarded as modern classics such as I Dreamed A Dream, ldquobut the show is more popular than ever. I must say, Irsquom totally surprised.By the time Les Miserables opens at the Festival Theatre in Edinburgh, the new six-part TV adaptation of Hugorsquos book scripted by Andrew Davies will be mid-way through its own run. With Dominic West playing Valjean as part of a cast that includes Olivia Coleman and David Oyelowo, rather than claiming kin with Boublil and Schonbergrsquos take on things, advance publicity appears to pointing up the fact that it is categorically not the musical, and shouldnrsquot be confused as such. Viewers and critics have already criticised this sans songs version as being flat.With Les Mis the musical itself filmed in  with Hugh Jackman as Valjean, this too is something Schonberg doesnrsquot understand.ldquoWhenever I read an article about the BBC version, they are saying it is the real version of the novel and not the trivial musical stage version, he says.ldquoI donrsquot know how you can promote something against it. People know the title because of the musical show, but each time therersquos an adaptation, they all make the point that they are not going to have anyone singing. But who knows  This one might be very good. I will look at it carefully.Schonberg probably doesnrsquot need to worry too much. As he points out, there has been more than  films based on Hugorsquos novel, with over  TV adaptations as well as another  dferent versions onstage. This is how great stories work as they are reimagined for every age. Indeed, it was another musical adaptation of a nineteenth century novel that was the starting point for Les Miserables.ldquoAlain saw Oliver! in London, says Schonberg, who had previously collaborated with Boublil on La Revolution Francaise, Francersquos first rock opera, produced in . ldquoI said to Alain, next time we find a big subject, we have it as a sung-through musical, and when Alain saw Oliver!, that gave us an idea about how to do it.Lionel Bartrsquos musical version of Charles Dickensrsquo novel, Oliver Twist, had already been adapted for film by Carol Reed in  by then, after being first seen on the West End eight years earlier. Prior to putting Les Miserables onstage, as was the fashion then, Boublil and Schonberg released a recording of it as a concept album. This approach had already paid idends for the English musical theatre team of Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber with Jesus Christ Superstar and Evita, and Schonberg had already scored hit records in France.Three years after the Les Miserables concept album had led to the showrsquos original French production, it was heard by British producer Cameron Mackintosh after it was passed on to him by director Peter Farago.ldquoTwo years after the show closed in Paris, Cameron was organising his records and put it on, Schonberg recalls. ldquoand after that we heard he was looking for those crazy French guys, Schonberg and BoublilWhile the pair worked on new drafts of Les Miserables, Mackintosh was riding high on the success of Cats, directed by Trevor Nunn, who had also overseen David Edgarrsquos epic staging of Dickensrsquo Nicholas Nickleby, and knew how to put on a big show. Success was far from guaranteed, however, and the opening night of Les Mis was a critical disaster.ldquoThe critics were very bad,rsquo says Schonberg, actually using the v word eight times. ldquoCameron has a tradition of having a lunch the day after an opening night, and it was like a funeral. We thought it was finished, and during the lunch Cameron kept trying to call the box office to measure the scale of the disaster, but couldnrsquot get through. Eventually he received a message to say that the reason he couldnrsquot get through was that the show had sold , tickets, and in two weeks would be sold out.Les Miserables went on to win an Olivier Award for the most popular show, while on Broadway it won three Tony awards.The current touring version is directed by Laurence Connor and James Powell for a production reinvigorated for the showrsquos th anniversary in . The result is a very st century Les Mis, which utilises projections based on paintings by Hugo created by son et lumiere auteurs Fty-Nine Productions. The internationally renowned team led by Leo Warner and Mark Grimmer, who have come a long way since their early work at the Traverse Theatre, the National Theatre of Scotland and with Stellar Quines Theatre Company.Having worked worldwide on the National Theatrersquos production of War Horse and the  Olympics, more recently  have been responsible for opening events of the Edinburgh International Festival, Deep Time, Bloom and the First World war-themed Five Telegrams. The latter projected images onto the walls of the Usher Hall accompanied by a thundering score by Anna Meredith.ldquoThere have been so many improvements to Les Miserable this year,rsquo says Schonberg. ldquoThat has a lot to do with technological developments which wouldnrsquot have been possible even five years ago.This keeps the show fresh for several generations of theatre-goers, as was proven last week, when Schonberg met a woman who told him how shersquod seen Les Miserables a staggering  times.ldquoFor Christmas she was taking her children and grand-children to see the show with hr again,rsquo he says.What Les Miserables taps into, again, Schonberg isnrsquot sure about. All he can say is that ldquoI think we did the right job, but it is the novel that is responsible for the success of the show, and for whatever reason, people seem to leave the theatre a bit dferent. People are scared for the future. Theyrsquore all looking for a bright tomorrow and waiting for the sun to shine, and people come out of the show perhaps believing they can be a better person.Les Miserables, Festival Theatre, Edinburgh, January -February .www.capitaltheatreswww.lesmis"},{"url":null,"title":"impact-of-brexit-on-scotlands-construction-sector-to-be-examined-by-holyrood","story":"The inquiry will also consider the effect technological changes and automation will have on the industry - which employs more than , people, % of the Scottish workforce.The work is to be carried out by the Economy, Energy and Fair Work Committee, with convener Gordon Lindhurst saying MSPs are keen to discover how challenges facing the building industry can be overcome.:Scottish construction firms fear Brexit will hike labour costsHe said: \"Construction is a vital sector in Scotland as it drives and underpins the economy with its knock-on effect on other sectors.\"As well as being a major employer, the sector also delivers infrastructure for housing, transport, education and community, and contributes pound. billion to Scotlands gross domestic product.\"However, the sector has its challenges and we want to hear views and suggestions on how these can be overcome.

Don flew to Normandy twice on D-Day, first dropping paratroops and then a glider with more troops and equipment.Don had been fascinated with aeroplanes since his childhood in Worcestershire. As a young boy he once walked four miles with his family to see a travelling circus which featured a plane of Great War vintage Don could only gaze in wonderment as the flying machine entertained the crowds, and he resolved that one day he would fly an aircraft of his own. It was an ambition that would be fulfilled with the onset of World War Two.Although just  at the time of D-Day, Don had already clocked up numerous operations as a bomber pilot. He had been severely injured in a fighter attack over Germany in  and was declared medically unfit. After being reinstated on appeal, he was retrained as a radio observer.ldquoWe had been in No.  Group Bomber Command, says Don, who moved to Thurso in the s but whose Caithness connection goes back to  when he flew Blenheims out of Wick. ldquoThe whole squadron were suddenly lted out of Bomber Command and put into  Group, airborne support, which was a completely new role because wed never worked with paratroops or the like before.He was now in  Squadron, flying a modied version of the Stirling four-engined heavy bomber: the Mk IV troop-carrier and glider tug. ldquoWe had to do a lot of exercises to get used to that aeroplane and to get used to dropping troops and towing gliders, which obviously was a dferent ball game altogetherhellip It required a lot of dferent techniques.ldquoAnd it was necessary with any airborne group to drop them accurately in as tight a bunch as possible ndash therefore yoursquod got to operate at a low height and also not get them scattered, so timing was important.ldquoThere developed a formation flying technique which was called starboard echelon, so youve got two lines of aircraft flying parallel to one another. We had to practise these on group exercises, and a number of things happened: tow ropes broke, gliders went down in dferent places.ldquoOn one group exercise we were flying along in this starboard echelon formation and there were literally hundreds of us ndash it wasnrsquot just my squadron, it was a number of dferent squadrons ndash and suddenly an aircraft in the port line veered straight across into an aircraft in the starboard line and they both went down in flames. We lost two aircraft and two crews, just like that, on an exercise. Those are the things that stick in the mind.That tragic accident occurred on May , , in one of the last group exercises before D-Day. It was becoming clear that a big operation was imminent, one that would have major repercussions for the course of the war.ldquoObviously we knew something was happening, Don says, ldquobecause we were practising with troops and gliders and whatever. But we werenrsquot aware, of course, until the th of June when we were briefed originally.The invasion was scheduled initially for June  but was postponed for  hours because of the weather. ldquoBefore that we had the indications of the airfield being closed off and we werent allowed to leave ndash we were shut in, the mail was censored.Paratroops of the th Airborne Division had been arriving at Fairford from the middle of May, and glider pilots were gathering there too as the security arrangements became ever tighter. The troops camped out on the airfield and Don remembers: ldquoOne thing that struck me was that most of them were not very big men but the amount of equipment they carried was phenomenal, with kitbags full of gear strapped to their legs. The other thing that struck me as quite remarkable was they were all carrying water bottles full of white rum!Stirling LJ  took off from Fairford at . hours on June  in what was code-named Operation Tonga, with Don as wireless operator air gunner. On board were  fully equipped paratroops and the BBC correspondent Guy Byam.Donrsquos chief recollection of that night flight over the English Channel is the sight of vast numbers of landing craft and other vessels in the assembly area ndash which was known as ldquoPiccadilly Circus ndash as they awaited the signal to head for the beaches.ldquoWe were briefed to drop precisely at a time and place, he explains. ldquoIt was important to get the troops on the ground in a bunch, not scattered. We were only over mid-Channel so we did an orbit ndash that was a bit dicey with so many aircraft about, all flying in one direction, and us crossing the stream. It all went to build up the tension.Finally, at . hours, the troops were released at Ranville, where they were to set up a homing beacon to aid following aircraft and also to assist in holding bridges over the nearby river Orne after the seaborne invasion had begun. Don remembers the red light in the fuselage turning to green on reaching the dropping zone. ldquoThey all had to go together. Naturally some hesitated on the lip of the door ndash but they had all got to go.In the lead-up to the drop, there had been a close encounter between the Stirling and a group of paratroops released by a nearby Dakota. ldquoHe released his troops and they came past us and we flew right through and didnt touch one, says Don.ldquoThere was no flak at all over Normandy but then we had to fly in a northerly direction towards the Pas de Calais after dropping our troops, which was a feint because the Germans expected us to attack the Pas de Calais rather than anywhere . So we flew on a northerly track and we experienced flak around Le Havre and Dieppe, and then when we exited France towards Beachy Head we got some light flak on the coast, but there wasnrsquot a great deal of resistance.It was a dferent matter altogether when Don and his crewmates embarked on their second operation of D-Day, code-named Mallard.This time their Stirling had a Horsa glider in tow, containing more troops bound for the Ranville area along with an armoured jeep, four anti-tank guns and ammunition. Take-off time was . hours and the glider was to be released at ..Don remembers the scene vividly: ldquoThe Channel was still littered with shipping but when we approached the Normandy coast it was a chaotic mass of ships and landing craft and smoke and explosions. It looked like a scene out of a nightmare, really. And, of course, as we went over land and approached the landing zone there was a lot more activity and a lot more flak.ldquoYou couldnt tow a glider above  knots so it was fairly slow. You were low because you didnrsquot want the glider to be shot down before it could get down to land. So obviously a big aircraft like the Stirling, with a ft wingspan or thereabouts, and a Horsa glider behind it, was a good target. In fact, all  of our aircraft were hit by anti-aircraft fire.Indeed one of those planes was shot down and crash-landed into the beachhead. The airmen were uninjured and got away for a while before being picked up by a German patrol.Subsequently the German position where they were held prisoner was captured and the crew ed to base.Reflecting on the chaos and confusion of D-Day, does Don recall feeling scared by what was happening around him  ldquoWell, everybodyrsquos scared ndash I donrsquot care what anyone says, he replies. ldquoIf yoursquore not scared you donrsquot perform, but itrsquos discipline and training that takes you through. You do reach a point of no .ldquoThis is rude, I know, but itrsquos what I call s**t or bust. You go on and do it. Itrsquos a matter of accepting whatrsquos going on and just dealing with it, and doing the job yoursquore supposed to do.ldquoItrsquos not a question of bravery. Irsquom very suspicious when people say, lsquoOh, yoursquore a brave man,rsquo or lsquoYouve got a lot of courage.rsquo You react to circumstances. Itrsquos a question of training and discipline and doing your job, without really recognising the probability of being killed.ldquoAnd I think to some extent the unorm protects you ndash you feel less vulnerable when yoursquove got a unorm on and yoursquore acting in that capacity. Everything happens very quickly.ldquoSo Irsquom very suspicious about lsquobraveryrsquo. I think we react more instinctively based on our training and our own iniduality. I donrsquot think I could have coped with being an infantryman, for instance. I donrsquot know how those chaps did it, because it must have been hell on earth for them.DON can look back on hundreds of hours of operational flying in a distinguished RAF career that included missions for the Special Operations Executive. And yet, despite the passage of years, he has never forgotten the thrill of his first tantalising taste of aviation.ldquoI fell in love with aeroplanes when I was a kid when Alan Cobhamrsquos Flying Circus came to visit our town with an old World War One aeroplane, and it was fascinating, Don says. ldquoHe had a couple of old SEs [fighter aircraft] and you could have a flip round the field for  shillings ndash but of course  shillings was half a manrsquos wage, so we just stood there with our mouths open.ldquoBut the smell of hot engine oil, castor oil and fumes and what-not got into you. I was determined to try to get into it in some way, and of course thatrsquos what I did.He grew up in Kingswinford, Worcestershire, where his father ran a transport yard. Don trained as a motor mechanic after leaving school at the age of  and went on to qualy as a motor vehicle technician in the summer of . He was called up when war broke out in September of that year, having joined the volunteer reserve two years previously.After pilot training he enjoyed rapid promotion in Bomber Command and was an acting squadron leader when, ing from a mission near Hanover in May , his aircraft was attacked from below by an unseen German fighter plane. The bomb aimer, navigator, flight engineer and wireless operator were all killed but Don survived along with his mid-upper and rear gunner. Somehow he managed tohis crippled Stirling to an emergency landing field on the east coast of England despite suffering severe spinal injuries, damage to his left eye, lacerations around his head and a hole in his knee. He still bears the scars.Don spent eight months in hospital and was discharged as medically unfit. However, he refused to accept that his flying career was over and lodged an objection with the air ministry. Eventually his appeal was successful and he was reinstated, being retrained in the new discipline of radio observer.Operations in the aftermath of D-Day included Market Garden in September  ndash ldquoI went to Arnhem five times during that debacle, says Don ndash and he continued in Stirlings until rsquo.He and his first we Lillian were married in  and they had three children: daughter Elaine, now living in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, and sons Peter and Robert, who are both ex-Navy. Peter is in Denmark while Robert has a management post at Dounreay.Don ed to the motor trade after the war and became general service manager with a large garage group. He then spent more than  years working in further education, including a spell as head of the engineering department at a college of technology in Salisbury.Lillian died in  after many years of ill-health and in  Don moved to Thurso, coming out of retirement to work for eight years with local firm Ashley Ann. In  he was married for a second time, to Lybster-born Isabel, whose three daughters became part of the family. Isabel died in .Don still keeps in touch with three of his former crewmates from those D-Day operations: Jim Wayman, the rear gunner, who lives in Dorset Eric Winter, flight engineer, in Coventry and Sid Harrison, the mid-upper gunner, who lives in Crewe. However, there was a particularly close and enduring bond between Don and his pilot, New Zealander Frank Cox.ldquoAlthough our families were half a world apart, they sort of grew up together ndash he came over [to this country] and I went to New Zealand, says Don. ldquoIn  his daughter rang me from New Zealand and said Frank was dying of bowel cancer ndash he knew he was terminally ill and he hadnrsquot got long to live. They had asked himthere was anything he really wanted, and hersquod said, lsquoIrsquod love to see my old mate again.rsquo So I went to New Zealand and I was with him when he died.ldquoNow you canrsquot explain relationships like that ndash they exist because of the worth of each one of you to the other in action. Itrsquos what they call camaraderie. Irsquom still in touch with his family.As his thoughtsto the events of  on the Normandy beaches, Don agrees that D-Day was a turning point ndash ldquotherersquos no doubt about that. But he adds: ldquoI regret to say I donrsquot think wersquove learned any lessons. I donrsquot think we should be doing what wersquore doing now [in Iraq].ldquoAs I look back I think first of all how lucky I was and I feel very sad about the people who gave their lives in that struggle. Itrsquos not really appreciated, the sacrices that were made both on the home front and in action. Itrsquos a sad reflection on society, I feel.ldquoWe ought to be very thankful that wersquore free, because thatrsquos what it was about. We should remember that this country wouldnrsquot be freeit had been overrun by Nazi Germany.ldquoIt was all for a cause. People may say, lsquoOh, thatrsquos patriotic nonsense.rsquo But it isnrsquot.This is a slightly edited version of an interview first published in the John OrsquoGroat Journal of June , .Thursday  Jan  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118591.jpg","title":"Just the ticket for tackling debt","story":"Scottish Government ViewpointTHE Scottish Government has launched a People, Not Profit campaign to support the Scottish Credit Unions that play a vital role in helping people stay out of unmanageable debt.The campaign seeks to support the growth of the sector by raising awareness of credit unions and the services they offer to a wider and more erse audience.Aileen Campbell, Cabinet Secretary for Communities and Local Government, launched the campaign.A new survey has revealed one in five Scots have not heard of a credit union.Currently, around , people across the country are part of a credit union some seven per cent of the population.The survey revealed also that only two-fthsof people questioned thought they would be eligible to be a member of a credit union, and that one in four peoplewrongly believe they make profits for shareholders, just like banks.The campaign will highlight credit unions are not-for-profit organisations providing loans and savings, and most people would be eligible to join at least one credit union based on where they work or where they live.A new website has been launched to help people find out which credit union they could be a member of.Ms Campbell said: \"In helping build a fairer Scotland, we want to protect people from getting into unmanageable debt and falling into the hands of predatory, high-cost lenders.\"A key part of this is making sure that people are aware of the financial services and fair alternatives available, including credit union membership.\"Our new campaign will highlight the benefits of joining a credit union and I would encourage everyone to visit the new website to find out more.\"Michael Sheen, actor and social activist, who is a credit union member, has worked with the Scottish Government to produce a short video explaining what the organisations are.* For more information, visit www.creditunions.scotThursday  Jan  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"More festive frustration for Wick Academy as Formartine snatch victory in stoppage time","story":"Wick Academy  Formartine United Formartine United took advantage of a late red card to Danny Mackay to hit an injury-time winner and consign Academy to a second defeat over the festive period.The Scorries struggled to create any clear chances but defended resolutely and the game appeared to be drting towards a goalless draw before Graeme Rodgerrsquos late strike.Manager Tom McKenna made two enforced changes to his side, with Ross Allan and Andrew Hardwick replaced by Gordon MacNab and Craig Gunn. Sixteen-year old Mark Macadie, brother of Richard, made his first appearance on the bench.Academy started positively and Marc Macgregor twice tested Formartine keeper Kevin Main within the opening  minutes ndash first when he scuffed a shot straight at Main after being set up by a driving run down the right from Davie Allan, and then seeing an edge-of-the-box effort comfortably held.With Wick sitting deep in clear defensive blocks of four and five, the visitors took control after that and passed up several decent opportunities to take the lead.Archie Macphee found himself with a clear look at goal a quarter of an hour in but he somehow poked wide of Sean McCarthyrsquos left-hand post, and Rodger followed that moments later by guiding a shot wide of the same spot.After coming through that tough -minute spell, it was Academy who threatened next when, after a great spin in midfield by Grant MacNab, the ball came through for Macgregor whose shot was blocked by Main.The biggest cheer of the half came when Formartine assistant manager Russell Anderson, unhappy with what he felt was a series of unfair decisions against his team, was given a strict talking to by lineswoman Molly Alexander.Academy made a tactical switch with Craig Gunn and Davie Allan swapping wings and Gordon MacNab moving upfield to partner Macgregor up top. The move failed to pay idends as Wick couldnrsquot trouble the away defence throughout the half, Davie Allan coming closest to goal when he skewed his shot wide after a one-two with Macgregor.Formartine similarly struggled to break down a well-drilled home defence, but they smelled blood when Mackay was given a second yellow card in the last minute after a collision with substitute Scott Ferries.It was another Formartine sub who played a key role in the winner when Liam Burnett skipped past Craig Gunn to the by-line and cut back for the unmarked Rodger, who had the simple task of tapping it home.Wick Academy: McCarthy, M Steven, Farquhar, D Mackay, Manson, Henry, Gunn, Macgregor , D Allan, Gordon MacNab , Grant MacNab .

More information is given on the Scottish Government#s website, here.Publishing the payment schedule, rural economy secretary Fergus Ewing said: “As we approach the commencement of the New Year, I want to provide farmers, crofters and other rural businesses with as much clarity and certainty as possible.“I am therefore confirming that we intend to keep to the proposed CAP payment timetable published in our stabilisation plan, which outlines when farmers and crofters can expect to receive their CAP entitlements.“By doing this, we are offering clarity and certainty over when payments will be made, demonstrating stability in our payment system, while enabling farmers and crofters the opportunity to plan ahead accordingly.”The president of the Scottish farmers union, NFU Scotland, Andrew McCornick said the timetable will be valued by farmers and crofters, particularly following a tough year for agriculture in Scotland.Mr McCornick: “Confirmation that balance payments for Pillar  schemes will start in March, and payments for coupled support and LFASS starting a month later, will allow many businesses to now plan their cash flows on that basis.#Many farmers are extremely reliant on these scheme payments and their timing so the payment calendar will allow farmers and crofters to carefully plan for the year ahead. Any delay in the timetable with an important scheme like LFASS, would merit Scottish Government considering another loan scheme as a contingency, as it has previously.“Successive loan schemes have been invaluable in addressing cash flow concerns but the continued need for loan schemes demonstrates that confidence in the SGRPID system to deliver prompt payments in the future is still an issue. The move from loan schemes to direct payments and other schemes meeting set payment deadlines will build trust within the sector in the post-Brexit era and aid the organisation and planning of farm businesses in uncertain times.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

That is why the meaningful vote had to be delayed and one wonderseven the January vote will go ahead.“Attempts to frighten MPs into supporting it are unlikely to work, because voting down this substandard deal will not result in no Brexit.”Urging Mrs May to take her time to get a better deal, he adds: “We know that the EU is worried about the loss of the £ billion ‘orce’ paymentthere is no deal... so this is the moment to be hard-nosed about these issues.“The more we prepare to leave the EU without a deal, the more likely a good deal becomes.“Tory MPs must remain committed to delivering the referendum result, as repeated in our manesto, which pledged to leave the Customs Union and the Single Market and which said that no deal is better than a bad deal. To do otherwise would frankly throw our democracy’s credibility into chaos.”: Jeremy Hunt: New Brexit vote would be ‘devastating’Meanwhile the current Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay is reported to be convening a meeting on Thursday of ministers to discuss the latest preparations for a no-deal Brexit.Writing in the , the minister said no deal will be “far more likely”MPs reject Mrs May’s agreement in the upcoming vote.“We have agreed a deal with the EU which allows the UK to leave in good order and we now want to see this deal passed by Parliament,” Mr Barclay said.“But, as a responsible government, we are preparing for all scenarios which is why, before Christmas, the Cabinet agreed to intensy our no-deal preparations.”He added: “These preparations follow more than two years of extensive work to get the UK ready. Now, as  begins, we will accelerate our no-deal planning further.”Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, speaking in Singapore, said cancelling Brexit through a second EU referendum would have “devastating” social consequences, while a no-deal exit would cause economic disruption.He predicted the Government would “find a way” of getting the -page withdrawal agreement approved by Parliament.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4851197.1546465040!/image/image.jpg","title":"cost of trident could sink mod budget","story":"The cost of renewing the UK#s Trident nuclear deterrent could #sink# the overstretched defence budget, experts have warned.Building four new Dreadnought-class submarines to replace the vessels that provide the UK’s continuous at-sea deterrent is already set to cost £ billion, at a time when the Ministry of Defence faces a black hole in its equipment procurement programme of as much as £bn over the next  years.Trident renewal alone makes up a quarter of the MoD’s ten-year equipment plan. The final cost is expected to rise by another £.bn over budget.The National Audit Office has put the total cost of running and updating the UK’s nuclear deterrent at over £bn, and last year said it would be “crucial” to find ways of cutting the bill to make it affordable.Defence secretary Gavin Williamson argued for extra money in last year’s budget, but was given just £bn to fill the gaps.Cost pressures have forced a two-year delay to construction of the Astute-class of nuclear-powered attack submarines.Trevor Taylor, a naval specialist at military think-tank the Royal United Services Institute, told the Financial Times that “nuclear subs are the most demanding defence project”. “You do not get to build a prototype – you have to get it right first time.”Mr Taylor said: “Can Dreadnought sink the defence budget  The answer is yes.”He added: “At what point does an independent British deterrent become unaffordable  For me, there is such a commitment to this that they would spend whatever was needed.”Richard Scott, naval consultant editor at defence journal Jane’s, said MoD officials were privately voicing their own fears about the costs of replacing Trident.“You hear comments about the disproportionate impact the deterrent has on the overall defence budget,” Mr Scott said. “Some people are asking, ‘can we really justy this’ ”In March, the MoD was allowed to use £m of a £bn contingency fund held by the Treasury to ensure the Dreadnought programme, being delivered by BAE Systems at Barrow-in-Furness, remained on track.Announcing the funding, Prime Minister Theresa May said it was “another sign of the deep commitment this Government has to keeping our country safe”.Defence contractor BAE has described the programme as “one of the world’s most complex engineering challenges”.Dreadnought submarines, which like their predecessors will be based at Faslane naval base on the west coast of Scotland, will be powered by a new model of nuclear reactor that will not be able to be tested in prototype, posing the biggest risk to the project, according to analysts.SNP MSP Bill Kidd said the cost of the Trident renewal programme was “enormous and unjustiable”. He claimed an independent Scotland would be able to avoid “paying through the nose for these wasteful and immoral weapons”.“It is increasingly obvious that the UK Government’s single-minded obsession with nuclear weapons is going to come at a huge cost to our conventional defence,” Mr Kidd said.“The staggering revelation that even senior military officials are now questioning whether we can justy Trident renewal should give the Tories – and Labour – a reality check.”©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4851207.1546466547!/image/image.jpg","title":"from brexit to a smacking ban a political rollercoaster of a year lies ahead for scots","story":"The political calendar of  will be dominated by one event: Brexit. The way forward remains unclear with a beleaguered Theresa May set to have another attempt at persuading the Commons to back her proposed deal when Parliament s next week. The debate among MPs will resume on Monday with a crunch vote to be held on  January. But the prospect of the Prime Minister#s deal being passed by MPs remains bleak. If the vote is rejected by the Commons, it opens up a range of potential scenarios.Mrs May could go back to European leaders and seek further concessions, but this appears unlikely after the limited movement she received from Brussels in talks in December immediately after she postponed initial plans for a meaningful Commons vote. The “nightmare” scenario for many would be that Britain exits the EU without a deal. This would thwart the prospect of a two-year transition period after the UK’s departure from the EU. Business and industry leaders have warned this would have a disastrous impact on the economy as costly tarfs are imposed on exports to the EU. There are also fears of potential hold-ups to important commodities, such as food and drugs, coming into the country through ports, as more rigorous customs checks are imposed. Although a majority of MPs oppose such a scenario, the current paralysis at Westminster means the country may inadvertently end up in this situationno other agreement can be reached. Labour has also laid a vote of no confidence in Mrs May, with other political parties laying one in the government. If the latter is passed, it would usually mean the government falls. This could lead to a general election which is Labour’s preferred outcome. The party saysit seizes power, it would seek to negotiate a deal that keeps the UK in the EU single market and customs union, in a Norway-style arrangement. This appears unlikely, though, with EU leaders having made it clear that the current deal is not open to renegotiation and time is running out. A second EU referendum could also be a possibility with Labour also open to this scenario, along with the SNP and Liberal Democrats. A signicant number of “remainer” Tory MPs may also be supportive. And despite the tight timescales, EU leaders are more likely to be disposed to “freezing” the Article  withdrawal processthere was the prospect of the UK choosing to change its mind and remain with the bloc.If Mrs May’s deal is agreed, on the other hand, the government would then put forward the EUBill which will pass into law some of Brexit’s biggest issues, such as the agreement on citizens’ rights, the financial settlement and the details of the transition. Before any Brexit deal can be approved it must be approved by a full vote in the European Parliament which could also see any dubious aspects of the withdrawal treaty referred to European Court of Justice.Brexit Day itself is scheduled to fall on  March and will end the UK’s formal membership of the European Union severing a link which stretches back to the country’s entry to the then EEC back in . The deal struck by Mrs May with EU leaders means that a -month “transition” period now takes effect. The UK will continue to abide by EU rules and regulations and enjoy full single market access, as well as freedom of movement across EU borders, meaning that disruption is likely to keep to a minimum during this period. However, the UK will no longer have a vote on EU laws and regulations. Fully-fledged trade talks can now begin between the UK and the EU. While Britain remained a member state, such talks were not permitted under EU law.Nicola Sturgeon is also expected to set out her plans on the prospect of a second Scottish independence referendum early in the new year as the final Brexit departure terms become clearer. The First Minister has already made it clear she intends to hold a another vote on leaving the UK to give Scots an alternative to Brexit. With many in the Nationalist movement growing increasingly restless on the issue, Ms Sturgeon will come under growing pressure to unveil her plans. The situation could come to a head when SNP delegates gather in Aberdeen for the party’s spring conference in May. It seems likely that the First Minister will seek a Section  order requesting authority is transferred from Westminster to hold a referendum, but this looks likely to be refused by the UK government which has control over the constitution. An illegal “Catalonia-style” vote has been ruled out by Ms Sturgeon. The growing suggestion is that a referendum could then be made the central issue of the  Holyrood elections. Whether this would appease the SNP grassroots is another matter.Allegations surrounding former first minister Alex Salmond willto the spotlight this month. Salmond has launched a judicial review against the Scottish Government over the way it handled two harassment complaints made by female civil servants, relating to his time as first minister. The case is due to be heard at the Court of Session but it will not deliberate on the allegations themselves. It will instead focus on a new\u2028 complaints process, introduced by the Scottish Government following the rise of\u2028the global #MeToo movement.Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson will make ato the political frontline in spring after maternity leave following the birth of her first child, Finn in October. Her deputy, Jackson Carlaw, has been holding the fort in the main opposition slot during the weekly First Minister’s Questions joust.A key milestone in the Scottish political calendar will also come about when the th anniversary of devolution is celebrated in May. A series of events are being lined up at Holyrood to mark the occasion, with Presiding Officer Ken Macintosh expected to co-ordinate a number of cross party and civic initiatives.The long-touted prospect of the council tax being axed in Scotland could move a step closer to reality this year. Finance Secretary Derek Mackay has indicated that he is ready to do a deal with the Greens on the issue in order to get his budget passed at Holyrood in March. Patrick Harvie’s party is the only one in Parliament currently taking part in budget talks with the SNP but have made it clear that a commitment to the reform of local government taxation is needed before any deal is struck. Abolition of the council tax was a flagship policy of the SNP a decade ago, but it was watered down and a previous review of the system barely tinkered at the edges.Scotland is also expected to become the first part of the UK to back a formal ban on the smacking of children with MSPs expected to agree legislation proposed by Green MSP John Finnie. It is likely to provoke another row with campaigners who see the laws as state intrusion into family le, following recent controversies over issues like the introduction of a “named person” for every youngster in Scotland. Smacking is currently allowed through the provision of a “justiable assault” defence in Scots law. The changes being proposed would see this defence removed from the statute book.The prospect of a repeat of the teacher strikes which shut down classrooms across the country in the s looks increasing likely in the year ahead as a stand-off over pay becomes increasingly polarised. The EIS teaching union is demanding a  per cent hike in wages to cover real terms cuts suffered by the profession during the climate of austerity. This has been branded “unaffordable” by Nicola Sturgeon. Unions have already rejected a  per cent offer from the employers which also includes councils. The brinkmanship is likely to continue into the new year, but there have already been grim warnings that action could target the constituencies of senior SNP Cabinet members including Education Secretary John Swinney and Ms Sturgeon ­herself.Glasgow becomes the first part of Scotland to introduce a “low emission zone” banning some types of vehicles from entering the heart of the city centre. The city has some of the poorest air quality in the UK and it is hoped the measure, introduced at a minute to midnight on Hogmanay, will go some way to addressing this. The new zone will take effect in stages, so  will see one-fth of the older, worst polluting buses banned. They will eventually be banned completely by . But there has been criticism of the scheme from campaigners who say there is no timetable in place to limit pollution from cars, vans and lorries.Scots will also see an overhaul of the system of organ donation with a sht towards a system of “presumed consent” likely to be pushed through later this year. Legislation to sht to an “opt-out” system is currently going through Parliament and will mark a departure from the current regime which means people must “opt in” before organs can be removed. Medics will still check with families to confirm the deceased person’s views, and ensure they understand the process. But there have been concerns raised about the prospect of a clashthe deceased person’s relatives object to organs being taken even where there was no proactive “opt-out”.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4850891.1546504252!/image/image.jpg","title":"poll 72 of labour members back second brexit vote","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has defied calls to throw his weight behind a second referendum on the European Union despite a poll suggesting almost three-quarters of Labour members want one and thousands could quit the party unless it works to bring one about.A survey of more than , party members found  per cent want a so-called People’s Vote on the terms of Brexit and most would chose to stay in the EUgiven the option.But Mr Corbyn has long resisted such calls. Asked yesterdayhe would change his stance, the Labour leader said: “What we will do is vote against having no deal, we’ll vote against Theresa May’s deal.“And at that point she should go back to Brussels and say, ‘This is not acceptable to Britain’ and renegotiate a customs union, form a customs union with the European Union to secure trade.”At last year’s Labour Party conference a motion was passed that saidanother general election was not called, then Mr Corbyn should pursue another referendum on Brexit.Speaking about the motion he told reporters the policy was ­“sequential” on a range of issues, adding: “The issue of another referendum was, of course, one of the options, but that was very much after the votes have taken place in Parliament.“We haven’t yet had a vote and I think the government really should be ashamed of itself. This vote has been delayed and delayed and delayed. “It’s finally going to take place the second week of January. That is not acceptable. This vote should have taken place more than a month ago.“This government is just trying to run down the clock and create a sense of fear between either no deal or May’s deal. Well, both of those options are completely unacceptable.”The YouGov poll, carried out for the Economic and Social Research Council-funded Party Members Project, found strong backing for a second vote among Labour supporters. A total of  per cent of existing Labour voters and  per cent of those who backed the party at the  election wanted Mr Corbyn to “fully support” a fresh referendum.Almost a quarterof Labour members put Mr Corbyn’s failure to back a second referendum down to a belief that he supports Brexit.Some  per cent opposed the stance the party has taken on Brexit and  per cent of those told researchers it had caused them to consider quitting. That proportion would be equivalent to around , members, according to the project’s analysis.If there was another referendum and a three-way question, some  per cent of Labour members said they would back Remain, \u2028 per cent said they would vote Leave with Prime Minister Theresa May’s deal and \u2028 per cent would support leaving with no deal.Labour backbencher Luciana Berger, who supports the People’s Vote campaign, said Mr Corbyn was “wrong to suggest that either he or Theresa May can negotiate a better Brexit deal”.She said: “It’s time the leadership stopped hiding behind process and faced up to the scale of the crisis and took the side of the people.”SNP MP Stephen Gethins called for opposition parties to find common ground in a bid to stop the UK leaving the EU without a Brexit deal.

Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27500  ","story":"• John James Kelly, Jimmy Joe Reynolds and Charlie #Cathal# McCafferty Staff ReporterThe three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof.On  November , IRA Volunteers blew up six customs posts along the border in Counties Armagh and Fermanagh.

Seismic political events, including the Home Rule crisis, the World War, the  Rising and the Conscription threat had shaken the country since the last General Election in . Women had the vote for the first time, other restrictions on the universal right to vote had been removed and the widening of democracy helped to ensure a stunning victory for Sinn Féin on a Republican . Ireland elected  members to the House of Commons in the Westminster Parliament. They were elected in single-seat constituencies on the first-past-the-post voting system, as Westminster MPs are elected to this day. Since its foundation in  Sinn Féin had advocated the withdrawal of Irish MPs from Westminster and the establishment of an Irish constituent assembly. It was only in , in successive by-election victories, that Sinn Fein won Westminster seats and put its abstentionist policy into operation. The swing to Sinn Féin was not only because of the executions and mass imprisonments after the  Rising there was also growing opposition to Irelands involvement in the war and its cost in lives, the inclusion in the British Cabinet of Tory Unionists who vehemently opposed any form of Home Rule, the threat of Partition and the ineffectiveness of the Irish Party at Westminster, led by John Redmond, increasingly seen as collaborators with British imperialism, as well as ongoing repression and press censorship. Redmond died in March  and in April the British government introduced legislation to impose Conscription in Ireland. The Irish Party MPs withdrew from Westminster in protest, thus ending forever any signicant Irish nationalist presence in that Parliament. Sinn Féin, the Irish Volunteers and the trade union movement took the lead in the anti-Conscription campaign. The Irish Party was also involved and it had three by-election successes in  but the writing was on the wall. In East Cavan in June Sinn Féins Arthur Grfith won a decisive victory on the abstentionist  which Irish Party leader John Dillon had called a policy of lunatics. It was widely predicted that Dillons party faced heavy defeat whenever the General Election came. Well before the war ended, Sinn Féins election preparations were under way. The jailing of many of its leaders in the British governments concocted German Plot did not deter the movement. In August  General Secretaries Harry Boland and Tom Kelly reported to the Ard Chomhairle that there were over , cumainn throughout the country. The same meeting endorsed a motion to contest every seat in the General Election “in order to give every Irish voter the opportunity of voting for or against the establishment of an independent Irish Republic”. By the time of the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis in October , many candidates had already been selected, a process overseen by Harry Boland, based at the movement’s Head Office in  Harcourt Street, Dublin. That same month the electoral register was revised to take account of the widened franchise. Women over  could vote for the first time and remaining property qualications for men over  were removed. This meant that the number of people in Ireland entitled to vote in the General Election grew enormously from , in  to ,, in . On  October the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress announced its intention to stand in a number of constituencies. But there was opposition both internally and externally. Sinn Féin requested that Labour candidates take a pledge to abstain totally from Westminster, in which case Sinn Féin would stand aside in selected seats. But the Labour position was to abstain conditionally, retaining the option to attend in certain circumstances. A great many trade unionists were members or supporters of Sinn Féin and opposed Labour standing unless the full pledge was taken. A special conference of the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress was held in the Mansion House on  and  November, at which the decision was taken not to stand in the General Election. Debate has continued ever since about the reasons for this decision and its consequences. There was a wide iety of views within the Irish trade union movement ranging from socialist republicans to Home Rulers to Unionists, so the reasons for non-participation were ied. Historian Dorothy Macardle put it this way: \"The majority of the working men and women of Ireland were members of Sinn Féin or the Volunteers or Cumann na mBan, and, as the disciples of James Connolly, held that the freedom of the nation and the freedom of the working classes must be pursued as one unided aim.\" . The war ended on  November and the British Parliament was dissolved on  November. Polling days was set for  December. The Sinn Féin manesto reflected the republican position adopted by the Ard Fheis a year previously and stated that the party \"gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic\". It was committed to establishing the Irish Republic by withdrawing Irish representation from Westminster, using “any and every means available” to make British rule impossible, establishing a constituent assembly and appealing to the post-war Peace Conference to recognise Ireland as an independent nation. It roundly condemned the role of the Irish Party in collaborating with the British government and attempting to “harness the Irish people to England’s war chariot”. The Manesto endorsed the  Proclamation “guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens”. The manesto was censored by the British authorities when it appeared in the newspapers but the full version was widely circulated. Press censorship was only one of the many forms of repression that the British used during the election. Hundreds of republicans were in jails  – including  of Sinn Féin.s candidates. Raids and arrests were frequent, as were bans on public meetings and among those arrested during the campaign was Sinn Féin Director of Elections Robert Brennan. His two predecessors, Seán Milroy and Dan McCarthy, were already in prison. British soldiers and loyalists had attacked  Harcourt Street on  November and subsequent nights, leading to the death from a stroke of ‘Nationality’ editor Seumas O’Kelly.  On  November the office was raided by a large force of armed Dublin politan Police who arrested Brennan and seized manestos and other election material. Acting Director of Elections James O’Mara wrote to the press: “Each arrest has naturally caused some disorganisation, but the cause of Irish independence will not be stayed or broken by such tyranny. Men have been, and will be, found who will fill the vacant places.” Nominations were due to close on  December. In North-East Ulster the Catholic bishops suggested that Sinn Féin and the Irish Party should not split the nationalist vote in seats where this would allow a Unionist to win. Sinn Féin proposed that a plebiscite be held among nationalist voters in these constituencies. Dillon rejected this in talks with Sinn Féin representative Eoin Mac Néill. The latter acceded to a call for the Catholic Cardinal Logue to propose a four-four ision of eight seats between the two parties. Others in Sinn Féin criticised Mac Néill for not adhering to his instructions. Sinn Féin candidates remained in the race in three of the four Irish Party-allocated constituencies but did not campaign and their voters were urged to support the Irish Party to keep the Unionists out. In taking this position the need to oppose the British threat of Partition was very much to the fore. When nominations closed it was realised that  outgoing Irish Party MPs were not contesting the election and in  constituencies,  of them in Munster, the Sinn Féin candidates were unopposed. Sinn Féin contested  of the  constituencies . Harassment continued right up to polling day with raids and arrests, seizure of Sinn Féin election material and removal of posters by British crown forces. After the death in Usk Prison, Wales, on  December of republican prisoner Richard Coleman, Sinn Féin campaigners wore black crepe on candidate badges. In The Four Glorious Years Frank Gallagher says a final election rally filled Dublins OConnell Street with speakers on several s, each flying a Tricolour with a black cross for Richard Coleman. He describes how on polling day Dublin dockers marched to the polling station behind an advance guard of Citizen Army veterans and hundreds of workers at the new British aerodrome at Collinstown – now Dublin Airport – went to the polls in a fleet of lorries flying Tricolours. The only two women candidates were both suffragists and  Rising veterans - Countess Markeivicz in the St Patrick’s Ward in Dublin’s South Inner City and Winred Carney in the strongly Unionist Victoria ward in Belfast. Markievicz was in Holloway Prison in England and her election address to her constituents she said:“I have many friends in the constituency who will work all the harder for me. They know that I stand for the Irish Republic, to establish which our heroes died, and that my colleagues are firm in the belief that the freeing of Ireland is in the hands of the Irish people today.”There was a two-week gap between polling day and the announcement of the final results on  December. Sinn Féin had won an overwhelming victory, taking  of the  seats in Ireland. Unionists won  and the Irish Parliamentary Party six . The majority vote for Sinn Féin was  per cent:  of the  Counties ed only Sinn Féin TDs. Of Dublins  TDs, all but one were Sinn Féin. The myth of nine-county Ulster being Unionist was exposed. Unionists polled a majority in Antrim, Armagh, Derry and Down but there were nationalist majorities in Cavan, Donegal, Fermanagh, Monaghan and Tyrone. Constance Markievicz was the only woman elected in Ireland and Britain and would go on to be one of the first women government ministers in the world in the First Dáil Éireann. Preparations for that Dáil, the democratic assembly of the Irish Republic so strongly mandated by the electorate, began soon after the General Election that transformed Ireland  years ago. GENERAL ELECTION - MANIFESTO TO THE IRISH PEOPLETHE coming General Election is fraught with vital possibilities for the future of our nation. Ireland is faced with the question whether this generation wills it that she is to march out into the full sunlight of freedom, or is to remain in the shadow of a base imperialism that has brought and ever will bring in its train naught but evil for our race.Sinn Féin gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic.Sinn Féin aims at securing the establishment of that Republic.. By withdrawing the Irish Representation from the British Parliament and by denying the right and opposing the will of the British Government or any other foreign Government to legislate for Ireland.. By making use of any and every means available to render impotent the power of England to hold Ireland in subjection by military force or otherwise.. By the establishment of a constituent assembly comprising persons chosen by Irish constituencies as the supreme national authority to speak and act in the name of the Irish people, and to develop Irelands social, political and industrial le, for the welfare of the whole people of Ireland.. Irelands claim to the application of that principle in her favour is not based on any accidental situation arising from the war. It is older than manynot all of the present belligerents. It is based on our unbroken tradition of nationhood, on a unity in a national name which has never been challenged, on our possession of a distinctive national culture and social order, on the moral courage and dignity of our people in the face of alien aggression, on the fact that in nearly every generation, and five times within the past  years our people have challenged in arms the right of England to rule this country. On these incontrovertible facts is based the claim that our people have beyond question established the right to be accorded all the power of a free nation.Sinn Féin stands less for a political party than for the Nation it represents the old tradition of nationhood handed on from dead generations it stands by the Proclamation of the Provisional Government of Easter, , reasserting the inalienable right of the Irish Nation to sovereign independence, reaffirming the determination of the Irish people to achieve it, and guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens.Believing that the time has arrived when Irelands voice for the principle of untrammelled National self-determination should be heard above every interest of party or class, Sinn Féin will oppose at the Polls every inidual candidate who does not accept this principle.The policy of our opponents stands condemned on any test, whether of principle or expediency. The right of a nation to sovereign independence rests upon immutable natural law and cannot be made the subject of a compromise. Any attempt to barter away the sacred and inviolate rights of nationhood begins in dishonour and is bound to end in disaster. The enforced exodus of millions of our people, the decay of our industrial le, the ever-increasing financial plunder of our country, the whittling down of the demand for the Repeal of the Union, voiced by the first Irish Leader to plead in the Hall of the Conqueror to that of Home Rule on the Statute Book, and finally the contemplated mutilation of our country by partition, are some of the ghastly results of a policy that leads to national ruin.Those who have endeavoured to harness the people of Ireland to Englands war-chariot, ignoring the fact that only a freely-elected Government in a free Ireland has power to decide for Ireland the question of peace and war, have forfeited the right to speak for the Irish people. The green flag turned red in the hands of the Leaders, but that shame is not to be laid at the doors of the Irish people unless they continue a policy of sending their representatives to an alien and hostile assembly, whose powerful influence has been sufficient to destroy the integrity and sap the independence of their representatives. Ireland must repudiate the men who, in a supreme crisis for the nation, attempted to sell her birthright for the vague promises of English Ministers, and who showed their incompetence by failing to have even these promises fulfilled.The present Irish members of the English Parliament constitute an obstacle to be removed from the path that leads to the Peace Conference. By declaring their will to accept the status of a province instead of boldly taking their stand upon the right of the nation they supply England with the only subterfuge at her disposal for obscuring the issue in the eyes of the world. By their persistent endeavours to induce the young manhood of Ireland to don the unorm of our seven-century old oppressor, and place their lives at the disposal of the military machine that holds our Nation in bondage, they endeavour to barter away and even to use against itself the one great asset still left to our Nation after the havoc of the centuries.Sinn Féin goes to the polls handicapped by all the arts and contrivances that a powerful and unscrupulous enemy can use against us. Conscious of the power of Sinn Féin to secure the freedom of Ireland the British Government would destroy it. Sinn Féin, however, goes to the polls confident that the people of this ancient nation will be true to the old cause and will vote for the men who stand by the principles of Tone, Emmet, Mitchel, Pearse and Connolly, the men who disdain to whine to the enemy for favours, the men who hold that Ireland must be as free as England or Holland, Switzerland or France, and whose demand is that the only status befitting this ancient realm is the status of a free nation.ISSUED BY THE STANDING COMMITTEE OF SINN FÉINtest"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27506  ","story":" Aengus Ó SnodaighThe flu epidemic that swept across Britain and Ireland in  struck at the weak and elderly in society. Hundreds died and many more spent many weeks crippled in agony in their beds during the winter months.Richard Coleman was born in Dublin in , one of eleven Coleman children, most of whom were active in the Gaelic League. Brought up in Swords, County Dublin, Richard was a religious and a patriotic young man. He trained to be a Christian Brother, but left to begin a career with the Prudential Insurance Company.When Thomas MacDonagh came to Swords in April  to recruit members for the recently formed Irish Volunteers, Richard was among the first to join. When John Redmond forced a split in the Volunteers later that year, the remaining Volunteers elected Richard as their captain.On Easter Sunday , Richard mobilised his men, the Fingal Battalion, at Saucers Town, ensured that they were ready for what lay ahead and dismissed them till the following day. On Easter Monday they, along with other Volunteers from surrounding areas, came under the direction of Thomas Ashe, whose instructions were to prevent British reinforcements from reaching Dublin. They fulfilled that task heroically that week.On the Tuesday,  Volunteers were sent into the GPO in response to a request from the Commander-in-chief, James Connolly. On reaching the GPO, the group was split up. Six men became the tunnelling unit around the GPO - `the engineering corps - while the others under Richard were instructed to reinforce the garrison under Sean Heuston in the Mendicity Institute. Connollys parting words to them did not augur well for their mission: ``I dont think you will all get there, but get as far as you can.They got as far as the Mendicity Institute unscathed. A Volunteer at one of the barricades they passed through said of them: ``In the midst of the firing, men approached up Church Street towards our barricade. When they reached it, they passed briskly towards their objective - whatever it might have been. They were dressed and, I thought looked, like countrymen... I could not but admire very much they way they went into action.At the Mendicity Institute, the garrison was under severe pressure, with the British attack coming virtually from all directions. By Thursday, things were hopeless and Sean Heuston was forced to surrender to a much larger British force.They, similar to the other captured Volunteers, were corralled at the Rotunda Hospital for identication purposes. They were then court-martialled and sentenced. Richard was sentenced to death, though this was commuted to three years penal servitude.The sentenced prisoners were transported to Dartmoor Jail in England first and then ided up. Richard was sent to Lewis Jail in Kent. When they were released after a very successful campaign in Ireland and abroad for their freedom, each Volunteer was granted £ from the National Aid Fund in America to help them rebuild their lives. They all pooled their money and began the New Ireland Friendly Society, with Richard as a director and a trustee with a superintendents wage.Like many of the other released prisoners in June , Volunteer Richard Coleman of Swords travelled to Clare to help Sinn Féin and the Irish Volunteers in their efforts to get Eamonn de Valera elected in the by-election.While there he addressed the first unormed parade of Irish Volunteers to be held since . For this, he was arrested and jailed for six months. While in Mountjoy Jail, he and the other prisoners went on hunger-strike, led by Thomas Ashe. Ashes death led to such a public outcry that the remaining prisoners were first moved to Cork Jail and then Dundalk Jail before being finally released.Richard was not to remain `at large for long and he was again arrested, along with many of the other republican leaders whod been active in rebuilding the Movement, as part of the British authorities `German Plot conspiracy.The prisoners were assembled first in Dublin Castle on  May  and were then ided up and sent to Usk and Gloucester Jails in Britain. Conditions were harsh in the jail and attempts were made to criminalise them with the order to wear prison unorms. They resisted and at the direction of the Home Office the prison governor, Mr Young, capitulated. On their first night in Usk, the internees won the right to free association, the right to receive and send letters, to smoke and to wear their own clothes.Despite their victory, the prison regime and their confinement weakened the men and with the onset of a severe winter, many succumbed to the influenza virus which had reached epidemic proportions, killing hundreds outside the prison walls. Richard was among a group of POWs struck down by the virus - they were left in their damp and cold cells for three days after the flu struck them down. On  December, a new prison doctor, Dr. Morton took up his new duties in the prison and immediately he diagnosed that Richard had now suffering from pneumonia and he had him transferred to hospital. He died a few days later on  December .Remembering the result of Thomas Ashes inquest - that the prison authorities were culpable - no formal inquest was allowed and when Richards brother arrived he was prevented from getting an adjournment of the local inquest so as to instruct a solicitor. The local inquest heard Richards brother state that Richard was a strong healthy man at the time of his arrest, while three fellow POWs attested to the insanitary conditions in the jail and that improper nursing contributed to his death. These statements got good publicity in the Irish press and added to the campaign to get the POWs released.Richard Colemans remains were released to his brother and were taken to Dublin where they lay in state for a week in St Andrews Church, Westland Row. Over , people filed past the coffin to pay their last respects. Volunteers in unorm formed a guard of honour during that time. A public funeral procession in driving rain from Westland Row to Glasnevin was followed by over , people. Three volleys were fired over the grave in Glasnevin Cemetery by six Volunteers despite a huge police presence. The size of the crowd prevented the police from moving against the Volunteers.Volunteer Richard Colemans death in an English jail, aided Sinn Féin campaign against Britains occupation and their general election campaign which was in full swing at this stage, and two weeks later Sinn Féin won a landslide victory of parliamentary seats. A month later in January  Sinn Féin MPs met as Dáil Éireann for the first time. The escape from Usk Jailby four of Richards comrades on the same day saw that republican POWs were unbroken and unbowed by their comrades death.Volunteer Richard Coleman died of pneumonia in Usk Jail on  December ,  years ago this week.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27507  ","story":" Michael McMonagle“This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account. - Chris Hazzard MPThe proposal from a senior Tory MP that the threat of food shortages in Ireland should be used to put pressure on the Dublin government and the EU in the Brexit negotiation exposes the colonial attitude of Brexiteers, a Sinn Féin MP has said. South Down MP Chris Hazzard was speaking after senior Tory MP and former minister Priti Patel urged the British government to use the threat of food shortages which could arise from a no-deal Brexit as leverage in the Brexit negotiations. The Tory MP, who previously stepped down from her ministerial role after revelations of secret meetings with the Israeli government, asked why the threat of food shortages wasnt being \"pressed home\" during the Brexit negotiations. Her remarks have sparked outrage on social media, with comparisons to Charles Trevelyan, the notorious British civil servant known for his role during The Great Hunger. Chris Hazzard said the proposal from the Tory MP were \"crass and offensive.\" “This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account.“They know the history of the Irish famine and Britain’s role in it and the very fact that they would seek to inject that into the Brexit debate is crass and offensive.“The Tories couldn’t care less about the impact of their reckless Brexit agenda on the people and economy of Ireland. We are simply collateral damage,\" he said. The South Down MP also said these and other public statements from Tory MPs highlight the importance of the backstop. \"It is our only insurance policy against a hard border in Ireland and comments such as Priti Patel’s will only serve to reinforce the determination of those of us who are saying that the backstop is the bottom line. It cannot and will not be abandoned or renegotiated,\" he said. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27508  ","story":" Síle DarraghWhen young women were imprisoned throughout the conflict, in this state, in Britain and in the six counties, they knew they were walking in the footsteps of the women of . We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.I was asked to speak at this event because I am a woman ex-PoW. To my mind there is nothing extraordinary in that, because I am only one of many.  There are hundreds of women throughout this country who have endured imprisonment because of their republicanism – and who carry that past with pride. There are women around us today who have shown bravery that would be considered well above the call of duty in any other walk of le. And, there are thousands who have quietly lived their lives and never told anybody of the things they did to further republicanism.And today we’re here to honour the memory of Constance Markievicz, one of the most famous republican women in recent Irish history a woman revered equally by historians and revisionists, and a woman who believed in, and participated in physical force republicanism.Constance Markievicz didn’t give a second thought to taking up arms and declaring war on the British Empire. Neither had she any misgivings about teaching young Fianna members to fight and bear arms. And she is rightly hailed a hero for taking that stand but the same people who revere her would, in a heartbeat, condemn me and others like me, and would pour scorn on those women on our republican role of honour, and claim that there is a dference.But I wonder could they tell me the dference between Constance Markievicz, who stated in  that:And the words of Volunteer Mairéad Farrell when she stated in :And I would love those revisionists, who laud Constance Markievicz and condemn Mairéad Farrell, to explain to me the dference between the circumstances that drove republicans in  to strike a blow against the British empire, and of republicans in  and  who took up arms to defend small communities like mine – trapped on the fringes of loyalist east Belfast, subjected to sectarian pogroms, ignored by a British government and forced into a state that neither wanted or accepted us.Marie Moore, a native of Clonard, a veteran of republican struggle and Belfast’s first Sinn Féin Deputy Mayor speaking of her le of republicanism rememberedWhere were the revisionists when thousands were being burned out of their homes when frightened mothers were dragging terried children onto buses and trains and being forced as refugees across the border, hoping for help and safety in another state that had abandoned us, and that also neither wanted nor accepted us When those who revere Constance Markievicz’s philanthropy and work among the poor of Dublin are celebrating her le, do you wonderthey ever give a thought to what she would have done had she been there when the hundreds of refugees from ‘the black north’ poured off buses with their meagre belongings in battered suitcases Do they think she would have stood idly by and did nothing I know none of us can speak for the dead none of us know what the other would have done, but we know enough about her to come to our own conclusions and I would like to think that she would have been as much a leader now as she was then.Her commitment and her legacy was an example to young women like me when I was growing up in a war-torn Belfast. She inspired us. She gave us aspirations to live up. She set an example. And part of that example was to never back down.We knew her history. We knew she took up arms. We knew she was a commander in the IRA. And we aspired to be just like her.She was also a POW, and when young women were imprisoned throughout the conflict, in this State, in Britain and in the six counties, they knew they were walking in the footsteps of the women of . We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.And no political opponent or revisionist will tell me, and all those thousands like me, that I should be ashamed of that.But the irony is, that the people who are so quick to condemn today’s republicans for taking the decisions we did, have never once considered what drove so many Irish men and women, young and old, to walk the hard roads we walked during these last  troubled years. We didn’t do for fame or fortune. We did it because it was the right thing to do.There are always reasons and circumstances behind people’s decisions and, we need as much today to consider those journeys, as we do the journeys of the men and women of . Circumstances and history shaped all of us. That’s undeniable.Throughout the decades republican women have been to the forefront of struggles in Ireland in the Suffragette movement, the Labour movements, the Gaelic League, and many other organisations – much as republican women today are deeply involved in every aspect of daily le and organisations working to better peoples’ lives.In every phase of the struggle, women have taken risks. From their involvement in the ’s border campaign, to those who broke the Falls Curfew and carried guns and ammunition out under their coats, in prams and in shopping bags. And, we know many too who lost their loved ones, and their own lives, to plastic, rubber and live bullets on active service for the IRA, and to loyalist and British State murder squads.We all know women who walked the streets wrapped in blankets, in bare feet, in rain and snow, to highlight the plight of the prisoners in the H-Blocks and Armagh who smuggled comms, love letters, and much more into and out of the prisons who marched in their hundreds to the steps of Stormont when Sinn Féin were locked out of talks, demanding their rights and representation.There are women who travelled every week, for years, to visit loved ones imprisoned in this state, in the six counties and in Britain, most times with young children in tow. The hardship of prisoners’ families is often forgotten, and imprisonment impacted on thousands upon thousands of people throughout this island, not just the prisoners themselves.Brave republican women stood as Sinn Féin candidates in the early ‘’s and ’s, when in councils throughout the six counties they were vilied and subjected to the vilest of sectarian abuse and threats of death.And I’m proud to say that the temerity of those who led the way has paid off in idends. Republican women were elected in their hundreds – councillors, MLAs, TDs, MEPs, Senators and including – dare I say it – three very proud and very capable women MPs are walking in the footsteps of the first female MP elected to sit in the British House of Commons the first abstentionist Sinn Féin MP, Countess Constance Markievicz.And still, there are people telling us today that our Sinn Féin MPs, elected by thousands of Irish citizens full in the knowledge that, like Markievicz they would not be taking seats or swearing an oath to a foreign government, should take seats in a British parliament, or better still, resign those seats and gt them to others who are more than willing to doff their caps and swear an oath to defend an English monarch. Do these people even listen to themselves These same people, who are lecturing us, will no doubt be lauding Constance Markievicz for her part in the birth of the nation, with all her history of abstentionism and of physical force republicanism.Do they genuinely not understand irony And do they think that our supporters, those who flock to the ballot boxes in their thousands toSinn Féin elected representatives, don’t aspire to the goal of Markievicz, of a democratic republic that cherishes all of the children of the nation equally Where is the equality for nationalists in the six counties  Where is the respect for the democratic mandate of thousands upon thousands of people who have yet to have their rights and entitlements respected in the British constructed and maintained sectarian six-county state  Where is the support for our democratic mandate  Where is the aspiration to cherish all of the children of the nation equally  Or do they not consider us part of that nation  They need to bear in mind that when the Proclamation was being written there was no border in Ireland – hard or soft.They also need to bear in mind that there is no single narrative to this conflict. Yes, people have been hurt, on both sides, and those who are trying to revise the history of the IRA of , are also trying to revise the history of the IRA of this phase of the struggle to present one side and one side only. As a republican woman I am proud of the rich history of Irish women that we can lay claim to, and many here today were part of that history. And I am proud and in awe of those women who lost their lives as part of that struggle.Unfortunately, throughout the decades of our troubled past people who know nothing about what we went through are writing and rewriting our history.We cannot allow the memories of our dead, the stories of nationalist and republican victims, and the history of repression and oppression that led to young people again taking up arms, in the same way Constance Markievicz and Tom Clarke and Pádraig Pearse and all those others in  took up arms, being airbrushed out of our history. And maybe one day we’ll be in a place where the circumstances that led to those decisions are acknowledged and accepted.Because, rest assured, not one of us woke up one morning and decided on a whim to take up arms, to put our lives on the line, to face imprisonment and death. There are always reasons why people make the decisions they do but some people just refuse to see or accept that.We know those reasons and we need no lectures from people who have not walked in our shoes. is something we should all aspire to.We have a duty to future generations to ensure that our revolution isn’t rewritten. We need to make sure that our young people know why and where our history of struggle comes from to remind, educate and to see that it never happens again to ensure that young women continue to be inspired by Constance Markievicz, by her bravery, her philanthropy and her work for those less well off. But we also need to ensure that the circumstances that led to her and future republican women seeing the need to take up arms, never happens again.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27509  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinI remain optimistic because Ireland is changing.

A people’s parliament for a revolutionary generation. The coming year is an opportunity to rebuild that culture of change and a parliament that serves the people and not vested interests. Sinn Féin will stand with the people on the streets and stand up for them in the Dáil because the housing and health crises can and must be ended.The policies of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael created and sustained the health and housing crises. As waiting lists grow and the number of patients on trollies hit record highs, the Taoiseach points the finger of blame at doctors and nurses who take Christmas leave. His response to rising evictions and homelessness is to defend the Vulture Funds and give tax breaks to landlords.The Taoiseach and Fine Gael are supported in all of this by Mícheál Martin and the supply and confidence trick.Regardless of what choice the British government makes on Brexit, it cannot be allowed to damage Irish interests, our economy, our agreements or the rights of citizens. This is one issue that unites the majority of parties North and South. We will continue to stand up in the interest of all Ireland. Early in January I will travel to Brussels to continue our engagements with European leaders.An Executive in the North should be in place delivering for all in the community, growing the economy, standing up to destructive Tory policies, and representing the majority view on Brexit. Instead we have witnessed daily at an inquiry the corruption of governance that led to the RHI scandal.No government could sustain the abuse of power and intolerance displayed by the DUP. All the while the Irish and British governments looked on and refused to act. It is a disgrace that the institutions of the north are not up and running.We had a deal with the DUP leadership that would have reinstated the Institutions. The DUP walked away. The two governments promised a new talks process. Ten months on there has been no talks and no process. There has been nothing constructive from the two governments. That is not good enough.Every day that the Executive is suspended undermines the political institutions. Every refusal to recognise rights undermines the political process. The threat to impose Brexit undermines the democratic process.The DUP know that their deal with the Tories will end. They also know that the refusal of rights is not compatible with equality and power-sharing government. They should also know that there is no good or positive Brexit for the north.Sinn Féin is ready for talks, to establish a new Executive working in genuine power-sharing, and operating to the highest standards of governance. A new Executive must include new ways of working, be inclusive of all parties and respect the rights of all the people.The DUP knows what needs to be done. Theresa May knows what needs to be done. It will require leadership that has been absent to date.The two governments have indulged the DUP at the cost of the political process. The two governments know what must be done to form a new Executive in the north. The current do-nothing approach is running out of road.The majority of parties share a common approach to Brexit and to the rights of citizens, and are committed to working together to build a new Executive.The two governments must convene talks and make clear the agreements and rights of citizens will be at the core of a new Executive.The Irish Government cannot look on as spectators. They cannot stand idly by while the DUP and British government shred the agreements. The agreements are the people’s agreements. The people voted for them. The Taoiseach said that the people of the north will not be left behind again. The government must plan for a successful talks process and also have a backup plan.They must also begin preparations for Irish Unity. There is no contradiction in seeking the establishment of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement and fulfilling its promise of a unity referendum. The time is right to hold an informed and respectful conversation and referendum on our shared long term future as a united people and a united Ireland. No government should try and stle that debate or call for it to be suspended.I remain optimistic because Ireland is changing. I believe that we have the policies and plans to tackle the housing and health care crises. The debate on Irish unity is under way, and we will have elections and the opportunity for people to have their say. The choice is simple, continue with the failing policies of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil or plot a new course for a new and united Ireland.I look forward to the new year and the continued challenges and opportunities of a changing Ireland.test"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8745017.1545218388!/image/image.jpg","title":"double celebrations for stuffabusni toy collection","story":"Thanks to the generosity of the Northern Ireland public, thousands of children living in poverty across the province will receive presents this Christmas.For the second year in a row, Translink and U joined forces for the Stuff a Bus Toy Appeal, in aid of The Salvation Army and St Vincent de Paul.

offer in case of emergency card","story":"Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon Policing and Community Safety Partnership , in partnership with local police is launching a new community safety initiative, in case of emergency card , to make sure people get the best treatment at a time when they need it most.Indicating who should be contacted in the event of an accident or emergency, the ICE Card also provides your medical information including any conditions or allergies you may have, medication you are taking and your blood type.An emergency can strike anywhere - you might be far from home, family or friends - and carrying the ICE Card means that your loved ones can be reached quickly and avoids the problem of unlocking mobile for emergency details.Stressing the importance of carrying an ICE Card, Chair of ABC PCSP, Councillor Joe Nelson commented: “This is a very simple yet effective initiative. Schoolchildren, cyclists, runners, older people and people with acute medical conditions immediately spring to mind, but in fact I think everyone should carry an ICE Card. People don’t think twice about wearing a seatbelt or cycling helmet, butyou had a serious accident you’d like your next of kin to know as soon as possible and you’d want the best care possible in a medical emergency. Almost everyone carries a wallet or purse with them so this is the ideal place to keep an ICE Card”.Chief Inspector Barney O’Connor commented: “PSNI is fully supportive of this initiative which is straightforward, practical and user-friendly and provides families reassurance that a loved one has personal information accessible in all emergency situations. Ideal for use whether you are a student studying away from home, an older person or someone with a medical condition.”The ICE Card ensures all the essential information is accessible in one place meaning it could help save lives, provide the best help and care, as well as make sure your next of kin can be contacted promptly.Information about medications and allergies helps ambulance personnel make better decisions about treatments they can give you and crucially in the case of heavy blood loss, it is important for emergency staff to know your blood type. In the case of people with conditions such asAlzheimer’s it can help a person who may be confused contact their family and avoid any unnecessary distress.The cards are initially being rolled out at PCSP and PSNI engagement events and through groups. For more information on how to get an ICE Card please contact PCSP Project Officer, Billy Stewart on    or by emailing william.stewart@armaghbanbridgecraigavon.gov.uk.\"  \"  Police warn Northern Ireland residents to look out for vulnerable relatives after two people robbed of thousands Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8756119.1546445050!/image/image.jpg","title":"st colman s have a super tour","story":"Local families attending the Family Health Initiative at St Colman#s Primary School recently visited Moundview Eurospar in Dromore for a supermarket tour.The Family Health Initiative is a healthy lestyle programme delivered by Early Years- the organisation for young children in the Southern Trust and is funded by the Public Health Agency.During the supermarket tour both parents and children took part in a fantastic scavenger hunt to find all the healthy food items on their sheet.

Speaking to the North Belfast News, Neil Francis said: “Me and my friends were walking out of the playground and this baby walked down towards the pond. We saw a woman pointing towards the baby and he slipped into the water face first. “All the other people started panicking and they all ran over and people were screaming. I got on my stomach and tried to reach in to get him, but I couldn’t reach so I just jumped in lted him under the armpits and lted him out.“A woman took the baby and cleaned him and dried him. I was scared, but nobody  seemed to be doing anything so I just jumped in. I was worried that it might be a bit deep, but I was more worried about the baby. I’m just really happy that the baby wasn’t hurt.”Neil Francis has been recognised as hero at his school assembly, and was gted a superman t-shirt by his religion teacher Mr Wylie. Paul Berne, acting Principal at Edmund Rice College, said: “We’re delighted that these kids are able to do what they’re doing. It’s the second time our pupils have saved someone’s le in a month. We’re very, very proud of them. They are top class role models for the school. About a month ago a sixth year helped someone in a hit-and-run and now we have this.It’s great that young people that age are able to do that – it’s incredible. Some people would freeze in these situations. These kids are top class. It’s a very tough thing and a very brave and courageous thing for any child to do.”Neil Francis’ mum, Natalie, added: “We’re so proud of him. We were scared that he did it, but we’re very happy that he did.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2018-12-28-at-13.57.45-copy-2.png","title":"when america bombed its own citizens","story":"FEW of us could point out Puerto Rico on a map of the world but fewer still are aware that this tiny Caribbean island, now a US territory, once boasted an independence movement which collaborated with De Valera. That gap in our knowledge has now been put right with the the timely publication of the powerful ‘War Against All Puerto Ricans: Revolution and Terror in America’s Colony’ by accomplished journalist Nelson A. Denis. His book sweeps through the many humiliations heaped on Puerto Ricans after the US invasion of , such as a ban on Spanish in schools and a prohibition against the flying of the nation’s flag. Where the American government led, business followed. Suffocating poverty on the island and slave-like conditions on the sugar plantations worsened. The first civilian governor Charles Allen ed to the US and leveraged his contacts and influence to become the King of Sugar. “By ,” writes Denis, “Allen and US banking interests had converted  per cent of all arable land in Puerto Rico into sugar plantations. These bank syndicates also owned the insular postal system, the entire coastal railroad, and the international seaport of San Juan.”Patriots responded with their own Nationalist Party but its ranks were riddled with FBI informers and when that didn’t stymie its growth, supporters were massacred in the town of Ponce. On Sunday March  , a parade of unarmed nationalist cadets was effectively ambushed by police in scenes similar to our own Bloody Sunday. “The police kept shooting and clubbing for thirteen minutes,” says Denis. “By the time they finished,  men, one woman and a seven-year-old girl lay dead over  more were gravely wounded — moaning, crawling, bleeding, and begging for mercy in the street.# marked the high-point of this revolutionary rising when, following  years of military occupation, the Nationalist Party of Puerto Rico staged an unsuccessful armed insurrection.They paid a heavy price for tweaking the tale of the tiger. Ill-trained and poorly-equipped cadres of nationalists – branded communists by the powers-that-be – were cut down by US National Guard troops. In the town of Jayuya where revolutionaries had seized control, the residents were subjected to a merciless bombardment by ten Thunderbolt fighter planes armed with -lb bombs. It was the only time in history that the United States bombed its own citizens.Within a fortnight, the rebellion had been quashed but not before a failed assassination attempt on President Truman had ensured the tiny island nation’s freedom struggle made headlines around the world. The nationalists paid a heavy price: vengeful prison sentences were meted out to the leaders and activists. One woman, Blanca Canales, served  years of a le sentence for burning the post office in Jayuya — the same town levelled by US planes. Their incarcerated leader Pedro Albizu Campos was subject to brutal conditions right out of the Gulag Archipelago — and then some. In , he was exposed to radiation poisoning which led to visible burns on his extremities, swelling of his face and led to a stroke which left him paralysed. Thus ended the long struggle of the revolutionary who had parlayed with De Valera and raised money for the Irish liberation movement in Boston in  — at one point he spoke in front of , people in Sanders Theatre in Boston and delivered what was described, by an English lord no less who was present, as “the most complete, the most brilliant speech” on Irish freedom ever heard. The  years which followed his death in  were, says Denis, “a downward spiral of chaos and corruption that turned the island into a punch-drunk fighter, unsure of its whereabouts, wobbling on its feet, pawing at empty air”.It’s hard to argue that things have improved of late. Emigration is the only route to meaningful work for an entire generation: In  alone, it lost a net , residents or nearly . per cent of its population. In , the island went bankrupt with the US Government refusing to come to its aid. In , Puerto Rico was hammered by a Hurricane Maria — the worst natural disaster to ever hit the island. “Is there a solution to all this ” asks Denis. “Of course, but the complicated ones rarely work. Those that have been tried include corporate tax subsidies to giant pharmaceutical companies, a fraudulent war on drugs, government subsidies, austerity programmes, and real estate speculation. These ‘solutions’ breed government fraud, police corruption, absentee ownership, junk bonds, media spin, and rampant hotels, shopping malls and parking lots. The answer may be much simpler. It starts with an honest self-appraisal. It acknowledges the eviction of an entire people — literally and systematically — from their own land.”Nelson Denis has done a service to the people of Puerto Rico — his people — and to the wider world watching on with this authoritative history of a brave island people. He has, at last, put Puerto Rico on the map."},{"url":null,"title":"meet the brexitbashing twitter account followed by leo varadkar","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Editors Viewpoint: State papers show leaders saw a bigger picture The diplomat said many MPs who did not take an active interest in Irish affairs became \"puffed with outrage and conviction\" about doing something in response to the killings.He said suggestions ranged from demands for a tougher and revised policy of policing funerals to a demand for internment throughout Ireland and, in \"more cases than previously\", to a demand to setting a date for withdrawal from Ireland \"in order to let the Irish get on with butchering each other\". State papers: Clintons invite to Adams provoked furious response from PM Majors private secretary Mr Ryan also said people across Britain wrote to their MPs demanding greater action against terrorists.The two plain-clothed British soldiers inadvertently drove into the path of the funeral before mourners pulled them from the car and were beaten before being shot dead by members of the IRA.The murders happened days after the funerals of the three IRA members who were shot dead by the SAS in Gibraltar. State papers: Taoiseach backs Garda in face of Iron Lady Margaret Thatchers disdain Mr Ryan said after meeting backbenchers at Westminster, he was struck by their exasperation and anger \"without any proper sense of how to ventilate it\" while there was a resurgence of \"frustrated patience\" with Ireland.\"The complexity of the issues elude their instinctual approach to policy questions, that of self-interested pragmatism and this further fuels their primary response to events such as last Saturdays,\" he added. State papers: Thatcher warned Haughey of worst civil war everUK allowed Irish unity \"It has to be said that no amount of violence toward the UDR, the RUC and Northern Irish or Irish civilians of any religious persuasion could come anywhere near provoking the same reaction in Britain to Saturdays killings - and the sort of killings they were - of their own English soldiers.\"He later said there was a risk the Anglo-Irish relationship and the Agreement may be \"caught in the net\" when MPs look for the reasons behind the murders.Days after the killings, the Secretary of State Tom King, made a speech to the House of Commons in which he described the \"horric events\" that shocked the world. State papers: Thatcher asked to make gesture of clemency in Guildford Four case  In a separate memo from Mr Ryan following a meeting with Conservative MP Edward Leigh, he said the Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was left \"very distressed and very angry\" by the soldiers murders.Mr Leigh indicated that MPs held special meetings to call for support for \"much tougher and direct action\" by the SAS and other special units against terrorists.\"He stressed several times that he was not exaggerating the mood generally\", Mr Ryan wrote.Mr King told Mr Leigh during a meeting they had reason to believe the IRA was \"planning a serious offensive\", however he did not elaborate further than this."},{"url":null,"title":"10 things nonbrits find weird about britain according","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Britain’s sizeThe top comment on the thread has Redditors discussing Britain’s size compared to other countries like the US.Answering the original question, one user wrote: “How small it is. Living on a little island like that blows my mind.“I read somewhere that people aren’t willing to drive like an hour to see their family members. Like I used to drive an hour to school every day.”Comment from discussion dr_greasy_lips’s comment from discussion \"Non-British people of Reddit, what about Britain baffles you \".“Anything over an hour is a long drive really,” replied another user, who said they lived in the south of England but had only been north “a handful” of times.Other users attributed the perceived lack of travel to the high prices for petrol and public transport.“Petrolalso costs £.per US gallon in the UK, so it’s no surprise that we try to avoid driving where possible,” wrote one.. The iety of accentsThe UK is renowned for its iety of accents and dialects, a topic which garnered a lot of discussion with one user asking: “The accents. Why do you have so many dferent accents in such a small place  And how the hell did that happen ”Comment from discussion Demonhunter’s comment from discussion \"Non-British people of Reddit, what about Britain baffles you \".Another user was succinct in explaining: “A village may have been occupied for over a thousand years at this point.“For most of its history it was occupied by people who didn’t travel, and didn’t have much contact with people who did travel.“Over hundreds of years each region has developed its own little oddities with the language leading to substantially dferent accents.”. TeaThe British obsession with tea“Your obsession with tea.“I like tea. It’s good. I don’t see my nation drinking so much tea that power companies have to account for when the commercials start because everyone’s turning on an electric kettle.”One user attempted to explain, describing teas as “perfect for any situation”.  Non-British people of Reddit, what about Britain baffles you  from AskReddit They wrote: “Welcome. Tea “Feeling emotional. Tea “Celebration. Tea “Period. Tea “It’s a tad nippy out. Tea “So upset you can’t talk. Tea “Just lost a limb. Tea ”“Tea as an emotional suppressor is the most British thing I’ve ever heard,” replied another.. Greetings“The question ‘you alright ’ is not actually them askingyou’re okay,” wrote one user who was swtly put in their place.Comment from discussion drugwitch’s comment from discussion \"Non-British people of Reddit, what about Britain baffles you \".“Just means “hello”” wrote one Redditor in the comments.“The correct reply is ‘Yeah! You alright ”Another explained: “In Cornwall it is the most common way to say hello. The only acceptable response is ‘yeah, you’“Alright  Yeah, you“Evenyou’re not alright it’s the only way to respond.”. Hundreds and thousandsOne incredulous Redditor wrote: “Apparently British people call sprinkles ‘hundreds and thousands’.Comment from discussion IvoryApricot’s comment from discussion \"Non-British people of Reddit, what about Britain baffles you \".The replies devolved into arguments about what exactly constitutes sprinkles or hundreds and thousands and whether the two are actually the same thing, but for the sake of simplicity most agreed they were tiny, sugary toppings for cakes.. Strange townsOne reply that received nearly , upvotes lamented Britain’s odd names for towns and villages in an expletive filled tirade.They wrote: “The f****** strange city county province names.“Shit like ‘Barton in the Beans’ is a name for a f****** hamlet in Leicestershire.“We have some weird city names where I’m from. Bucksnort, TN is one of those, but Barton in the f****** Beans is % insane.“Also Titty Hill,” they added, referencing a hamlet near Chichester in West Sussex.. Britain’s many namesGreat Britain vs. the United Kingdom vs. England vs. the British Isles and all the other odd isions.A helpful user claried the details thusly:Great Britain is the land mass which includes include Scotland and Wales.The UK, or United Kingdom, is the country which includes England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.England is the largest part of the United Kingdom.The British Isles are all the islands off the coast of Europe which are part of the United Kingdom, as well as Ireland and the smaller isles around Scotland and the Irish Sea.Comment from discussion SaintPhoeniix’s comment from discussion \"Non-British people of Reddit, what about Britain baffles you \".. Washing machinesIn a comment that possibly reveals more about Americans than it does Britons, one popular response reads: “Why is it standard to have the clothes washer in the kitchen, and why aren’t clothes dryers something everyone owns  ”Comment from discussion xowildrose’s comment from discussion \"Non-British people of Reddit, what about Britain baffles you \".“Washers need water, kitchens are where the water pipes are. Dryers take up room, we have really small houses,” replied one user.Another added: “Alsothe home decorating show I watch on Netflix is any indication, all your houses are - years old and the walls are made of timbers, plaster, rocks, animal bones, and crumpets.“Not very easy to remodel or retrofit anything.”. Piers MorganOne Redditor responded to the question about baffling Britain with one line: “That Piers Morgan is still on television.”Comment from discussion TomFazio’s comment from discussion \"Non-British people of Reddit, what about Britain baffles you \".Many Britons shared the sentiment, with the most popular reply reading: “That baffles many brits too”.Other quintessentially British things that were also baffling to Brits included Marmite and Brexit.. Banter.“How they’re so rude to each other. FOR FUN,” wrote one user, explaining: “I have a British boyfriend and the way he talks to his family is just baffling to me.”Comment from discussion EeveeSpectrum’s comment from discussion \"Non-British people of Reddit, what about Britain baffles you \".Another tried to clary: “Well yeah it’s banter.“If I can’t brutally insult a mate and be roasted back, do we really like each other ”"},{"url":null,"title":"ben simmons rounds off 76ers win with the cheekiest of plays from","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Receiving the MBE is just totally surreal.ldquoIrsquom overwhelmed the work I do in safeguarding children and women has been recognised by the Queen.Sheila started to work as a front line practitioner in the field of social work  years ago. Today, she is Social Work Manager for the South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust.She is also the chairperson of the South Eastern Area Domestic and Sexual Violence Abuse Partnership, a multi-disciplinary and inter-agency made up of voluntary and statutory community groups like Sure Start, Womenrsquos Aid and PSNI.Sheila said social workers were used to being on the receiving end of unwarranted bad publicity, but were expected by society to protect vulnerable children.She said: ldquoI first began to understand domestic violence when I became a social worker. I quickly realised it was prevalent in a lot of families.ldquoThankfully, society is beginning to talk about it more. ldquoWe need to continue to talk about it because it is so dficult for anyone living with domestic violence to tell their story and it is extremely dficult for children.ldquoThey are scared to speak out because they remain afraid of what might happen to themthey told an outside organisation. Sometimes, their silence is due to them feeling ashamed or even responsible for the abuse they are dealing with.Sheila understood quite early in le about the effects of trauma. Her elder brother, Eugene, disappeared on New Yearrsquos Day  when Sheila was in her early teens.His three children came to live with her family and she saw how her own mother and father were able to make their lives as normal as possible which led to some healing for all of them.The tragedy was the inspiration behind a play called, The Ferryman which debuted in London recently.ldquoMy role is tough, she explains, ldquobut social workers are our own support network. We meet with a lot of anger and abuse. It can be challenging but it can also be rewarding. Many people do come back to us to say thank you or, they will say to us that wersquove helped to turn their le around. That is said to us more frequently than anything . Thatrsquos what keeps us doing the job. We are the source from which change is possible. Everyone has the potential to change and I see it played out time and time again.It is evident that Sheila is dedicated to the families she protects. She said: ldquoDomestic violence is quite prevalent in Northern Ireland. One in six women and one in nine men will live with it including their children some time in their le.ldquoPolice are called to an incident every  minutes. Curiously, it is this time of year that sees a spike in those figures. Christmas Day and New Yearrsquos Day will see the highest numbers of women and children call the police for help.ldquoAnd, I do think the timing of this MBE from the Queen will only serve to raise awareness of this issue. And might even help someone who is suffering abuse to pick up the phone and ask for help.Sheila advises that anyone who wishes to make a call should contact   , which is completely confidential. It is available to all men and women affected by domestic and sexual violence..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Call for upgrade at Ardglass harbour  ","story":"THE need for major improvements at Ardglass harbour to allow signicantly larger vessels to enter the port has been highlighted by former South Down MP Margaret Ritchie.Her comments come after last monthrsquos annual EU Fisheries Council meeting in Brussels which determines how much fish can be landed at the local port and at the neighbouring harbours of Kilkeel and Portavogie.EU chiefs have decided to reduce prawn quotas by just over % to ensure the species ldquostays within sustainable levels, while the herring quota has been reduced by %.The Fisheries Council also determines how many days boats can put to sea, but the December meeting will have been the last UK fishermen were represented at ahead of the Brexit at the end of March.Welcoming some of the outcomes from the Brussels negotiations, Miss Ritchie has urged British and Irish governments to resolve what she described as ldquooutstanding problems in the fisheries sector to build the economies at the three Co Down fishing ports.She explained that the Fisheries Council consists of EU Fisheries Ministers who decide on the annual quota allocations for range of species mdash including prawns and white fish mdash which are the main staple of Northern Ireland fishermen.Miss Ritchie said she was concerned there has been a slight decrease in the amount of prawns which can be landed locally, after a series of successive quota increases over recent years.ldquoIt is important that the British Government has realistic proposals capable of implementation in place to safeguard and grow our local industry, said Ms Ritchie.ldquoThere are also other fishing issues that require resolution as they present ongoing challenges to the catching and processing sectors. They include the Voisinage Agreement with the Irish Government to allow Co Down fishermen to resume fishing in Irish Sea waters. There is also the need for improvements to harbour infrastructure at Ardglass and Kilkeel to allow larger boats to land fish.Miss Ritchie said the prawn quota reduction was more to do with the species being exempted from so-called discard ban.She added: ldquoIt is vitally important that our local fishing industry in the catching and processing sectors is allowed to continue to grow and develop.ldquoThe Government needs to continue with a positive working relationship with the industry to allow the economic sectors in Ardglass and Kilkeel to be nurtured to ensure existing jobs are sustained and new employment opportunities are realised.Mr Alan McCulla, chief executive of the Anglo-North Irish Fish Producers Organisation Sea Source, believes the outcome of the annual negotiation on catch quotas ldquoputs Northern Irelandrsquos fishermen in a good starting position for the next phase in our relationship with the EU.He said the agreements reached at the Fisheries Council meeting offered ldquosome positives and some negatives for the Irish Sea, with the December negotiations described by the Department of Agriculture Environment and Rural Affairsas ldquoone of the most dficult councils in recent years.A spokesperson for the government department said it was vitally important to ensure that sufficient quota was obtained for all Irish Sea fish species to enable them to land all the fish they catch from the start of the New Year, particularly whiting which is a by-catch in the prawn fishery.ldquoThe EU Commission initially proposed an Irish Sea whiting quota of  tonnes but this was successfully negotiated up by % to  tonnes, with agreement to carry out a further review of the quota in the new year.The government department spokesperson said the deal ldquoensures that there are now workable solutions to alleviate the pressure for fishermen while preventing fish from being wastefully discarded unnecessarily..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Castlewellan tree voted top in NI  ","story":"CASTLEWELLAN Forest Parkrsquos giant redwood is celebrating being voted Northern Irelandrsquos Tree of the Year in the Woodland Trustrsquos search for the countryrsquos best-loved tree.The stunning redwood mdash or multi-stemmed giant sequoia to be precise mdash finished second in the  UK final.Everyone associated with the Forest Service, the people of Castlewellan and ious groups helping with ambitious regeneration proposals at the stunning forest park, are delighted with the majestic treersquos success in the regional heat.The giant redwood stands within the walled garden at the forest park and at over  years old has seen centuries come and go.

The Hoops raced into a - first half lead with goals from Stephen Galbraithand Sean McMahon before Jordan McCoubrey delivered the coup de grace in the th minute to finally kill off a game Olympic outfit.Celtic looked the more composed and inventive side from the off and an understrength Olympic struggled to create anything of note. The Hoops seized the lead with only six and a half minutes gone and never looked back.Chris Mullan, who was like a fleet-footed gazelle down the left flank and just missed out on the man of the match award, sped past his marker on the edge of the box.His stinging shot that looked destined for the bottom corner of the net was parried out by an alert Ryan Connollly, but Galbraith was hovering around the six-yard box and was perfectly placed to steer the ball home.Less than two minutes later Mullan dipped his shoulder again and cut inside Jack Roddy before striking the base of the post with a fierce shot.Olympic steadfastly refused to buckle and with  minutes gone were unlucky not to equalise when Aaron McCaffrey, their most potent player in attack, was unable to take advantage in a rare moment of panic in the Celtic box.Celtic went back on the attack and with  minutes gone taskmaster Jordan Curran teamed up with Mullan to create an opening for Sean McMahon, but he fired wide.Back at the other end, the dangerous McCaffrey got in behind Conor Doherty, but his delightfully flighted cross missed by everyone in the box.With  minutes gone Rottweiler Curran blocked an Olympic attempt to send Rhys Patterson clear. The ball flew off his shin and into the path of the willing Sean McMahon who raced away from Michael Rice and Darryl Russell, but with only Connolly to beat, his cheeky, dinked effort grazed the crossbar on the way to safety.A minute later another mazy Mullan run ended with the wing wizard crossing for McMahon, but this seasonrsquos top scorer had his audacious effort blocked on the six yard box with Celtic claiming a penalty.The second goal wasnrsquot long in coming and with  minutes gone a Mullan cross was deftly headed home by Doherty, who had been given the freedom of the box. Three minutes later Galbraith made it - when his low corner evaded Connolly at his near post and ended up in the net.Celtic continued their dominance after the break with Mullan and McMahon dovetailing perfectly for Curran, but his shot went well over the top. With  minutes gone McMahon decided to go it alone, but he was well off target as Olympic backed off him.Olympic tried desperately to get things moving, but it just wasnrsquot their day and with  minutes played Russell did exceptionally well to prevent Galbraith from making it - with a last-gasp tackle.The fourth goal was just around the corner and with  minutes gone Andy Baggley headed the ball into the path of prodigy Jordan McCoubrey, who looked suspiciously offside. The teenage terrier didnrsquot hang around as Olympic had pushed up and he raced cleat to beat Connolly all ends up.If anything, Celtic could have won by an even bigger margin and Connolly saved brilliantly in the th minute to deny Baggley a fth Celtic goal.Celtic Bhoys: Nathan Curran, Shaun Megahey, Conor Doherty, Matthew Carson, Mikey Rice, Jordan Curran, Terence Bell, Ricky Kerr, Stephen Galbraith, Sean McMahon, Chris Mullan.

Mr Turner said that the CAJ “describe themselves as ‘an independent civil liberties organisation formed in  to work for the highest standards in the administration of justice in Northern Ireland’”.He said that the group had in recent years produced reports about inquests, complaints, the use of force by the security forces and emergency legislation.The restricted February   memo went on to say that CAJ had “increasingly used ‘international force’ in an attempt to bring pressure to bear on the Government’”.He said that “the RUC’sdescription of CAJ is that of a ‘self-appointed body of no official standing’”.Mr Turner said that “CAJ claim to have a membership drawn from both sections of the community ‘including lawyers, students, community workers, trade unionists, unemployed people and academics’.“In reality they are [a] left of centre group with mainly nationalist support . Other executive members have dfering shades of opinion ranging from the fairly sensible to the biased and naive.”He said that the CAJ “remain firmly opposed to the use of violence to achieve political goals although there has been a sht in the leadership to a face less acceptable to the NIO.“The author of CAJ’s monthly bulletinis strongly biased and opinionated today’s CAJ is not in the Brice Dickson mould.Sammy Wilson: Theresa May’s Brexit deal is only threat to Union Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“CAJ continue to produce distorted reports that fail to paint the whole picture.“However, they remain a ‘fashionably radical’ rather than in any way sinister grouping.”A note at the top of the memo beside the name Ms Johnston, said: “A regular ‘irritant’, the CAJ is wholly disliked by the RUC, but tolerated in other quarters. They have an unfortunate disregard of matters factual.”Among many senior civil servants to whom the note was copied was Stephen Rickard, an MI officer working within the NIO who just a few months later would be killed along with  other people when the Chinook helicopter on which he was travelling crashed on the Mull of Kintyre.Three days later, the private secretary to NIO security minister Sir John Wheeler wrote: “The minister was very grateful for your submission of  February which provided advice on the membership, and an assessment of the standing, of CAJ.“Sir John has noted the submission with understanding and amusement.”The file also contains a rare note from Northern Ireland’s most senior military officer, General Officer Commanding Sir Roger Wheeler, in which he suggested to the NIO’s permanent secretary that there should be a coordinated civil service, RUC and Army response to critical CAJ and Amnesty International reports.Sir Roger said that a recent report by the CAJ had been met with a rebuttal which was jointly drafted by Stormont’s top press officer, Andy Wood, the RUC’s chief press officer, Bill McGookin, and the Army’s chief information officer in Northern Ireland, Nigel Gillies.Sir Roger welcomed the fact that in response to an Amnesty international report which was critical of the security forces the secretary of state had written back to the group “challenging Amnesty to call on the paramilitaries to stop killing the security forces”.Last night Professor McEvoy, who is no longer on CAJ’s board, said: “The NIO assessment that CAJ was and is unequivocally opposed to political violence is of course correct.“As for the other suggestions, from memory, at the time we were working on issues such as reforming the police complaints system, public order policing and the role of human rights in the emerging peace process. “Much of that work was subsequently reflected in the Patten report and Good Friday Agreement. CAJ’s line remained consistent it was the NIO that changed.”try catch            ..

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

When I woke up whenever and potted and mooched and just saw what the day would bring.Like most people, the demands of work, family, friends, errands and the general stuff of le, mean that at any given moment we can be doing one thing, planning something  and thinking about many more.I get in to grasshopper phases where it feels like there is so much on my lsquoto dorsquo list that I flit and fly between myriad things and sometimes few of them get completed how Irsquod like or indeed completed at all and for those that that do get sorted and sewn up with aplomb, there is no time to take any satisfaction or pride because it is time to crack on with the next thing folks.I read a while ago about a concept that affects your brain around scarcity.The idea that when we feel that something is scarce, be that time, money or something  that we feel is in short supply, it can make us act with less focus and rationality thanwe had an abundance of such.So, in my case, when I feel time is pressured, I am more likely to try to do more with the result that I feel I have less time and my scarcity suffering brain is more likely to forget, to misplace to mess up.And so, knowing this, I am going to set aside the lsquoto dosrsquo and the lsquoshouldsrsquo and curl up on the settee with my utterly wonderful friend and eat and chill and know that with every mouthful of delicious cake, I am doing myself some good. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He decided to put together a calendar of his work together to help raise money for the Alzheimers Society, as his father died from the disease in .The -year-old was encouraged to put together the calendar after posting some of his pictures in a local Facebook group.He said: \"I was surprised by the positive response and all the encouraging comments my first set of photos received, said Phil, ldquoWhen I posted another set of photos people started suggesting putting them together in a book or a calendar.\"Mr Lewis said the idea stuck and he asked the group to vote for their favourite photos which would be included in the calendar, before working with local graphic designer Ceri Legg who designed the layout and Beacon Printers, who printed the calendars.Around  calendars were printed altogether which were on sale in shops throughout the town, but have now fully sold out.ldquoI was really worried at first as the number  was suggested to me by the printers, and as soon as I picked them up I start feeling anxious about how exactly I was going to sell  calendars,\" said Mr Lewis.\"I thought that  would have been a more realistic number. I was completely taken aback by the huge response.\"I had people contacting me from all over the world ndash Australia, Spain, Texas, askingI would post calendars to them. This is on top of the response from local people.\"I spent most of my evenings in that first week doing deliveries all over Penarth,\" Mr Lewis added.Through the sales, Mr Lewis has raised more than pound, for the Alzheimers Society.He said: \"It seemed like the right thing to do really, as Penarth is a very community-oriented town so doing a calendar for charity fits with the outlook of the people of Penarth.\"Now, Mr Lewis is looking at printing more calendars this year to help raise further funds for the charity.\"If the idea of this calendar had never been suggested then my photos would have ended up just sitting on my computer,\" he said.\"Irsquom just glad that this hobby that I really like has ended up being put to good use by raising this money for charity.To get in touch with Mr Lewis about purchasing a calendar, email philip.lewis@live article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is these very services that are now under threat as a direct consequence of year on year under funding.As the proposed cut to the Valersquos budget is below the  per cent threshold, the authority will not receive any further support during the settlement process, Councillor Thomas says.Councillor Thomas says the reduction of pound.million ldquoignores the impact of inflation on council budgets. He said the impact of pay inflation on the council next year will be pound.million..The Vale council is also facing unfunded cost pressures in   of pound.million due to changes in the pension scheme for teachers.Providing for growing numbers of pupils with additional learning needs, and also complying with new Welsh Government legislation, would also cost the council an extra poundmillion which is also unfunded, Councillor Thomas says.Vale councillor Bob Penrose also added that school cutbacks ldquoare inevitable.Cllr Penrose said: ldquoIn July UK Government announced a . per cent rise in teachersrsquo pay which would cover England and Wales.ldquoThis was followed by the announcement of a  per cent increase in employersrsquo contribution to teachersrsquo pensions.ldquoWhat was lacking was an explanation of how this would be paid for.The council has set out its initial budget for  , which says the authority would need to find an additional pound,, in savings next year.That would be on top of pound,, cuts which have already been planned ndash which include a one per cent funding reduction for schools across the Vale.A council tax rise of . per cent for each of the next three years had been assumed in a provisional financial plan published by the council in September. The final level of council tax is not expected to be set until early in .But the council says raising council tax would only cover a small amount of the money it needs to balance the books. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

As we were working specically to meet the needs of three inidual children we really wanted their experience to be special and are delighted with the feedback we received. It was lovely to hear the books have given the children such a positive experience.”Eleanor Girvan mum of Nessa said: “The dferent textures and colours and shine really stimulated Nessa and she really enjoyed the book.”Ben Sterritt’s mum Ann added: “The book is amazing and a lot of work has gone into it. Ben loves it – he loves feeling the shapes and texture and enjoys when I read it to him.”And Meadbh Bustard, mother of Cara commented: “Cara loved the sensory aspect of the book touching and feeling it. She loves balloons and numbers and as the book was designed especially with her in mind she really enjoyed it.”Pat McAteer, Specialist Services Manager at the Southern Trust, says: “We have a very active Deaf Club who work together to raise awareness of the needs of and reduce isolation amongst the deaf community. Because of their own communication challenges, our deaf club members have great empathy for this group of visually impaired children and we sincerely thank them for their thoughtfulness in creating such beautul interactive books which are bringing great enjoyment.”The project was funded by the ‘The Northern Ireland Executive Social Investment FundSouthern Zone ‘Work It’ training and employment programme.’Budding young reporters visit BBC Newsline studio Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"try catch            ..

Some of the major deals completing last year included PwC’s move to Merchant Square, the Northern Ireland Civil Service at  Lanyon Place and Allstate at Mays Meadow. “During an unsettling period of political uncertainty, the local office market is an indicator of the health of the Northern Ireland economy, with the professional services and technology sectors in particular leading the way,” Brian Lavery, managing director at CBRE said. “Currently we only have around , sq ft of grade A office space available fragmented across a number of buildings underpinning the need for more investment in this space. “Alongside this office space growth, we are also seeing the green shoots of demand for residential living in the city centre. We believe this is the trend to track in  and beyond as investors across the UK and globally continue to look for opportunities in this area. “However, on a more positive note, we are seeing strong interest from a wide spectrum of investors for office investments in Belfast which is being driven by growing rents and demand, combined with limited supply of high-quality accommodation.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
