The move, published on Monday, will see the new political wing become responsible for \u0027military-patriotic\u0027 work within the Russian ArmyThe defence ministry did not release details of the new directorate, but an unnamed military source told the Kommersant daily that Kartapolov would also be responsible for the activities of the Yunarmiya, a patriotic military youth organisation sponsored by the ministry.After Russia\u0027s 2014 annexation of Ukraine\u0027s Crimea, seen by the Kremlin as a big success, the military has grown increasingly influential in domestic and foreign policy, especially in Syria.The Bolsheviks, wary of the army\u0027s loyalty, introduced political commissars in 1918. In the late Soviet period, political officers, known as \u0027zampolity\u0027, tried to ensure soldiers knew their communist doctrine and where their loyalties lay.

consider shunning university for alternatives such as high-quality apprenticeships, says the Education Secretary.Damian Hinds said youngsters – including the most affluent – should think twice about whether a \u0027traditional degree\u0027 is the right option for them.He said he is determined to make technical routes as prestigious as academic ones so that they are no longer seen as \u0027second best\u0027.And he said the Government\u0027s new T-levels and degree apprenticeships in jobs such as engineering and accounting will provide fast-track routes to \u0027highly-skilled work\u0027.His comments come amid growing debate over whether studying for a non-vocational degree really is the best option for people who just want to get stuck into a career.For many years, schools have been directing bright pupils towards general degrees at good universities in the belief that this is the best route to a professional job – even if the skills learned have only limited use in the workplace.           Mr Hinds said the Government\u0027s new T-levels and degree apprenticeships in jobs such as engineering and accounting will provide fast-track routes to \u0027highly-skilled work\u0027In his first major speech on social mobility, Mr Hinds outlined his vision for ersifying the routes to good careers.You MUST teach your children basic speech at home, minister...France bans

from To Kill a Mockingbird.Speaking at the Resolution Foundation, the Education Secretary, 48, said he would recommend Harper Lee\u0027s classic novel to pupils because of its messages on overcoming difficult circumstances. \u0027Character, resilience, virtue, upstandingness – there\u0027s a lot of education in that book and a lot to be learned from that character,\u0027 he said.Gregory Peck won an Oscar for his portrayal of Finch, who defends a black man wrongly accused of rape in Alabama, in the 1962 film.                                                    \u0027For a long time, one of the reasons university was such a key determinant of future success was that many of the alternative options towards highly-skilled work were frankly not up to scratch.\u0027Technical education in this country has long been seen by many as the second-best option to academic study and university.\u0027New technical qualifications, T-levels, are being introduced as an alternative to A-levels, and businesses are being encouraged to create \u0027degree apprenticeships\u0027, which combine instruction with work experience.The qualifications have been created in partnership with employers, and have \u0027real currency\u0027 in industry, said Mr Hinds. \u0027Our goal is that all young people, whatever their background, will have much better choices when they start thinking about their post-16 and post-18 destinations,\u0027 he added.Asked later if he thought it would give these routes more credence if middle-class children took them, he replied: \u0027Yes, I do.\u0027University participation has expanded over the past few decades, but because the job market is now over-supplied with graduates, a good university degree is no longer a guaranteed passport to a skilled job.Mr Hinds also used his speech to dismiss claims that elite universities are institutionally biased against disadvantaged students. However, he acknowledged that more must be done to encourage such students to apply.He urged the elite universities of the Russell Group to \u0027reach out\u0027 to poorer pupils and do more to make sure they are admitted – for example, by making socio-economic background an admissions consideration.Mr Hinds also said disadvantaged parents should encourage their children to tackle tougher subjects because they can be a \u0027signalling device\u0027 to universities and employers that a pupil is clever."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/09/09/4DF46A1500000578-0-image-a-6_1531126256163.jpg","title":"The modern family businesses run children","story":"    Family affair: Jordan Weller and his mother Julie prepare clothes for his online businesses which rakes in some £500-a-dayJordan, who lives at home with his parents in Essex, pays his mum a weekly wage of £80 to collect up to 50 items of vintage sportswear once or twice a week, which she\u0027ll wash and iron. She also prepares the quarterly report for the accountant.\u0027She takes the lead on all the things I don\u0027t have time to do\u0027, Jordan says. \u0027I could give her more work but it\u0027s difficult as the business is online and she\u0027s not very good on the computer.\u0027Start-up Doctor: How do I raise money and find investors to...Plumbers and handymen, Amazon needs you: New service for...How to find a better current account for your small businessCan coffee help homeless people off the streets?

He says he was always into fashion, and knowing what people wanted wasn\u0027t difficult because he was selling to other young people with similar tastes to his own.While the business was small, Jordan was able to operate alone from his parents\u0027 house. But when sales took off, he quickly found he needed more space.\u0027There were cardboard boxes everywhere and we were getting in the way of each other,\u0027 Jordan says. \u0027There was so much stock in the house and I knew my Mum and Dad didn\u0027t like it.\u0027Jordan found a unit in East Tilbury, a 15-minute drive from his parents\u0027 house. It serves as an office, photography studio and stockroom for 1,000 vintage garments.He now rakes in around £500 a day, of which £350 is profit. His best return was on a pair of Nike Air Max trainers, which he bought on eBay for 99p and sold for £80.He says his mum saw the potential in his business from the start and was keen to get involved.For the most part Jordan says he and his mum get on like a \u0027house on fire\u0027, but he admits they still bicker from time to time.\u0027She takes the job seriously, but I\u0027m a perfectionist,\u0027 he says. \u0027If she makes a mistake I\u0027m always like, \u0027Oh Mum\u0027!\u0027Julie seconds this: \u0027I\u0027ll do something one way and he\u0027ll say, \u0027Not quite like that, Mum\u0027. But you know what, it\u0027s his business and I\u0027m here to help.\u0027He\u0027s built this up over the last five years and I\u0027m really proud of him.\u0027Dimitrios Tsivrikos, a consumer and business psychologist at University College London, says enterprising young people such as Jordan dispel the myth that all millennials want success handed to them on a plate.But he cautions that, while the internet has created a world of opportunities, this comes with downsides. For example, it can be hard to know where to start or how to make a success of a business as a young person. That\u0027s where parents and grandparents are filling the void.\u0027Unlike their parents, many of whom had a fairly prescribed route to success, with plenty of examples to follow, young people today are navigating untrodden paths as online entrepreneurs,\u0027 Dr Tsivrikos says.My seven-year-old sister helps model the clothes  While some relatives work away behind the scenes, others are becoming the face of the modern family business.          Cool kid: Seven-year-old Oberta  Vodenicharova models a jumper for her sister KristinaKristina Vodenicharova decided her seven-year-old sister Oberta, known as Bertie, would be just the thing to make her brand, The Cool Kid, stand out.Kristina, 22, used to make her boyfriend Stanislav, 23, pose in the vintage sportswear she sold, but says he didn\u0027t enjoy it.After a few months, she started putting Bertie in front of the camera wearing the Eighties and Nineties Fila, Nike and Puma \u0027treasures\u0027 she finds in shops around the East Midlands. Bertie, who has long dark hair and a mischievous grin, throws herself into the work.\u0027She\u0027s very creative,\u0027 Kristina says. \u0027As soon as she\u0027s dressed she starts making faces and posing, and I take photos the whole time. She keeps changing her expression until I get the right look.\u0027While Kristina says she and her sister have a lot of fun together, working with a seven-year-old isn\u0027t without its challenges.\u0027I took her to the lake in the centre of Coventry on a photoshoot and there were ducks, which proved a big distraction,\u0027 she recalls. \u0027I told her that once we were done she could go play with the ducks, and that seemed to do the trick.\u0027Bertie has also developed a penchant for fashion, which can cause problems if she takes a liking to something that\u0027s up for sale. Kristina says she and her young assistant once had an argument because Bertie wanted to keep an Adidas crop top for herself.\u0027She said, \u0027I\u0027ve always wanted one, please, please, please\u0027. My mum said, \u0027No, she\u0027s only seven\u0027.\u0027But we ended up making a deal if it wasn\u0027t sold in two weeks she could have it. It sold straight away — she was very disappointed.\u0027Kristina, who can make up to £300 a day, sometimes gives her little sister some pocket money — £5 here and there — or takes her shopping for sweets as a thank-you treat.          Sole traders: Daniel Wilmot and  his grandad Brian, 81, show off pairs of rare Nike trainers I\u0027m 24 and grandad\u0027s 81 and we are a business team Daniel Wilmot has picked a relative from the other end of the family tree to help run his online business selling rare trainers.He says his grandad Brian, 81, who was nicknamed \u0027the brain\u0027 at school, is \u0027the kind of person you\u0027d go to for advice\u0027 — and most of his family do.And Daniel, 24, says Brian\u0027s experience running a seaside sweetshop in Great Yarmouth has proved invaluable.Brian got involved with Daniel\u0027s business three years ago. He was already sourcing and selling rare trainers online while studying at Nottingham Trent University. He had planned to join the police, but decided it wasn\u0027t for him. His mum didn\u0027t have his room ready at her house in Elford, Staffordshire, so he went to stay with his grandad, whom he has always been close to.He\u0027d been used to going shopping and trawling websites such as Gumtree on his own. But when he moved in with Brian, they started going out together to visit Nike stores in Birmingham.Daniel says: \u0027Grandad was recently retired and would have been sitting at home. And I\u0027d just be going out on my own.\u0027Brian took on the book-keeping while Daniel focused on purchases and sales. He turned over £40,000 in the first nine months.\u0027I was so wrapped up in the trainers I didn\u0027t think much about the books. In just a year, we\u0027d gone over the VAT threshold and I needed to be responsible.\u0027That\u0027s where my grandad really helped. We got the books out and made a list of everything we sold.\u0027Now Daniel can sell between 20 and 50 pairs of trainers a day on online marketplace Depop under the name @hookedbhm, with an average mark-up of £20.Daniel doesn\u0027t pay his grandad and says the only time they have discussed money has been in jest.                            Grandad used to tell his friends in the pub that he was being exploited and he\u0027d have me impounded for slave labour. But he would never take any money                         \u0027Grandad used to tell his friends in the pub that he was being exploited and he\u0027d have me impounded for slave labour. But he would never take any money.\u0027Brian, whom Daniel dubs a \u0027Clarks man\u0027 for his traditional taste in shoes, has never had much interest in trainers.Daniel bought him a pair of Adidas shoes when he had a heart bypass and had to do more exercise, but says he rarely wears them. Now Brian is on the mailing list of every trainer retailer just in case they have rare shoes to sell, and keeps an eye on which ones he should be buying for the business.\u0027Grandad\u0027s really knowledgeable and knows what it takes to run a shop. He\u0027ll think of all the things I don\u0027t, such as what you\u0027re supposed to do when you want to go on holiday.\u0027Brian says: \u0027I\u0027ve only had one pair of trainers in my life and I couldn\u0027t tell you what they were.\u0027But I was interested in spending time with Daniel, who\u0027d come back from university a confident young man. He\u0027s like a mini-me — we\u0027ve got the same sense of humour and we\u0027re both very laid back.\u0027I give him support and go with him when he bulk-buys. I\u0027m also around to bounce ideas off and tell him when something sounds daft — but that\u0027s just being a grandad, really.\u0027          Natacha Petajamaa and her mother Mirva  converted a room in her home from where her they sell vintage clothesMy mum helps out as a vintage bargain hunter  When your business revolves around the latest trends, as a millennial you might not trust your parents to know what young people want.And Natacha Petajamaa says when her mum, Mirva, first got involved in her Dark Paradise Vintage clothes business four years ago, she made a few dubious choices. Natacha, 28, says the worst item her mum picked was a long leather gothic trench coat.The conversation that followed was awkward: Natacha had to explain that the coat wasn\u0027t really the type of thing people were after and Mirva was quite upset.Natacha had been selling online with a friend for a few years, starting with clothes that were gathering dust in their wardrobes and then looking for bargains in charity shops. Natacha would also sell her mum\u0027s unwanted items for her. And when Natacha\u0027s friend went away to university her mum stepped up.Natacha moved to London and Mirva offered to send the sold garments to buyers from her home. She wanted to sell her own vintage finds on the website, too, and Natacha agreed. Mirva keeps the money she makes from these sales.Natacha says her mum\u0027s tastes have improved over the years, and she rarely has to say \u0027no\u0027 any more. \u0027She found this amazing Sixties leopard print jacket at a car boot sale for £5 and we listed it online for £65,\u0027 Natacha recalls.                            There were occasions early on when Mum was a bit resentful if I was selling more than she was and she had to pack and send all my stuff. But you\u0027ve got to have these arguments in order to learn                         \u0027It was snapped up straight away and we kept getting messages from people wanting it.\u0027Every weekend Natacha travels from London to her parents\u0027 three-bed house in Crowborough, East Sussex, and she and Mirva go off to trawl countryside car boot sales. They take their haul back home and store it in one of the rooms they\u0027ve converted into studio and storage space.Natacha uploads pictures of their stock on to shopping websites Depop, Etsy and ASOS Marketplace. Mirva is then responsible for communicating with customers, packing the orders and sending them. Natacha deals with the websites and social media.In total, they make £4,000 to £5,000 of sales a month — each keeping the gains from the garments they selected. They make more in winter, when they can sell expensive coats.While Natacha says her mum has become the \u0027other half\u0027 of her business, and couldn\u0027t run it without her, they\u0027re also in competition.\u0027There were occasions early on when Mum was a bit resentful if I was selling more than she was and she had to pack and send all my stuff. But you\u0027ve got to have these arguments in order to learn.\u0027Mirva says it took some time to get used to what Natacha wanted.\u0027I wore these vintage clothes the first time round,\u0027 she says. \u0027I thought anything \u0027vintage\u0027 would work. But Natacha would say they weren\u0027t fashionable and young people wouldn\u0027t like them. So what she didn\u0027t like I wore myself!\u0027Now I know what people want and your confidence grows when people appreciate your taste.\u0027Mirva says she loves working with Natacha because it keeps their relationship close.She adds: \u0027When you have children and they grow up you can grow apart.

The rest of the time we have to buy it.\u0027There have been times where we\u0027ve had no electricity for 24 hours.\u0027 Nieves lives with her two daughters and a granddaughter on the outskirts of San Juan, in a neighborhood of small, unfinished houses, dirt roads and skinny dogs.She spends a quarter of her income buying water while her medical student daughter has to go to a neighbor\u0027s house to use the internet.Yet protests in San Juan are as scarce as food, medicines and sanitary products.Many residents seem resigned to their fate. Some collect rain water, while others pray that frequent power cuts won\u0027t damage their electrical appliances.           Far from being a remote village outpost, San Juan has a population of 160,000 inhabitants and is just 90 miles southwest of the capital Caracas.

He vowed to quadruple oil production, which has dropped from a high of 3.2 million barrels a day 10 years ago to a 30-year low of 1.5 million in 2018, but predicted it would take two years to see \u0027the first symptoms\u0027 of \u0027economic prosperity.\u0027That won\u0027t cheer the residents of San Juan, though.Carolina Azuaje, a 17-year-old medical student, leaves home at 6:00 am to try to get on one of the free buses supplied by her university, but often has to wait hours to do so.\u0027You have to punch and kick your way onto the bus,\u0027 she said. \u0027Last week, I broke a finger.\u0027It\u0027s no exaggeration. When the bus arrives, she jostles with around 100 people to try to board. Many don\u0027t make it, but most just laugh.Nieves says there\u0027s no point complaining as it will only lead to greater hardship.

No one is talking about bank reform and investment and job creation,\u0027 said economic journalist Maziar Motamedi of Tehran\u0027s Financial Tribune.Fearing a public panic, the government continues to insist that everything is under control, but has so far offered only vague promises that it will allocate more money to job creation and funnel more infrastructure projects to the private sector.\u0027Just saying positive stuff is not helping. People have a hard time believing them,\u0027 Motamedi said.\u0027Everyone knows the structural problems are there but the government is tackling crises as they happen rather than preventing them.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/09/09/4DF46A1500000578-0-image-a-6_1531126256163.jpg","title":"The modern family businesses run children","story":"    Family affair: Jordan Weller and his mother Julie prepare clothes for his online businesses which rakes in some £500-a-dayJordan, who lives at home with his parents in Essex, pays his mum a weekly wage of £80 to collect up to 50 items of vintage sportswear once or twice a week, which she\u0027ll wash and iron. She also prepares the quarterly report for the accountant.\u0027She takes the lead on all the things I don\u0027t have time to do\u0027, Jordan says. \u0027I could give her more work but it\u0027s difficult as the business is online and she\u0027s not very good on the computer.\u0027Start-up Doctor: How do I raise money and find investors to...Plumbers and handymen, Amazon needs you: New service for...How to find a better current account for your small businessCan coffee help homeless people off the streets?

He says he was always into fashion, and knowing what people wanted wasn\u0027t difficult because he was selling to other young people with similar tastes to his own.While the business was small, Jordan was able to operate alone from his parents\u0027 house. But when sales took off, he quickly found he needed more space.\u0027There were cardboard boxes everywhere and we were getting in the way of each other,\u0027 Jordan says. \u0027There was so much stock in the house and I knew my Mum and Dad didn\u0027t like it.\u0027Jordan found a unit in East Tilbury, a 15-minute drive from his parents\u0027 house. It serves as an office, photography studio and stockroom for 1,000 vintage garments.He now rakes in around £500 a day, of which £350 is profit. His best return was on a pair of Nike Air Max trainers, which he bought on eBay for 99p and sold for £80.He says his mum saw the potential in his business from the start and was keen to get involved.For the most part Jordan says he and his mum get on like a \u0027house on fire\u0027, but he admits they still bicker from time to time.\u0027She takes the job seriously, but I\u0027m a perfectionist,\u0027 he says. \u0027If she makes a mistake I\u0027m always like, \u0027Oh Mum\u0027!\u0027Julie seconds this: \u0027I\u0027ll do something one way and he\u0027ll say, \u0027Not quite like that, Mum\u0027. But you know what, it\u0027s his business and I\u0027m here to help.\u0027He\u0027s built this up over the last five years and I\u0027m really proud of him.\u0027Dimitrios Tsivrikos, a consumer and business psychologist at University College London, says enterprising young people such as Jordan dispel the myth that all millennials want success handed to them on a plate.But he cautions that, while the internet has created a world of opportunities, this comes with downsides. For example, it can be hard to know where to start or how to make a success of a business as a young person. That\u0027s where parents and grandparents are filling the void.\u0027Unlike their parents, many of whom had a fairly prescribed route to success, with plenty of examples to follow, young people today are navigating untrodden paths as online entrepreneurs,\u0027 Dr Tsivrikos says.My seven-year-old sister helps model the clothes  While some relatives work away behind the scenes, others are becoming the face of the modern family business.          Cool kid: Seven-year-old Oberta  Vodenicharova models a jumper for her sister KristinaKristina Vodenicharova decided her seven-year-old sister Oberta, known as Bertie, would be just the thing to make her brand, The Cool Kid, stand out.Kristina, 22, used to make her boyfriend Stanislav, 23, pose in the vintage sportswear she sold, but says he didn\u0027t enjoy it.After a few months, she started putting Bertie in front of the camera wearing the Eighties and Nineties Fila, Nike and Puma \u0027treasures\u0027 she finds in shops around the East Midlands. Bertie, who has long dark hair and a mischievous grin, throws herself into the work.\u0027She\u0027s very creative,\u0027 Kristina says. \u0027As soon as she\u0027s dressed she starts making faces and posing, and I take photos the whole time. She keeps changing her expression until I get the right look.\u0027While Kristina says she and her sister have a lot of fun together, working with a seven-year-old isn\u0027t without its challenges.\u0027I took her to the lake in the centre of Coventry on a photoshoot and there were ducks, which proved a big distraction,\u0027 she recalls. \u0027I told her that once we were done she could go play with the ducks, and that seemed to do the trick.\u0027Bertie has also developed a penchant for fashion, which can cause problems if she takes a liking to something that\u0027s up for sale. Kristina says she and her young assistant once had an argument because Bertie wanted to keep an Adidas crop top for herself.\u0027She said, \u0027I\u0027ve always wanted one, please, please, please\u0027. My mum said, \u0027No, she\u0027s only seven\u0027.\u0027But we ended up making a deal if it wasn\u0027t sold in two weeks she could have it. It sold straight away — she was very disappointed.\u0027Kristina, who can make up to £300 a day, sometimes gives her little sister some pocket money — £5 here and there — or takes her shopping for sweets as a thank-you treat.          Sole traders: Daniel Wilmot and  his grandad Brian, 81, show off pairs of rare Nike trainers I\u0027m 24 and grandad\u0027s 81 and we are a business team Daniel Wilmot has picked a relative from the other end of the family tree to help run his online business selling rare trainers.He says his grandad Brian, 81, who was nicknamed \u0027the brain\u0027 at school, is \u0027the kind of person you\u0027d go to for advice\u0027 — and most of his family do.And Daniel, 24, says Brian\u0027s experience running a seaside sweetshop in Great Yarmouth has proved invaluable.Brian got involved with Daniel\u0027s business three years ago. He was already sourcing and selling rare trainers online while studying at Nottingham Trent University. He had planned to join the police, but decided it wasn\u0027t for him. His mum didn\u0027t have his room ready at her house in Elford, Staffordshire, so he went to stay with his grandad, whom he has always been close to.He\u0027d been used to going shopping and trawling websites such as Gumtree on his own. But when he moved in with Brian, they started going out together to visit Nike stores in Birmingham.Daniel says: \u0027Grandad was recently retired and would have been sitting at home. And I\u0027d just be going out on my own.\u0027Brian took on the book-keeping while Daniel focused on purchases and sales. He turned over £40,000 in the first nine months.\u0027I was so wrapped up in the trainers I didn\u0027t think much about the books. In just a year, we\u0027d gone over the VAT threshold and I needed to be responsible.\u0027That\u0027s where my grandad really helped. We got the books out and made a list of everything we sold.\u0027Now Daniel can sell between 20 and 50 pairs of trainers a day on online marketplace Depop under the name @hookedbhm, with an average mark-up of £20.Daniel doesn\u0027t pay his grandad and says the only time they have discussed money has been in jest.                            Grandad used to tell his friends in the pub that he was being exploited and he\u0027d have me impounded for slave labour. But he would never take any money                         \u0027Grandad used to tell his friends in the pub that he was being exploited and he\u0027d have me impounded for slave labour. But he would never take any money.\u0027Brian, whom Daniel dubs a \u0027Clarks man\u0027 for his traditional taste in shoes, has never had much interest in trainers.Daniel bought him a pair of Adidas shoes when he had a heart bypass and had to do more exercise, but says he rarely wears them. Now Brian is on the mailing list of every trainer retailer just in case they have rare shoes to sell, and keeps an eye on which ones he should be buying for the business.\u0027Grandad\u0027s really knowledgeable and knows what it takes to run a shop. He\u0027ll think of all the things I don\u0027t, such as what you\u0027re supposed to do when you want to go on holiday.\u0027Brian says: \u0027I\u0027ve only had one pair of trainers in my life and I couldn\u0027t tell you what they were.\u0027But I was interested in spending time with Daniel, who\u0027d come back from university a confident young man. He\u0027s like a mini-me — we\u0027ve got the same sense of humour and we\u0027re both very laid back.\u0027I give him support and go with him when he bulk-buys. I\u0027m also around to bounce ideas off and tell him when something sounds daft — but that\u0027s just being a grandad, really.\u0027          Natacha Petajamaa and her mother Mirva  converted a room in her home from where her they sell vintage clothesMy mum helps out as a vintage bargain hunter  When your business revolves around the latest trends, as a millennial you might not trust your parents to know what young people want.And Natacha Petajamaa says when her mum, Mirva, first got involved in her Dark Paradise Vintage clothes business four years ago, she made a few dubious choices. Natacha, 28, says the worst item her mum picked was a long leather gothic trench coat.The conversation that followed was awkward: Natacha had to explain that the coat wasn\u0027t really the type of thing people were after and Mirva was quite upset.Natacha had been selling online with a friend for a few years, starting with clothes that were gathering dust in their wardrobes and then looking for bargains in charity shops. Natacha would also sell her mum\u0027s unwanted items for her. And when Natacha\u0027s friend went away to university her mum stepped up.Natacha moved to London and Mirva offered to send the sold garments to buyers from her home. She wanted to sell her own vintage finds on the website, too, and Natacha agreed. Mirva keeps the money she makes from these sales.Natacha says her mum\u0027s tastes have improved over the years, and she rarely has to say \u0027no\u0027 any more. \u0027She found this amazing Sixties leopard print jacket at a car boot sale for £5 and we listed it online for £65,\u0027 Natacha recalls.                            There were occasions early on when Mum was a bit resentful if I was selling more than she was and she had to pack and send all my stuff. But you\u0027ve got to have these arguments in order to learn                         \u0027It was snapped up straight away and we kept getting messages from people wanting it.\u0027Every weekend Natacha travels from London to her parents\u0027 three-bed house in Crowborough, East Sussex, and she and Mirva go off to trawl countryside car boot sales. They take their haul back home and store it in one of the rooms they\u0027ve converted into studio and storage space.Natacha uploads pictures of their stock on to shopping websites Depop, Etsy and ASOS Marketplace. Mirva is then responsible for communicating with customers, packing the orders and sending them. Natacha deals with the websites and social media.In total, they make £4,000 to £5,000 of sales a month — each keeping the gains from the garments they selected. They make more in winter, when they can sell expensive coats.While Natacha says her mum has become the \u0027other half\u0027 of her business, and couldn\u0027t run it without her, they\u0027re also in competition.\u0027There were occasions early on when Mum was a bit resentful if I was selling more than she was and she had to pack and send all my stuff. But you\u0027ve got to have these arguments in order to learn.\u0027Mirva says it took some time to get used to what Natacha wanted.\u0027I wore these vintage clothes the first time round,\u0027 she says. \u0027I thought anything \u0027vintage\u0027 would work. But Natacha would say they weren\u0027t fashionable and young people wouldn\u0027t like them. So what she didn\u0027t like I wore myself!\u0027Now I know what people want and your confidence grows when people appreciate your taste.\u0027Mirva says she loves working with Natacha because it keeps their relationship close.She adds: \u0027When you have children and they grow up you can grow apart.

Salman Abedi, who attacked the Manchester arena was rescued from Libya onboard HMS Enterprise, pictured arriving in Valetta, Malta on August 4, 2014. Abedi was among 110 Britons - including his brother Hashem - rescued from the war zone by the Royal NavyThey also demanded to know why the Abedis – British-born sons of Libyan migrants – had been allowed to visit the Middle Eastern state without apparent scrutiny and subsequently fell off the security services\u0027 radar.Robby Potter, 48, who almost died in the attack after shrapnel from the bomb punctured his heart, told the Mail: \u0027The authorities have definitely hidden this information from us. They haven\u0027t been honest. Brother of Manchester bomber \u0027tells family he is scared of...Share this article\u0027The Government should have told us straight away or it should have been in the reports. We have been left to find out through the Press.\u0027John Woodcock, the independent MP for Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria, said: \u0027It is deeply concerning that the Royal Navy\u0027s role in extracting Salman Abedi has had to be uncovered by a media investigation rather than being volunteered by the British Government.          Robby Potter, pictured with his wife Leonora Ogerio. They were both wounded in the attack\u0027In particular, David Anderson QC needs to explain why he did not include this in his report into the Manchester bombing – was he kept in the dark or did he choose to hide it from the public?\u0027Either way, this undermines the important role he had as Britain\u0027s independent reviewer of terror legislation.\u0027I believe the Navy acted perfectly properly in rescuing these British citizens but unnecessary secrecy leaves the unfortunate impression that the Government has something it wants to hide.\u0027 It is understood that the Ministry of Defence was the first Whitehall department to discover that Abedi had been rescued by the Royal Navy.          Abedi was already being monitored by the security services seven months before his rescueHis name emerged on passenger lists handed to the sailors on HMS Enterprise. The information was subsequently passed on to Number Ten, the Foreign Office and the Home Office.Whitehall sources said that Abedi\u0027s rescue did not come to light in the Anderson report because it had no relevance to potential security failings.But Elkan Abrahamson, a solicitor representing relatives of victims of the bombing for the forthcoming inquests, said: \u0027The trouble with the Anderson report is that we are not allowed to see the primary sources – that is, the MI5 or other security service documents.\u0027I am sure that the security services have not told us the full story. We may need an inquiry to get at the truth.\u0027He added: \u0027Both Abedi and his brother ought to have been tracked better, there are certainly concerns around that.\u0027           The Daily Mail yesterday uncovered how Abedi was rescued by the Royal Navy from LibyaThe Anderson report revealed that Abedi was already being monitored by the security services a full seven months before the rescue and that MI5 closed his file as a result of mistaken identify a month prior to his evacuation from Libya in 2014.Senior security sources insist Abedi had not been radicalised at the time of the rescue and instead was brainwashed after watching bomb-making videos on the internet.However, other sources have claimed that Abedi was seen on the front line, fighting alongside jihadis in Ajdabiya, eastern Libya. Survivors of the atrocity said it was difficult to understand why the Abedis were not detained or monitored following the rescue on their return to the UK.Mr Potter, who was blown up while waiting for his daughter after the concert, said: \u0027The security services must have known the Abedis had gone to Libya to fight. They\u0027ve got questions to answer about why they let them back in the UK as free men.\u0027The security services should have questioned the Abedis about what they were doing in Libya, at the very least. They should have been taken back to Libya and not allowed into Britain.\u0027             Hashem Abedi, 21, brother of Manchester suicide bomber Salman Abedi has claimed he is afraid to be extradited to the UK to face terrorism charges The UK government requested his extradition last October from the United Nations-backed government in Tripoli. But the high-level negotiations appear to have stalled.And in May Libyan judicial sources told the Mail that Hashem could escape justice by refusing to face trial in the UK. His opposition to being extradited might hold weight because he has joint Libyan citizenship, a source said.Mr Salem suggested however that Hashem, who was born in Manchester to Libyan migrants, might not be able to veto any attempt to bring him to Britain. \u0027He was afraid and he didn\u0027t want the Libyan Government to hand him over to Britain,\u0027 he said. \u0027He was very scared and the matter was still very hot but the decision is not in his hands. To me it\u0027s obvious he has committed a crime in Britain – of course he wouldn\u0027t want to be handed to them.\u0027Hashem is believed to have played a key role in the attack in May last year, including helping to buy materials for the homemade bomb set off by his brother Salman.He has also been linked to a plot to kill Peter Millett, the UK\u0027s former envoy to Libya. It is alleged he was in a four-man cell planning to carry out the attack using a suicide bomb. Brother of Manchester bomber \u0027tells family he is scared of...Share this articleIt was claimed they also plotted to kill former UN envoy Martin Kobler and Libya\u0027s prime minister Fayez Al-Sarraj. Mr Salem said: \u0027This case is quite difficult, it is not going to be that easy for Hashem to be handed over. He is a Libyan citizen and yes although he is a British national as well, it is considered that he has also committed a crime here in Libya.\u0027Mr Salem said the decision over Hashem\u0027s future was for the Libyan government to decide and not his militia: \u0027The decision to hand him over is not in our hands.\u0027But he said his Special Deterrence Force unit would willingly release Hashem from its jail, which is holding around 250 Islamic State suspects, should they be asked to do so. He said: \u0027We cannot say no. What concerns us is that we want to reassure the British people.\u0027I understand so many innocent lives were lost, and the British people feel they we are not giving them the justice they are seeking because they presume that because he is a Libyan citizen and currently in Libya that we are providing him a safe haven.            Salman Abedi, pictured, murdered 22 people during a terrorism attack on the Manchester Arena \u0027On the contrary. We do want him to face justice.\u0027Our main concern is that he does face justice no matter if it is in Libya or Britain.\u0027Of Hashem\u0027s brother, he added: \u0027It is unfortunate that they had accommodated Salman for several years in their country and he has the British passport and he committed such a thing to a country that sheltered him and served him and that he would blow himself up and that he would kill innocent children.\u0027Even his own family were shocked. We met with them and have spoken to them.\u0027Mr Salem said there was enough evidence to convict Hashem, and he had \u0027confessed to everything\u0027.He added: \u0027He is facing two things. Either he is going to be tried in Libya or he is going to be tried in Britain. If the British government and the Libyan government reach an agreement for handing him over he will be then tried in Britain.\u0027He denied any suggestion that Hashem could have been tortured into confessing his role in the Manchester attack.

The rest of the time we have to buy it.\u0027There have been times where we\u0027ve had no electricity for 24 hours.\u0027 Nieves lives with her two daughters and a granddaughter on the outskirts of San Juan, in a neighborhood of small, unfinished houses, dirt roads and skinny dogs.She spends a quarter of her income buying water while her medical student daughter has to go to a neighbor\u0027s house to use the internet.Yet protests in San Juan are as scarce as food, medicines and sanitary products.Many residents seem resigned to their fate. Some collect rain water, while others pray that frequent power cuts won\u0027t damage their electrical appliances.           Far from being a remote village outpost, San Juan has a population of 160,000 inhabitants and is just 90 miles southwest of the capital Caracas.

He vowed to quadruple oil production, which has dropped from a high of 3.2 million barrels a day 10 years ago to a 30-year low of 1.5 million in 2018, but predicted it would take two years to see \u0027the first symptoms\u0027 of \u0027economic prosperity.\u0027That won\u0027t cheer the residents of San Juan, though.Carolina Azuaje, a 17-year-old medical student, leaves home at 6:00 am to try to get on one of the free buses supplied by her university, but often has to wait hours to do so.\u0027You have to punch and kick your way onto the bus,\u0027 she said. \u0027Last week, I broke a finger.\u0027It\u0027s no exaggeration. When the bus arrives, she jostles with around 100 people to try to board. Many don\u0027t make it, but most just laugh.Nieves says there\u0027s no point complaining as it will only lead to greater hardship.

These narratives about effigies brought to life, homunculi, golems, reanimated corpses and sentient robots invariably end in death and disaster. Still, they profess our sincere hope that if we can invent the formula for life, we might also cheat death. It might even be argued that in the end this is really the only story there is to tell of our species. If only there will be someone left to tell it.  No one grows up without being exposed to this story in one form or another. So when I set out to write CoDex 1962, a novel about a dying man trying to find a place for himself within the grand narrative of human history, I immediately thought of the treasure trove of these tales. His need to be something new leads him to the story of the golem and the rabbi who created him, and even to the brink of awareness of the real author of the book he thinks he is creating. For, after all, a novel is made of ink-and-paper automatons. Here are some of the other great stories that we will never learn from. 1. The Tale of Thorleif, the Earl’s Poet, translated by Judith Jesch The poetwarrior Thorleif and his dealings with the evil Earl Hakon is the subject of this short Icelandic saga – which boasts of one of literature’s nastiest artificial hitmen. After Hakon has robbed Thorleif and burned his ship, the poet takes revenge by composing a curse so powerful it makes the earl lose his hair. In turn, the miserable earl enlists two witches to help him fashion a man’s likeness out of driftwood and bring it to life by putting a fresh human heart in its breast. Then they send it off to Iceland where the wooden killer hunts Thorleif down and cuts his stomach open with a halberd. The poet recites a poem about his own killing before he literally spills his guts.  2. The Street of Crocodiles by Bruno Schulz, translated by Madeline G Levine One of the 20th century’s true masterpieces. Originally named The Cinnamon Shops, it is a string of stories taking place in the Jewish community of Drohobych in what was then Polish Galicia. It is a magical text where everything is infused with life. Things, creatures and natural phenomena constantly blend as they are used as metaphors for each other. At the book’s heart is the narrator’s father, Josef, slowly retreating into a world of his own within the large family house. He becomes the spokesman of tailors’ dummies and mounts a passionate defence of these silent, still beings. The book ends with a mysterious image of a giant homunculus merging with the universe and the index cards it is written on. 3. Frankenstein by Mary Shelley With this novel, the mythic tale of man’s limited authority in creation becomes a modern story. Like all the best stories, it makes us face the failure of our ambition and the damage we can do. Claimed by each new age as the perfect mirror, Frankenstein has been rewritten, retold and reinterpreted in every narrative medium, just like the antique Greek myth of Prometheus that inspired Shelley in the first place. 4. The Adventures of Pinocchio by Carlo Collodi, translated by Ann Lawson Lucas Collodi’s tale about the rascally boy marionette has it all and all too much of it: loneliness, the fear of dying, treachery, the corruption of youth, violence towards the weak, devious humans and talking animals, sexy spirits, ominous landscapes, man-to-beast metamorphosis, hopes fulfilled and quashed, humanity gained through trial and error, and a strangely elastic nose. It is a children’s book of the best and darkest kind. Most of us get to know the Disney film at an age when we are still raw material like the wooden boy. To read the book as an adult is even scarier. 5. A Cyborg Manifesto by Donna Haraway“The cyborg would not recognise the Garden of Eden it is not made of mud and cannot dream of returning to dust.” Animal, human, cyborg Haraway put humans in their place with her 1984 manifesto, arguing for a post-humanist stance based on affinity and kindness. Her thinking is challenging and in dialogue with radical feminist body and identity theory. It is not an easy text to decipher but it has brought me much inspiration over the years and I think it contains a seed for our survival. 6. The Puttermesser Papers by Cynthia OzickOzick gives us a female golem in the second “paper” in her book of Ruth Puttermesser, a busy feminist lawyer in mid-20th century New York. What Puttermesser needs is a helper (a wife, really) and one night while sleeping she makes a golem from the earth in her apartment’s flower pots. This creature grows so powerful that Puttermesser is able to become city mayor. She uses her golem to clean up the city, but as in every well-told automaton tale, the creature gains dangerous independence.  7. On Dolls, edited by Kenneth Gross Gross brings together in one beautiful volume key texts about the uncanny world of inanimate beings, by authors including Walter Benjamin, Marina Warner, Sigmund Freud (on ETA Hoffman’s The Sandman) and Heinrich Von Kleist. The latter’s On the Marionette Theatre makes the unsettling case that the marionettes’ experience is superior to man’s bondage in living flesh. 8. He, She and It by Marge Piercy In 2059, Shira Shipman is living in a changed North America. Her young son has been taken from her by the “multi” that runs her zone, so she returns to Tikva, the Jewish “free town” where she grew up. Here, she meets an extraordinary cyborg, imbued with intelligence, feeling and the ability to kill.9. Cloud Atlas by David MitchellTold in the past, the present and possible futures, Cloud Atlas’s most tragic and human character is Sonmi–451, a future clone designed to have no self-awareness – and thereby no survival instinct – so she can be worked to death in a diner only to end up reprocessed as food. As her name implies, she finds her strength through reading and her own story becomes a cornerstone of a civilisation even farther in the future.  10. The Golem by Gustav Meyrink, translated by Mike MitchellWhen I was 17 and had just met my mentor in all things strange and marvellous, the Icelandic surrealist artist Alfreð Flóki, he gave me a copy of this novel and told me we could have no further conversation before I had read it. It is a fever dream of a book. The protagonist’s mind melds with the legend of the Golem of Prague, the original artificial man of clay created by rabbi Judah Loew ben Bezalel in the 16th-century ghetto. And my mind melded so thoroughly with the novel that 13 years later I decided to bring the golem story into the folds of Icelandic literature by any narrative means neccesary.

But in its latest quarterly health check on the economy, the NIESR said May’s version of a soft Brexit was still not soft enough. The government was aiming for market access similar to that enjoyed by Switzerland but with a much tougher migration system. “In our view, the government will have to make significant concessions to the EU,” it said.It added, however, that even these modest growth rates relied on the UK continuing to have close to full access to the EU market for its goods and services.The more limited proposals for market access in the recently published white paper would lead to a loss of output amounting to £500 per person over time, compared to a soft Brexit.“The loss would be around £800 under a ‘no deal’ Brexit. These estimates do not include the likely impact on productivity which could, on some estimates, double the size of the losses,” said the thinktank. Jagjit Chadha, director of the NIESR, said: “In the UK, uncertainty about exit from the EU seems to be limiting the development of policies to promote more inclusive growth.” Brexit, he added, was a demanding agenda that was causing political stasis. “Things are not happening that should be happening.”Chadha said pre-Brexit Britain was “gripped by an unusual amount of uncertainty, you might call it an epidemic of uncertainty – we haven’t worked out how to do it”.The NIESR said the Bank of England would need to take account of the uncertainty when setting interest rates. While supporting a quarter-point increase in official borrowing costs this week, the Bank should make it clear that it was prepared to reverse the decision, the institute added. “The UK is just eight months away from the March 2019 EU exit date and the range of outcomes remains as wide as ever. We are by no means sure that there will be a deal by then, and even if there is a deal it is not clear how policymakers, businesses and households will respond to the new arrangement. And, all along, the chance of a second referendum is rising.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea43643119edbf629fd2d693261ab6cff9200259/0_192_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=00ac17d269bcb234da0deeff738ba5ec","title":"brazil graffiti artist sao paulo","story":"Two pixadores were shot dead after a police confrontation while tagging a building. Four years later, their families and friends are still waiting for justiceIt was a mild July evening when the two men entered an apartment building in the midst of São Paulo’s urban sprawl and headed for the roof.Alex Dalla Vechia Costa, 32, and Ailton dos Santos, 33, were pixadores – graffiti taggers who cover the ugly, grey buildings of South America’s biggest city with their hieroglyphic scrawl. Relatives say the two men bluffed their way into the building so they could tag it. But a suspicious caretaker called the police, and after a confrontation, the two men were shot dead.The case prompted an outcry when five officers were twice held in custody, charged with murder – and then released.The accused officers were eventually cleared of involvement in their killing last November by a São Paulo judge, who tried the case without a jury.But according to court documents, the same five officers have been involved in 17 incidents in which civilians were killed. São Paulo state public prosecutors are now appealing the verdict, arguing that the officers “sentenced the two pixador iniduals to death and executed them”.Four years after the killings on 31 July 2014, Costa and dos Santos’s families and friends say they are still waiting for justice in a case which threw a spotlight light on São Paulo’s risky graffiti culture – and on the lethality of Brazilian police.Pixação – as the city’s tagging style is known - has many opponents in São Paulo, who draw a distinction between its barely-intelligible scrawls and more conventional graffiti art.But pixadores say their designs are a cry of protest from the city’s marginalised communities.Fabio Vieira, 33, a photographer and pixador who knew Costa, described pixação as a protest against the social alienation and abandonment of a ided city. Its practitioners relish the challenge of reaching places where their tags will be most visible – often breaking into abandoned buildings or tricking their way past caretakers. “We know it is a crime but we occupy the city,” he said. In an open letter following the court decision, a group of the city’s pixadores wrote: “What is the biggest crime? To tag your name or to execute someone and hide the evidence?”In their testimony, the officers said they had been told the building was being robbed, and that the two men had shot first before they returned fire. Police said they found a revolver and a pistol on the men, as well as stolen goods. Prosecutors argued that that evidence was falsified and the guns had been planted.Judge Débora Faitarone discounted evidence from two other officers who had testified that they had seen two men being held alive on another floor because of what she said was inconsistencies in their testimonies. The judge also noted that both victims had criminal records, for stealing and criminal damage. “It is absolutely believable that the victims were armed,” she said in her ruling.Lawyers for the officers recently said in a statement that no spray paints were found with the dead men, nor was any part of the building painted. “It was another important victory for the police family,” it said.But relatives said the two victims entered the building to tag not to steal. On the night of their death Costa had sent WhatsApp messages to friends asking who wanted to go tagging, later published by the human rights website Ponte. Once inside the building, the two men took a selfie in the elevator – standard pixador practice.“What bandit would do that?” asked Vieira, who later took a photo of Dalla Vechia’s dead hand with paint on it – more proof, he argued, that the men had been tagging before their deaths.Costa had even appeared in a TV report in which he and other taggers were seen tricking their way into an apartment building before spraying their names from the roof. The two men’s tags – JETS for Alex Dalla Vechia Costa and ANORMAL for Ailton dos Santos – can still be seen emblazoned across São Paulo.For their families, the pain continues. Alex Della Vachia Costa worked cutting and polishing marble and had two young sons, Alex Júnior and Lucas with his former partner Erika Ferreira de Sá – also a pixadora – and he also had children with other women.“He was a great person,” De Sá said. “He went out every night to paint.”The night he died, he promised to meet her at around 11.30pm but failed to turn up. Police called to tell her he had been killed in a shoot-out.“I knew it wasn’t an exchange of fire because he did not go around armed,” she said.Ailton dos Santos had given up pixação, according to his wife Eliete dos Santos, 33, but, after running into Costa – a childhood friend he took it up again a few months before his death. He left behind a nine-year-old daughter, Stefany. “The pain that we feel gets worse with time,” said Eliete dos Santos, who has joined support groups with other women whose partners and children have been shot by law enforcement officials. Brazilian police kill more than 11 people a day, according to 2016 figures from the Brazilian Forum on Public Security, and are often accused of falsifying evidence.Major Sérgio Olímpio Gomes, a São Paulo lawmaker and police officer, said officers regularly face dangerous armed criminals and suffer exceptionally high mortality rates – 453 were murdered in 2016. “It is not that police in Brazil are killers,” he said. “We are a dangerous country where the criminals are dangerous.”Violent crime and police killings are all too common in the periferia – São Paulo’s grim, low-income suburbs which are home to most of the city’s pixadores, said Vieira.“Pixação is from the periferia. Rich people don’t do pixação,” he said. “It will never end.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27dd872ece5ff700dd9bb5703a08f10b8644daeb/0_0_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ab8fc2ef58a0c62002f10acbbe19822","title":"germanys china city duisburg became xi jinping gateway europe","story":"For much of the 20th century, the city of Duisburg in Germany’s industrial west was a steel-and-coal town whose chimneys cloaked the skies in smoke. And yet there is something about this soot-stained spot in the Ruhr valley that seems to encourage a particularly clear-sighted view of the rest of the world.In 1585, it was in Duisburg that Flemish cartographer Gerardus Mercator published a book of maps of European countries – the first ever “atlas” to carry that name. And it was here that Mercator first presented his new world map, the “Mercator projection”, that was so revolutionary for maritime navigators keen to steer merchant vessels across the high seas in the straightest possible line.If in 2018 Duisburg is slowly rediscovering its cosmopolitan past, it is not just because four centuries after Mercator, traders are still trying to find the most direct route from A to B. As the threat of Donald Trump’s tariffs and Brexit-related trade barriers is driving wedges between the EU and the Anglosphere, this former rust-belt town town allows one to see in real time how Germany and China are intensifying their economic ties.China’s Belt and Road Initiative is a huge, $1tn infrastructure project to better connect China – and Chinese goods – with the rest of the world. It is meant to be a 21st-century silk road, made up of a belt of overland corridors (including roads, bridges and railways) and a maritime road of shipping lanes.Its wider ambitions are harder to pin down. Is it a bid by China for world domination, or simply a move to prop up Chinese companies at home? Is there a grand strategy, or is it just a rebranding of existing projects?In\u0026nbspCities of the New Silk Road\u0026nbspwe have endeavoured to find out, by exploring the project\u0027s tangible results so far – from the newly built city of Khorgos on the Kazakhstan border to Duisburg, dubbed “Germany’s China city”. Our correspondents have reported from\u0026nbspthe “next Dubai” rising out of the sea in Sri Lanka, the nascent port of Gwadar in a restive province of Pakistan, the sleepy Tanzanian village that could be transformed into Africa’s largest port, and more.Nick Van MeadRead more: Cities of the New Silk RoadEvery week, around 30 Chinese trains arrive at a vast terminal in Duisburg’s inland port, their containers either stuffed with clothes, toys and hi-tech electronics from Chongqing, Wuhan or Yiwu, or carrying German cars, Scottish whisky, French wine and textiles from Milan heading the other way.In Duisburg’s port, where train tracks run straight to the edge of the Rhine River, goods are loaded straight on to ships, stored for further dispatch in one of several football pitch-sized storage units, or sent on by train or truck to Greece, Spain or Britain.Local politicians, while still proud of the city’s links to the 16th-century mapmaker, also like to compliment the perceptive eye of modern Chinese cartographers: in a map of Europe displayed at Shanghai airport, they point out, Duisburg’s name is printed larger than London, Paris or Berlin.“We are Germany’s China city,” says Sören Link, Duisburg’s Social Democrat mayor. For years, his city has been a symbol of the challenges of long-term structural changes facing industry in the Ruhr region: in 1987, photographs of thousands of Krupp steelworkers barricading a bridge over the Rhine protesting against imminent factory closures travelled around the world.The trains’ return journeys, however, remain Duisburg’s achilles heel. For every two full containers arriving in Europe from China, only one heads back the other way, and the port only earns a fifth of the fee from empty containers that have to be sent back to China.And while the west’s appetite for gadgets made in China shows no sign of abating, one of the main European products heading east is powdered milk – a result of low trust in domestic brands following a 2008 food safety scandal. If that trust returns, even fewer containers may be heading east from Duisburg.“The ratio used to be 4:1, so it has improved, but we still have an imbalance,” admits Erich Staake, the port’s CEO. A former TV channel manager, he is not shy to take credit for the entrepreneurial spirit of the port. Since taking charge in 1998, employment at Duisport has soared from 19,000 to 50,000.While other German port cities such as Hamburg run their harbour “like a landlord”, Staake says, Duisburg has worked to court new trade, modernising its logistics infrastructure and even setting up its own railway company. He is building a new 20,000 sq metre storage unit where China Railways will be able to neatly stack 2,000 containers.Staake’s aspiration doesn’t stop there. For Duisburg to permanently establish itself on the New Silk Road, he says, rail travel between China and Europe needs to outstrip other freight methods.“Rail freight between Chongqing and Duisburg is almost twice as expensive as shipping, but takes 12 days instead of 45. Air freight is at least twice as expensive as rail freight, but takes on average five days. If we can reduce lead times even further, below 10 days on average, then that opens up a lot more potential.”But in Germany, some have been quick to sound a note of caution. If the still-recovering industries in western Germany make themselves too reliant on China, they warn, it could provide economic leverage for an authoritarian regime that wants to project its geopolitical power into western Europe. “What’s good for Duisburg isn’t necessarily good for the world,” cautioned one recent article.For now though, China’s soft power barely registers in the region. The number of Chinese citizens living in the city has doubled in the past eight years – but from a low base of 568. The local Duisburg-Essen University houses a Confucius Institute and attracts the largest number of Chinese students in Germany, most of whom study engineering and economic sciences. They support a growing network of relatively authentic Asian fast food joints which now compete with the kebab houses introduced by a previous generation of migrants.The reasons journey times from China are still far too long, as Staake sees it, lie mainly with the heavily unionised rail companies in Europe rather than their counterparts in Asia: trains take on average six days to travel the 1,300km (800 miles) from Brest on the Polish-Belarusian border to Duisburg, while the 10,000km from Chongqing to Belarus is often completed in five-and-a-half days. “The Chinese and the Kazakhs drive thousands of kilometres a day, they really work hard. It’s ridiculous, really. Of course we are trying to work out why this is happening. You know how many train drivers’ unions we have, and the Poles are not much better,” says Staake. At the Duisburg city museum, visitors can still listen to the chants and jeers of the workers who went on strike over the closure of the steelworks in the 1980s and early 90s. A button hidden inside a wall made of original Ruhr valley coal triggers a recording. The modern Duisburg port with all its modern marvel, however, has yet to find its place in the city’s memory. In the entrance hall to the museum, a wall greets visitors with the words for “welcome” in the languages of all the migrant workers who have shaped the city, from Kurdish to Greek to Polish. For now, the Mandarin or Cantonese phrases for “welcome” do not feature.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9aa4ccf3335ee7f88608f29633c6f626a4b589d/0_295_6000_3601/master/6000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d29c60fdb1389d299b5fb1fdb390223d","title":"brighton estate bevy pub co operative working class community","story":"School was out and so was the sun. Brighton was heaving. The train station was a crush. The day-trippers slowly advancing upon the marina knew what they had come for. The sand, the sea, the boutiques in The Lanes, the rainbow flags, and craft beer. This is tourist-board Brighton, a city that my colleague and resident Rafael Behr calls “a coastal exclave of pseudo-London urbanity”. Like all such myths, it hides a multitude of inconvenient facts.Moulsecoomb and Bevendean, although just 10 minutes’ drive from the pier, are two big housing estates blessed with neither glamour nor cash. “You have the groovy and then you’ve got the real,” says Helen Jones, a Bevendean resident. “Up here, you have people fighting for every penny.”Pleasures enjoyed by holidaying families are seen as off limits. Many local people just don’t go to the beach. As Jones says: “The thing about not having money is that you simply can’t take part.”It was a baking hot day when I met her, with the South Downs beckoning. “Look around: it’s beautiful. But how many shops can you see? How many cafes? How many resources?” She reels off the tribulations of a decade of austerity: a park nearly shut for good, a GP surgery closed, the adult education centre folded, big cuts planned for the local school. “Live by the seafront and you’re in tourist town – you get everything chucked at you. Out here, you’re not seen – so you don’t matter.”It’s a story I have heard too many times in too many places across Britain: people too poor for the market to take an interest in, and too invisible for the state to take notice. Except in this case the community had an answer to its officially sanctioned neglect – and Jones and I were sitting in it.We were in a beer garden. More precisely, the last beer garden in the last pub in the entire neighbourhood – a pub that was shut down in 2010 and almost died. Instead, Jones and her neighbours brought it back to life, in a story that involves a punch-up at a vicarage, an anarchist dad, and working-class people getting so well organised that the politicians were forced to listen to them.This pub used to be the Bevendean Hotel, until one too many fights forced the police to close it in the spring of 2010. It lay empty for years, leaving around 18,000 people without a local. Brewers sniffed around but couldn’t make the sums work. The area’s reputation for roughness did not help: a local vicar once received a postcard addressed to “The Reverend John Wall, The Vicarage, The Dodgy Bit of Brighton, England”. That this was all the address the sorting office needed tells you something about the suburb’s standing.In the end, local people raised the funds and opened the Bevy in 2014. With banners reading “More Than A Pub”, it certainly doesn’t look like tourist Brighton’s gastropubs and cocktail palaces. Jones calls it “a back-to-front community centre”.When I visited on Monday, it was serving lunch for users of the Bridge advice centre, which had just closed down. That’s what the Bevy does: act as a hub in a community that has almost no other public space to meet, to rally against school cuts or housing problems. Chauffered along in the pub’s navy-blue minivan, the lunchers sat in the community cafe while several older regulars perched on the bar stools. This being the summer holidays, a young girl zoomed about on a hoverboard, making a staff member mutter: “I’m going to close my eyes and not think about health and safety.”The Bevy is neither cool nor especially pretty. Instead, it’s different and important. It’s not the hard-drinking, sticky-floored drinking den of old nor is it a money magnet. Pints are well over a quid cheaper than they charge in the centre of Brighton and – almost unheard of in this industry – all bar staff over 18 are on the proper living wage of £8.75 an hour. Working almost anywhere else, the Bevy’s 20-year-old apprentice would be close to £100 a week worse off.The difference lies in the fact that this pub is a co-operative owned by its members, with profits invested back into the community. Britain now has more than 100 of these “community pubs”, and their stories can be strikingly similar. In some chocolate box of a village, the boozer is about to shut, so residents hold the mother of all whiprounds and a public asset is saved. When prime minister, David Cameron himself propped up the bar of a community pub, while his government rightly chipped in to a £3.6m fund to open more.Among such heartwarmers, the Bevy sticks right out. Those other stories are largely rural this one is suburban. Those are about preserving the heart of a village the Bevy is about creating an institution to bring together a fragmented community. And it remains Britain’s only co-op pub on a housing estate. Others could rely on local people pulling £500 out of their pockets for the Bevy, they hesitated to ask residents for more than a fiver.Most of all, those other pubs didn’t have Helen Jones, or self-described anarchist Warren Carter. Even friends describe the pair as “stubborn bastards” – and they needed to be. When the authorities got wind of their plan, a police officer emailed to say that the pub would never be allowed to re-open. The council gave them bad advice, while local politicians didn’t have a clue. “All the Labour people now saying, ‘Oh yeah, I’ve always supported the Bevy’: they did fuck all, apart from bringing down some doughnuts once,” says Carter. “None of the parties did anything.”The team would go to every half-relevant meeting. One would plant a question about the Bevy, giving Carter his excuse to make a sales pitch, while a third would eye up the hall for rich Brightonians to badger into handing over money. Respectability was lent by the parish vicar, the aforementioned Father John, who saw the social isolation all around and could see how the Bevy might help. He believed: “At the heart of every community, you need a good church and a good pub.”When they launched their community share issue, he let them use the church. Even the £200,000 the Bevy committee raised in shares and grant money had to be supplemented with more begging and borrowing. The pub had no cellar, no toilets and almost no ceiling. Jones points out the beer garden tarmac that fell off the back of a lorry, the bar that was donated by a landlord who had closed his London pub, the logo that was designed for free by a local artist. Even now, if a toilet door is broken, someone coming in for a pint will fix it.All those imperfections make it more, not less of a community pub. At the opening, Father John blessed the bar with holy water and pulled the first pint. When he left for a posting in Uckfield, the pub held a leaving do. After midnight, they decamped to the vicarage – until there was a punch-up at 4am. The fracas made it into his final Moulsecoomb sermon: “At last, I feel as if I have assimilated.”As much as its beer, a pub can be measured by the quality of its banter, and so I went for a stroll with Iain Chambers, the general manager, and Bevy regular Jonathan Woolven. I’ll let them introduce each other. Chambers is a “dour fellow he never looks happy”, according to Woolven. Whereas Chambers urges you to listen to Woolven’s “amazing” voice – “like if a grizzly bear could talk”. Chambers hails from Preston Woolven was born in Paddington, London. Chambers went from running a renowned cafe, as recommended by the , to organising community businesses Woolven went into the army in 1950 and served for almost a quarter of a century. Even though Chambers manages the pub and Woolven supposedly just drinks there, both men feel they have a big stake in it.Outside the Bevy sits an old garage, now used by the local pigeon-fanciers’ club. They bring their birds along on a Friday, says Chambers, then “a lorry takes them off to Holland or wherever and they’re back by Saturday”. Woolven adds: “I give the pigeons a shopping list for Carrefour in Calais and they bring it back in time for the weekend.” A roar of laughter.Behind it lies Woolven’s showpiece: former wasteland that he and half a dozen others have turned into a blooming garden. University rugby clubs terraced the lot and put down steps. “I did ask for a chairlift,” the 86-year-old joked. Another roar.He is practically bounding around, showing off the old council bins, now filled with black earth and sprouting spring onions, rosemary and thyme, courgettes – all soon to end up on a Bevy chopping board. Higher up were raspberries, gooseberries, blackcurrants. In the corner were carrots. That giant plant straight out of Jack and the Beanstalk was corn on the cob. All over the other side of the pub were his flower baskets and planters. “It’s a good clean way of spending the day, isn’t it?”From the peak, we squint into the sun towards the sheltered housing where Woolven lives, “just a five-minute stagger away”. What did he do before the Bevy was reborn? “I went thirsty.” More laughter. The old pub had been so rowdy that he avoided it. “It was a no-go area,” says Woolven. “We had to win back a lot of the neighbours.” We. I tried to imagine anyone feeling such ownership over their local tavern.“Being a community pub rather than just a pub with a brewer in charge – it’s brought the whole community together,” Woolven declares.Chambers’s team deliberately overlaps events that pull in very different crowds, so that Woolven and his green-fingered senior citizens sometimes hold a fruit and veg sale-cum-competition at the pub on a Saturday morning – just as the Parkrun joggers meet for breakfast. It breaks down boundaries. Woolven mentioned the builders, already congregating at the bar in their paint-encrusted overalls. “They’re now much gentler. They can see the pub’s changed – and it ain’t changing back.” Rather than stay inside staring at the walls, “I might pop out for a pint of an evening. I feel comfortable about coming here,” says Woolven.Chambers couldn’t resist: “It’s been known for Jonathan still to be here at 10 o’clock of a Friday evening.”But for Woolven and other local people, their world has opened just a little wider. “Before, it was just that dreadful pub up the road,” he remembers. “Now I’m proud of the Bevy.”Running a community pub that serves the best interests of its working-class community and makes money is difficult . The activism that got it open isn’t necessarily suited to keeping it running. “Our management committee was bus drivers and midwives.\u0026nbspWe didn’t know anything about running a business,” says Warren Carter.The pub used to have an elaborate food menu, before they realised that the regulars’ budgets only really stretched to pints. And more than three years after opening, the Bevy is only now making a profit – and relying upon the goodwill of people like Chambers to work long weeks for no extra pay. Yet from his new vicarage, Father John describes it as “a minor miracle” – and he’s the expert on such matters.Woolven tells me what the Bevy means to him: “We’re a lot happier. Being old but being accepted so much by such a range of ages … I can come in here and I can mix with everyone here. You’ve got kids running around, people off building sites …”“I’ve stopped being a boring old shit,“ continues Woolven. “I can talk about all sorts of things that I don’t know about. It all adds to your happiness.”His simple words hang in the humid air. After the mandatory beat, Chambers pipes up: “He says that, but if the Harvey’s ever edges off top quality, he’ll be off into\u0026nbsptown.”“Listen,” says Woolven, “I’ve been drinking Harvey’s bitter for 60 years and if it’s not right, it’s just not right.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a6f12c9546dd9ae5dfc15bbf4bc06494974a774/0_113_2935_1762/master/2935.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b4a30318db60eb218cff2cf79145124","title":"may wooing macron futile eu brexit","story":"The prime minister is breaking her holiday in the Italian lakes to visit the French president at his official holiday residence off the Riviera for talks reportedly solicited by the British side.

Indeed, the Macrons incurred the wrath of the French public by asking for a swimming pool to be installed to supplement their private beach. Nor is it uncommon for national leaders to visit each other on holiday. It was routine for Soviet and Russian leaders to hold court beside the Black Sea, and there were summers when, for instance, Silvio Berlusconi seemed to be running something akin to a pan-European timeshare at his Sardinian villa.The UK’s sudden interest in the EU27, however, suggests something other than recreation. With May’s Chequers proposals apparently failing on both fronts – neither bringing new unity to her government and party nor convincing EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier – the government seems to be adopting a fresh approach that looks suspiciously like ide and rule. Now that the EU institutions are safely en vacances, the idea would seem to be to sound out key national governments inidually – and press key national interest buttons – in the hope that they will in turn decide to bend Barnier’s ear.The rationale can be well understood. May’s pitch to Emmanuel Macron is expected to focus on European security, the gap that leaving could create in that sphere and the mutual advantage to be drawn from the UK’s continued participation in information-sharing. Vienna is equally well chosen for Hunt’s flying visit, given the complexion of the Austrian government and its concerns about borders and migration. Poland, the Baltic states and Italy must surely be among the next destinations on UK ministers’ holiday route.All of which marks in some ways a welcome change. It is positive to see the UK engaging in some pro-active European diplomacy and going beyond Brussels and the old standby of Berlin. If this amounts to a recognition that Angela Merkel’s power may be ebbing and the EU centre of gravity may be shifting, then that hints at a welcome sense of realism, even if it has come a bit late in the day.The deployment of Hunt also suggests that the Foreign Office may be making a comeback in policy regarding the EU. Boris Johnson was kept about as far from European matters as it was possible to be and the tone has changed. Hunt has come in with a combination of charm offensive and warnings to France and Germany that the danger of the UK “crashing out of the EU” was “increasing by the day”, and that this could be as damaging to the EU – a “tragedy” even – as it would be for the UK.How much ice will any of this cut with either France, Germany or the EU as a whole, however? If London has any expectation of sowing ision, with a view to extracting a better deal – or any deal at all – it could well be disappointed. Over the year and a half since the UK invoked article 50, the EU27 have shown a remarkable cohesion. There may be discord on sharing responsibility for refugees, on Poland’s proposed judicial changes, on free movement, on reform – or not – of the eurozone, and on Macron’s vision for a Europe at once more flexible and more integrated. But on Brexit, it has been hard to detect any cracks.Forecasts that the Brexit vote could encourage others to follow suit have not been borne out. On the contrary, the effect seemed to be to foster unity – including on military and defence, where the UK had been an obstacle to closer cooperation. The vagaries of the Trump administration in the US further underlined the advantages to the EU27 of belonging to a larger, friendlier and more familiar bloc.So London may be embarking on a summer of diplomacy – and the new faces of Hunt and Dominic Raab as chief negotiator offer something of a new start. But an autumn of agreement will only follow if the UK finally grasps that it is the one doing the leaving, that the EU’s shared interests remain strong, and that it is the UK, not the EU, that needs a deal.• Mary Dejevsky is a writer and broadcaster"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7eef2f85edb18442eaeffae02d664f754f268612/0_273_4386_2632/master/4386.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bcca3936d9207c62dbe6642c163a2dc2","title":"no deal brexit mps","story":"Britain’s national conversation is subjecting voters to two dangerous falsehoods. The first, that a no-deal Brexit couldn’t harm us. The second, that it could ever happen.The first fallacy exposes the worst of Brexit’s toxicity: namely, the casual, unabashed exceptionalism that places the enterprising British beyond the laws of gravity. Brexiters protest that our “clean break” departure on WTO rules will ensure that life continues as normal. The only thing that will break in this scenario is Britain’s economy and social contract.A no-deal Brexit will tear us from every EU law, instrument and agency overnight. We have nothing with which to replace them. Out of the European Aviation Safety Agency, no British plane or pilot will be certified or insured. Out of the single market and customs union, every British lorry will have to be checked at French ports for tariffs and standards, bringing cross-Channel traffic to a standstill. These outcomes are not only legal, but required. The WTO cannot and will not help.The first falsehood has birthed the second. Persuade enough people believe that a no-deal won’t amount to an unequivocal national breakdown, and it follows that we may actually end up doing it with public and parliamentary support. But the plan won’t work. We are not leaving without a deal under any circumstances.First, the political reasons. Chief among them, Theresa May. She will not accept a no-deal scenario. Everything she has done so far demonstrates her terror of it. The EU has called her bluff on the negotiation sequencing, orce payment, Irish backstop and transition terms, and to keep the show on the road she has blinked each time.Assume then that May folds and subsequently resigns. The new prime minister declares that no deal really is better than a bad deal. He or she needn’t come clean about the consequences: reality will step into the breach. Put simply, Britain will start shutting up shop by the new year. Tens of thousands of EU citizens will leave, manufacturers will make show-stopping announcements about the closure of businesses, and the pound will tumble. Can the new prime minister depend on voters’ enthusiastic embrace of an entirely voluntary and pointless Blitz spirit, or will they call for a climbdown?Imagine the political crisis escalates. The prime minister faces down public pressure to change course and has to confront parliament. Which brings us to the other key block for no-deal: parliamentary arithmetic.The UK could sign up to all the EU’s rules and regulations, staying in the single market – which provides free movement of goods, services and people – and the customs union, in which EU members agree tariffs on external states. Freedom of movement would continue and the UK would keep paying into the Brussels pot. We would continue to have unfettered access to EU trade, but the pledge to “take back control” of laws, borders and money\u0026nbspwould not have been fulfilled. This\u0026nbspis an unlikely outcome and one that may be possible only by reversing the Brexit decision, after a second referendum or election.Britain could follow Norway, which is in the single market, is subject to freedom of movement rules and pays a fee to Brussels – but is outside the customs union. That combination would tie Britain to EU regulations but allow it to sign trade deals of its own. A “Norway-minus” deal is more likely. That would see the UK leave the single market and customs union and end free movement of people. But Britain would align its rules and regulations with Brussels, hoping this would allow a greater degree of market access. The UK would still be subject to EU rules.A comprehensive trade deal like the one handed to Canada would help British traders, as it would lower or eliminate tariffs. But there would be little on offer for the UK services industry. It is a bad outcome for financial services. Such a deal would leave Britain free to erge from EU rules and regulations but that in turn would lead to border checks and the rise of other “non-tariff barriers” to trade. It would leave Britain free to forge new trade deals with other nations. Many in Brussels see this as a likely outcome, based on Theresa May’s direction so far.Britain leaves with no trade deal, meaning that all trade is governed by World Trade Organization rules. Tariffs would be high, queues at the border long and the Irish border issue severe. In the short term, British aircraft might be unable to fly to some European destinations. The UK would quickly need to establish bilateral agreements to deal with the consequences, but the country would be free to take whatever future direction it wishes. It may need to deregulate to attract international business – a very different future and a lot of disruption.Tory MPs have so far largely swallowed a hard Brexit they do not want. But a no-deal is an unprecedented catastrophe. Many shy rebels will draw the line at licensing national suicide on principle. Others will think more politically. A Tory government that sends the economy and livelihoods over the cliff will collapse the Tory party for a generation. Even MPs who would not save the country might opt to save themselves. Labour, for its part, declared a no-deal scenario its red line in the 2017 election manifesto. Even a handful of extra Tory rebels would break the government’s Brexit majority. After all, government whips last month threatened MPs that losing a key Brexit vote would trigger a general election, and still only won by six votes.Why then is May talking up the prospect of no-deal even when it remains inconceivable? This is the real “project fear”. She hopes that just enough talk of stockpiling food and medicine will blackmail just enough MPs into voting for her still-elusive EU deal. Far likelier is that she scares the public into supporting a new vote on Brexit, with the option of abandoning it altogether.The government and hard Brexiters are really engaging in niche games of cakeism. The government wants to scare us with talk of hardship without spelling out the full horror of no-deal. The Brexit fundamentalists prefer the more traditional Orwellian pursuit of promising no new border controls while simultaneously declaring we will take back control of our borders. The electorate will ultimately punish both sides for their duplicity.Both the no-deal fallacies originate in the biggest lie of all: that Britain’s putative greatness allows it to defy concrete reality. But in the first instance, we have built our interconnected economic life on the floor of EU agreements that a no-deal instantly cuts away. In the second, we lack the bargaining power, legal security or economic might to legitimise the threat either in Brussels or at home.Here then is the truth. National myth-making may feed our imaginations, but not our stomachs. We are, in reality, not so special. Any country will burn if you set fire to it. The prime minister may see fit to light the fuse, but so long as we live in a parliamentary democracy, MPs will have the power to confiscate the matches.• Jonathan Lis is deputy director of the thinktank British Influence"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5fe782423e60270aa02a23e7b516d78c57f2cc69/4_278_5068_3041/master/5068.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=66804d31e6daf0ac8a8c7c201a6a6c99","title":"people brexit brits government new political party","story":"I’ve always subscribed to Michelle Obama’s golden rule that when your opponent goes low, you go high. I don’t think one moment that we should sink to the levels of the Brexiters – the dodgy money, the electoral lawbreaking and the lying – but I do wonder if those of us who remain deeply concerned about the consequences of Brexit are really landing all the blows that we can.We need to, because the best interests of our country are at stake. If our generation fails to put up a proper fight, the generation that follows us will neither forgive nor forget, as theirs will be a diminished and, quite probably, dismantled United Kingdom. Leaving the EU is only the first phase of the Brexiter agenda to shake us free of the laws, rules and rights that many see as a constraint on the implementation of their frighteningly rightwing vision of Darwinian capitalism.What is the right strategy for those of us who oppose this? I remain unconvinced that it lies in a new political party. The EU referendum in 2016 amounted to a fight between a group of well-meaning career politicians and their professional advisers, and a collection of obsessive haters of the EU prepared to do whatever it took to win. It took us a while to get our act together in the remain corner, and too often we allowed ourselves the indulgence of arguing among ourselves, becoming preoccupied with what Vince Cable memorably described as the “narcissism of small differences”.This will only become worse if the rumours that some of the remain campaign groups are contemplating metamorphosing into political parties turn out to be true. I’m bored of the jostling for position by big egos, the confused messaging, and the outdated talk of both remainers and leavers. Although there are some very brave politicians in Westminster – some who have risked their personal safety to stand up to claims they are traitors, simply for arguing for what they think is in Britain’s best interests – the political classes have, by and large, let us down. Two ruthless party machines have done a very good job of stopping anyone from either side of our so-called debating chamber from asking awkward questions, or standing in the way of impending chaos.So I don’t see a new political party helping. Neither do we need a general election, where the Tories and the Labour party can only offer a choice of Brexit, Brexit and still more Brexit. I am not, I might add, about to enter the political fray myself as the leader of the Liberal Democrats, as was absurdly rumoured in the media last week (ignoring the fact that I am not even an MP).A clean vote on the real options is the only right and democratic way forward. Three options should be put to the public: the deal Theresa May negotiates, the special deal we already have with the EU (so cannily negotiated by Margaret Thatcher), or no deal. And given that Brexit supporter Jacob Rees-Mogg has conceded it could take 50 years to see any economic benefits, 16- and 17-year-olds should be allowed to vote, as Brexit’s negative consequences will be felt for most of their adult lives.The facts are now colliding with the soundbites and the personalities, and it is making for a bonfire of vanities. Both of our main parties face the real possibility of fracture if the people are not given the chance to have their say. We have had enough of decisions that are fundamental to our future – so many of them never even mentioned during the referendum campaign – being made without any reference to what the public thinks.The British are a people who are generally happy, under normal circumstances, to trust politicians to tell us the truth and to leave them to run the country as we get on with our lives. But we reserve the right, always, to make it clear that they are our servants, not our masters, and, when necessary, we can and will take charge. We now wish to exercise that right with a referendum on the options facing Britain once the prime minister has negotiated her deal.• Gina Miller was the lead claimant in the successful legal fight to allow parliament to vote on whether the UK could start the process of leaving the EU"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98532698a3fc71224b0f85a4e5fa461bc4900d1f/0_467_3234_1940/master/3234.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1bd651a04166be74a0042db947210cb4","title":"monty python amorous pink knight unseen sketches revealed","story":"Material from Michael Palin’s archives was written for Holy Grail but they had too many ideas to get in one movieUnseen sketches from Monty Python have been discovered in the archives of Michael Palin.The comedy group of Palin, Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle and Terry Jones produced their last film 35 years ago but boxes of material have now emerged, according to the Times.The material, deposited at the British Library in 2017, has been revealed to contain unused script ideas including two sketches written for Monty Python and the Holy Grail.One of the sketches is about a Wild West bookshop while another features an “amorous Pink Knight”. They will go on display to the public along with more than 50 notebooks containing notes on two of the Pythons’ films, Holy Grail and Life Of Brian. Material deemed controversial at the time was reportedly discarded and would still be seen as too risque today.Palin, 75, has given permission for the sketches to be reproduced and admitted the group often produced more material than was needed.“Sometimes you have things like that. I can’t think why it wasn’t used. The Holy Grail took shape gradually and at the beginning it had far more ideas in it than ended up on screen because you had to have a narrative. In the end the story of the knights was strong enough.”The archive s the writer, actor, comedian and TV presenter’s literary and creative life for more than 20 years, from 1965 to 1987.On Monday Cleese suggested the reason Monty Python’s Flying Circus is no longer regularly shown on TV is because it’s “too funny” compared with modern comedies.

Some of them, too, are sadly no longer with us, such as New York’s CBGB, or may not count as music venues in the formal sense at all – the street corners of the Bronx, Brooklyn, Compton and suburban Atlanta that gave birth to hip-hop come to mind. Whatever your taste or level of music-nerdery may be, one thing is for sure: the seven venues below have all at some point provided the setting for significant moments in US cultural history.To New Yorkers, Madison Square Garden holds a singular place in the city’s imagination. Known to them simply as “the Garden”, this 20,000 capacity venue describes itself, modestly, as “the most famous arena in the world”. Ordinarily, such a claim would hardly be credible but, in the case of Madison Square Garden, it’s more than justified. Consider this: since the current arena opened its doors in 1968 – there had been three previous public venues occupying the same site since 1879 – the Garden has hosted a number of the greatest shows in the history of popular music, including George Harrison’s Concert for Bangladesh in 1971 Parliament Funkadelic’s legendary sold-out shows of 1977 and 1978 and, more recently, LCD Soundsystem’s final (or, as it turned out, not so final) show in 2011, which was released the following year as the groundbreaking concert film Shut Up and Play the Hits. It might also be worth mentioning that while the Garden doesn’t have an official house act, that bloke from across the Hudson who goes by the name of Bruce Springsteen has played the venue no less than 47 times. The most famous arena in the world? They’re probably right.If Madison Square Garden is the premier indoor concert venue in the US, then Colorado’s Red Rocks Amphitheatre would have to be its most spectacular outdoor musical locale. Framed by an enormous angled rock on one side, with stunning views of the rugged mountain terrain on the other, Red Rocks’ unparalleled outdoor setting has been used to a striking effect in concert films over the years, including U2 Live at Red Rocks: Under a Blood Red Sky and Neil Young’s Red Rocks Live. With a capacity of almost 10,000, the otherworldly arena has also hosted legendary performances by REM, Stevie Nicks and, on what must have been a particularly psychedelic night in 1968, Jimi Hendrix and the Soft Machine. This year, its programme of events includes appearances by Jackson Browne, Seal and the Colorado Philharmonic Orchestra, as well as every rapper’s favourite rapper, that inimitable Brooklyn native, Nas.Instantly recognisable for its “shell” of concentric arches over the stage, the Hollywood Bowl is to Angelenos what Madison Square Garden is to New Yorkers. Set in the bowels of the Hollywood Hills – with the Hollywood sign perched not far off in the background – the list of notable pop and rock performances here is too exhaustive to detail, hosting over the years the Beatles, the Doors (both of whom recorded live albums at the site), Kraftwerk, Prince, Black Sabbath and Dolly Parton. But the 17,500 capacity venue isn’t just famous for its live shows this being Hollywood, it has also featured as a location in films as varied as Some Kind of Wonderful, Beaches and Escape From LA.Perhaps no other continuously operating venue in the US has such a mythical status for its role in the history and development of one style of music as the Village Vanguard does for jazz. All of the greats (and by that we do mean all) recorded and performed here over the years: Coltrane, Davis, Mingus, Monk, Rollins, Evans, Brubeck, Baker … the list goes on. And for this reason, the Village Vanguard might just be the No 1 place of pilgrimage for jazz lovers in the world. But it is by no means for jazz buffs alone this intimate, 120-seat venue offers an authentic taste of an older New York – as a much a place to sit back with a good martini, take in the portraits of the legends that line the walls and imagine the curlicues of smoke that once rose from the tables and gave this tiny basement club the hazy ambience that jazz venues the world over have sought to replicate.If Nashville is the home of country music, then the closest thing it has to an exact address would be 2,804 Opryland Drive, where you’ll find Grand Ole Opry – a venue that holds roughly the same significance for lovers of country music as the Village Vanguard does for jazz. But the Grand Ole Opry is a little bit more than a music venue: taking its name from the weekly concert radio performance, it is also the longest radio broadcast in US history, having first hit the airwaves in 1925, moving between Nashville locations before finally settling in its current, purpose-built venue in 1974. The great names of country and western, from Johnny Cash to Loretta Lynn, and Garth Brooks to Patsy Cline, have all been regulars at the Opry, and some 215 acts have held a coveted Opry membership (a sure sign that you’ve “made it” as a country star) at some point in their careers.Possibly the coolest venue in the US that you’ve never heard of, Pappy \u0026amp Harriet’s is a dusty saloon bar located in the depths of California’s cowboy country, on the fringe of Joshua Tree national park. The stature and notoriety of Pappy \u0026amp Harriet’s has grown rapidly in recent years, since becoming the venue of choice for many an artist booked at the nearby Coachella festival to play a secret little show of their own on the side. Queens of the Stone Age, Spiritualized, Sonic Youth, Lorde and – pause – Paul McCartney have all passed through for a jam at some point. Oh, and it’s also home to a fully preserved cowboy and western film set out the back, complete with the facades of a local bank, chapel and saloon, which served as the location for dozens of films and television programmes in its 1950s heyday.No list of the US’s great music venues would be complete without at least one entry from New Orleans – and given that it is the home of the legendary Preservation Hall, competition was stiff. But we all know that they do things a little bit differently south of the Mason-Dixon line, and nowhere down south does that hold truer than in New Orleans, so it only seems fitting to choose Kermit’s Treme Mother-in-Law Lounge – one of the most magnificently eccentric music spots in the city. Set up by 60s R\u0026ampB legend and self-proclaimed “emperor of the universe” Ernie K-Doe, the lounge hosts local jazz, funk and legendarily swampy Louisiana blues performances week in, week out, and is as famous for the mind-bending murals that adorn its exterior walls as it is for its raucous shows and southern soul food.United Airlines flies from four UK airports to key US hubs, with onward connections to more than 280 destinations across the Americas.

Check out their historic taproom for a glass of Tivoli Helles Lager, a favourite of the early pioneers, which is still poured to this day.Wynkoop Brewing Company Established in 1988, this is Colorado’s first craft brewpub, and still one of its best and most notorious. Try their Rocky Mountain Oyster Stout, brewed with its namesake (bull’s testicles to you and me the region has no oysters).Ratio Beerworks Set up by a trio of former 90s punk rock touring musicians, this industrial-style taproom in the hip RiNo (River North) Arts District has taken the Denver craft beer scene by storm. Expect slick brews, a sweet patio and one of the coolest live music, arts and event line-ups in the city.

This is how the trainer ended up on the front row, how the Ikea Frakta bag went from the car boot to the catwalk and how slip dresses slipped into Céline’s spring 2016 collection.But rarely does it encourage you to extend the wear of things you already own. Still, these are desperate times. We can’t and shouldn’t keep buying new clothes simply because of the weather. And if last weekend’s rain brought with it a mix of flooding and respite from the heat, it also bought us time to gear up for the second wave. Because a new reign of hot terror is coming! And this time we need to be prepared – so get ready to wear your swimsuit as daywear.Unpacking this trend, which you may be doing if you are on holiday, is simpler than it sounds. For one, a swimsuit is designed to be both wet and dry, which is good for the hot human body since most don’t show up sweat. And while this is not a trend for the office, the headline is misleadingly daft: fashion writers talk about day-to-night dressing (how to dress for a temperature drop without bringing a whole extra outfit to work) a lot. Amphibious dressing is simply beach-to-street dressing.The roll call of evidence is already pretty convincing. Topshop suggests you wear its textured swimsuits “beyond the beach”. Cossie + Co, a new brand that sells proper one-piece swimsuits in grown-up colours, are also “not reserved for the beach”. Zara, meanwhile, has styled a white swimsuit with a pencil skirt fit for the boardroom.A recent image of Julie Pelipas, fashion director of Vogue Ukraine, wearing a “swimsuit-like top” and loose trousers was declared “the most perfect outfit of the summer” by the fashion blog Man Repeller. In a recent article, the New York Times suggested pairing the bestselling swimsuit from a new collaboration between Staud and Solid \u0026amp Striped with Levi’s jeans. And then there’s Alexa Chung, who posted a swimsuit-and-denim skirt selfie last Friday on Instagram Stories with the caption: “Swimwear as workwear was the only option.” When something becomes normalised by Chung, it is usually here to stay.Perhaps we could have seen it coming after Marni “superimposed” a swimsuit shape on to a dress in its current collection. And we have certainly seen a version of this before, with underwear worn as outerwear, a trend explored by Rihanna and Beyoncé that has become so pervasive it now has its own Wikipedia page. Wearing your swimsuit as a top is probably an extension of this.Huddart says she has seen the firm’s swimsuits “take on a erse new role – worn as much off the beach as on”. Natascha Wittgenstein, founder of new Swedish brand Tooshie, concurs (although she prefers the word “multitaskers” when talking about wearing hers out at night). Still, they agree this is an era of textured swimsuits. As Huddart says: “A swimsuit no longer means just that.”These are weird times for swimsuits. While Love Island messed with their very essence (contestants’ swimsuits this year had enough cut-outs to trigger trypophobia), the one-piece recently came under scrutiny after the Miss America pageant announced it will eliminate one of the most contentious aspects of the competition: the swimsuit round.If underwear continues to be a battleground about primal sexuality, then it’s time for swimwear to take on a new role."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3aa0df8988ab16a5e8a8df3ec529650b1348f71d/33_0_872_523/master/872.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=01c17d3344d063d5117a5751ba10b779","title":"never goin back review augustin frizzell","story":"In director Augustine Frizzell’s debut feature, a pair of pot-smoking 17-year-olds make a delightful mess of a planned vacation to the beaches of Texas“You are I are going on this trip,” says one fledgling but comfortably stoned almost-17 year-old to another in Augustine Frizzell’s debut feature Never Goin’ Back. “And we’re going to kiss some motherfucking dolphins, smoke some motherfucking ganja, and eat some motherfucking donuts.” The trip in question is a weekend getaway to the beaches of Galveston, Texas. The stoner teens are Angela and Jessie, best friends, roommates and colleagues who may or may not kiss the dolphins but will surely smoke the ganja.Never Goin’ Back, indie distributor A24’s new mumblecore, millennial buddy comedy, stars newcomers Maia Mitchell and Camila Morrone as the aforementioned besties, a word that doesn’t sufficiently describe the depths of their kinship – even if it’s what they’d call themselves. The two live together watch porn together light up together rail lines of coke together draw dicks on each other’s faces attempt amateur heists and wait tables at the Buttermilk Cafe, where they’re loading up on shifts so they can afford that weekend trip to Galveston to celebrate Jessie’s 17th. There’s not much more to the plot than that, but it works precisely because of its slightness: for these freewheeling, high-school dropouts, a weekend on the Gulf coast is a sojourn of Eat, Pray, Love proportions, and they’ve already blown next month’s rent to make it happen.There’s a romantic seediness to the film, which avoids condescending its subjects or trafficking in Gen-Z tropes while still ringing true. Jessie’s brother Dustin, a kind of wannabe Lil Peep, sells weed and talks with what he seems to think are gangster affects. Jessie and Angela, meanwhile, speak the jargon of the iGeneration – “I will literally die” and “boujee-ass vacation” and “What the fuck is a collect call?” – but are not the 2000s babies you read about in Refinery29 money diaries. They’re a clever, slightly bemused, quasi-industrious duo, as committed to one another as they are weed, donuts, and mild juvenile delinquency. In Mitchell, one sees traces of Emma Stone, particularly her early work like Superbad and Easy-A. The 21-year-old Morrone, affixed with a bronzed scowl, brings to mind the devil-may-care cool of Emma Roberts.Frizzell, who’s given her young actors a smart, acid-tongued screenplay to work with, is just as savvy a director, resisting the urge to freshen up the film’s harsh environs with sepia-tones and sunlight. Set mostly in strip malls, diners and dilapidated apartment complexes in the American south, Never Goin’ Back evokes some of A24’s most critically acclaimed releases – like Moonlight and The Florida Project – plus more obvious thematic analogs like Spring Breakers and Gia Coppola’s Palo Alto. But Frizzell doesn’t give her film quite as much of an arty polish, perhaps because much of it’s pulled from her own plucky teenage years in north Texas and a similar short film, of the exact same name, that preceded this one.But naturalism, even when stylized, comes with a cost. And about two-thirds of the way through Never Goin’ Back, Frizzell seems to have wanted to pre-empt accusations of plotlessness by making too much happen in the final act, a natural if counterintuitive reflex when a film’s pleasures have less to do with action than atmosphere. An unnecessary subplot involving Dustin and his bros collides with Jessie and Angela, who have managed to make a royal mess of their clothing, bank accounts, and vacation plans. Mitchell and Morrone possess such a natural rapport that it’s fun to watch them mess up. But the same can’t be said of Dustin and his buddies Brandon and Cedric, the gang of misfits who orbit around them.Watching Never Goin’ Back, it’s easy to see the frames of reference Frizzell pulled from, besides her own teenage escapades. But the film also defies easy categorization it’s not consistently funny enough to be a comedy, nor lively enough to be a drama. Moreover, its two leads are not characters we see on film all that often: young women, in financially precarious terrain, who are dictated not by men or professional ambition or big-city dreams or parental pressures but by their hedonistic whims: pot, donuts, bikinis, the beach. Men, of literally all ages, have been following those exact whims on screen for decades. Which is why Never Goin’ Back, despite clear influences in both style and tone, feels so fresh."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25baaa41892d8a49bc539337579a15abc14e7ddc/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8da2df8e42101687b5690162f45f3b9b","title":"manchester united women liverpool inaugural match","story":"Manchester United women’s first game following their inception earlier this year will be against Liverpool as the fixture list for the new season was unveiled on Wednesday.United face their Merseyside rivals in Group Two North of the Continental League Cup on 19 August.

Beating a Real Madrid side who have just begun their own preparations for the new campaign means little in the grand scheme of things yet for Mourinho, who made few friends and even more enemies in Spain during a typically tempestuous three-year spell, it perhaps carried a touch more significance than most of these tune-up encounters.Excellent first half goals from Alexis Sànchez and Ander Herrera placed United firmly in control of a game they deserved to win against, it must be said, undercooked opponents who barely got out of first gear until the second half. Karim Benzema’s 45th-minute strike gave the predominantly Madrid supporting crowd of around 64,000 here something to get excited about, yet it was not enough.The Old Trafford manager would have been pleased to see Sànchez looking near to his busy, creative best while there was an assured first start for Brazilian midfielder Fred. Herrera and Juan Mata also impressed. It has, nevertheless, been an extremely long two weeks in the US for Mourinho – this was their first victory in regulation play (Milan were defeated on penalties in Los Angeles last week) – who has reverted to miserable type with aplomb.“I didn’t learn anything (from this tour),” Mourinho said. “I know what Herrera, Mata and Sànchez are, I know the kids are very young and need time to grow up. The boys gave everything and we tried to fight for the best result, but tactically it means nothing.”The Portuguese will be delighted to get back to Manchester although whether the problems which have blighted a tempestuous pre-season will be solved before the start of the Premier League season remains to be seen. The absence of Anthony Martial continues to prompt questions, and when asked again whether the Frenchman would return to join the team in Manchester, Mourinho said, “I don’t know.”The manager’s travails, which came to the fore last weekend in Michigan with an astonishing broadside against some of his own players while privately fuming with executive vice chairman Ed Woodward’s lack of transfer activity, would certainly have raised a smile in the Real Madrid ranks. The 55 year-old never felt truly loved during a rollercoaster spell at the Bernabéu from 2010 to 2013 which saw everything unravel in true Mourinho style – falling out with almost everyone before heading for the nearest exit door with a knowing grimace.His situation at Old Trafford is yet to reach that kind of meltdown level though new signings – a central defender and a winger are his priority – are needed to diffuse unhappiness and breed confidence ahead of what promises to be a testing campaign trying to keep free-flowing Manchester City at bay. This was United’s fifth game of this trip but for Real, a visit to Hard Rock Stadium was the first of a three-match International Champions Cup schedule which sees further encounters with Juventus and Roma.With David de Gea making his first appearance since returning from a post-World Cup break and new signing Fred, the Brazilian midfielder who cost £52m this summer from Shakhtar Donetsk, enjoying his first start, at least Mourinho was able to see some of the 12 key first team players who have missed most of this trip return to action. There was, of course, no Cristiano Ronaldo on show for Real following his move to Juventus, so it was left to Gareth Bale and Benzema to produce the kind of star quality an expectant crowd at the home of the Miami Dolphins came to see. The Madrid pair teamed up early on, the Welshman starting a move which saw the French striker shoot past the post from close range.Fred acquitted himself well as United began to get a foothold in the game and on 18 minutes, Sànchez swept them ahead. It was a passage of play which could have even made Mourinho smile – Herrera sent Matteo Darmian free on the right and the Italian’s cross was steered in by the Chilean forward. It was a superb move yet the one which followed nine minutes later, was arguably better. Darmian lifted the ball to Mata and once the Spaniard had regained his composure he crossed for Sànchez who was able to ert the ball into the path of Herrera. His finish was precise and clinical. Bale curled wide soon after yet Madrid’s attacks were so sporadic, it was a surprise to see them pull one back just moments before the end of the first half, Benzema steering in an excellent Theo Hernández cross.Bale, a one time target for Mourinho, was withdrawn for the second half as Julen Lopetegui shuffled his pack and one of the substitutes introduced, Martin Ødegaard, should have levelled on 56 minutes when he blazed over the bar from eight yards. The young Norwegian also saw a free-kick saved by De Gea on 73 minutes but Mourinho’s side held firm. Now, however, the hard work really begins."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1128091a89915ea21f86329448df5322fdc9334f/0_143_3827_2297/master/3827.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35a3f8b50dff342162b010f8d80ae823","title":"premier league preview 2018 19 cardiff city","story":"Neil Warnock will shrug off predictions that his promoted side will make an instant return to the Championship writers’ predicted position: 20th (NB: this is not necessarily Ben Fisher’s prediction but the average of our writers’ tips)Last season’s position: 2nd in ChampionshipOdds to win the league (via Oddschecker): 2000-1He owns a 1958 Massey Ferguson tractor, loves Motown, enjoys watching Downton Abbey with a glass of red wine and is a qualified chiropodist (an in-growing toenail specialist). Now, for the fifth time, one of the game’s most loved – and loathed – pantomime villains is back on the big stage. An old-school manager, Neil Warnock is determined to ruffle a few feathers on his return to the Premier League with Cardiff City.If he could keep them afloat in the top flight, Warnock has said that then might be a good time to get off the giddying juggernaut and, at last, on to his beloved tractor, that goes by the name of Gladys, stationed at the family home in Cornwall, between the towns of Launceston and Callington. It will be a big ask – they are odds-on favourites for relegation – not that he cares. “We were 33‑1 this year to get in the play-offs, let alone win promotion,” he said. “So we’re going to enjoy it. We know we’re up against it.”Whatever happens, it certainly will not be dull. After a spicy FA Cup meeting in January, there will be Guardiola v Warnock, part II and III, for starters. Cardiff meandered through the muck and nettles, as Warnock put it, of the Championship to toast an unlikely feat, bewitching and bullying opposition along the way. He questioned referee Mike Jones’s preparation for a Severnside derby in November, doubted Derby County’s motive for postponing their match due to snow in March, and, a month later, he memorably repeatedly told Nuno Espírito Santo to “fuck off” after the Portuguese made a belated attempt to shake hands. By May, the captain Sean Morrison was dancing, the Welsh capital was partying, while the Malaysian owner, Vincent Tan, once despised by fans was hoisted aloft by a sea of blue – not red – as Warnock looked on, showered in champagne. He’d done it again.Getting them here, via a record eighth promotion, Warnock says, is his biggest achievement yet. But keeping them there would surely top the lot. The marmite Yorkshireman turns 70 in December, by which point Cardiff’s season could already be defined. Cardiff’s last Premier League sojourn, in 2013-14, was short-lived after a disastrous season ended with the team rock-bottom and relegated. Only Aron Gunnarsson remains from then and, with Warnock at the helm, they will be anything but naïve this time around.Their start is relatively kind, too, with their first three matches comprising of Bournemouth, Newcastle United and Huddersfield Town. They will be sterner tests than those presented to them over the start of pre-season, though. Cardiff racked up a 6-1 win over Tavistock AFC before an 11-1 cakewalk against Bodmin Town. “People said to me, ‘are you going to the Far East or America?’ and I said: ‘No, no, we’re going to Cornwall. I prefer team bonding rather than globe-trotting and having to overcome travel fatigue.”Warnock prides himself on making something out of nothing, rehashing others’ leftovers, more often than not revitalising careers he once described his man-management as akin to agony aunt Marjorie Proops. “He gives you the tools to be the best version of you,” Morrison said. “He works out what your best job is, what you are good at and doesn’t try to change you into something that you are not. He embraces what you are and gets the best out of you that way.”Junior Hoilett is among those to have reaped the fruits of Warnock’s efforts, with the winger following his manager through the door after his appointment in October 2016. Last season, his struggles with form and fitness vanished as he proved a constant menace, scoring 11 goals. And more often than not, on the other wing in the manager’s preferred 4-2-3-1 was Nathaniel Mendez-Laing, a broad-shouldered forward with explosive pace, also a free transfer. “I know that I can get things out of players that possibly nobody else can,” the Cardiff manager said. “I love seeing some of my players – the ones who have been discarded by someone else – pick up man of the match or player of the season. I get a kick out of seeing my players going through brick walls for me, not opening my bank balance.”Promotion has enabled Tan and the chief executive, Ken Choo, to loosen the purse-strings a little but it has hardly been a summer blowout. Cardiff have spent almost £30m on beefing up their squad with four Championship arrivals. By top-flight standards, it is pennies. Warnock has suggested their budget is half that of Huddersfield’s. Alex Smithies, Bobby Reid, Greg Cunningham and Josh Murphy have 11 Premier League games under their belt between them, so they do not necessarily offer an abundance of top-level experience but Cunningham, a marauding left-back, and Reid, a revelation after being reinvented as a striker at Bristol City, are intriguing buys. The former, a Manchester City academy graduate and long-term target for Warnock, excelled over three years at Preston North End, establishing himself as a reliable performer and deputising as captain last season.Reid’s upward trajectory has been more sudden after a breakout season in which he weighed in with 26 goals and assists combined, the second-most in the ision. A relentless runner who has developed predatory instincts, he shone against both Manchester clubs in a brilliant cup run last season, hard evidence of how he can send top-flight defenders dizzy. For Reid, on the books at his hometown club for 18 years, a £10m move across the Severn Bridge to test himself at the highest level was ultimately just too good to turn down.Along with Murphy, who could face his twin Jacob, of Newcastle, as early as August, Warnock will hope he has added enough firepower to take the burden off Kenneth Zohore, who is not the most prolific of strikers. In midfield, they boast experience in the shape of the Iceland captain Gunnarsson, while Joe Ralls was arguably the most underrated performer in the second tier last season. Ralls joined the club at the age of 16 after being spotted playing for Farnborough Town but, eight years on, is the team’s beating heart, though he also has a knack for arriving late in the opposition box. Defensively, they are gloriously stubborn, though it remains to be seen how Morrison’s watertight partnership with Sol Bamba, the cumbersome centre-back Warnock insisted deadpan was a better defender than Virgil van Dijk, copes with the step up."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db395978ad1bef6be6669cfdb44a7f3404226ea4/0_0_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7191d7d497e289ecf55b6246e348002","title":"france croatia final trophy russia 2018 ends on high world cup football daily","story":"Max and co discuss France’s World Cup final triumph over Croatia, another penalty, another controversial VAR incident, the tournament’s highs and lows and players taking shots to the conkers"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5eb2cd8f643af333efef066ccb9eb781f3062e0/0_144_2219_1331/master/2219.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b27f939f121ec3efb6c0ad433dce6977","title":"manchester united jose mourinho reality show","story":"In 2007, coinciding with the moment David Beckham made his debut for LA Galaxy, I was at their Home Depot Center ground in Los Angeles to watch José Mourinho’s Chelsea compete in something called the World Series of Soccer. Don’t look for this competition – they don’t play it anymore. As part of their US summer tour, Chelsea beat LA Galaxy in the last match, though the competition was won on goal difference by – hang on, let me get my reading glasses on – Tigres UANL. Suwon Samsung Bluewings finished fourth.It has been so unbelievably and immensely long since I slightly loved Mourinho that even mentioning this vignette feels like exhuming a Paleolithic artefact, turning it over in your hands and thinking: Ugh. This is dirty and I have no idea what it is or ever was.Anyhow. I think the vague point is that no one could watch Mourinho on Manchester United’s summer tour in the US this year, and think anything other than what an endlessly sour bore he is. If Mourinho once felt like the ironist puppeteer at moments like this, he has long commuted down into the proverbial messy bitch who lives for the drama.This (if slightly paraphrased) appears to be the verdict of some United players, who are reportedly briefing that they are finding the manager’s behaviour “exhausting” and that he is “dragging the whole tour down”. His demeanour is certainly weighing down many United fans, who are facing up to the fear it may well be their turn to endure one of Mourinho’s famous third seasons at a club.If your reaction to this is the Alan Partridge “so what?” gesture, catch up. Ed is on precisely the same page as United’s managing director, Richard Arnold, who has characterised the club as “the biggest TV show in the world”. A few years ago, the ’s Ken Early noted Arnold declaring triumphantly that United had “recently surpassed the social media following of Vin Diesel and were closing on Rihanna.”“If you think about why people watch soap operas,” enthused Arnold, “it’s what will happen next. That uncertainly is part of what makes sport exciting.” All these things considered, Mourinho was the perfect hire – a classic soap a who creates #content seemingly reflexively.It seems baffling that these particular executives have failed to monetise Mourinho with some sort of fly-on-the-wall reality series, particularly now the window may be rapidly closing. For all their postmodernist bluster, perhaps, United’s top brass are still some way behind the proper monsters of unscripted television. They have a lot to learn from, say, Mike Darnell – a US TV executive responsible for a welter of smash hits down the years, as well as controversial shows such as Who’s Your Daddy? in which an adult adoptee had to pick her biological father from a lineup.Darnell’s sole regret about that show was that all the outrage generated “was outside the programme – so it doesn’t translate into ratings”. Remember: it doesn’t matter if people think your product is trashy or repulsive or morally bankrupt, as long as you are able to alchemise their anger into ratings gold. (This, you will have noted, is a formula which has now taken the biggest reality star of that era all the way to a highly sought after address in Pennsylvania Avenue.)Something for Woodward and Arnold to bear in mind on their eternal quest to take things to “the next level” commercially. If rushed into production now, an unscripted reality Mourinho series would certainly have the ability to reach beyond the product’s existing customer base, or “Manchester United supporters” as they used to be known. Call it Keeping Up With The KarKrashing One – and give us at least three weeks of unmissable histrionics before its star walks out."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3cc91a218dfbcbb96fd499bf6bdc44d5a0c51233/0_1150_7129_4277/master/7129.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=66dc20daf25d2d2d0697efae15aa3ebd","title":"how to make seafood paella recipe masterclass","story":"It may not be the traditional Valencian way, but follow these steps for a surefire crowdpleaserConfirmed as Spain’s best-loved contribution to world cuisine by its elevation to the emoji canon in 2016, the subsequent controversy over the virtual paella’s ingredients sums up the fierce pride Valencianos take in their famous rice dish.

Stir well until all the grains are coated with liquid and the rice sits in an even layer.Pour in 400ml of the warm prawn stock plus the saffron and its soaking water. Stir, bring to a boil and simmer for 10 minutes without any further stirring, then arrange the monkfish, mussels and peeled prawn on top of the rice, pushing them down well into it but otherwise leaving it undisturbed.Continue cooking, still without stirring, for about eight minutes, keeping a wary eye on the pan – if it begins to look very dry before the rice has cooked through completely, then add the rest of the warm prawn stock, bearing in mind the finished dish shouldn’t be at all soupy or wet: indeed, there should be a crunchy crust on the bottom.Cover the pan with foil, turn off the heat and leave to rest for 10 minutes (paella tastes better warm than hot). Remove the foil and garnish with chopped parsley and wedges of lemon. Paella is also sometimes served with aioli (traditionally made with just garlic, olive oil and salt), though good garlic mayo would also work well.If seafood doesn’t float your boat, swap the prawn stock for a good chicken one and saute chunks of chicken andor rabbit (ideally bone-in) in place of the monkfish or use a meat-free stock and veg of your choice instead.

I am a student and need it to pay my rent. I recently used Viagogo to buy two tickets for George Benson at the Royal Albert Hall. I guess I am a victim of its hard sell as the site reminds customers tickets are selling fast. Their face value was £75 but only after completing did I realise they had cost £430. I have been told by staff at the Royal Albert Hall that the majority of its high-value tickets were sold directly to an inidual on Amazon who used Viagogo to resell at a huge premium. I purchased tickets for the rugby autumn international Ireland v New Zealand from Viagogo. I believed I was paying €390 for five tickets and was constantly under pressure on the site with countdown clocks. It was only when I confirmed the purchase that I realised the cost was €2,400 for the tickets that haven’t even been released yet. Viagogo’s apparent brazenness has been breathtaking and, so far, it’s managed to profit with impunity.In April the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) threatened it with legal action for failing to comply with its demands that it make its pricing more transparent.A month later, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) reported it to National Trading Standards for similar defiance.The company has been cocking a snook at regulators since 2015 when the CMA ordered it to display the face value of tickets it was reselling. It didn’t. In 2017 the ASA told it to make its exorbitant fees and delivery charges clear at the start of the transaction. It didn’t.Until recently, the final cost price of a ticket, including Viagogo’s fees, did not appear until the completion stages when customers were about to pay – resulting in some overlooking the total. This month, however, over a month after ASA’s deadline for compliance, it has started specifying add-on fees beneath the advertised ticket price, albeit in faded grey eclipsed by the lurid countdown clocks.However, it has still failed to respond to the CMA’s demands that it identify sellers, make clear the face value of tickets and warn customers that some venues do not accept tickets from secondary ticket websites.The CMA is also concerned about the countdown clocks that hasten customers into a transaction before they’ve digested the small print.The Royal Albert Hall says that the show’s promoter allocated tickets in PR’s row to Amazon, as it was a legitimate agency for the show. “It appears a member of the public purchased them and then resold on Viagogo,” it says. “We do everything in our power to prevent tickets from being bought for resale, and are very clear fans should avoid firms like Viagogo.” Amazon ceased operating as a ticket agency in March.Viagogo has not responded to requests for a comment.If you need help email Anna Tims at your.problems@observer or write to Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.

And so he should, given he is one of the last old record guys – the kind who came up when rock’n’roll was the thing, who worked in the Brill Building, who talks about songs and records rather than streams and monetisation. The kind of guy who signed the Ramones and Madonna.His conversation is littered with the names of old labels and the men who ran them, the stanzas of a romance that is now dusty and forgotten. King, Chess, Imperial Don Robey, Art Rupe, Lew Chudd. “Lew had, in my opinion, the greatest man in rhythm and blues at the time, Fats Domino,” he says. “He had one of the greatest country artists: Slim Whitman. And he had one of the first rock’n’roll teen idols: Ricky Nelson. What a spread!”Stein is 76 now and the author of a wildly entertaining new autobiography. Siren Song, detailing a career that began with him travelling into Manhattan from Brooklyn to help compile the Billboard charts when he was still in his early teens, and continues today: he’s still president of Sire, the company he set up in 1966 (it was swallowed by Warner Bros in 1977).“If you want to get into the business, get in when you’re young,” he says – when he was 15, his parents allowed him to go to Cincinnati to spend the summer living with and learning the record trade from Syd Nathan. “He told my father I had to be in the music business, otherwise I’d be a failure, because I had shellac in my veins.” Stein was always more entranced by the songs than the singers. In Siren Song, he writes of realising he was gay in his teens and knowing it had to be a secret. “It was only when the music began flowing through me that I could feel something medicinal happening,” he writes.“What attracts me to a band is their music, their songs,” he tells me. “I don’t look for how good they are with their musicianship. That will definitely improve and can improve. I’ve never gone after a big band they’re all young bands I’m after. You have to see what’s in the songs. Musicianship can always improve, but at least a germ of the songwriting has to be there from the start.”For the first decade or so of its existence, Sire was by Stein’s account a fairly precarious operation (though secure enough to enable him to buy an apartment overlooking Central Park). It had hits largely by licensing records from Europe that no other American label was interested in, striking gold by picking up the rights for the entire world – bar Holland – for Focus’s bizarre yodelling prog-rock song Hocus Pocus, which became a worldwide hit in 1973. He had wanted to release a record by Jan Akkerman, but EMI’s Dutch outpost told Stein: “‘He’s joined his old band Focus. They’re not doing very much, they don’t have a deal, they’re playing the background for Hair.’ I jumped on a plane and I met them and I signed them. That became my first million-selling album. Without that, we might not have been around a few years later.”Though Stein knew he was gay, in 1971 he married Linda Adler in what was, as Siren Song makes plain, a fairly tumultuous relationship. Why did he marry in the first place? “I didn’t dislike women,” he says. “I just preferred men. I guess some of it might have had to do with being raised as an Orthodox Jew. Family was always so important, and I wanted a family. I felt it very important to pass on and continue the link. Linda was not the only woman I went out with, but she was the one I felt most compatible with. There were some really nice women, but Linda and I kinda hit it off. We fought a lot, battled back and forth. But we got married, had two lovely daughters.” In Siren Song, Stein is upfront about not being a great father, and Linda being more interested in being a socialite. Did he think he could somehow have a “normal” family life? “Who’s to say what’s normal? I’m still here. I’ve got a family. Sometimes normal sounds boring. Sometimes I wish I wasn’t as crazy as I am, I will say that. Life’s been good to me. I have very few regrets.”Stein’s enduring reputation began in 1975, when the Ramones became the first of a string of New York punk bands who joined the label, followed by Talking Heads, the Dead Boys, and Richard Hell and the Voidoids. Then he began signing the best British underground bands for the US: the Smiths, Echo and the Bunnymen, and Depeche Mode (whom he picked up after taking an $8,000 Concorde flight to London, then travelling straight to Basildon to see them in a club). It must have required a wide variety of interpersonal skills to work with people as different as the street hustling Dee Dee Ramone, the bookish and reserved David Byrne, and the, well, Morrisseyesque Morrissey, I suggest. “I don’t call them skills. I don’t change hats: ‘Give me my David Byrne hat!’ I’m the same person. Even by the time I started Sire, I had been around the music business for many years, and many of the stars I had been aware of as a kid, they were gone. I knew that some of them would have very, very short careers and so I felt empathy, I felt an obligation to go out of my way to help artists. I’m sure I’ve screwed up a couple of times, but most of the time I’ve tried to look out as much as possible for the artist.”His greatest commercial success was Madonna, whom he signed from his hospital bed in 1982, while being treated for the heart condition subacute endocarditis. “She was a study. I could see how ambitious she was. How strong she was. People ask me: ‘Did you know she was going to be ‘Madonna’? Of course, I didn’t know how big she was gonna be, but I knew she was gonna go pretty far. I’ve never met anyone like her in my whole life. I believed in her and I wrestled to get her signed very, very quickly.” Which entailed a battle with the head of Warner, Mo Ostin – Siren Song’s villain – who did not want Stein spending more of his money.Sire is not what it once was it couldn’t be. It is a little imprint within Warner that has a handful of artists, none of them stars. That it exists at all is probably a courtesy to the last of the great old record men. But his golden run from the mid-70s to the mid-80s – when he had the best ears in the business – marked Stein as Sire and Sire as Stein. That is the age that gave him a name that people who love music recognise. “I don’t believe there are any geniuses in our business,” Stein says. “Maybe there are a few. I’m not among them, I can assure you of that. I have good ears, I’m a hard worker and I love what I do. Don’t make me out to be more than I am.”He stops. Then adds an afterword: “Don’t make me out to be less than I am, either!” This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Last week, when he went to Berlin, he said there was “a risk of a no deal by accident”. He said much the same yesterday, as he went to Paris and said the possibility of a no deal was “increasing by the day”. And today, after meeting his Austrian counterpart Karin Kneissl in Vienna, he said in a tweet there was “a real risk of a messy orce which would be a geostrategic mistake”.But, according to a report from the AFP news agency, Hunt also told reporters after the meeting:At the moment we are heading for no deal by accident.That implies a level of probability rather higher than “real risk”.Hunt also defended the British government’s decision to appeal over the heads of the European commission to EU leaders, in the hope of getting a better Brexit offer. He said that although negotiating with the commission was “the correct and legal thing to do”, the government thought that “in the end the outcome of those negotiations are a choice for European countries from whom the commission gets its mandate”.Kneissl was dismissive of the idea of trying to sideline the commission when she gave an interview to the Today programme this morning (see 10.330am) and after the meeting with Hunt she insisted there was “a high degree of cohesion” amongst EU member states about how to deal with the UK.The AFP report also includes this snippet in its report.Asked whether there was any possibility of an extension to the UK’s exit date of March 29 next year, or even to the exit talks due to be concluded by October, Hunt said he thought this was “highly unlikely”.“I think people would worry if there was any delay in the exit date that it was some kind of project to avoid leaving the EU,” he said.If Hunt was saying that the prospect of the UK not leaving the EU on March 29 next year was “highly unlikely”, that would be significant because it would imply Hunt thinks there is a remote chance the UK won’t leave by then and that article 50 will be extended. Downing Street has absolutely ruled this out. But the AFP report suggests the question was ambiguous, and that Hunt may have been saying the chance of the deal not being concluded by October is highly unlikely.Sky News has been using Freedom of Information requests to get hold of Brexit impact studies produced by councils. As Faisal Islam reports, some of them are not encouraging. Nearly 30 councils have responded to a freedom of information request for their Brexit plans, with some expressing mounting incredulity and exasperation at having to plan to deliver local public services against a backdrop of highly uncertain Brexit negotiations with Europe and within government.They say they are having to work out the implications for social care, border controls, the availability of food and medicines and even the fear of “social unrest.”Sky’s Zach Brown has tweeted some of the highlights.Business Insider’s Thomas Colson has a good story about Home Office contingency planning for border controls after no deal Brexit. He says one conclusions was that EU nationals would continue to get preferential treatment at the border because the Border Force would not have the resources to tighten checks. He says:A source close to the Home Office explained that the Border Force would likely have little other choice than to carry on allowing EU citizens freely into the UK as it would not have the staffing capacity, resources, or infrastructure to implement a new registration scheme in a no-deal scenario.It currently takes an average of approximately 45 seconds to check an EEA citizens’ passport, compared to an average of 4 minutes for an non-EEA arrival.If every new arrival was subject to 4-minute checks, there could be days-long queues at some British airports without a dramatic increase in the number of trained immigration officers.This is from the Labour MP Stephen Kinnock on what he thinks Labour should do next to address the antisemitism problem facing the party.Karin Kneissl, the Austrian foreign minister who is meeting Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, in Vienna, was on the Today programme this morning. Since his appointment Hunt has been regularly warning about the risk of a no deal Brexit happening by accident. (He was at it again yesterday.) But Kneissl played down the prospect of this happening. When asked about this, she said:From the commission’s side, there is a clear-cut schedule, so an accident is not really something that people are working for. Everyone is working along a schedule ...If from both sides more effort is put into the negotiations, things can be handled in a transparent way and nobody should be afraid of a dirty Brexit, a cliff-edge or whatever. It’s really a matter of sticking to the schedule.She also did not seem too impressed by Hunt’s suggestion that the major EU nation states should overrule Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, and force Brussels to offer a compromise deal. When asked about this, she pointed out that Barnier was following guidelines and a mandate agreed by the European council, the body made up of EU leaders.Boris Johnson is back in the running to be the next Conservative leader, a ConservativeHome survey of party members suggests. ConservativeHome regularly asks Tory members who they want to see as the next leader (and the results are taken seriously, because in the past these surveys have been a reasonably good guide as to the outcome of internal Conservative party elections) but when Johnson was foreign secretary, he never did particularly well. As Paul Goodman explains in the ConservativeHome write-up, Johnson’s resignation over the Chequers plan (see 9.15am) has transformed his chances.A month ago, before the Chequers cabinet meeting and the Brexit white paper, he was foreign secretary – tied to a policy which he clearly didn’t believe in, and having failed to quit over Heathrow expansion. He was fifth in the survey, languishing on eight per cent.Now, his rating has almost quadrupled, and he is top of the poll. He last led as long ago as March 2016 – in the aftermath of his decision to come out for Leave. Again, his total soared.Our reading is that most panel members believe that David Davis is now too old to lead the Party, even as a stopgap, and that Johnson, with his Daily  column, his national projection and reach, and his publicity-mongering over the best part of 30 years, is best placed to make the case for an authentic Brexit to the voters.Until recently the conventional wisdom at Westminster has been that, although Johnson would be popular with Conservative party members, his chances of making it onto the shortlist of two that would be put to the membership would be slim because MPs have to whittle down the candidates first and many of them consider him unprincipled and untrustworthy. But winning elections comes first and it is not hard to see how MPs might swallow their qualms about Johnson in the light of evidence showing he would win them the most votes. The Sunday Times (paywall) recently published a YouGov poll showing exactly this.Theresa May’s proposals for the UK’s relationship with the EU after Brexit - set out in the white paper but known as the Chequers plan, because it was finalised at an all-day cabinet meeting at Chequers - are a lot “softer” than people expected when she first became prime minister. But, according to a thinktank report out today, the economy would still suffer quite badly. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research has published its latest economic review and it says Chequers would cost the economy the equivalent of £500 per person in lost output. And, of course, a no deal Brexit would be even worse.Here’s an extract from its news release.Our central forecast under a ‘soft Brexit’ scenario is that the economy will grow at a pace that is consistent with its potential. This translates to annual GDP growth of 1.4 per cent this year and 1.7 per cent next year, which is broadly unchanged from our previous forecast ...As before, the central forecast has been conditioned on a ‘soft’ Brexit assumption where the UK achieves close to full access to the EU market for goods and services. If instead of this soft Brexit scenario we assume that the government achieves the somewhat more restrictive white paper proposals, the output loss will amount to £500 per person per year over time compared with the soft Brexit scenario. The loss would be around £800 under a ‘no deal’ Brexit. These estimates do not include the likely impact on productivity which could, on some estimates, double the size of the losses.Output is a measure of what the economy produces. An output loss is not the same as a loss to household income. But it is a way of saying the country would be getting poorer, and that does ultimately impact on family finances.My colleague Larry Elliott has written up the report overnight here.It’s another quiet, recess day at Westminster. The only item on the government’s news grid is Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, meeting his Austrian opposite number Karin Kneissl in Vienna for talks. Austria holds the presidency of the EU at the moment, which means it is a more influential EU player until the end of the year that it otherwise would be. And, of course, the Labour party is still embroiled in a row about antisemitism. In the latest development, Jeremy Corbyn has apologised for speaking at an event where the actions of Israel in Gaza were compared to the Nazis.

He moves so beautifully, especially given he’s not a short man. Those runs are the only ones off the over. “Mental endurance: chess, beyond doubt,” emails Geoff. “Athleticism: mountain climbing, decathlonheptathlon, rowing, squash, fell running all belong above tennis. But for the combined award it’s surely hard to outdo test batting.”I’m not sure about that - the endurance ones you mention don’t require the same level of skill as tennis, don’t all work the whole body, some can be paced, and some come with proper breaks. But agreed on chess, look at the devastation here: And read a bit more about it here:20th over: England 62-1 (Jennings 27, Root 21) Jennings has looked alright this morning, taking four to cover, and this is a big chance for him. If he can parlay a start into a score, he’ll be in for the series, but if you’re asking me, I’d guess that Ashwin will see him away before that happens - he’s not quite supple enough in technique and footwork, yet. 18th over: England 58-1 (Jennings 23, Root 20) Shami finds some away movement as Root comes part of the way forward before retreating as the ball beats him. Root then takes a single to third man, via edge, and Shami goes around to slant into, rather than across the left-handed Jennings he plays out three dots.“I’d say that the whole of track and field comes under the same banner as cricket and darts solitaire,” says Sarah O’Regan. “Once you’ve jumped, sprinted, or thrown, there’s absolutely nothing you can do to stop your opponent doing it better. (Same with gymnastics, actually). I think the shorter the track distance the more this applies - when you get to 10,000m and longer, the mind games and tactics are brought in.” Usain Bolt told a friend of mine that before he beat Gatlin in Rio, before the race Gatlin was giving him dap and all sorts. Bolt wondered why this was, given that they were rivals, knew he had him, and sure enough, Gatlin bottled it on the line. Tangentially, I remember during those Olympics, a liveblog discussion about hardest sportsmen ended with this:17th over: England 57-1 (Jennings 23, Root 20) Jennings defends, takes a mooch, and when the throw hits the stumps they amble a single. And oh look, there’s Root taking three more past slip he’s nearly caught up with Jennings having faced 16 fewer balls. 16th over: England 53-1 (Jennings 22, Root 17) Jennings feathers one to cover, then Root turns two to fine leg. He’s looking a pretty sound bet to get himself out for 64, and to cement the point, somehow forces one into the ground, wide of slip, and to the fence at third man. As with Ian Bell, you should always consider a man there when he’s at the wicket. 15th over: England 46-1 (Jennings 21, Root 11) Athers isn’t sure whether Ashwin is spinning it because there’s moisture in the well-watered pitch, or because it’s dry and therefore tacky. Ashwin being quite good is probably relevant too, and he sends one past the outside edge and off stump - Jennings left it, but the turn he anticipated wasn’t there. Single off the over, earned by Jennings to long leg, via sweep. “Don’t think I’ve missed anyone else mentioning it, but snooker is up there with darts. When you’re off the table, there’s nothing at all you can do to affect the game. Even worse, every point your opponent scores is a point you then can’t score, as opposed to darts, where you both score entirely inidually. Also, the inherent stuffiness massively limits the amount of agitation that can be deployed, beyond dead-eye stares and puffed-cheek sighs. And, matches can comfortably last a couple of days. Still no comparison to test batting, though, which seems like a truly terrifying undertaking to a man as limited as myself.”Sort of – you can lay a snooker or, if it’s not going well, roll into the reds. Or try potting your way out of trouble, whereas in darts, all you can do is chuck, and you don’t have options in terms of how you chuck. I actually wrote some things about this stuff - darts here and snooker here. 14th over: England 45-1 (Jennings 20, Root 11) Mohammed Shami into the attack and my coverage dies, but he slings down a further maiden. Drinks. 13th over: England 45-1 (Jennings 20, Root 11) A maiden from Ashwin, but his final delivery is a lifter! Yes, a lifter! Maybe it’s deliberate, maybe it’s natural variation, either way, more doubt in more minds. Anyway, it clips the shoulder of Jennings’ bat, but drops safe. And here’s England’s problem they can’t just let Ashwin bowl, but they can’t afford to attack him either...12th over: England 45-1 (Jennings 20, Root 11) Sharma is not there for this, and a wide one allows Root to move away from it then return with his bat, cracking four to long leg. Those are the only runs from the over.  “Totally agree re your point on getting bums on seats,” emails Karl Gibbons. “It is school holidays, so if seats haven’t been sold, give them away for free to kids! Re the mentalphysical points on endurance and other sports, I think cricket stands alone because you are actively playing against another team whereas darts and golf, although you have opponents, what they do could  should not impact what you do (if one’s personal game is on form). Another sport I would put in the mix to rival cricket would be tennis – granted it is not as long and thus less mentally demanding, but if you play badly for an hour you are going to be packing up your bags and shaking hands with the umpire.Regarding tennis and comparing to team sports, I remember Sir Alex Ferguson once saying that he knew that in a big cup final he would always have 2 or 3 players who didn’t perform to the peak of their ability. This matters less in a team sport and will do in cricket too, as you have others to bail you out by scoring  taking wickets however, in tennis it is just you. Hence Federer  Nadal’s dominance and ability to play at their highest level in the highest intensity grand slam finals always amazes me.”The inability to affect your opponent is, I think, why darts is so stressful – it’s all on you – and why we see the various tricks players employ to agitate their opponents. I agree on tennisers, though, who are the fittest athletes apart from perhaps fighters. 11th over: England 41-1 (Jennings 20, Root 7) You can forgive England batsmen for being trepidatious here, but they don’t appear to be. Jennings drives two through point then nabs a single, and Root adds another via inside edge. Ashwin looks settled here - it’s going to be a busy day for him, I shouldn’t wonder. Great stuff. 10th over: England 37-1 (Jennings 17, Root 6) Sanga explains that Ashwin planned that wicket, showing Cook a variety of deliveries to get him playing one way – around off, I think – before the wicket-taker, much straighter and perhaps a bit quicker too. Meanwhile, Jennings edges four then after a single, Root turns four. He now has six off two balls, and that’s the thing with him - the match is never still when he’s in the middle. “With one ball, Ashwin makes both captains regret leaving out the second spinner,” tweets OBOer Tim de Lisle, “colleague” being a word that one may never use - any more for anymore? I wonder about that, though - my guess is that Root, if he had a twirler as good as Ashwin available, would just not have picked Rashid. 9th over: England 25-1 (Jennings 12, Root 2) Root takes two off his first ball, gliding to cover. But I can’t stop watching that ball from Ashwin, which was pretty much perfection. England will be feart, and with good reason. Here we go! Here - we - go! This is delicious from Ashwin, who flights one in that pitches on middle, then grips, spits and fizzes past the outside edge to clatter off! Oh yes! 8th over: England 25-0 (Cook 13, Jennings 11) In commentary, Sanga talks about the Asian mindset when touring England, and the desire to bowl at the first sight of cloud. As far as I can see, you might bowl at Trent Bridge, but everywhere else, even Headingley, you back yourself to bat. Sharma, meanwhile, is bowling ok - some good balls and some less good balls - and the pressure is not intense. Jennings is able to leave too many deliveries, and when forced to play shoves a single off his legs, the only run from the over. PJ returns on mental strength: “Re: the email from James. I think you’re right Daniel, physical endurance is a different beast altogether. Two tiny technical mistakes in test cricket and your whole match is over, you‘ve made your team‘s job harder, and you‘ve got to deal with that psychologically until the next match. I don’t see any analogy with cycling on that front. Don’t get me wrong, I‘m a long distance runner and so appreciate the mental preparation of endurance sports, but it’s very different. I can run badly for an hour and still run a good race, and I guess it is the same in cycling, but a bad hour in test cricket is impossible because you‘ll be shaking your head and taking off your helmet after a few minutes. You need complete focus at all times.”7th over: England 24-0 (Cook 13, Jennings 10) Ashwin into the attack - a move born of simultaneous positivity and frustration. He starts by coming around, and Cook takes a single to pint before Jennings is forced to sweep, the ball shooting off the glove in the opposite direction of the intended shot they run a leg bye. “I’m based in London,” emails Wayne Stubbs, “so a day at the cricket begins with champagne breakfast at the Wolseley - eggs, bacon, smoked salmon, tea. Settle down at the ground with Pimms and lemonade, moving on to gin an tonic in the heat of the day. Something light and digestible for lunch - chicken, perhaps, with some more champers or a light chablis to wash it down. As the afternoon shadows lengthen some good finger food - scotch eggs, gala pie. After stumps its pile in a taxi for a raucous ride to Rules, where steak and kidney pudding and apple crumble are consumed with some decent red.”Fair, but I’m not grasping the apparent pause in the eating? 6th over: England 22-0 (Cook 12, Jennings 10) Nasser points out that if this had been Broad and Anderson bowling this morning, they’d have been criticised for insufficient up-pitching ... but have a look! Sharma gets one off the seam and across Jennings, who fences ... and Rahane, at four but ing in front of three ... in front of Kohli at three ... puts it down! A long, lingering glare that screams “I despise you” is administered, and that is not good news for India, who know they need to field properly to get anywhere. Two off the over. “It would be interesting to know if other cricketers’ names had origins which were apposite,” emails Phil Sawyer. “For example, if Jimmy Anderson was of Scandinavian descent then Anderson would, I think, roughly translate to ‘strong and manly offspring’. However, in the ancient Lancashire dialect it actually translates as ‘the chuntering one’.”Well, I’m not one hundred percent certain that it’s its origin, but emess, as in MS, means ultimate, ine truth in Hebrew – as discussed below. 5th over: England 20-0 (Cook 11, Jennings 9) Yadav serves Cook a short, wide one, so he slaps it to the point fence. Then he and Jennings nab a single each before Cook snaps four more off his pads. This is now a minor Start, which is to say one should now add two wickets to the score. “I shall join you immediately in your coolbag quest,” emails Sarah O’Regan. “Are you a champagne sharer, or shall I stick to my own Aperol spritz? I do feel it is slightly remiss of you not to have taken advantage of the obvious jeu de mot: Root (not route) around the coolbag, in both a Joseph and a piggy manner. Oink! Pass me that enormous pork pie!”Being a child, I still enjoy fizzy drinks and will therefore guzzle bubbles all day if I’ve sneaked enough in, or if I can be arsed to get up and buy them. Perhaps an ale or two in the evening session to wash down the 17 remaining bags of chrisp. 4th over: England 10-0 (Cook 2, Jennings 8) There’s plenty of swing for Ishant - too much swing, you might say - and Cook is content to take one from the over, turned off his legs. “Here is the obligatory TMS link for those of us living outside the UK,” emails Chris Drew.This saved my life in Ghana once. It’s a beautiful thing. 3rd over: England 9-0 (Cook 1, Jennings 8) Edgbaston is far too empty, and it’s about time cricket acted in this regard free tickets for kids, to be distributed to schools in term-time and available on the gate and in local youth clubs otherwise. Test cricket is worth saving, let’s save it. Anyway, Jennings turns Yadav’s first ball for four to fine leg, then adds two more to midwicket and another two to deep square he’s away. “I think Geraint Thomas may have something to say about PJ Connolly’s email!” emails James Rodger.I see what you’re saying, but cycling as I understand it is basically a suffering contest the mental strength demanded by cricket is a different kind of thing because cricket is skill-based rather than endurance, and therefore physiology-based. 2nd over: England 1-0 (Cook 1, Jennings 0) Ishant, who has form for brilliance in England, is getting warm. He’s lost the waves in favour of a sweep and his first ball squares Cook, pitching on the seam and going away into the back thigh – good start. Very good start! The third ball also leaves Cook, and the fourth is too good, squaring him again! Maiden. In my boxroom office, I’m planning my route through my imaginary liquid picnic I’ve started with champagne, will move on to white wine (possibly). Feel free to send in your personal route around the cool bag. 1st over: England 1-0 (Cook 1, Jennings 0) India have three slips and a gully, then move gully to short midwicket cunning. Yadav – who name means “his hands” in Hebrew – runs in hard, and Cook blocks well on the back foot. Then he finds some movement and Cook leaves well, relying on the bounce – there’s less than he expected and already the call to bat looks the right one. Cook then takes a single into the off side, the only run form the over. “Very excited about this series,” emails PJ Connolly. The ‘Mind Games’ feature on Sky and the following chat is great. Surely there are very few sports that compare to Test cricket for what you need to do mentally beforehand. Just the sheer duration and intensity of a day’s play, never mind a whole match, makes it stand alone. I can only think of golf as something similarly dependent on such mental strength, but golf’s not really sport is it?”Darts is a mental game too - there’s nothing you can do if it’s not going well, say roll into the reds, cover up, slog, whatever. You just have to chuck better. But agree that the resolution needed to bat all day is incomparable. Umesh Yadav has the ball Cook will face. We’re nearly there, and I really don’t know what’s going to happen (now that you ask). Yesterday I’d decided that India are too strong, but I’m back on England now. I wonder if we might see more draws than we’ve been accustomed to, but I think Broad and Anderson will take enough wickets to sneak their team home. I’m probably wrong. Alastair Cook is on telly talking about the man on his shoulder, and how he’ll have him there for as long as he plays cricket. When it comes to the mental side of things, he’s one of the most articulate sportsmen I’ve ever interviewed, and England need him to be in shape here. Keaton Jennings might do well, but England can’t rely on him, and with Root at three there’s a chance for India to decapitate quickly. “Isn’t it funny whenever a captain is asked about their choice of whether to bat or bowl they always look over at the pitch, as if the pitch is telling them what to say in the interview,” emails Scott Roberts. “It reminds me of the time back in Catholic junior school in the lunch hall when a child told the head Nun about a boy that had thrown some food at him. Every time the boy who had been shied at with said food turned around to motion to the other boy attempting the food-based run-out, the Nun would shout ‘stop looking at him’ and slapped him across the face. It happened about six times, as the boy couldn’t help but turn and look at the ‘pitch’ to confirm his story. Ah, good times……how we laughed!”In my school, if you told someone they weren’t wearing their kippa, they would immediately put their hand on their head seeking it, though they knew that was the only place that it wasn’t. We see some VT with James Anderson it’s fair to say he’s up for this one. He is one of the greatest exponents of white-line fever, and has particular needle with this India team. I can’t wait to see how this plays out, especially with Kohli, who he got four times in 50 balls last time they met in England. Kohli, though, is a much better player now. KL Rahul is in for India, with Pujara missing out Karthik keeps, Hardik is the allrounder and Ashwin is the sole spinner. Virat says he was thinking about bowling because of the cloud cover, to get the maximum out of the new ball on day 1, but agrees that it looks a decent track. Root says it looks a good surface and the cloud should burn off. Can’t they at least be cable knit? Disgraceful. Sangakarra says that when he first came to England, he was told to play as straight as possible, but eventually had a “little epiphany” telling him to play late and square. That seemed to go ok. “Morning Daniel, morning everyone,” opens Simon McMahon. “So, England’s one thousandth Test. A millennium of Tests. Test 1K. Of course, being an England cricket fan, A Grand Don’t Come for Free. It’s been quite the ride, even if I myself have only been around for about one third of them. Here’s to the next 1000, eh?”Let’s hope so. Test cricket, along with darts, needs to be on the national curriculum imagine thinking morris dancing, recorder and maths are of greater value. Back to Rashid, he won’t be able to rely on the brilliant captaincy of Eoin Morgan, but Root probably has a better feel for things than Alastair Cook. And the India batsmen know he can bowl jaffas, so will be circumspect facing him than any of the alternatives. Harbhajan reckons India will bowl if they win the toss, but Michael Holding advises both teams to bat. I’d be surprised if England didn’t, because although they might fancy a go first up, guts out the first hour and they can dictate. Talking of turn, it’s a while since I’ve been as keen for a player to do well as I am for Rashid to do well today. In general, he’s not been well treated by England and Joe Root in particular, dropped for Dawson, omitted for Crane, and never really given a run. I also cannot grasp the idea that he should’ve rejected the call-up, nor that it shouldn’t have been issued if the selectors deem him the best option. Plus the protests on behalf of county cricket, not a unity nor a person as far as I’m aware, are a nonsense and seem to have come from no one who plays in it. As for Geoffrey Boycott – a man who not that long ago said that he should “black up” to get a knighthood, but this week called Rashid a “spoilt brat” – well. He reckons England have the edge in the batting, but the attacks are pretty well matched. I wonder about that - if the pitches turn, England are in big trouble, but as far as Edgbaston goes, they seem to have done everything possible to deliver a typical track and the weather is obliging too. Sanga thinks it’s going to be good. What further evidence do you need? We know this is a thing because the telly coverage is starting an hour prior. If you’re not buzzing, advise yourself. The world is a dark place, so when light comes our way, it is our duty as human beings to embrace it with every sinew and synapse that we can muster. Already this summer, sport has elevated us with ine lovingkindness, but there is nothing to compare with a major Test series no more exacting examination, no more comforting rhythm, no more affirming intensity. England v India will give us all of that and more than that, a panoply of other things we can’t conceive of until they’ve happened and even then. Of course, like everything else in life, sport can and does disappoint. But the starting position here is such that we can be certain something will happen. The hosts have a reputation to shatter: for the last few years they’ve been better at losing than winning, and in a particular manner. Unlike in previous generations, there has not been an overriding sense of hilarious ineptitude and demeaning powerlessness rather, frittered talent and frantic minds. But in the end, too much of that leaves us with only one conclusion: not bloody good enough. W have now reached that juncture … and yet England remain a fascinating side. Their batsmen are enterprising and tough, except for when they aren’t, and their bowlers are clever and capable, except for when they aren’t. If they can pull this off it could be the start of something if they can’t it might be the end of various things. India, meanwhile, are already the best side in the world. But in a fallow period for greatness they need something special to enshrine their status as a team for the ages they need to win here, and they have a fantastic chance so to do. Aside from fragile opposition, they have had plenty of time to acclimatise and conditions will never be more to their liking. More than anything, though, in Virat Kohli they have a totemic giant of world sport, a genius and a guru, whose relentless positivity is a philosophy, an inspiration and a way of life. And this summer we are getting not just Kohli, but Kohli with a point to prove stand well back. So, Test cricket, here we are and here we go: immerse us in your splendour, please.

But straight away, I recognised that I liked it – and I knew that one day I’d have to stop.”Rees, who was born in Maesteg, south Wales, is making his debut at this year’s Edinburgh fringe with Happy Hour, a look back at his battle with alcohol. He started performing in 2010 and quickly scooped up some new act awards. Then, two years ago, his comedy career stalled as he experienced problems with addiction.Being a standup, Rees “got away” with his drinking for longer than most. “It’s quite normal to go up on stage after a few pints, and it’s fine to be hungover the next day. Someone with a normal job would’ve been fired. But I was just getting on with it.” In 2016, after a visit to his GP, the damage became clear. “There’s an enzyme called GGT that shows how hard your liver’s working. It should be under 50 in a healthy adult. At that point, mine was over 1,700. My doctor said, ‘You’re going to kill yourself if you don’t stop drinking.’”Happy Hour makes Rees part of a new wave of comedy at the fringe, as standups share stories of coming back from the brink. Last year’s Comedy Award was shared: Hannah Gadsby won for her passionate diatribe against homophobia and sexual violence, and John Robins for his raw account of his reaction to a breakup. This year, to name just a few, Dave Maher describes surviving a coma, Louise Reay explores free speech after being sued by her ex-husband, Jim Tavaré relives his near-fatal car crash, and Lou Sanders tackles addiction.Which brings us back to Rees who, on Good Friday last year, stopped drinking completely. “I was physically dependent by that point,” he says. “The shops weren’t open and I wasn’t so much craving a drink as physically needing one. My only option was to go to hospital for Valium. I went to my first meeting on Easter Monday and it’s been abstinence from then on.”On Easter Sunday – two days after checking himself into hospital – Rees went on stage and talked about his addiction, and the material has now been bolstered into an hour-long show. Although standup, which mostly exists in pubs and clubs, is a boozy environment, the 28-year-old says the support of the comedy community has been a huge help with his recovery. “There are a lot of comedians who are ex-drinkers, so I had no shortage of people to ring when it was getting too much. You could argue that it’s a risky environment, but when I did my first gig two days after hospital, it helped – it gave me a boost. I like comedy clubs. If I’m giving up booze, I’m not giving up comedy as well.”Beth Vyse is another comic who has turned life-threatening experiences into comedy. As Funny As Cancer, her acclaimed absurdist show from 2015, tackled her battle with breast cancer via dreamlike bus rides with Michael Jackson and a pile of ping-pong balls. Her latest show, The Hand That Rocks the Cradle, which finds her in character as desperate daytime TV host Olive Hands, deals with no such hardship. But it does come to the fringe a year later than planned.“Last year,” says Vyse, “when I was eight-and-a-half months pregnant, my partner started feeling dizzy. After finally going to hospital, they found a cavernoma in his brain. They’re basically abnormal cells and they’d haemorrhaged, so there was blood in his brain.”Luke Chaproniere, her partner, was told surgery wasn’t possible. The only option was to wait for the blood to be absorbed back into the brain. After three months, he had recovered – by which time Vyse had given birth to their son, Henry. They decided to take a show to Edinburgh but, with a month to go, Chaproniere’s symptoms returned and they were forced to cancel.“It would’ve been silly to do it,” says Vyse. “Especially with the new baby. I could’ve gone up on my own, but I wanted to be with Luke. I couldn’t have done this show with anyone else.” Indeed, Chaproniere isn’t just Vyse’s partner, he’s her comedy team-mate. He advises on scripts, directs her shows and operates all the technical aspects. The second wave of symptoms turned out to be a scare – not another bleed, but the old blood becoming dislodged. Within a couple of months, Chaproniere was feeling better. The show was back on for 2018.But a major aspect of it has changed. In The Hand That Rocks The Cradle, Vyse explores juggling her career and motherhood through madcap games and set pieces, but it features a starring role for young Henry. “Not to be rude,” she says, “but last year Henry would’ve just been a cute, breathing prop. He was only three months old. Now he’s a bit older, he reacts to things. I’ll use his responses as part of the show. Whether Olive Hands takes them on board or just ignores them, I’m not sure.”The comedian Adam Hess has no such dependents – and that became a factor in the experiences he has turned into his show Seahorse. “What happened to me,” he says, “made me realise, in both the saddest and happiest way, that I don’t have any heirs. I’ve got nothing.”Last year, the 29-year-old hit rock bottom, after losing all his savings when a tech investment crashed. Hess has always been fascinated with technology and, after reading about the rise of Bitcoin, invested £200 in the cryptocurrency. A few hours later, his portfolio was worth a whole 50p more. “I thought, ‘Oh my god, just a few hours and 50p return – great!” So he kept investing and soon most of his savings were tied up in the digital currency.For a while, all was good. The value steadily increased – but then it started to plummet. “I failed to realise that all of the articles I was reading were written either by someone with an incentive to make me buy more, or by people as deluded as me. I mainly wanted to pay off my university debt so I could say, ‘Now I can be a proper grown-up.’”Instead, Hess found himself revisiting his childhood: having lost his shirt, he was forced to move back in with his parents – and that was the inspiration for Seahorse. “The fact that I’m 29 and the parent-child dynamic still exists is so funny,” he says. “Like, I’m given less dinner than my dad – and fair enough, he’s in charge of me. But I’m bigger than him.”Cohabiting with his folks isn’t the main focus of Hess’s show, though. After moving back home, he went through old photos and childhood possessions that brought back memories of his school days. “The show’s about sexuality and kind of about me thinking I was gay. I preferred wearing dresses, I fancied a couple of boys, and I loved everything that was ‘fabulous’. And then I was told it was wrong, so I just had to repress it. At the time, I thought it was being gay, but maybe I was just woke as fuck!”Hess insists he has “nothing new to bring to the table” in terms of opinions: the show is simply his personal stories. But being at home has made him feel more comfortable talking about his experiences. “I feel safer there,” he says. “I’m constantly surrounded by people I love. It’s been a silver lining that funny stuff has come out of me losing a bit of money.”But, as any comedian will tell you, taking a show to Edinburgh is expensive. Most comics don’t break even over the month-long festival. So after his financial disaster, how is Hess justifying spending cash on this year’s fringe? “It’s so funny,” he says. “In order to do this show about losing money, I’m having to lose more money. But no matter what, I will probably go to Edinburgh every year till I’m dead.”• Matt Rees and Adam Hess are at Pleasance Courtyard.

Our hope is that these tools give people more control over the time they spend on our platforms and also foster conversations between parents and teens about the online habits that are right for them.”The tools will be found in the settings page of Facebook and Instagram under the headers “Your Time on Facebook” and “Your Activity” respectively.In January, Facebook’s founder, Mark Zuckerberg, declared that “making sure time spent on Facebook is time well spent” was one of the key problems facing the site, alongside “protecting our community from abuse and hate” and “defending against interference by nation states”.The company also faces competitive pressure to move quickly. Both Google and Apple have announced similar features, built into the forthcoming versions of their iOS and Android operating systems – and these can mute notifications permanently, rather than temporarily as Facebook will allow.Both Apple and Google also have “time well spent” features allowing parents to limit their children’s screen time. Facebook’s implementation of the idea is focused only on self-control.Laura Randall, the NSPCC’s associate head of child safety online, said: “Facebook and Instagram state they want to ensure their platforms are safe but to do so they need to tackle serious problems within their sites.“Time limits do not address the fact that there are still no consistent child safety standards in place. This lack of responsibility is why the legislation the government has committed to must include a mandatory child safety code with an independent regulator to enforce consequences for those who don’t follow those rules.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92e025836636cbea5cbed70e12cae0e4fe97a195/0_27_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16dc77055b8f220a23528b8014291aa8","title":"hong kong retro shopping scene vintage t shirts toys","story":"Skip the shiny malls and dig beneath the surface for a taste of Hong Kong’s vintage cool – from propaganda posters to secondhand PradaHong Kong is a city obsessed with the new: new buildings, new restaurants, new brand names, new trends. But underneath all that newness lies a burgeoning retro scene, one that’s a little more attached to the past. From genuine vintage to old-school cool, Hong Kong has a lot more to offer than mere novelty.Cat StreetOfficially named Upper Lascar Row, after the lascar sailors who used to bunk here, this little alley just off the Hollywood Road antiques drag is known universally as “Cat Street”. In Cantonese, a “cat” is a fence for stolen goods, and the street was once well known for its less-than-legal wares. These days the trinkets lining Cat Street are rather more legit. They still might not quite have the pedigree of the antiques stores that surround them, but this strip lies at the intersection of capitalism and communism: the stalls are full of mass-produced copies of Mao’s Little Red Book, Communist-era propaganda posters, and Chinese Politburo playing cards (can you name them all?). One store even features large marble busts of Mao, Stalin and Lenin, if your breakfast nook is in need of a touch more authoritarianism. There are also bronze tchotchkes, jade necklaces, Hong Kong postcards, and Bruce Lee posters aplenty for the souvenir shopper. But best of all are the wristwatches featuring a waving Chairman Mao on the face, his arm ticking away the seconds. Halfway up this short street, the Man Mo cafe serves up some fascinating fusion dim sum, such as pan-fried truffle brie dumplings.Hipster 9Hong Kong’s ladies who lunch are known as “tai-tais” – literally just “wives”. There are plenty of them in this city of status and money, and along with all the high teas and spa days come an awful lot of designer labels. But even the rich in Hong Kong are squeezed into smaller living spaces, and when they run out of walk-in wardrobe space they bring their brand names to Hipster 9 to be sold on consignment. What that all translates to is a regular stock of barely worn clothes, accessories, jewellery and shoes that tend toward the Pradas, the Ferragamos and the Guccis, with some choice vintage options on top – all for far less than you’d normally expect to pay. Rumour has it that Hong Kong celebrities are prone to dropping off their pre-loved items here, for that touch of extra glam.TinyNot all retro is secondhand, of course. Modelmaker Tiny’s toys summon up times gone by, with die-cast models that are a serious nostalgia hit for Hongkongers. Tiny is fully stocked to create the old-school Hong Kong diorama: crumbling tenement building facades, in front of which tiny model street hawkers roast up miniature chestnuts, while vintage taxis and “hot-dog buses” – double-deckers so named for their colour scheme and lack of air-conditioning – wait for passengers alongside rickshaws. Even if you didn’t grow up in the city, these iconic trams, delivery trucks and even soft-serve ice-cream vans make for perfect gifts. The company also creates miniature Boris buses, if your predilections incline towards London.Midwest VintageThe city’s very first vintage store was founded back in 1993 as a company selling used clothing across Asia, Russia and eastern Europe. But after a while it discovered that the Hong Kong market was just as interested in vintage as anywhere else. Midwest Vintage stocks genuine classic Americana, sourced straight from the Lone Star state itself. Think vintage T-shirts, Levi 501s, US air force surplus flight jackets and navy pea coats – stylish and utterly impractical in the sweltering heat of Hong Kong. Hence the shop’s homegrown label, First Edition, which takes vintage fabrics and merges them with contemporary designs for clothing that’s – just like Hong Kong – the very best of both worlds.Mee \u0026amp GeeHong Kong doesn’t have much of a thrifting scene, but Mee \u0026amp Gee (sometimes known as Mee \u0026amp George) is a goldmine, as long you come equipped with time and patience. This shop brings mostly secondhand Japanese fashions into its many crammed racks, and shoppers are expected to get stuck in. There are plaid shirts in every hue, adorable print dresses, leather coats of wildly varying quality and age, some amazingly ugly shirts – and a surprisingly large selection of mesh fishing vests. You have to steel yourself for Mee \u0026amp Gee, and you might not always come away a winner, but the HK$10 (£1) rack right by the entrance can hold treasures."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebfb8206faa45b2f4c8c8b7d8c99f40e25dcfb90/126_153_2303_1382/master/2303.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=83dcf0226ea47ad8dcb0711c63aef04c","title":"readers travel photography competition july the winners","story":"This month’s selection of travel imagery mixes quiet moments and superlative views.

Carlos says several times that what happened to them was the one thing his son most worried about as they made their way to America – being forcibly separated from his father.“He used to tell me, ‘Please don’t leave me alone’ and he would repeat that,” Carlos said as he recalled his son’s pleas during the almost year-long journey from El Salvador to the US border. It was a difficult and dangerous trip that they survived together, only to be split up at their destination.“I told him that I would always be with him. But when they separated us, my promise was broken,” Carlos said.Aaron spent a month in a center for children while his mother, who was already in the US, struggled to locate him, acquire legal representation and turn in documentation proving she was his mother.Nine months after entering the US, Aaron still stutters when he talks, and he refuses to speak to his father. “The relationship we had is broken, the trust we had is broken,” Carlos says. Their story is a familiar one of leaving a homeland to avoid falling prey to gang violence, but ending up traumatised by their experiences arriving at the border. After facing widespread backlash over a policy of child separation at the border, the US government is now seeking to reunite families. But parents and mental health professionals say the effects of the trauma of separation will persist long after parents and children have found each other again.Child separation of migrant families increased in April of this year under Donald Trump’s “zero tolerance” policy, however it’s not entirely new. The president’s policy change increased separations because adults crossing into the US illegally would now be criminally charged rather than simply deported. This policy change meant that adults were held in detention facilities, where children are not allowed, until their date in court. Carlos and his son presented themselves to border officials to seek asylum, and they arrived five months before zero tolerance was implemented. Carlos believes he was discriminated against, and despite providing Aaron’s birth certificate and passport, that he was separated under suspicion that he wasn’t his real father. Carlos and his family had left behind their upholstery shop and their hometown in El Salvador four years ago because he could no longer afford the $500 monthly fee that the MS-13 gang demands from every local business owner in the area. When gang members told his wife she had to smuggle drugs for them and that Aaron needed to join the gang or their family would never be safe, they decided they had to leave the country. They left in January 2017.When Carlos and Aaron reached the US point of entry in Tijuana, Mexico, in November 2017 he told the Customs and Border Protection officials that they came to apply for asylum. After two days in a crowded holding cell, father and son handcuffed together, Carlos says Aaron grew quiet, he couldn’t express himself as well as before and began to stutter. On the fifth day, now in Ice custody, officials told Carlos to go collect his belongings because he would be moved to a detention center. When he returned, Aaron and the children of three other fathers had all been taken away to another facility. “Because of what we were going through in El Salvador, I always looked for a way to keep us together,” Carlos said. “But sadly, what didn’t happen in El Salvador happened to us here.” Other immigrant families – even though they too have now been reunited – have similar stories of long-term trauma caused by the separation policy. Jose Demar Fuentes was one of the other fathers separated on the same day as Carlos in November 2017.He and his wife and two sons, also fleeing gang violence in El Salvador, were traveling with a group of migrants through Mexico when their 15-month-old, Mateo, fell ill. Jose and his wife Olivia decided to use all the money they had to pay for a bus ticket so that Jose and Mateo could get to the US faster and seek medical attention.When Olivia found out that her baby had been separated from her husband, she made it to the US as fast as possible and began the process of finding him and providing all of the necessary documentation. After 85 days separated from his parents, Olivia and her son Mateo were reunited in February 2018 at the Los Angeles airport. In the video of this moment, it appears as though Mateo doesn’t know her. Six months after being reunited, Olivia says Mateo cries when strangers approach them and still wakes up crying just like he did on their first night back together. She said: “People have said things to me like ‘How can a child his age have trauma? He can’t possibly know what happened to him.’” But Olivia believes he does know, and most concerning to her, she says he has changed a lot. “Now he’s afraid of everything,” she said.Dr Faye Snyder, psychologist and licensed marriage and family therapist, says that the attachment phase – roughly age zero to three years old – when children build their relationships with and depend upon their parents, is critical to development. “It is important to understand that an attachment break at that age is so much more traumatic than to an adult,” Snyder said.After eight months in detention, Mateo’s father Jose was released from detention on 10 July. “It’s like we’re starting the process all over again,” Olivia said. “Mateo won’t approach his father and if he can’t see me he starts crying again.” She says her whole family is suffering from the separation, not just Mateo. Her older son Andree, who was four when they entered the US, is scared to be left alone anywhere without her. “He has a lot of fears,” she said. “He can’t even look at the police because he says they are going to take him away the same way they did with his brother and dad.” Dr Snyder points out that even children who are separated from just one of their parents due to detention also experience separation anxiety. Mirna Aldana, her husband Magdiel Lopez and their 18-month-old Joshua entered the US seeking asylum in early May. Joshua was never taken away from Mirna throughout her 24 days in detention, but neither of them have seen her husband for nearly three months now because Magdiel is still in detention. “He wakes up in the middle of the night crying and calling out ‘Daddy! Daddy,’” Mirna said. “I don’t know what the adjustment period will be like when his dad gets out.” Carlos Aguilar still hasn’t seen his son in person, now 14, since the day they were separated. After seven and a half months in detention, Carlos was released in June. Since then he has been living on a friend’s couch in Detroit while his sons live with their mother in Chicago. About his sons, Carlos said: “They don’t want to talk to me because they feel I disappointed them. They’re scared it’s going to happen to us again. Separation destroys families.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21f9955f38d3a55aa0994c2a9e875f972123fdff/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=644cfc766c20d225eb2fdb9ae6f668de","title":"debbie sims africa mike jr black liberation orphan move nine philadelphia","story":"Mike Africa Jr has spent 40 years of his life with both parents behind bars. Then one day in June, his life changed.  Ed Pilkington tells his storyThe placenta was the trickiest part. How to dispose of it without it making a mess that would alert the guards that a child had just been born in a prison cell?There was no medical equipment, no painkillers, no sterilized wipes or hygienic materials of any sort. When it came to cutting the umbilical cord in the absence of scissors, well, that was the easy part: just use your teeth.But Debbie Sims Africa was more stressed about the placenta. It was 1978, she was 22 years old and five weeks into what would turn out to be a 40-year prison sentence.She was determined to give birth on her own without any involvement of the jail officers so she could spend some precious time with the baby. In the end, a co-defendant helped her out, scooping up the placenta in her hands and secreting it to the shower room where she flushed it down the prison toilet.The plan worked. Debbie Africa got to spend three wonderful days with her baby son. She hid him under a sheet and when he cried, other jailed women would stand outside the cell and sing or cough to obscure the noise. She knew it couldn’t last, as jail rules prohibited mothers being with their children. At the end of the three days she informed the jailers of the baby’s existence and, once they had got over their astonishment, they arranged for the mother and son to be separated and for the child to be taken to the outside world. So begins the extraordinary life of Mike Africa Jr, a man born in a prison cell, and his incarcerated parents. As he approaches his 40th birthday in September, he reflects on what a crazy ride it’s been. He was born to a mother accused and later convicted of third-degree murder in one of the most dramatic confrontations with law enforcement of the 1970s black liberation struggle. Not only was Debbie Africa sentenced to 30 years to life for the death of a police officer, so too was her husband, Mike Africa Sr, father to Mike Jr, who was caught up in the same confrontation and given the same punishment.Which makes Mike Jr a penal orphan of the black power movement. For almost 40 years, he visited both his parents in separate penitentiaries but never saw either of them outside prison walls. Last month Debbie was finally released from prison on parole, but his father remains in captivity and to this day he has never seen the two of them together. Debbie and Mike Sr, both now 62, are two of the Move Nine, the group of black radicals who were collectively held responsible for the death of Officer James Ramp during a massive police shoot-out at their communal home in Powelton Village, Philadelphia on 8 August 1978. The group, whose members take “Africa” as their last name as a political badge, were resisting eviction.Move was one of the more extraordinary elements of the 1970s black liberation struggle. Deeply committed to fighting police brutality in African American communities, they were also devoted to caring for animals and the environment. They were like the Black Panthers crossed with nature-loving hippies. Black power meets flower power. They lived in a communal house along with dozens of stray dogs and cats where they would preach their political beliefs day and night at high volume through bullhorns, driving their neighbors to despair. Over time they came to be seen as dangerous non-conformists by the Philadelphia police and city government, leading to a drawn-out confrontation that culminated in the 1978 siege and gunfight involving hundreds of police that saw the death of Officer Ramp and sent nine of the black radicals to prison, potentially for life.The Move Nine were accused of firing the first shot and of killing Ramp. Yet they have always claimed innocence. They deny that they shot at anybody and blame the officer’s death on accidental “friendly fire” from other armed police. Ramp, 52, was a former marine who had served with the Philadelphia police department for 23 years. He was killed by a single bullet. Yet all nine Move members were convicted of his murder.I met Debbie Africa and her son as part of research into incarcerated black radicals that began more than two years ago. The starting point was the Angola Three, former Black Panthers who had endured unprecedented stretches in solitary confinement in Louisiana’s notorious Angola prison.That began a journey that would bring me to interview several members of the Move Nine as well as former Black Panthers and members of the Black Liberation Army who remain incarcerated in some cases half a century after their arrests. It would culminate with a day spent with Debbie and Mike Jr, mother and son, as they celebrated their first time together beyond prison walls.Debbie Africa was eight months pregnant during the 1978 siege. During the shoot-out she was holed out in the basement of the Move house, where she was bombarded by water cannons and tear gas and had to fumble her way out in the dark carrying her first child, her two-year-old daughter Michelle.No evidence was presented at trial that she pulled the trigger or ever touched a gun. But she was convicted nonetheless as a murderer and conspirator.Mike Sr remains behind bars in Graterford correctional institution in Pennsylvania. But last June, Debbie Africa became one of very few black liberationists convicted of violent acts from the 1970s to be released on parole having convinced the board she was no threat to society.Debbie and Mike Jr talked to me at his home in a small town outside Philadelphia just two weeks after she had been released on parole from Cambridge Springs prison. They were both still clearly awestruck to be in each other’s company after so long – Mike’s sporadic prison visits to both his parents were nothing like this.It’s the little things that have dumbfounded Mike Jr most. The first morning after they got back to his house, they were sitting at breakfast wearing no shoes.“It was the first time I’ve ever seen her feet, and it was the first time she’d ever seen my feet since I was three days old in her cell,” he said.Debbie Africa described waves of overpowering emotion. “I can’t believe this is happening,” she said. “I’ll just start hugging him in the supermarket and people will be giving us strange looks.”She talked about the wrench of letting her son go when he was three days old. “It was a hard, hard decision. I wanted what was best for him and I knew that was not to get close to me at any level. So I had to break the bond.”Mike Jr was raised during his childhood by his grandmother and by a succession of different female members of the Move organization as part of its communal ethic. “I was a community kid, I had many mothers,” Mike Jr said in a deadpan voice, as though describing the weather.Every Mother’s Day he makes the rounds of his “mothers”. He drives around bearing cards and flowers which he drops off at the homes of at least six women. He rattled off their names: Bert, Sue, Romana, Pam, Mary, Teresa. Now he’ll be able to put flowers in the hands of his true birth mother. He had no idea who she was, nor who his father was, until he was about six or seven when their relationship to him was made clear to him.“I didn’t know she was in prison, I didn’t know any of it. I thought that the person caring for me was my mother.”He looks back on his childhood and recognizes that some aspects of his upbringing were less than ideal. “Who teaches a kid how to brush his teeth or take a bath but his parents. I didn’t know how to wash my hair ’til I was 15.”Through his childhood he was taken to visit both parents in separate prisons, maybe once or twice a year. But for years he had no idea why they were locked up. When friends at school asked about him about them, he would demur or make up stories because he was embarrassed to reveal his ignorance.It was only when he was 14 and sitting with his father in Graterford that the penny dropped. He asked Mike Sr whether there was anybody held in the prison who had done something really bad, like killing somebody.“He didn’t go on to explain,” Mike Jr recalled. “I was frightened. Was he going to be in here forever? I was crying my eyes out trying to figure it out, but I couldn’t explain to him why I was crying. I couldn’t put it into words.”Mikr Jr said it took him years to put the pieces together. “I was left to figure it out for myself, to fend for myself.”But neither son nor mother are ones to dwell on the wounds of the past. I asked Debbie Africa whether she regretted that by her actions as a black liberationist and Move member she had put her son through so much pain.“There are always going to be things in my life that I wish didn’t happen,” she said. “I do truly wish that what happened to my son hadn’t happened, I do truly. But I look at the man he is now, and I love it.”Having spent two days in the company of Mike Africa Jr outside Philadelphia, I can see what she means. He has turned out remarkably poised for someone with his chaotic childhood résumé.He runs his own small business as a landscape gardener, is married and has four children of his own. He is a proud member of Move, has never owned or even held a gun, and his house is comfortable and full of light, though it was notable how much neater it was the second time I visited following Debbie’s release. At last she has begun fulfilling that ritual of parents everywhere: tidying up after their child’s mess.On Mike Jr’s part he’s similarly delighted his mother has turned out as well-balanced, sociable and positive as she is, given 40 years in correctional institutions. “I feel relief. Big relief. I never knew she would come out alive. When people come out of prison they can be sick in the head, but this transition of her coming to my house has been the smoothest major transformation of my life.”Now the challenge is to help Mike Africa Sr secure parole, and so complete the family. His next appearance before the parole board is in September, and they are all already on tenterhooks.A paradox of Debbie Africa’s release is that under her parole terms she is not able to communicate in any form with her husband because he is classified as a co-defendant and thus is out of bounds. The last time they saw each other in the flesh was in 1986. Since then they had been allowed to write to each other from their cells, and in that way managed to keep their bond alive.Now that the letter-writing has been stopped all they have in terms of connection is Mike Jr acting as a go-between. He lets each parent know how the other is doing. He also acted as my go-between, putting questions to his father which Mike Sr answered in a phone call to him. How confident is Mike Sr, I asked, as he heads into the parole hearing?“I’m confident that I’m going to tell the truth. I’m confident that I deserve parole. I’m confident I would never be considered a danger to the community ever again. We never intended for anyone to get hurt, and regret that anyone did get hurt.”Then he added: “What I’m not confident about is what they’re going to do, I have no control over that.”He said the knowledge that his wife was now at home with his son and daughter was a great comfort to him. But it also heightened his desire to be with them all.“Forty years of wanting, anticipating. It’s like Double Dutch. You’re always on the edge of that jump rope, hopping up and down, waiting to get in, waiting for your turn.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/148ec2f1cc740a6227e84ea999f2e27724a61834/0_130_2818_1690/master/2818.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=50bcc5ee93c11e6b7a4f397c7c64af5d","title":"the start up making shirts out of cow poo","story":"Cow waste is a global environmental issue. Jalila Essaïdi and Dutch farmers are tackling the problem by transforming manure into materialsWould you buy a shirt that has been through the back end of a cow? This could be a future fabric choice according to one Dutch startup, which is extracting cellulose from cowpats to make “manure couture”.Jalila Essaïdi believes that a non-vegan future will involve recycling cow manure into cellulose fibre, bioplastics, chemical concentrates and pure water – and being less squeamish about it, too.It is just one of a range of innovations seeking new materials for old applications, as the world tries to wean itself off dirty habits like plastics and hydrocarbons and embrace new technologies.News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@the Biocouture has in fact been around for several years but faces problems of scalability.Essaïdi, who is working with 15 farmers in Eindhoven to create an industrial-scale manure refinery this year, has already won awards for her innovation including $200,000 from the Chivas Venture and an H\u0026ampM Foundation Global Change award. “What makes our process better than the normal textile industry Croft method is that we don’t need high pressure, as the cow stomach is the first step in making the fibre softer. It’s also more energy efficient.”Kim Roetert, public affairs spokeswoman for the ZLTO farmers’ association, believes manure is an inevitable side-effect of animal farming but too much is a real problem. “Just seeing it as a waste product shows limited vision, though,” she says. “Manure has a lot of value, not just in making the ground fertile, but also, as Mestic is doing, making textiles, paper and bioplastic ... or bio-energy. There would be no reason for farmers to commit manure fraud if it were no longer a waste product.”H\u0026ampM Foundation, established by the clothing retailer H\u0026ampM, reckons we will have to get used to such unusual source materials. “The world is already consuming the equivalent of approximately 1.6 planet’s worth of resources every year, and there is an urgent opportunity to shift to a model where valuable materials are recovered,” says communications manager Malin Björne. “Fashionista or not, we are all going to have to get used to sometimes unconventional materials as we cannot rely on cotton, for example.”H\u0026ampM won’t comment on whether it would produce clothes with Mestic, but other manufacturers have told Essaïdi that they would consider using the cost-efficient fabric – but would not declare it explicitly on clothing labels.Some academics believe cellulose taken from dung has even more high-tech potential thanks to the quadruple-bellied digestion power of a cow.Prof Alexander Bismarck, head of the polymer group at the University of Vienna, is working on creating ultra-thin nanocellulose, for instance – although he had to start with elephant dung because none of his students would initially work with cowpats. The key question with manure couture, though, is whether the fabric smells. When the Dutch television channel RTL Nieuws took Mestic on to the streets, some people – after sniffing it – said they wouldn’t mind putting it on. And what about the farmer? Hans Huijbers, chair of the farmers’ associaiton ZLTO which is working with Mestic, wouldn’t mind wearing it. “If I’ve been busy in my cowshed, then I’m already coated in manure!”This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

The result in the presidential vote – being contested by Zanu-PF president Emmerson Mnangagwa and Nelson Chamisa of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change – is due by 4 August but expected sooner.Tensions are rising in the former British colony as opposition fears grow that the election count is being rigged. Monitors have warned of possible violence if the results are contested, and authorities are braced for protests.The latest results announced by the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission showed Zanu-PF had won at least 109 seats, enough for a majority in the 210-seat lower house of parliament. With more results to be declared, the party has a chance of gaining the two-thirds majority that would allow it to change the constitution at will.Chamisa’s MDC had won 41 seats. Analysts blamed isions within the opposition for the low tally. Chamisa claimed in a tweet on Wednesday morning that the ZEC “seeks to release results to buy time \u0026amp reverse the people’s presidential election victory”. The election pitted Chamisa, 40, a lawyer and pastor whose only previous experience of power was a stint as a minister in a coalition government several years ago, against Mnangagwa, 75, a longtime Mugabe aide and head of the ruling Zanu-PF party.Chamisa claimed on Tuesday that he was “winning resoundingly”, a claim repeated by senior officials over the course of the day. His supporters gathered at their party’s headquarters in the capital during the afternoon to celebrate victory despite the lack of official results. Police vehicles equipped with water cannon patrolled nearby.Obert Mpofu, the home minister, said the government was concerned by “high levels of incitement to violence ... by certain iniduals and some political leaders who have declared themselves winners”.If no candidate wins more than half the votes in the presidential election, there will be a runoff in five weeks. Another possibility is negotiations to form a coalition government.The two presidential candidates represent dramatically different ideologies and political styles, as well as generations. Pre-election opinion polls gave Mnangagwa, a dour former spy chief known as “the Crocodile” for his reputation for ruthless cunning, a slim lead over Chamisa, a brilliant if sometimes wayward orator.Support for Zanu-PF historically has been deepest in rural areas, particularly the party’s Mashonaland heartland, where more than two-thirds of Zimbabwe’s 17 million people live.Although the campaign has been free of the systematic violence that marred previous polls, the MDC has repeatedly claimed it has been hindered by a flawed electoral roll, ballot paper malpractice, voter intimidation and handouts to voters from the ruling party. Andrew Makoni of the Zimbabwe Election Support Network (ZESN), a coalition of civil society groups that deployed 6,500 election monitors, said: “The fear is that people are going to be disgruntled to the point where they go into the streets, and then there is a worry what the response will be from the security forces in the country.”The MDC has repeatedly accused the electoral commission of bias and many of their allegations have been supported by independent analysts and experts.Election monitors from the US and the European Union will deliver their preliminary verdicts on the poll on Wednesday.Zimbabwe’s rulers know a fraudulent election would block the country’s reintegration into the international community and deny it the huge bailout package needed to avoid economic meltdown.Almost four decades of rule by Mugabe has left Zimbabwe with a shattered economy, soaring unemployment and crumbling infrastructure.Supporters said the president had won “a landslide victory”.“The MDC are just extremely bad losers,” said Bright Matonga, a businessman and former ruling party minister.

Dr Ruth Caden completed her general practice training in rural Ireland, witnessing the ever-increasing workload with reduced resources that her GP colleagues were facing.“They could often not take holidays as there was no cover, they would do unpaid house calls in the evenings after work. Although they did it largely without complaint, I could see how this could lead to burnout,” Caden says.“The GPs I worked with were tireless in their work for their communities and invested heavily in their practices, some in primary care centres, only for the Government to unilaterally slash the practice income by 38 per cent.”Caden worked in Ireland for six years before leaving for Vancouver Island, Canada. Remuneration and working conditions for GPs are better in places such as Canada and Australia, according to Caden. But if the Government was to make a serious commitment to changing working conditions for GPs, she would consider returning.“So far, unfortunately I have seen nothing to show that they are serious about this, and I have a significant concern that general practice as we know it will be killed off by this Government. This will impact on the poorest and most vulnerable, who disproportionately rely on general practice.”Last home for a holiday in October, Caden sees little hope of returning as working conditions for GPs remain difficult.Dr Dermot Coffey was easily persuaded to leave his homeland in 2002 with his partner due to the “awful working hours” for doctors in Ireland at the time.“The conditions weren’t even the worst they had been – we at least got paid for the hours we worked – but I remember working out we averaged 78 hours a week that whole year, and every fourth week was 100 hours,” he says.Coffey and his partner (now wife) headed for New Zealand where they live with their three children, despite a few stints working in Ireland in 2004 and 2009.A recent holiday to Ireland prompted him to think about his reasons for leaving and roused mixed feelings on returning.“Like a lot of people I imagine I’ve felt the pull back a lot more strongly since we’ve had kids, and although I’ve a brother and his family out here now, the distance seems a lot further than it did when we moved 16 years ago,” he says.“I’ve never been one to hold with the view that medicine is a ‘vocation’, or that Irish graduates should be bonded to the country, but I have felt in more recent times a feeling that we as medics should all be chipping in to help the Irish health system, and a desire to make whatever little difference I could has added to the drawback.”Coffey finished his GP training in 2007, worked as a GP in Wellington until 2016 and has just returned to work in Christchurch after spending two years in Melbourne, where his wife completed training as a geneticist.“Would I come back? I would. I wouldn’t expect perfection but I’d like to see some hope for general practice first.”Motivated less by a desire to avoid the challenging working conditions in Ireland and more by a yearning to care for some of the world’s poorest populations, Commandant Dr Patrick Kelly joined the Defence Forces in 2014 after completing his GP training in Ireland.Kelly is acting senior medical officer with the UN’s Quick Reaction Force, and will leave Syria for a holiday in Ireland in August. He will enjoy a three-week break here before returning to the Golan Heights as part of the UN mission, hosted by the Syrian Arab Republic.The Waterford native became a member of the Order of Malta aged 12 and grew to appreciate caring for people and the human element of healthcare.“A career in the Defence Forces has offered me the opportunity to provide healthcare to people who really need it refugees, internally displaced populations or to persons living in resource-poor settings. I’ve been able to care for various groups from orphans of the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone to internally displaced persons as a result of the Syrian civil war.His current role is to provide for the primary care needs of 130 soldiers, as well as preventing the outbreak of disease, which can occur in people situated in close quarters.His other role is as a doctor of the Quick Reaction Force, which is in effect an emergency service for UN unarmed military observers who are overseeing the area of separation between Israel and the Syrian Arab Republic as part of the UNDOF mandate.Kelly says he may one day consider working in Irish general practice, but for now, on the whole, enjoys the variety offered by his work abroad.“You miss family events, but you have to take the good with the bad,” he says.Dr Cróchán O’Sullivan, consultant interventional cardiologist, returned home to live in Ireland in recent weeks after spending seven years working in Switzerland.The Kildare native graduated in medicine in 2004. Since then he has moved city and country 11 times.In 2011, he went to Switzerland. O’Sullivan wanted to be an interventional cardiologist and there was no training opportunities in Ireland.“The main reason people move is for training, I think,” he says.“When you’re training in Ireland you have a very pessimistic outlook of the future . . . I didn’t see any future in Ireland. I felt that I had to go abroad and make the most of it over there.”Amid the pessimism and lack of training opportunities in his chosen speciality O’Sullivan, a qualified doctor, made the difficult decision to move abroad to train, unpaid.“When you move abroad first you don’t get paid, you don’t get a salary for working for the hospital and have to find your own funding. When I moved to Switzerland first I got a grant from the HSE that lasted a year . . . then I was lucky to get another grant for a year.”Last year, he and his wife had a child, which he says “was the impetus for us to come home”.Looking for a job in Ireland, he spoke to “very disillusioned” colleagues working in the public sector due to consultant pay concerns and limited resources.Having specialised in innovative, new valve procedures in Zurich, O’Sullivan wanted to continue this work in Ireland and private hospitals, with superior resources, offered better opportunities, he says.He has taken up a role in the Bon Secours Hospital Cork and is excited about the positive outlook there. Whereas the outlook within the public sector “appeared to be more negative”, he says.Irish academic fellow in geriatric medicine Dr Mary Ní Lochlainn, who works for the National Health Service in London, says she cannot “imagine ever not being paid for my work or having to chase my due pay” unlike her Irish counterparts.Ní Lochlainn has never worked for the HSE and has only been in Irish hospitals as a medical student, but even as a patient here found the two-tier health system “very troubling”.She chose to move abroad for a number of reasons.“I was influenced by many fantastic consultants in geriatric medicine as a medical student in Trinity, all of whom had spent time training in the UK. So I definitely felt I would go to the UK at some point. I also moved for the training opportunities and to experience the NHS, as well as the more forgiving hours and better working conditions.“The NHS is the most incredible system, I feel deeply privileged to work there. Money is never a consideration in my day-to-day clinical work, nobody mentions insurance, and everyone gets the same treatment regardless of their classcolourcreedbank balance. It is not perfect, with Tory-underfunding, but nevertheless it is a phenomenal institution.”Ní Lochlainn, like junior doctors in Ireland, must move hospitals as part of her training post. But, she only moves between hospitals in south London.“I don’t have to move to opposite ends of the country away from loved ones, moving house regularly, etc. This is a big consideration of mine when I think about moving home,” she says.Most importantly, she believes unequal pay for consultants is a huge factor for Irish doctors abroad. “Why should those of us who qualified later be penalised and paid less for the same work?” she asks. “It is utterly demoralising. I worry about my parents and extended family being in Ireland where the waiting lists are ever growing. Unless we sort out this demoralisation, there will be more empty posts, and no doctors to clear these waiting lists.“I’m not sure the general public realise that they are the ones who will suffer if these issues are not resolved by Government as soon as possible.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"\u0026lsquoScene is now set\u0026rsquo for referendum on Irish unity, says Mary-Lou McDonald\u0026lsquoDeficiencies\u0026rsquo led to non-odourised gas emergency plan being put in place as a resultJuan Manuel Santos acknowledged for role in ending over 50 years of violenceSeven bikers killed so far this year, five on a Sunday\u0026lsquoI want the Taoiseach to step up and do something to protect these women\u0026rsquoAs Kinahans live abroad, trusted lieutenants manage drugs business in RepublicAnti-abortion group says strategy to oppose legalisation should use religious argumentResidents had challenged \u0026lsquofast-track\u0026rsquo decision on development of 500 homes on pitchesTwo options drawn up to avoid closure of road linking Ranelagh and RathminesPassengers complained of pain despite paramedics\u0026rsquo evidence of little vehicle damageJoan Freeman, Gavin Duffy and Patrick Feeney make their pitches to local authorityBoard and developer expect Raheny project to be subject of further legal actionVaradkar confirms all 221 women will qualify for compensationSinn F\u0026eacutein leader does apparent U-turn after previously saying it was not the right climateHealthier diet lowers anxiety and reduced stress levels can aid \u0026lsquoleaky\u0026rsquo gut problemsDue process has been followed and the law must take its course, says justice ministerDriver later convicted of careless driving causing death didn\u0026rsquot know he had hit Stefan Cooper (18)Inquest hears 41 year old motorcyclist died after colliding with large bales of hay"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3582841.1533109157!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"david kitt says his fianna f%C3%A1il family link irrelevant to housing debate","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDavid Kitt: ‘I do think it is sad that so many creativeartisticbright people are being forced to leave this city and the country in general.’ Photograph: Matt KavanaghThe Kitt has gone public on his decision to quit Dublin because the home he rents is being sold as part of a portfolio to a consortium of European investors.He accused Fine Gael of “failing this city and its people massively. And Dublin’s heart and soul is being ripped out and sold to the highest bidder.”On his Facebook page, Kitt posted: “It will be sold or rented no doubt to someone working for Amazon on a base salary of 70k while the people who make this city what it is are forced out to the suburbs or to a city (where) they can afford a reasonable quality of life and where their level of income doesn’t make them feel like a complete failure.”Kitt faced a backlash as a result of his comments with many people pointing out that his father, Tom Kitt, had been a member of the Fianna Fáil government during the boom time period. His uncle Michael, aunt Áine Brady and grandfather Michael snr were also Fianna Fáil politicians.Kitt said it was “bloody typical” of “elements of the media” to bring up his family background and it did not address his essential argument that Dublin was becoming unaffordable for so many people.“I’ve been dealing with a certain tribal spite all my life just because of my family name and it doesn’t have any relevance to this debate whatsoever,” he wrote in an updated Facebook post.“By challenging the present administration by name I was by no means defending or extolling the virtues of previous ones. Certain elements of the media seem to be leaping on this part of what I said rather than discussing the important details – bloody typical.“It’s just tit for tat politicising and highjacking of an important issue. I’m simply a concerned resident and I can guarantee that whatever the party colours of the residing CEO of Ireland PLC, I would have taken issue with them over their handling of the current crisis.“As our President put it ‘the neo-liberal model of unregulated markets, the privatising of the public space and the redirection of active participating citizens with rights to an existence of passive consumers with unlimited needs has exacted a terrible price on our economy and society’.”Kitt also responded to those who said he should go and live in places outside Dublin where the cost of living is cheaper.“To those talking about Dublin not being the centre of the Irish universe, I get it, but that’s not really the point. There’s a whole lot more to this country that I’ll miss beyond Dublin but Una’s article was about Dublin and hence me chiming in as a born and bred Dubliner who is deeply saddened and angered by the way the city is headed and the costs involved.“Maybe there are those in our midst who are happy to see it turn into Googletown and to see the back of lowly artists like myself but judging by the response here I’m not alone and that gives me some hope for the future of the city.”He concluded: “I’m signing out, these posts will self-destruct in 24 hours and we can get back to usual service of strictly music around here, that’s definitely what I’m best at.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3582371.1533063721!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"leo varadkar government can be flexible on backstop","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar  pictured during a media briefing at Government Buildings. Photograph: Tom HonanThe Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has stressed that the Government is prepared to be “flexible” on the exact content of the Border “backstop” but would not compromise on what it must achieve.Mr Varadkar made the comments while speaking to journalists on Tuesday at a briefing at Government Buildings.“When it comes to the backstop, our position has always been what matters is not the detailed legal text, it’s the outcome, and so what we want the backstop to achieve is a guarantee that there won’t be a hard Border between Northern Ireland and Ireland,” Mr Varadkar said.He said that while the Government was “totally enthusiastic” about solving the problem of the post-Brexit Border when the EU and the UK agree on a future relationship, the Irish Government would not back down on its insistence that the backstop is part of a withdrawal treaty between the UK and EU – due to be agreed by mid-October.In the absence of a withdrawal treaty, the UK is scheduled to leave the EU next March without a transition period – meaning that EU laws and agreements would cease to apply to the UK overnight.The backstop agreed between the EU and UK last December provides for regulatory alignment between the Republic and Northern Ireland in order to avoid customs checks. It would come into effect in the absence of a wider Brexit deal providing for a frictionless Border.“We have to have the backstop as well. We have to have that assurance that unless and until a new solution is in place, that there won’t be a Border.“But yes, we can be flexible certainly on the content of it so long as the outcome is the one that we need,” Mr Varadkar said.Senior Government sources said they expect little progress on Brexit in the coming weeks, but that the UK and EU negotiating teams would restart talks in the middle of August in the hope of reaching a breakthrough on the Border issue in September.Sources acknowledge that the British ask – to have the UK effectively remain in the single market for goods – would have advantages for Ireland, but say it is unlikely to be accepted by Paris or Berlin, as it would compromise the EU’s single market rules.Mr Varadkar also indicated that the Irish and British governments will make another push in the autumn to bring the Northern parties back to the table at Stormont, with a view to resuscitating the powersharing institutions before the end of the year.“We would intend in the autumn some time trying again to get the parties in Northern Ireland together. I think the absence of any clarity around Brexit makes that very difficult, but if we can have that in October, I think there is an opportunity certainly before the end of the year to get the assembly and executive up and running,” he said.He said that\u0026nbspa Border poll at this time would be “very isive and unsuccessful”.“Now is not the time to get into all that,” Mr Varadkar said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Yeshiel PanchiaEPA Zimbabwe’s ruling Zanu-PF party has won the majority seats in parliament, results from the electoral commission showed on Wednesday.The report comes a day after the opposition accused the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission’s (ZEC) of deliberately delaying results in Zanu-PF’s favour.The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission results showed President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s Zanu-PF cruising to a big majority after picking up 109 seats against 41 for the opposition Movement for Democratic Change Alliance (MDC).Another 58 seats are yet to be declared.The commission said it will announce the results of the presidential race, pitting Mr Mnangagwa against opposition leader Nelson Chamisa, after all the votes have come in.Zimbabwe’s government increased security on the streets of Harare on Tuesday after tensions rose in the capital in the wake of the MDC’s claims the general election was being rigged.Although millions of Zimbabweans voted peacefully in Monday’s historic election, the situation began to deteriorate within 24 hours because of the commission’s refusal to release preliminary presidential results.In response, the MDC publicly declared that its own parallel count showed that Mr Chamisa had easily beaten Mr Mnangagwa.The move by the MDC Alliance, which comprises five opposition parties, prompted hundreds of its supporters to start wildly celebrating their side’s victory outside its headquarters in Zimbabwe’s capital.During a press conference to announce its victory and outline the rigging concerns, the MDC Alliance’s Tendai Biti said: “The results show beyond reasonable doubt that we have won the election and that the next president of Zimbabwe is Nelson Chamisa”.Mr Biti also claimed that the vice-president - retired General Constantino Chiwenga - who led the military takeover that forced former president Robert Mugabe to resign last November, had issued a directive for the assassination of Mr Chamisa and himself.Both Mr Mnangagwa - who was installed as Zimbabwe’s interim president after Mr Mugabe’s resignation - and Mr Chamisa had said earlier on Tuesday that they were optimistic about the outcome of Monday’s election."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3582279.1533057655!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"japan s heatwave puts its traditions to the test","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe pool at Toshimaen Amusement Park in Tokyo, during Japan’s heatwave. Photograph: Ko SasakiThe New York TimesThe dawn air in Tokyo is still and thick, like a heavy wet overcoat. By early morning, the thermometer is at 28 degrees and starting its climb to a suffocating afternoon peak of 36.In this heat, children surface early. Ours sleep with the air conditioner and fans whirring away through the night, heads lying on rubber ice-pillows. They wake complaining of dry throats.The humidity seeps into futons and clothes and makes the journey from home to train station a sweaty trial. Trains stuffed with perspiring commuters are a great well of rush-hour sullenness.Tokyo summers are rarely pleasant but this year has made everyone a bit neurotic. Heat warnings ticker for days across the TV screen. The weather killed at least 50 people in the city in July alone.The population of Waterford – more than 50,000 people – has been hospitalised with heatstroke. School trips have been called off, outdoor pools closed and summer festivals cancelled.Just before school broke up for holidays, a boy the same age as our oldest fell into a coma and never woke up. He had been out collecting insects in the sun with his classmates.His death panicked some schools into cancelling closing ceremonies in stiflingly hot gymnasiums. Big-city classrooms have air conditioners but their country cousins are often left to nature’s whim.Kids have to be watched, warn the old folk. The children dash out and play for hours, ignoring the telltale signs of heatstroke: tingling extremities, goosebumps, strained breathing, and disorientation.Yet most of the victims are old themselves, passing away unnoticed – sometimes in pairs, such as sisters Shizuko (93) and Miyoko Ogata (84), found lying near each other in their Tokyo flat on July 23rd.Raised in the burnt-out austerity of the post-war years, the elderly often shun air conditioners, either because of the cost or the belief that they weaken the body’s natural defences.Instead, they rely on old tricks: going for walks in the sun to beat the heat downing mugicha (roasted barley tea), cold noodles and heavily salted green beans cooling themselves with paper fans.With heat records tumbling, such traditional remedies are becoming redundant. Another vitamin-rich antidote to the summer – sweetened broiled eel – is running out.Five years ago, after decades of overconsumption, the government designated the eel an endangered species. Prices for it are rising steadily. Japan is the world’s largest consumer.Disappearing fish and overheating planet or not, life goes on. Kids in the park toss baseballs and afterwards scoff kakigori – sweetened shaved ice that is as quintessentially Japanese as sushi.Roads must be fixed. Across Tokyo, men in hard hats descend on potholes and cracks like antibodies around a virus. Some wear clothes fitted with small battery-operated fans.The TV says one-quarter of all skilled construction workers in the country are 65 or older. With the pressure on to finish building before the 2020 Olympics, most work six days a week. The government says it will promote a five-day workweek even as the country struggles with its worst labour crunch in decades. Nobody knows how this is going to be done.In the evening we read how air conditioners are causing summers to heat up even more. Millions of families like ours turn them on to cool down, using more energy, which triggers more emissions.We try opening all the windows in our breezeless apartment. After an hour, the temperature hovers above 26 degrees and the kids toss and turn on damp sheets. The cooler comes back on.In bed, I pick up a story by writer Lafcadio Hearn (1850-1904), probably Ireland’s most famous export to this country. In The Dream of a Summer Day he transports himself back to Japan in the eighth-century.“Summer days were then as now,” he writes, “all drowsy and tender blue, with only some light pure white clouds hanging over the mirror of the sea. Then, too, the hills were the same – far blue soft shapes melting into the blue sky. And the winds were lazy.”As we drift off to sleep, fans humming, the comforting thought comes that whatever wreckage we do, the hills, sea and sky will still be here long after we’re gone."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3582339.1533061847!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"britain calls on france and germany to force sensible brexit deal","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt with his French counterpart, Jean-Yves Le Drian, in Paris on Tuesday. Photograph: Alain JocardAFPGetty ImagesBritain’s foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, has appealed over the heads of Brussels negotiators directly to France and Germany to try to force the European Commission to strike a “sensible and pragmatic” Brexit deal.Ahead of talks with his opposite number in Paris, Mr Hunt accused Brussels of waiting for Britain “to blink” in negotiations as he claimed the chances of the UK leaving the EU without a deal were “increasing by the day”.“That is just a profound misunderstanding of us as a nation,” he said. “There is a real chance of no deal by accident. Everyone is assuming, no, no, no, this will never happen. Well, actually, it could.”Mr Hunt’s warning came as the Élysée Palace announced that British prime minister Theresa May will join French president Emmanuel Macron at his summer home, Fort de Brégançon, in the south of France on Friday when her holiday in the Italian lakes comes to an end.Ms May’s office confirmed that the pre-planned visit would include talks on the prime minister’s Chequers deal but that the pair would then be joined by Philip May and the president’s wife, Brigitte Macron, for a private dinner.In an interview before his trip to France, Mr Hunt warned the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, that his approach to the negotiations would inflict a “breakdown in relations and trust” between Britain and the continent which would be a “profound geo-strategic mistake”.He told the Evening Standard: “The probability of no deal is increasing by the day until we see a change of approach from the European Commission who have this view that they just need to wait and Britain will blink ...“France and Germany have to send a strong signal to the commission that we need to negotiate a pragmatic and sensible outcome that protects jobs on both sides of the Channel because for every job lost in the UK, there will be jobs lost in Europe as well if Brexit goes wrong.”However, Brussels insiders have repeatedly pointed out that Mr Barnier and his Brussels negotiating team are only acting on the orders of France, Germany and the rest of the 27 EU countries. Any inflexibility originates from the nation states.France has taunted the UK by offering to roll out the red carpet to British-based financial firms after Brexit, but Mr Hunt said a no-deal Brexit would be an economic “tragedy” for both countries.“If it became harder for European businesses to access finance, that is far from trivial,” he said, alluding to the flow of money from the City of London, which could become more difficult to access if there was no agreement.“The City itself would find a way to thrive, whatever the outcome of the Brexit negotiations. If it became a low-tax, low-regulation offshoot fully outside the EU, it would find a way to thrive in those circumstances. But for European businesses the impact would be profound,” Mr Hunt said. –  Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

Previous dry years mean the water table is low and wells have run dry. The drought has struck 20 provinces, with the worst affected in the north and west.More than 50,000 have already been driven off the land to the city of Herat.Families fleeing the drought last week told the  the crisis was likely to drive more Afghans abroad to seek a better life.The drought comes on top of worsening violence in the country\u0027s long-running conflict and a struggling economy.Large numbers of livestock have died and families have little to eat, while the harvest is expected to fail totally in weeks.One farmer called Ghulam told the  he was facing catastrophe and would consider joining a militant group if it meant his son would not starve.“ I can assure you that some nights, none of these families have even bread to eat, and they go to sleep hungry.

if access was required for engineering work, if there was a failure with infrastructure such as signalling or points, or if there was an unavoidable incident such as a passenger falling ill - and said they were contractually obliged to adjust services for safety reasons such as speed restrictions.It also argued that it was difficult to mitigate against certain causes of delays such as staff sickness, and said any driver involved in an operational incident had to take a set amount of time off work.The ASA said consumers would expect Gatwick Express to achieve the stated journey time barring exceptional or unforeseeable circumstances outside their control.10 simple secrets to saving money on UK rail faresIt said: Whilst we acknowledged that a proportion of services were delayed due to exceptional or unforeseeable circumstances outside of Gatwick Express\u0027s control, such as track faults, fatalities and power supply failures, we considered that a significant proportion of services were delayed for reasons that were within Gatwick Express\u0027s control.As such, we concluded that the claims \u0027Non-stop to Victoria station in half an hour\u0027 and \u0027in just 30 minutes\u0027 had not been substantiated and were misleading.It ruled that the ads must not appear again, adding: We told Gatwick Express to remove the claims \u0027Non-stop to Victoria station in half an hour\u0027 and \u0027in just 30 minutes\u0027 unless they could achieve that journey time in most cases, save for exceptional and unforeseeable circumstances outside of Gatwick Express\u0027s control.Gatwick Express is part of the Govia Thameslink Railway franchise, which also includes Southern, Thameslink and Great Northern.The operator has suffered major disruption on certain routes in recent years caused by a number of factors, including industrial disputes, a shortage of drivers, infrastructure failures and the introduction of new timetables on May 20. Please review our commenting policyFormer EDL leader Tommy Robinson freed as judges quash contempt ruling Comment: Ivanka Trump\u0026#39s choice of politics over fashion shows where power now lies in this White HouseBritish Jews believe Labour has \u0026#39declared war\u0026#39 on them, says party MP as Jeremy Corbyn under mounting pressure over anti-Semitism rowAlan Sugar comes under fire for \u0026#39sexist\u0026#39 tweet about a shopkeeperQuestions raised over identity of war dead repatriated from North Korea to USFreemasons to allow women members for first time -

Disease outbreaks that begin overseas, as seen with the Ebola epidemic, can quickly affect the UK and UK interests.“This impact can be either direct, or indirect through the loss of regional stability negatively affecting trade, causing migration pressures and creating ungoverned spaces in which terrorism and criminality can flourish.”Pandemics | The cost of a global outbreakThe plan says UK aid that builds up health services in the world\u0027s poorest countries goes “to protecting UK citizens from significant disease threats and securing the UK’s long term national security.”Any new deadly epidemic is likely to come from an animal disease infecting humans. Around 60 per cent of all human diseases and three quarters of all new and emerging infectious diseases are these zoonotic diseases. Recent examples include Ebola and H5N1 bird flu.As growing populations encroach on natural habitats and developing countries demand more animal foods, there will be increasing overlap between humans, domestic livestock and wildlife that could see new diseases jump from one group to another.An outbreak infecting UK livestock of crops could also be highly costly and damaging, the strategy says.Global health - Major threats to UK populationThe strategy says that a deliberate biological attack on the UK is currently judged unlikely. But it says such an attack on the UK or its armed forces “are aspects of this risk picture that may become more likely over the longer term”.Conflicts or economic crises also risk increasing the threat from diseases as health services collapse and immunisation programmes halt for diseases such as polio, diptheria and measlesIn the long term, “climate change will also increase the likelihood of pests and vector-borne diseases spreading to new areas of the globe, as they and their carriers are able to survive in countries where environments would previously not have supported their circulation”.Mr Wallace said: “Britain is a global nation, open to the world and outward facing. This means we are exposed to these risks, both at home and overseas, but it also gives us the opportunity to work with international partners to tackle such threats at source.”Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Pandemics and epidemicsFormer EDL leader Tommy Robinson freed as judges quash contempt ruling Comment: Ivanka Trump\u0026#39s choice of politics over fashion shows where power now lies in this White HouseBritish Jews believe Labour has \u0026#39declared war\u0026#39 on them, says party MP as Jeremy Corbyn under mounting pressure over anti-Semitism rowAlan Sugar comes under fire for \u0026#39sexist\u0026#39 tweet about a shopkeeperQuestions raised over identity of war dead repatriated from North Korea to USFreemasons to allow women members for first time - if they joined as menWatch the moment a car park collapses in Dallas\u0026#39Road rage\u0026#39 death: Man, 21, arrested on suspicion of murder as father killed after clash with motoristThieves escape in motorboat with Swedish crown jewelsLove Island winner Jack says he will marry co-star Dani Dyer \u0026#39next year\u0026#39Zimbabwe elections: Crowds gather for opposition protest ahead of presidential resultsPassengers escape death as AeroMexico plane crashes in Durango, MexicoComment: From smart meters to the Millennium Dome, why is Britain so uniquely awful at big projects?Comment: The Government is being shamefully flippant about our school exclusions crisisDavid Mundell: SNP and Tory ministers need to stop rowing and \u0026#39pull together\u0026#39 to exploit Brexit trade benefitsUS judge blocks release of 3D gun blueprints amid uproarBBC don\u0026#39t televise Monty Python today because it shows how bad modern comedy is, John Cleese claimsRussian journalists killed in Central African RepublicBreast cancer treatment can double heart risks   Gatwick Express told to ditch \u0026#39Get there in 30 minutes\u0026#39 claim as one in five services is delayed We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"zanu pf wins parliamentary majority zimbabwe elections","story":"Zimbabwe\u0027s ruling Zanu PF party won the majority of seats in parliament after sweeping rural constituencies by huge margins, official results showed on Wednesday, setting the stage for President Emmerson Mnangagwa\u0027s victory.Presidential results are due to be announced, with security forces on high alert as supporters of opposition leader Nelson Chamisa insist they will occupy the streets of Harare if their candidate does not win.Mr Chamisa has already claimed victory and accused the electoral commission of fixing results to favour Mr Mnangagwa. Riot police equipped with water cannon looked on as several hundred MDC supporters gathered outside Mr Chamisa\u0027s MDC party headquarters in central Harare and electoral commission where results were being announced.Tererai Obey Sithole, a 26 year old MDC member, told The : “We are not going to accept any result that is against the victory of Nelson Chamisa.”“We already have the results.

The MDC won in most urban centres, where it enjoys majority support.The MDC accused the election commission on Tuesday of deliberately delaying results of this week\u0027s vote to favour the ruling party, reporting irregularities in the first poll since the removal of Robert Mugabe in a bloodless November coup.Election observers from southern African nations on Wednesday commended Zimbabwe for a peaceful, orderly election, though they also identified some shortcomings in how it was conducted.The Southern African Development Community said Zimbabweans had the opportunity to exercise their constitutional right, and applauded the government for allowing more international observers for Monday\u0027s vote.Urging protesters to refrain from violence, the group aslo referred to criticism of the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission for the late release of the voters\u0027 roll, as well as bias toward the ruling party by state media and traditional leaders.Please review our commenting policyFormer EDL leader Tommy Robinson freed as judges quash contempt ruling Comment: Ivanka Trump\u0026#39s choice of politics over fashion shows where power now lies in this White HouseBritish Jews believe Labour has \u0026#39declared war\u0026#39 on them, says party MP as Jeremy Corbyn under mounting pressure over anti-Semitism rowAlan Sugar comes under fire for \u0026#39sexist\u0026#39 tweet about a shopkeeperQuestions raised over identity of war dead repatriated from North Korea to USFreemasons to allow women members for first time - if they joined as menWatch the moment a car park collapses in Dallas\u0026#39Road rage\u0026#39 death: Man, 21, arrested on suspicion of murder as father killed after clash with motoristThieves escape in motorboat with Swedish crown jewelsLove Island winner Jack says he will marry co-star Dani Dyer \u0026#39next year\u0026#39Passengers escape death as AeroMexico plane crashes in Durango, MexicoComment: From smart meters to the Millennium Dome, why is Britain so uniquely awful at big projects?Comment: The Government is being shamefully flippant about our school exclusions crisisDavid Mundell: SNP and Tory ministers need to stop rowing and \u0026#39pull together\u0026#39 to exploit Brexit trade benefitsUS judge blocks release of 3D gun blueprints amid uproarBBC don\u0026#39t televise Monty Python today because it shows how bad modern comedy is, John Cleese claimsRussian journalists killed in Central African RepublicBreast cancer treatment can double heart risks   Gatwick Express told to ditch \u0026#39Get there in 30 minutes\u0026#39 claim as one in five services is delayed NHS mortuaries so lax families are at \u0026#39significant risk\u0026#39 of burying the wrong bodies, watchdog finds  We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/31/17/apple.jpg","title":"apple after hours stock earnings shares trading market value worth","story":"Created with Sketch.The company managed to beat expectations by selling fewer, but more expensive, iPhonesClick to followThe Independent OnlineThe company posted better than expected earningsShares of Apple\u0026nbsphave jumped after the company posted quarterly results that beat out Wall Street targets while forecasting revenue above expectations in the current quarter.Those results were fuelled by the sales of their signature product - the iPhone - and revenue services such as the App Store, Apple Music, and iCloud.The company saw growth in its stock of 3.3 per cent in after hours trading.The immediate spike in shares was not enough, however, to make Apple the first company to be valued at one trillion, but the company has come very close to that moniker and continued growth in future quarters could potentially push it over that line.The company was able to beat sales estimates by selling fewer iPhones, and instead getting the more expensive models to fly off the shelves, analysts say. Even so, the company sold slightly fewer units with 41.3 million sold compared to the expectation that 41.8 million would be sold.Apple’s postings showed that the average iPhone sold cost $724 (£552), far outweighing previous expectations that the average price would come in at $694, according to the data providing service FactSet. During the quarter, an Apple spokesperson told Reuters, the best selling model was the IPhone X, which retails for $999.Apple unveils the iPhone XApple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone X during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone X during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, shows Animoji during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, speaks during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, speaks about the iPhone X during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone X during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone X during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, shows Animoji during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, speaks during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, speaks about the iPhone X during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple, the world’s most valuable technology company, forecast revenues of between $60b and $62bn for its fourth fiscal quarter, a figure that will include any advance sales of the company’s coming new models of iPhone.The earnings report is good news for the technology company, which last week avoided a tech sector sell-off that saw shareholders dropping stake in Facebook, Twitter, and Netflix amid concerns about the future growth of the companies.While Apple has a market valuation above $900bn, the company could be facing rocky roads ahead if President Donald Trump imposes tariffs that impact the import of its devices into the US.

Or is he Ed Sheeran? Whatever the answer, it’s clear the public imagination is still holding out for a heroClick to followThe Independent OnlineMark Billingham has become a talisman because – almost miraculously, as if blessed by the gods – he has been able to walk through shot and shell, IEDs and landmines, and come out the other end, more or less unscathedHe was providing protection to Tom Cruise at the time. Summer of 2002, in Rome. Time off from shooting The Last Samurai. He had mapped it all out, talked it over with the paparazzi beforehand, so it was no sweat. They would pause for a minute or so in front of the Excelsior, the snappers would politely keep their distance, and then he and Cruise would sedately enter the hotel. Everyone would be happy. And the plan went completely to plan. They stopped. The paparazzi took their pictures. Box-office star plus bodyguard gracefully two-step in the direction of the hotel. No drama. Until the point where they’re about to go through the door.\u0026nbspMark “Billy” Billingham spots this blue streak coming towards them from the right out of the corner of his eye. Instinct honed by years of training, he simultaneously wraps a protective arm around Tom Cruise and grabs hold of the blue streak with the other one. And all three of them tumble into the foyer of the hotel, with Billingham wrestling both of them to the floor. Then Tom says, “Billy, you can let me up now. I want to introduce you to my girlfriend.” Penelope Cruz – Cruise’s then partner – was the blue streak.She was impatient to see Tom. Maybe she should just have warned his bodyguard before popping up unscripted.Another time he was escorting Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie down the backstairs of the Waldorf in New York. Everyone was waiting for them at the front. Billingham’s simple plan was to take them out the back down the service stairs. What could possibly go wrong? He was leading them from the front. Ready for anything. Then he tripped and fell down the stairs, knocking himself unconscious. Pitt and Jolie rushed down and held his head and nursed him till he came around. He was seeing stars in more ways than one.It probably wouldn’t happen in Mission: Impossible. In reality everything always goes wrong and you just have to adapt. Billingham has been an A-list bodyguard to Michael Caine and Russell Crowe and he hasn’t lost anyone yet. He says the main difference with\u0026nbspCrowe is that “you spend a lot of your time trying to stop him picking fights”. Now one of the stars of the rugged Channel 4 show SAS: Who Dares Wins, he is an ace sniper and served in the SAS for nearly two decades. Earned an MBE for leading a hostage-saving mission. Tracked down, acquired\u0026nbspand delivered mass killers to the War Crimes Tribunal. And is even now planning to take on human traffickers and slavers around the world. He has paid his dues. He is probably about as close as you can get to a real-life hero. One who is still breathing, that is.Billingham with Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt and their children\u0026nbspin Chicago in 2007 (Rex)The “hero” is the ultimate myth, the “monomyth” as Joseph Campbell would say (in The Hero With A Thousand Faces), going all the way back to the Babylonian Epic of Gilgamesh, through The Odyssey and The Aeneid, and all the way up to Mission: Impossible and Jack Reacher. The “hero” – whether engraved in stone or encoded in digitally enhanced celluloid – never dies. Real heroes always do, ultimately, but some live long enough to tell the tale. Here we run into the major dilemma for the hero: can he be the narrator of his own story? Can he speak in the first person of his own exploits in war? And is he necessarily a “he” anyway?T.E Lawrence (aka Lawrence of Arabia) pulled it off in his autobiographical Seven Pillars of Wisdom. So too, more recently Andy McNab, also ex-SAS, in Bravo Two Zero, and Tom Marcus in Soldier Spy. But there is a grand tradition of the unsung hero. A decent working definition of the hero is: someone who says nothing (or not much) and confines himself to pure doing. He acts and then keeps his mouth shut. A hero needs a Homer. This is only partly because, more often than not, there is a legal gag on telling tales. He is subject to the Official Secrets Act or the equivalent. But he is also constrained by the code of modesty. The hero, if he says anything, is always self-deprecating. Thus Mark Billingham’s funny, oblique, mock-heroic stories above.On the other hand Billy is very good at swearing. His daughter reckons he has a touch of Tourette’s. “I’ll try not to swear too much, I really will,” he tells the audience at Prince’s Hall in Aldershot for An Evening with Mark Billingham, “but I’ll probably f***ing fail.”Rambo (in David Morrell’s First Blood, immortalised by Sylvester Stallone) set fire to an entire town because he couldn’t find the words to express his post-Vietnam sense of guilt and horror. Thus the reality of the hero is that he has to say something. Self-repression leads straight into PTSD. Hero turns anti-hero. Billingham was inspired to join up by tales of veterans returning from the Falklands. Now 53, then a teenage rebel, troublemaker\u0026nbspand discontent. Brought up on a council estate in the Midlands, he became an artful dodger, going about stealing hats from old guys, until one old guy ran after him, caught him, and persuaded him to go to his gym and learn to box.\u0026nbspHe thought of joining the Marines, but ultimately signed up with the Parachute regiment because “they sounded wilder”. He’d never been out of Walsall and suddenly he found himself jumping out of planes in places he’d hadn’t even heard of. Billingham is above all a survivor. He says it’s “90 per cent luck and 10 per cent\u0026nbspskill – or maybe it’s 100 per cent\u0026nbspluck, I don’t know”. Billingham has become a talisman because – almost miraculously, as if blessed by the gods – he has been able to walk through shot and shell, IEDs and landmines, and come out the other end, more or less unscathed. “I can survive in bad places,” as he puts it. The most time he has spent in hospital has been with a dose of cerebral malaria.\u0026nbspThe true hero is vulnerable, mortal. Not a Marvel superhero. The army prizes the hard man. Maybe we all do. Which is why we sign up for SAS: Who Dares Wins or the adjacent “Break-Point Prime Evolution” regime, devised by Ollie Ollerton. We want the abs bordering on armour plating, like a shield or suit of armour. So the bullets will just bounce off. Unbreakable. That is the myth, at any rate. But Billingham tells a story of one of his comrades in Belize, a man who was famously “hard as nails”. The toughest guy in the whole regiment. He marches off into the jungle one day and not long after they hear him screaming. A group of men, led by Billingham, go trooping off after him, assuming he has been taken captive, and is almost certainly being tortured. They locate him quickly enough. No sign of the enemy. But the guy has a thorn in his ear and it’s killing him. Sometimes the worst thing about being a hero is you get dirty and sweaty and you can’t get a shower.25 new films to look out for in 2018 that aren\u0027t sequelsCast: Ethan Hawke, Amanda Seyfried, Cedric the Entertainer825 The Miseducation of Cameron Post1025 City of Lies1325 The House with a Clock in Its Walls1625 Bad Times at the El Royale2525 Holmes and WatsonCast: Ethan Hawke, Amanda Seyfried, Cedric the Entertainer825 The Miseducation of Cameron Post1025 City of Lies1325 The House with a Clock in Its Walls1625 Bad Times at the El Royale2525 Holmes and WatsonBut the big news about SAS: Who Dares Wins is that the fourth series, now in preparation, will have women recruits as well as men. No reason why they can’t jump out of helicopters or rappel down a mountain. You don’t necessarily have to look like Bruce Willis or Arnie Schwarzenegger.\u0026nbsp“Hero” is now both masculine and feminine. You can’t plausibly say “heroine” any more. It sounds too much like a weepy sentimental movie or a damsel in distress.Women fight in the front line. The Kurdish Peshmerga (which translates as “those who face death”) includes a lot of women fighters. Asia Ramazan Antar was one of the fallen in the fight against Isis so too was Anna Campbell, from Lewes. On the more mythic side, we have Wonder Woman and X-(Wo)Men. This is the age of the rogue female.\u0026nbspI spoke recently to Ruth Shackleton: distant relative of the Antarctic explorer, she spent 20 years in the RAF, rose to squadron leader, did tours of duty in all the usual hellholes, and orchestrated the Red Arrows. She totally denies ever being a hero. She reckons her most heroic moment was when, with Scud rockets from Baghdad raining down, she helped a comrade (who had temporarily lost it) put on her chemical protection suit. Which demonstrates grace under pressure.Do heroes need to be less modest? The ancient myth of the hero was largely to do with defining and asserting masculinity. Aeneas dumps Dido. Theseus uses Ariadne and her thread to negotiate the labyrinth – where he slays the Minotaur – and then sails away. Ian Fleming’s James Bond follows the same pattern. The contemporary woman hero is fighting back, mainly against patriarchy. “This is the thing about bad guys,” says Stephanie Broadribb, author of Deep Down Dead (shortlisted for the International Thriller Writers’ Best First Novel award at ThrillerFest in New York, the winner of which is announced today). “They are generally guys.” She is a skilled horsewoman who trained as a bounty hunter to provide authenticity for her ass-kicking protagonist. And wields a mean taser. “I knew when I created Lori Anderson, a woman action hero, that she would never have to be rescued by a man.” She was influenced by Thelma and Louise, re-runs of The Saint, but above all by The Avengers (the TV series) in which Emma Peel is on a par with Steed when it comes to karate.There are other variations on the hero archetype, Carrie Gracie of the BBC for one, or the suffragettes or Stella Rimington, ex-head of MI5. I would propose Sofia Helin, who plays Saga Noren in The Bridge, but is also one of the extremely modest leaders of the Swedish #MeToo movement (“SilenceAction”). But it still comes down to being able to outfight, outwit, or outgeneral the opposition. And being prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice. Billingham sees no reason why women can’t get into the SAS itself: “If you can pass the test, you’re in.”I was brought up on a diet of highly heroic post-Second World War comics, like Valiant and Victor (who could forget Captain Hurricane?) But at a certain point I decided the hero was uncool. Was he not, after all, a flag-waver for the military industrial complex? Verging on imperialist? Behind every Aeneas there is an Augustus or a Caesar. Winston Churchill is liable to be co-opted by every tub-thumping would-be dictator (as per Boris Johnson with his sub-Kipling rhetoric of “sending our vanguard into battle with the white flags fluttering”.) The hero, like Napoleon, can become a tyrant. And yet the hero deserves resurrection.Why Now That’s What I Call Music still has a place in pop culture‘Spiderman’ who scaled flats to save child begins job as firefighterHumiliation: The pain of character assassination in the public eyeAt one level, maybe nobody is a hero (who can coincide with a myth?). At another, maybe everyone is, or would like to be (sometimes just getting out of bed in the morning is an act of heroism). Perhaps Gareth Southgate and the England football team all are. Anyone on a quest or a mission. Most of my personal heroes are surfers (take a bow, Ted Deerhurst). We haven’t yet given up on knight errants, Shane-style lonesome cowboys, and Liam Neeson. Lee Child, creator of the globally bestselling Jack Reacher series, says of vigilante loner heroes – who, like the ronin, are wandering samurai that have no lord or master and don’t belong to any conventional force – that “we invented them tens of thousands of years ago because we desperately wanted them to exist.\u0026nbspWe continue to reinvent them in flimsily disguised forms because we need them to be there, as a matter of catharsis and consolation.”Paul Hughes reckons we need them more than ever. He is a multilingual ex-RAF intelligence officer turned forensic scientist (and CEO of PH Interim) who goes about the country inspiring young people in schools with his non-fictional tales of bravery – not least in dealing with challenges they might face at school. Hughes says that “if you ask anyone who their hero is these days, they are more likely to answer Ed Sheeran or one of those characters from Love Island”. He argues that we are apt to think, just because we are sitting on a sofa and watching television, that the world is a safe place. It isn’t. “Today’s teenagers were born after 911. They haven’t seen Srebrenica or the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. People forget so quickly – they need to be reminded.”I’ve often said (mostly to others, sometimes to myself), “Don’t be a hero!” Which is fair enough, mostly. Avoid pointless heroics, if possible. Jaw-jaw not war-war. But the hero, of whichever gender, Billingham or Bond, Thelma or Louise, remains rooted in the collective unconscious. Maybe it’s just as well. So long as we have enemies, we will still need heroes.Andy Martin is the author of ‘Reacher Said Nothing: Lee Child and the Making of Make Me’\u0026nbspand teaches at the University of Cambridge.

She remembers wavering on the brink of death and telling God that she had to rejoin the living.A 21-year-old law student at the time, working at a women’s centre in West Berlin, she was nowhere near finished with the world.“\u0027I want to go back,’ I told God,” Ates, now a 55-year-old lawyer and women’s rights activist who is also studying to become an imam, recalled of that afternoon. “I still have a mission.”More than three decades later, that mission came to fruition a year ago when she stood before a congregation of Muslim men and women kneeling side by side as they recited prayers in the Ibn Rushd-Goethe Mosque – the first Muslim house of worship in Germany where women, many with dark ponytails and long curls uncovered, are recognised as imams.Any Muslim is welcome to join: men or women, Sunni or Shia, transgender, gay or straight.“We want to send a signal to political Islam,” Ates, wearing a long, white tunic trimmed with gold, told a packed room on the opening day, when journalists outnumbered worshippers.“We want to show that another Islam exists, that has nothing to do with terrorism.”Over the past year, that something has grown into a congregation of 35 core members – many of them women. They help Ates organise weekly prayers, give tours to school groups and hold seminars on democracy, love and the concept of an open, tolerant interpretation of Islam and a forgiving God.Religious groups join together for interfaith collaborationHere\u0027s a reminder of what Donald Trump said about Muslims in the past When is Eid al-Fitr and how do Muslim people celebrate it?During Eid, it\u0027s important to reflect on Islam in BritainThree years after a wave of more than 1 million, mostly Muslim, migrants arrived in Germany seeking asylum, culture wars over religious identity and the possible threat posed by Islam have led to a rise in nationalist, populist movements.The government of Chancellor Angela Merkel was nearly brought down this week over a dispute with the Bavarian sister of her conservative party, which sought to turn back refugees at the border.The Bavarian conservatives of the Christian Social Union joined the far-right party Alternative for Germany in promoting a narrative that refugees pose a threat, after several highly publicised killings and sexual assaults in the country led to charges against Muslim migrants.The party ordered that crosses be displayed in all public buildings in the state, and Merkel’s new interior minister, Horst Seehofer – also a Bavarian – declared: “Islam is not a part of Germany.”Against the backdrop of these debates, Ates sees the survival of the Ibn Rushd-Goethe Mosque, which recently celebrated its first anniversary, as proof that Muslims living in Germany need and are open to an interpretation of Islam that reflects the values of the Western society in which they live.Tombs in the centre of Tarung village serve as handy laundry driers on a sunny Sumba morning.Each tomb in Waihola village (near Nihiwatu) represents massive expense in terms of ritual sacrifices for local families who observe the ancestral Marapu religionCatholic imagery on a tomb in Waihola village (near Nihiwatu) shows how imported religions seem often to have blended almost seamlessly with the ancient Marapu religion.In an effort to minimise economic strain the law stipulates that only 5 buffalo can be sacrificed at funerals - in reality many more are often killed and a big buffalo with a wide horn spread will often fetch close to $4,000.A royal tomb in Pasunga village is flanked by the smaller tombs where servants were buried (sometimes buried alive!) alongside their master.Village dogs - currently s but, more than likely, part of some future feast - on tombs in Pasunga village.A horse - another part of Sumba\u0027s ancestral warrior heritage - grazes among the tombs in Pasunga village.A more humble modern style tomb stands next to the kings burial place in Galu Bakul, Anakalang.A village dog relaxes on a tomb in Prai Ijing village.While still considered sacred the tombs very quickly become part of normal village life.

The Arabs will never allow it,\u0027” she said. Instead, hundreds of people from across Germany, Europe and abroad have visited or attended services.Those most committed to its survival have made donations, some as much as €500, Ates said, emphasising that the mosque receives no public funding.“Even atheists come here and appreciate this place, as a spiritual place, a place of peace,” she said recently, standing barefoot on the pale carpet of the mosque. “I had hoped, but never dreamed, that so many atheists would be interested. That was a positive surprise.”The criticism and rejection, in its fierceness and intensity, less so. Even before the mosque opened, her personal Facebook page and that of the mosque were flooded with derogatory messages and even some death threats.“May Allah put you on the right path, or destroy you,” someone writing under the name Xalo Bero said, in one of the friendlier remarks.Protection provided by the police and paid for by the city government, in place since she published the book Islam Needs a Sexual Revolution\u0026nbspin 2009, was increased to a personal security detail after the heightened threats on her life.Days after the mosque opened, Dar al-Ifta, an influential arm of the Egyptian Justice Ministry that issues religious verdicts, denounced the mosque and declared that allowing men and women to pray alongside one another violated Islamic law.Turkish news outlets reported that the mosque was a terrorist organisation with links to the Islamist cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Turkey blames for a coup attempt in 2016 against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.Despite a video message in which Ates states that the “the Rushd-Goethe mosque has nothing to do with the Gulen movement”, the rumours have persisted.She blames them for the fact that few Turks have joined the congregants, although they make up the vast majority of the estimated 4.5 million Muslims living in Germany.Despite the demands of running the mosque, she takes Arabic classes and continues to work as a lawyer. She considers achieving a degree in Islamic theology important to her recognition in the Muslim community.“I want to understand the words and know the meanings so no one can say, ‘She’s just a lawyer,\u0027” she said.Born in Istanbul to a Turkish mother and a Kurdish father, she emigrated with her parents to what was then West Berlin in the late 1960s, part of the first large wave of Muslim immigrants who came to fill the blue-collar jobs needed to rebuild the German economy after World War II.Ates was 6 when she and her four siblings moved into a one-room apartment with their parents.As she learned German and excelled in school, Ates says, she came to understand that it was not the crowded living conditions that she found suffocating, but the realisation that because of her gender, she was not afforded the freedoms of her non-Muslim peers.“I was a girl,” she wrote in 2007 in Zeit Online. “I embodied the family’s honour, and my hymen – for a long time I didn’t even know what that was – was more important to the whole family than my brain.”At 17, she fled her home, graduated from high school and started studying law at the Free University of Berlin. To support herself, she worked as a counsellor in a women’s centre.In September 1984, she was speaking with a client when a man wearing a trench coat entered the centre, pulled out a pistol and fired three shots. One hit the client in the stomach, killing her the other struck Ates.She survived to see the suspect, a Turkish bricklayer, acquitted for lack of evidence, which enraged her. For years, she struggled with the psychological fallout of the attack.Violent clashes leave ’86 dead’ in NigeriaFrench far-right group arrested over alleged plot to attack MuslimsShe returned to her faith, but was again alienated by Berlin’s traditional, conservative mosques, where women were forced to pray behind a curtain. She decided that if the faith community that she needed did not exist, she would create it.It took years of planning, fundraising and looking for a suitable space. While she received support from like-minded liberal Muslims from Switzerland to the US, the critics have remained.What keeps her going is the encouragement, not only from social media postings, but also from the visitors who go out of their way to find a place of worship that previously existed only in their dreams.​Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2014/04/11/16/world-in-pic-5.jpg","title":"theme parks children office slides rollercoaster pub adrenaline fun","story":"Created with Sketch.When most of us spend the majority of our weeks working, worrying about finances, trying to stay on top of life admin and suffering from increasingly poor mental health,\u0026nbspthere is nothing more precious than a place intended simply for funClick to followThe Independent OnlineRollercoasters invoke \u0027eustress\u0027, a kind of stress that is not bad for you – rather it is pleasurable and many of us actively seek it outThat moment at the top of a rollercoaster – after the slow upwards build, when you’re high above the treeline, dangling, stomach clenched, looking down – is hard to compare to anything else.

You can bet that any resort you visit will be filled with varied and never ending things to discover.Whether it’s the thrill-inducing rides, the milder water rides, the inventive “worlds” or the over-priced but delicious doughnut and ice-cream combos that draw you in, it’s hard to deny that theme parks offer something for everyone. They are often marketed as family attractions, something for the kids, but they are places that can captivate and entertain at any age.I don’t feel like I enjoy theme parks any less now that I’m an (admittedly childish) adult – if anything, I enjoy them more. My mood is not as volatile (kids have the tendency to be excited one moment and in a strop the next), I don’t tire at the end of the day and I can appreciate things I didn’t as a kid – the engineering that’s gone into creating a place (not that I know anything about engineering), the small details, the truly fine art and craftsmanship.And as far as I’m concerned theme parks are a work of art. As Bill Watterson, creator of the cartoon strip Calvin and Hobbes, believed, I couldn’t agree more that there is no such thing as high art and low art – rather creations that either speak to people or don’t. And what could speak to people more than a place created for the sole purpose of having fun?Kingda\u0026nbspKa, New Jersey, is the world’s tallest rollercoaster at 456ft – higher than Big BenAfter all, when most of us spend the majority of our weeks working, worrying about finances, trying to stay on top of life admin and suffering from increasingly poor mental health, there is nothing more precious than escapism. Our cities, towns and villages revolve around practicality – offices for working in, shops for buying things, gyms for exercising. Most of what surrounds us is mundane – it’s pretty wonderful in this context that we have places created for the sole purpose of having fun.But while some of the elements of enjoyment are\u0026nbspeasy to recognise as such – good food, fun family rides and the opportunity to take a picture with a lifesize Donald Duck – what is it that is so enticing about rollercoasters? By definition they should evoke sheer terror, yet we absolutely adore them\u0026nbspand queue for hours on end for the two-minute scare they provide.Richard Stephens, a senior lecturer in psychology at Keele University, argues that rollercoasters invoke a good kind of stress, called “eustress” – a word that has the same route as “euphoria”. This kind of stress is not bad for you – rather it is pleasurable and many of us actively seek it out.Eustress can also explain why we like being scared in other contexts, such as on ghost trains or in live action horror mazes. It makes sense that we must all have different ways of seeking this kind of good stress – which is why some people love rollercoasters and some people can’t stand them. I’m a big fan of rollercoasters but the thought of scuba ing absolutely terrifies me. But for others I imagine this is a “eustressful” experience.For the ultimate thrillseeker, the fastest rollercoaster in the world is currently the Formula Rossa at Ferrari World in Abu Dhabi, which reaches an eye-watering 150mph. The second fastest, Kingda Ka at Six Flags Great Adventure in New Jersey, is also the world’s tallest,\u0026nbspat 456ft. To put that into some perspective, Big Ben in London stands shorter at 320ft.But Kingda Ka will not hold its title for long, as a new coaster, Skyscraper, is set to open in Florida in 2020 and will reach 500ft, plus have the steepest drop of any rollercoaster in the world.And lastly the longest rollercoaster, the Steel Dragon 2000, at Nagashima Spa Land in Japan is a whopping 8,133ft. It is the only existing rollercoaster to break the 8,000ft threshold, and it lasts for a whole four minutes.With rides becoming increasingly complex and impressive, it’s fascinating to see where things all started. The first commercial rollercoaster in the world, Switchback Railway, opened in 1884 in Coney Island, New York. It kickstarted the growth of attractions in the US, and before long Coney Island housed a few similar rides. The oldest acknowledged theme park was also located in the US:\u0026nbspSanta Claus Land opened in Indiana in 1935, and included many rides themed around the big\u0026nbspman in red.If you’d like a taste of an ancient theme park,\u0026nbspthe oldest\u0026nbspstill in operation can be found in Klampenborg, Denmark. Bakken opened in 1583 and has more than 150 attractions, including a wooden rollercoaster built in 1932. Denmark is also the home of Lego, and the original Legoland Park – so a heaven for theme park fans.In the UK we’ve also been breathing life into old theme parks, such as\u0026nbspDreamland\u0026nbspin Margate. First opened in 1880 and popular all the way through to the\u0026nbsp1990s, it was closed in 2003 and set to become a residential area. But after local residents campaigned to restore and open Dreamland instead, it was brought back and soon had a £25m\u0026nbsprevamp.It now has a concert venue, seaside pub and rooftop rum shack, and new rides are being introduced to sit alongside the restored vintage ones. According to its Wikipedia page, it’s intended to be a “working museum of vintage funfair rides”. And it’s changing the fortunes of the surrounding small seaside town in Kent.Another intriguing destination is an unexpected one. Nestled deep in the Italian woods, Ai Pioppi boasts a colourful range of rides – none of which are powered by electricity. Instead, riders push, pedal and swing – but we’re not talking playground-style attractions here\u0026nbspwe’re talking full-on Ferris wheels and rollercoasters. But perhaps even more impressive than the park’s eco-credentials is its founder, Bruno Ferrin, who has been building the park himself since the late 1960s. He started by adding a few slides to accompany his restaurant – and it grew from there.Around the world there are a whole host of niche theme parks – those interested can visit Hello Kitty’s castle in Japan, unearth mud at Diggerland\u0026nbspin various locations across the UK and US and view a host of farting and vomiting statues\u0026nbspat BonBon-Land in Zealand, Denmark.Of course, obscurities aside, you’re still guaranteed to have fun at your local attraction. And increasingly we’re seeing theme park culture enter\u0026nbspour day-to-day – less traditional workplaces are starting to install slides and ball pits and Penn State station in New York is considering adding a rollercoaster alongside it’s shops and subway platforms.It would do us all some good to get out the office and have some fun for the sake of fun –\u0026nbspor even better\u0026nbspwe could incorporate theme park rides and attractions into our daily lives.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

With these assumptions made, we obtained interesting results that can find important practical applications.”The team’s interest in the Great Pyramid was first roused while they were investigating the interaction between light and certain nanoparticles.Light can be controlled at a nanoscale by varying the size, shape and refractive index of the nanoparticles’ source materials.The Pyramids of Giza are near a Pizza Hut and more disappointmentsArchaeologists find 4,400-year-old tomb near pyramids outside CairoNow, the scientists want to find out if by creating nanoparticles shaped like the Great Pyramid, they can get them to interact with light in the same way it interacted with radio waves – concentrating its energy into specific areas.“Choosing a material with suitable electromagnetic properties, we can obtain pyramidal nanoparticles with a promise for practical application in nanosensors and effective solar cells,” said Dr Polina Kapitanova, another ITMO University physicist.This is not the first time the worlds of physics and pyramid research have collided.\u0026nbspIn a 2017 paper published in the journal Nature, scientists used particle physics techniques to discover a new chamber inside the Great Pyramid – the first to be revealed since the 19th century.\u0026nbspGreat Pyramid of GizaEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/06/23/18/BREXIT-VOTE-MARCH-29.jpg?width=1000\u0026amp;height=614\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;crop=16:9,offset-y0.5  on= tap:gallery-lightbox-6341451  role= photo  tabindex= 0  layout= fill  alt=   srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/06/23/18/BREXIT-VOTE-MARCH-29.jpg","title":"brexit key dates when uk leave eu transition period theresa may","story":"Created with Sketch.All the main events ahead of Brexit Day on 29 March 2019Click to followIndy PoliticsBrexit key dates: When is the UK leaving the EU?As Britain prepares to leave the EU on 29 March 2019, much uncertainty hangs in the air.

The EU has refused to give British banks passporting rights to trade within the EU, dashing hopes of a special City deal.And Francis Grove-White, deputy director of the pro-EU Open Britain group, said: “It’s disgraceful that the government seems to be trying to hide the consequences of their destructive Brexit from the very people who will be most affected by them.”As The Independent revealed last month, Highways England has acknowledged there is no chance of the M20 work being ready for exit day next March.Local councils in Kent are now up in arms because a permanent solution to the looming crisis will not be in place until “2023 at the earliest”.Kent County Council has warned the planning application for a major stand alone lorry park will not even be considered until next year – and will not be in place for at least another five years.It has told ministers this “is not only frustrating but potentially damaging to the UK economy as well as disrupting the daily life of Kent residents and visitors”.Cable says Final Say campaign has \u0027momentum that will be hard to stop\u0027Brexit is bad for your health UK doctors warn as BMA backs Final SayMay denies army to deliver food and medicines after no-deal BrexitBrexit: Deutsche Bank moves half of euro clearing business out of UKA separate Brexit impact report by Dover District Council agrees that “the ‘temporary\u0027 traffic-management system Operation Brock will be in force for some time”.However, the DfT insisted Brock was “simply an operational name” and denied it was “an acronym related to Brexit”.A spokeswoman said: “Work on Project Brock would have taken place regardless of Brexit to improve contingency arrangements for a range of scenarios which could result in cross-Channel disruption, including bad weather and industrial action.”Its statement, in May, made no mention of Operation Brock,\u0026nbspreferring instead to “our work to improve on the current Operation Stack arrangements and ensure that traffic can keep flowing on the M20 even in the event of serious disruption to cross-channel transport”.It also announced “a package of measures to tackle the blight of fly parking across the southeast and other parts of the country, including plans to increase overnight lorry parking capacity”.Industry sources in Kent told Sky News that the government feared its plans for a lorry park on the key motorway to the channel would be\u0026nbsplinked to the growing risk of a no-deal Brexit.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition herePort of DoverEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/04/27/14/infact-universalbasicincome.jpg  width= 2048  height= 1536  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/04/27/14/infact-universalbasicincome.jpg","title":"labour universal basic income john mcdonnell party manifesto corbyn poverty social benefits","story":"Created with Sketch.Exclusive –\u0026nbspIn an interview with The Independent, the shadow chancellor said: \u0027I think it’s one of those things I think we can get into the next manifesto and see, it’s worth a try\u0027Click to followIndy PoliticsLabour set to include pilot of radical basic income policy in next manifesto, John McDonnell saysLabour is set to include a plan for the radical policy of a universal basic income in its next manifesto for a general election, John McDonnell has told The Independent.The shadow chancellor – one of Jeremy Corbyn’s closest allies in Westminster – said a Labour-commissioned review into the policy, which aims to transform the welfare state, is expected to be published in the autumn.The concept, which involves ditching the traditional means tested benefits and replacing them with an unconditional flat rate payment to all citizens, has been trialled in various parts of the world, including Finland and Canada.Labour loses overall control of Nuneaton council in blow for partyMcDonnell offers City bosses role in Labour policy makingMcDonnell’s attempt to make nice with the City is a smart moveMcDonnell defends Corbyn’s response to Russia nerve agent attackMr McDonnell revealed he had recently discussed the idea with former Labour leader Ed Miliband, who was “really keen” on getting a pilot of the scheme in the next manifesto.Asked whether he could envisage a pilot of basic income forming part of Labour’s next blueprint for government, he replied: “It’s one of those things I think we can get into the next manifesto and see, it’s worth a try. There have been pilots elsewhere. I’m trying to wait for the feedback.”Last year, Mr McDonnell had told The Independent that Labour had set up a working group to investigate the feasibility of a basic income – led by one of his economic advisers, Guy Standing. During the height of the attempted coup against Mr Corbyn in 2016, the shadow chancellor also suggested he could “win the argument” on the idea within the Labour Party.In the\u0026nbspinterview with The Independent, Mr McDonnell continued: “If you look at what’s happened elsewhere in other countries – and I think Scotland is looking at it as well – they are doing it on a small geographical basis in particular towns. Guy is looking at that now and coming forward with proposals.“It will be thrown into the discussions about the next manifesto – that’s one of the ideas that a lot of people are pressing for.”While the finer details of such a pilot are expected to be set out at a later date, a year long scheme involving 2,000 participants was launched in Finland in 2017 with each inidual receiving a €560 (£490) monthly basic payment, equivalent to £5,880 a year.A poll last year by the Institute for Policy Research at the University of Bath suggested that nearly half of all Britons (49 per cent) would back such a scheme and proponents include the prominent billionaires Mark Zuckerberg and Richard Branson.UK news in picturesFriends of Lucy McHugh gather in Mansel Park, Southampton to release balloons in her memory.

I thought we had got to a position where we are able to move on – we’re not – we’ve got to resolve that by September.“The discussion is taking place I think that will enable that to happen.”\u0026nbspPressed for his thoughts on a demonstration earlier this year in Parliament Square, in which hundreds of Jewish people gathered to demand the Labour leader tackle antisemitism in the party, Mr McDonnell said it was “deeply, deeply upsetting”.“I can’t tell you how upsetting it was,” he added. “It really cut you to the core, it really did. You have work these things through.”He continued: “The issue for me is that it’s upsetting but partly because you think how have we got ourselves in this situation, we’ve got to get this sorted it out but also in the life experiences of members of the Jewish community, while we have these disputes going on in the media and elsewhere, there isn’t sufficient campaigning on the ground to tackle those.“You just want to get on with the job of tackling antisemitism – what we should be doing now and I hope we can do is working in inidual communities identifying where the peaks are in terms of the antisemitic incidents, working with the community about how we tackle those that includes working with the police.”On Brexit, he added that there will “almost certainly” be a debate on Brexit at Labour’s annual conference in Liverpool this September after the issue had been raised at union conferences and Constituency Labour Party meetings across the country.“There will be a range of policy debates and Brexit is bound to be one of them,” he said. “There’s bound to be debate this year.When pressed on the prospect of a fresh public vote on the final Brexit deal – something Labour has consistently refused to rule out – Mr McDonnell said that while the party is “always up for some form of democratic engagement” his preference would be for a general election.“My view is that they should just move over and let us start the negotiations. If they are not willing to do that – general election and let’s decide.”On Labour’s failure to explicitly rule out a fresh referendum, he explained: “Why not? It’s not our policy, it’s not our policy and the worry I have, if you look at the opinion polls, split down the middle still – absolutely split. There’s been movement either way. My worry is that if you go for another referendum we could have an equally spilt vote and ide the country all over again.”Mr McDonnell added that his greatest fear with a second vote would be the “rise of the xenophobic right”, adding: “We’ve already seen that on the Tommy Robinson marches, which has been on a scale that has shocked people and certainly surprised people.“I think there’s a real problem,” he said. “It could be really dangerous if you split the country again and allow that xenophobic right to exploit the issue again. That’s why I’d rather we had a general election and again – as I say – in a general election you’re debating all the issues but you’re also choosing the team who will then go and negotiate.”In the coming months Mr McDonnell said he will be doing what has been promised as an anti-austerity tour of the country in areas he believes the party should have won at the previous election and regions where the party could win next time round. And as part of the Labour’s preparations for the ultimate goal of holding office, he said a Queen’s Speech, linked to a first Budget, was also being planned.But when asked whether he thought the public viewed him as Chancellor-in-waiting, he replied: “You know, I don’t think the public know who I am. We’ve done some polling, as you do, and drilled down into the polling about who knows who. Philip Hammond and myself are hardly recognised – we’re on the same par.“For me, I’m not bothered about personal recognition, it’s whether they understand our policies.“I’m not bothered whether the general public recognise me – we’re not into personality politics. It’s the Tony Benn thing: policies rather personalities. What I am more interested in is making sure people understand our policies, support them, and also we can convince them we have the capability to deliver. In some ways that means being seen as a team overall.He said it’s “not about do I get recognised in the street”, but added: “I do a lot. What’s interesting is that people sit on the Tube opposite, looking at me thinking I know him from somewhere and thinking am I a family member – and it’s really funny.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/29/13/rtx1mkc4.jpg  width= 2500  height= 1607  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/29/13/rtx1mkc4.jpg","title":"no deal brexit jeremy hunt france germany theresa may leave eu emmanuel macron angela merkel","story":"Created with Sketch.Appeal comes as Emmanuel Macron invites the prime minister to\u0026nbspurgent talks at his holiday retreatClick to followIndy PoliticsJeremy Hunt calls on France and Germany to stop no-deal Brexit, insisting Theresa May will not \u0027blink\u0027Jeremy Hunt has called on France and Germany to intervene to prevent the UK crashing out of the EU with no deal, insisting Theresa May will not “blink”.The foreign secretary appealed to the EU’s most powerful countries to force Brussels to offer the UK better terms, as he warned the likelihood of a no-deal Brexit is “increasing by the day”.It came as Emmanuel Macron, the French president, invited Ms May to break off her holiday for urgent talks at his retreat in the south of France on Friday.Michel Barnier, the EU’s negotiator, and some senior EU politicians\u0026nbsphave ridiculed the notion of Berlin and Paris stepping in to end the deadlock and arrange a more favourable deal for the UK.But Mr Hunt said: “There is real chance of no deal by accident. Everyone is assuming, no, no, no, this will never happen. Well, actually, it could.“France and Germany have to send a strong signal to the commission that we need to negotiate a pragmatic and sensible outcome that protects jobs on both sides of the Channel, because for every job lost in the UK, there will be jobs lost in Europe as well if Brexit goes wrong.”In an article for the London Evening Standard, Mr Hunt wrote: “The probability of no deal is increasing by the day until we see a change of approach from the European Commission who have this view that they just need to wait and Britain will blink. That is just a profound misunderstanding of us as a nation.”Despite backing Remain – and once calling for a fresh referendum on the Brexit deal – he also insisted the UK would “thrive”, even with the massive disruption of no deal.People\u0027s Vote march - demanding vote on final Brexit dealA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 march“I’ve always been someone who believed that, if we ended up with no deal, we would find a way to thrive economically because we are Britain, we are that sort of country. We have solved these kinds of problems,” the foreign secretary wrote.That verdict is strongly contradicted by the government’s own leaked Brexit impact assessment, which warned of an 8 per cent hit to national output without a trade agreement.The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has also warned the UK economy would suffer more than the EU’s – losing 4 per cent of GDP, compared with 1.5 per cent across the channel.And ministers have been forced to concede there are emergency plans to ensure food, medicines and blood would still be available after exit day next March.Mr Hunt’s appeal comes after Mr Barnier last week\u0026nbsprejected the UK’s proposals for customs after Brexit, appearing to kill off the prime minister’s Chequers plan.No UK car manufacturer ready for Brexit, industry warnsImmigration fears will be ‘exploited’ again in Brexit run-up, MPs fearBrexit is bad for your health UK doctors warn as BMA backs Final SayMay denies army to deliver food and medicines after no-deal BrexitThe chief negotiator also urged the UK not to go behind his back, saying: “Anyone who wants to find a sliver of difference between my mandate and what the heads of government say they want are wasting their time, quite frankly.”No 10 confirmed the prime minister would fly to the south of France on Friday, cutting short her holiday in Switzerland and Italy by one day.In his article, Mr Hunt claimed there was a new unity in the cabinet after he replaced Boris Johnson and Dominic Raab replaced David Davis as Brexit secretary.“We have a united cabinet position, we are absolutely clear what we want, we know it’s not just the right thing for Britain, but it’s the right thing for Europe as well,” he said.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/01/08/zimbabwe-zanu-pf.jpg  width= 2500  height= 1875  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/01/08/zimbabwe-zanu-pf.jpg","title":"zimbabwe elections latest results zanu pf mugabe mdc lose mnangagwa chamisa","story":"Created with Sketch.Figures show Mnangagwa\u0027s party heading for sizeable majority with 58 seats still to be declared\u0026nbspClick to followThe Independent OnlineRuling Zanu-PF heading to convincing victory in first election since Robert Mugabe\u0027s oustingThe ruling Zanu-PF party appears to be heading for a convincing victory in Zimbabwe’s landmark election, winning the majority of seats in parliament with more than two thirds of the results declared, and the opposition trailing by a large margin.The results of the poll, the first in 38 years without Robert Mugabe in power, came far earlier than Zimbabwe’s Election Commission (ZEC)\u0026nbsphad forecast\u0026nbspand were immediately enmeshed in bitter accusations and recriminations, with political rivals the\u0026nbspMDC (Movement for Democratic Change) alliance claiming there had been widespread fraud and warning of street protests.There was a veiled threat of violence from the MDC, with Secretary General Douglas Mwonzora saying “If Zanu-PF and ZEC\u0026nbsptry to cheat, we are confident that the people of Zimbabwe will react. How they react we have absolutely no idea nor do we have any control. Therefore, we are just hoping that the people\u0026nbspwill be respected.”The latest figures show acting President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s party heading for a sizeable majority, getting 110 seats. The MDC have 41 seats and the NPF (National Patriotic Front), sponsored by Robert Mugabe and his wife Grace, have one. Fifty-eight\u0026nbspseats are still to be declared.The outcome of the parallel vote for the presidency is due to be announced in the next 24 hours. Although MDC leader Nelson Chamisa claimed victory the day before, during and after voting, indications have pointed towards a Mnangagwa win. However, there will be a second round in September if no candidate passes the 50 per cent barrier.Ironically, the MDC accused ZEC on Tuesday of a delay in announcing the results to enable manipulation by Zanu-PF to take place and warned that legal action was being taken to speed up the proceedings. The figures on Wednesday morning came after the count for 39 seats were revealed Tuesday evening.As the opposition renewed accusations of fraud, there was a rise in the presence of police, with carriers and water cannons, in Harare. It was the first overt sign of security forces patrolling the streets of the capital in an election campaign which had remained largely peaceful despite a grenade attack in a rally addressed by Mr Mnangagwa a month ago.The MDC claimed it had won the election on Tuesday evening and blamed election authorities for allowing malpractice. Tendai Biti, a MDC official and former finance minister, said: “Some election results that were supposed to be posted outside voting stations were not available and there has been a deliberate interference with the people’s will, shown by delays in announcing the elections results.”The MDC, however, later modified its position, saying it was not the party but civic society groups who were taking the legal action. No confirmation of this has come from any of the groups.In pictures: Zimbabwe votes in historic electionA man casts his vote in Mbare, a suburb of Zimbabwean capital HarareA police officer keeps watch of queuing  voters in MbareVoters stand in line outside a polling station in MbareElection officials remove political posters near a polling station on voting dayOppostion leader Nelson Chamisa arrives at a polling station in HarareOppostion leader Nelson Chamisa casts his voteZimbabwean president Emmerson Mnangagwa arrives to cast his vote in KwekweZimbabwean president Emmerson Mnangagwa casts his vote Voters stand in line outside a polling station in KwekweA woman prays outside a polling station in MbareVoters arrive at a polling station in HarareFormer president Robert Mugabe prepares to cast his vote in HarareA woman casts her vote in Mbare, a suburb of capital HarareA woman casts her vote in the township of MakokobaA police officer casts his vote in MbareA woman prays near a polling station in MbareA man casts his vote in HarareFormer president Robert Mugabe speaks at a press conference the day before the vote where he stated that he would not be voting for his former Zanu-PF partyA supporter of the opposition MDC party attends the final campaign rally in Harare on July 28Supporters of the opposition MDC (Movement for Democratic Change) party attends the final campaign rally in Harare on July 28Supporters of the opposition MDC (Movement for Democratic Change) party attends the final campaign rally in Harare on July 28A man casts his vote in Mbare, a suburb of Zimbabwean capital HarareA police officer keeps watch of queuing  voters in MbareVoters stand in line outside a polling station in MbareElection officials remove political posters near a polling station on voting dayOppostion leader Nelson Chamisa arrives at a polling station in HarareOppostion leader Nelson Chamisa casts his voteZimbabwean president Emmerson Mnangagwa arrives to cast his vote in KwekweZimbabwean president Emmerson Mnangagwa casts his vote Voters stand in line outside a polling station in KwekweA woman prays outside a polling station in MbareVoters arrive at a polling station in HarareFormer president Robert Mugabe prepares to cast his vote in HarareA woman casts her vote in Mbare, a suburb of capital HarareA woman casts her vote in the township of MakokobaA police officer casts his vote in MbareA woman prays near a polling station in MbareA man casts his vote in HarareFormer president Robert Mugabe speaks at a press conference the day before the vote where he stated that he would not be voting for his former Zanu-PF partyA supporter of the opposition MDC party attends the final campaign rally in Harare on July 28Supporters of the opposition MDC (Movement for Democratic Change) party attends the final campaign rally in Harare on July 28Supporters of the opposition MDC (Movement for Democratic Change) party attends the final campaign rally in Harare on July 28The MDC maintains that mandatory voting results forms were not posted at more than 20 per cent of the country’s polling stations in an effort to hide the fact that it had won.\u0026nbspWith repeated declarations of victory coming from their leaders, MDC supporters began to gather outside party headquarters in the afternoon. The mood was celebratory, with dancing to music emanating from a sound system mounted on a lorry.But there was annoyance and anger as water cannon trucks passed them twice on the road heading for the city centre.“I hope they are not going to be used against the people. I hope Zanu-PF are not up to their tricks again to steal the election as they have done in the past,” said 26-year-old Evermore Tsitsi, taking a break from the dancing.“If they are, there will be big trouble, big trouble.”His companion, Andrew Tawananyasha, 29, wanted to stress, “ZEC has shown that it cannot be trusted, it is working with Zanu-PF. In the past, we have backed down to avoid bloodshed, but this time we must seize our chance, we shall fight if we have to, we are prepared.”Security forces on the streets as Zimbabwe election results trickle inOpposition leader \u0027ready to form government\u0027 after Zimbabwe electionZimbabwe election takes dramatic turn as Mugabe turns against Zanu-PFAhead of Zimbabwe elections, the Mugabes\u0027 influence is still feltZimbabwe\u0027s president survives \u0027assassination attempt\u0027 at rallyMr Chamisa has stated a number of times that there would be protest marches if he was denied victory through fraud, adding that they would be peaceful.ZEC insisted that the election has been fought cleanly. “The atmosphere has remained peaceful” said its chairwoman Priscilla Chigumba. “We will not subvert anything. We have not received any major complaint about how the election was conducted.”One candidate must get more than 50 per cent of the votes, under the constitution, to win the election with a second round run-off scheduled for September if this does not happen.MDC said one of the reasons it is claiming victory is a late boost given by Robert Mugabe backing Mr Chamisa. The former president, the longest serving head of state in Africa until his overthrow eight months ago, said at a press conference that he would not back Zanu-PF, the party he once led, or Mr Mnangagwa, his former vice-president who replaced him.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":null,"title":"florida seth owen georgetown university parents lgbt homophobia","story":"A gay valedictorian who was disowned by his conservative Christian parents because of his sexuality, and put through \u0027conversion therapy\u0027, has been able to attend college because of a GoFundMe campaign.\u0026nbspSeth Owen, 18, graduated from First Coast High School in Jacksonville with a 4.16 GPA, but was worried that he wouldn\u0027t be able to make his dream of attending college a reality because his family refused to offer him financial aid, reports\u0026nbspNBC News.\u0026nbspWith Georgetown refusing to amend his financial aid package, and $20,000 needed for his first year at college, the Florida teen began to lose hope, until his Biology teacher stepped in.\u0026nbspSeth was just a kid that really stood out to me.He was super ambitious and was always trying to go above and beyond to make sure he could be as successful as possible.So, she decided to set up a GoFundMe\u0026nbsppage to help him get to college, with a goal of $20,000. At the time of writing, it has raised more than\u0026nbsp$70,000, and counting.\u0026nbspWriting on the page, she explained why she set it up, and her emotional connection to the high achieving student:\u0026nbspEarlier this year (after a year of attempted conversion therapy), Seth’s parents gave him an ultimatum.He would either continue to attend the church that outwardly attacked him and his sexual orientation or he would need to leave home.For his own well-being and safety, Seth chose the later.

In Balochisan, BAP won 13 seats out of the 65 while Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal (MMA) was in second place with nine. Who will eventually form the government in Balochistan is unclear as the BNP, BNP-Awami, Hazara Democratic Party (HDP) have won six, three and two seats respectively, while PTI has won four.In Punjab, Pakistan\u0027s largest province, the Muslim Leaque took 129 out of 295 seats with the PTI close behind with 123, while 28 independent assembly members will play a potentially vital role in forming the government.\u0026nbspWe will definitely form our government in Punjab as we are in contact with 21 independent candidates, PTI spokesman Fawad Chaudhary saidThe poll has been marred by long delays in counting and complaints of rigging by the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party.The party’s spokesman, Muhammad Mehndi, told The Independent\u0026nbspthe majority” of the elected members were “in favour of boycotting the oath of the assembly” and backed agitating against the election. There is no other opinion except that election is rigged,\u0026nbsphe said.Some of the smaller religious parties are threatening street protests if the poll is not re-run.We have decided to organise a movement to press for fresh elections, as the \u0027manipulated\u0027 results are not acceptable to us, MMA president Fazlur Rehman said.PML-N leader Shehbaz Sharif said on Saturday that he was outraged by the killing of a party member in the northern city of Mansehra and that demanding a recount was a party\u0027s legal right. He did not specify when the party member was killed.PML-N is a peaceful national political party and fear \u0026amp intimidation can\u0027t suppress our rights, Mr Sharif tweeted.Mr Khan has offered to investigate any claims of irregularities in the wake of Wednesday\u0027s poll, which Mr Sharif\u0027s PML-N and several other parties allege was skewed in favour of the former cricket hero by Pakistan\u0027s powerful military.European Union observers were critical of the political climate in the run up to the vote, saying that some parties had been disadvantaged. In their preliminary findings, the observers said the electoral process was not as good as the 2013 election and campaign week featured a lack of equality that meant it was not a level playing field for all parties.\u0026nbspThe US voiced similar concerns.We have concluded there was a lack of equality of opportunity, German MEP Michael Gahler said.A number of violent attacks, targeting political parties, party leaders, candidates and election officials, affected the campaign environment.“Most interlocutors acknowledged a systematic effort to undermine the former ruling party through cases of corruption, contempt of court and terrorist charges against its leaders and candidates.”Mr Khan\u0027s 116 seats put\u0026nbsphim short of the 137 required for an assembly majority, meaning he is likely to need a coalition with religious parties and independents to form a government.Two newly formed small parties are seen as being open to an alliance with Mr Khan\u0027s PTI.The GDA, a new alliance in Sindh province, has two seats.BAP, another new group formed by a number of seasoned political names from the southwesterly Baluchistan province, picked up four seats.The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Saturday released results for 270 seats, with elections in two seats postponed. Several were being recounted.The coalition arithmetic is slightly complicated by the fact that a further 70 seats, most reserved for women and members of non-Muslim minorities, are allocated to parties on the basis of their performance in the contested constituencies. Once those seats are added in, any coalition will need at least 172 seats.Additional reporting by ReutersEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/1/183x122/996812_1.jpg","title":"Brexit news jeremy hunt Brexit speech angela merkel eu uk","story":"The new Foreign Secretary warned Brussels\u0026rsquo most powerful countries Germany and France they must \u0026ldquosend a strong signal to the European Commission or \u0026ldquojobs will also be lost in their countries if the UK crashes out of the EU without a deal.Warning that the possibility of a no deal is \u0026ldquoincreasing by the day Mr Hunt said EU bosses had underestimated Theresa May\u0026rsquos steel because the Prime Minister Theresa May will not \u0026ldquoblink.He said the UK leaving Brussels without a deal risked chaos on both sides of the Channel and EU businesses would be hit.Speaking directly to Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron, Mr Hunt urged them to forced Brussels to offer the UK better terms.                \u0026lsquoWorst airline passenger ever\u0027 Mum, 51, jailed for punching flight                 \u0026lsquoMove aircraft to POLAND\u0026rsquo Furious Ryanair boss threatens to axe jobs He said: \u0026ldquoFrance and Germany have to send a strong signal to the Commission that we need to negotiate a pragmatic and sensible outcome that protects jobs on both sides of the Channel because for every job lost in the UK, there will be jobs lost in Europe as well if Brexit goes wrong.Jeremy Hunt warned a no deal scenario would be an economic \u0026ldquotragedy for the Continent - not just the UK - and that it would \u0026ldquochange British public attitudes towards Europe for a generation.He told the Evening Standard: \u0026ldquoThe probability of No Deal is increasing by the day until we see a change of approach from the European Commission who have this view that they just need to wait and Britain will blink.

She is the same age as me. But that’s where the similarities stop. In fact physically, the only thing that is similar about our ­bodies are our toenails.But when I see pictures of her I don’t feel bad about myself or envious (on the contrary, I feel only admiration) because I know I have not put in any effort to look like that.I like cake too much, and I like going out with friends, having a drink, cooking and eating. And I am more than happy with my lot.The problem is, though, that a lot of women DO feel bad about themselves when they look at photos of beautiful women.They compare themselves and feel they don’t measure up that they are lacking or worthless. This is especially an issue for young girls.Talking about body image this week, Loose Women presenter Nadia Sawalha said she blames herself for her teenage daughter’s body issues.She thinks 15-year-old Maddie has developed insecurities by growing up with Nadia talking about her own.“She grew up around me being negative about my body and she picked that up by osmosis,” she said.Unfortunately, it’s true that girls are influenced by the way their mothers feel about their bodies.But the reality is it’s not just our mum’s body image that is informing ours.It’s the airbrushed adverts and the photos that have been photoshopped into flawlessness on social media, offering impossible standards for us to try to live up to.It’s the enhanced physiques of the Kardashians and the women on Love Island setting impossible standards of “femininity”.The bottom line is that women are constantly sexualised and judged on their appearance, so it’s all too easy for women to fall prey to the pursuit of a “perfection” that doesn’t exist.When “perfect” can only be attained with surgery and extreme dieting, or starvation, you are setting yourself up to feel inadequate and bad about yourself.Even when some women look like they’ve achieved “perfection”, they still feel bad about themselves.Megan on Love Island is a good example.She is absolutely stunning but still lacks confidence — the one key thing surgery and dieting can’t necessarily give you.The most important thing you can give to any young girl — or boy — is that belief in yourself and who you are, and the certainty that your personality is just as important as the way you look.The question is, how do you achieve this?One thing I always tried to emphasise to my daughter when she was young was that it’s not just your skin that people are going to judge you on.I never worried about my weight and never said I felt fat — even if I had put on a few pounds.I also emphasised that happiness is not about looks.It is about how you feel, and about the friendship, fun and laughter you have in life.Laughter and personality are infectious.People don’t want to spend time with people obsessed about their looks and their weight.They want to be around people who are interesting, fun and dynamic.Have you seen that film, I Feel Pretty? It stars Amy Schumer, whose character is fuller figured, wears big pants and is always on a diet.Then she bangs her head and wakes up thinking — and acting as if — she is drop-dead gorgeous.As a result, doors start opening for her and she can have any man she wants.It’s just a film, but it rings true: Confidence comes from within.So much about confidence comes down to attitude.If you are constantly thinking about your flaws you forget your positives.So next time you find yourself pointing out your flabby bits, force yourself to find a positive.Forget “perfect”, accept your flaws and focus instead on dressing for your body shape.If you don’t know how to, then ask a sales assistant — that is the beauty of going into a shop rather than shopping online.And there’s nothing wrong with a few props. I’m not a fan of cosmetic surgery but if a padded bra and fake tan make you feel better about yourself, then go for it.That way you’ll have more time to get on and enjoy life, rather than fretting that you don’t look like J-Lo.THE saga of Tini Owens, 68, who has been trying for several years to end her 40-year marriage to 80-year-old mushroom farmer Hugh, took a depressing turn when she lost her long-running legal battle to divorce her husband.In short, she insists their relationship has broken down but Mr Owens refuses to agree to the split.Despite her certainty that it’s over, and the fact they are now living in separate houses, five Supreme Court judges waved away Mrs Owens’ pleas to let her end the union.They ruled she must stay married – because Mrs Owens has failed to establish that her marriage had irretrievably broken down, as required by law.How farcical.We do not live in the Middle East, or the middle ages, and we are not owned by our husbands.So why is she being forced to stay married to him?And what kind of man wants to force his wife to stay married to him?They didn’t deny the conclusions drawn by people at the time that they would rectify the shocking pay-gap between the actors and give Claire a £100k cheque as back-pay.But now that the dust has settled, guess what? It turns out the back-pay bit was just a rumour and no such thing has happened.Given that they pledged at the time that there will be no gender pay parity for the new cast, that sounds like flawed logic.I ADMIRE Louise Redknapp for saying she “lost her identity” during her 19-year marriage to ex-husband Jamie.The former Eternal singer, 43, talked about the fallout of putting her successful career on hold to raise sons Charley, 14 and Beau, nine.I guess what partly happened is that Louise found her identity again after being in the 2016 series of Strictly, followed by the show Cabaret.Having put her life on hold, which would build resentment in even the most giving individual, Louise had a chance to rediscover herself.Either Jamie didn’t like that, or he felt he couldn’t be part of her new life.It’s such a good reminder of the importance of hanging on to your own identity in a marriage.Even if you are the stay-at-home parent, it’s important to find a way not to be the “Wife of” or “Husband of” someone else.And not just to prevent your spouse from losing sight of the person they fell in love with.The real issue is that you can forget who you are yourself.A lot of this comes back to shared parental responsibility.The more equality there is with parenting, the more space there is for both parents to retain their individuality.Here’s some unsolicited advice for any new parents out there.Even if all you think you want to do now is look after your kids, try to find a little bit of space that’s just for you.Hang on to the things that made you you before you had kids and you’ll be doing your marriage a huge favour.But what’s as important as having separate interests and experiences in a relationship is that you grow together.It’s good to take separate paths but make sure you’ve got a shared one too.You’re welcome!\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBRITAIN’S first “legal” red light district, in Holbeck, Leeds, was a great idea – on paper.It was created four years ago with the aim of stopping sex trafficking and violence, and combatting sexually transmitted infections by regulating the sex trade.The problem is, it hasn’t worked.In fact it’s caused a surge in sex and drug-taking in parks and woods – sometimes in view of children.Not only that but the number of reported rapes and sex assaults in the red light district doubled since it launched.There is no perfect solution for the world’s oldest profession.But perhaps we need to start considering a way to create safe and regulated brothels since street-walking is never going to be safe.I WAS sickened to read about the man who “rescued” an 18-year-old British au pair in Naples who had just been raped by two men.Allegedly, he offered to help her but then said, “It’s my turn now”, before raping her again.What kind of despicable human being “rescues” someone only to attack them?In my view, if he is found guilty, whatever sentence he gets should be doubled.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Some of it is common sense.It makes no sense that ferry or rail passengers don’t have to give the same basic info to the Authorities as plane arrivals do.It should go without saying that failed asylum seekers should be sent home quickly, without endless costly judicial reviews at taxpayers’ expense.And to avoid another Windrush scandal we must give official papers to those who have been here for years — especially Ugandan Asians, who came in the ’70s and are most likely to be without. Other recommendations require a bit more thought.But at least Policy Exchange are doing some thinking about Britain’s future. On the other hand, the Government is turning drift into an art form.  Even the much-ballyhoed, super-charged no deal plans that were supposed to be released one-by-one this summer are being quietly shuffled away until one day in late August.Former Brexit Minister Steve Baker is right to be “alarmed and worried” .The PM’s Chequers fudge is a direct result of our lack of planning, and until we’re ready to go it alone, Brussels will force us to make more concessions.

Party members are in open revolt and Ukip are circling like sharks.Labour, meanwhile, has been dragged into a vicious civil war by a racist rabble bent on purging the party of all the people, like Frank Field, who make it worth voting for.Yet as things stand, it is Jeremy Corbyn’s Marxists who would storm to victory in a general election, bringing with them economic chaos, instability and, as night follows day, mass unemployment.What did we do to deserve this, Theresa May?How does this great nation find itself on the brink of political anarchy, paralysis and a Channel blockade on food and medicine?The answer is appalling leadership, dithering diplomacy . . . and a quite incredible failure to speak to the people.So, a round of applause for EU bully-boy Michel Barnier and unelected Brussels puppet master Martin Selmayr for opening our eyes in time.Without their breathtaking arrogance, Britain might have sleep-walked into a humiliating deal which left us half-in, half-out — and paying through the nose for the privilege.Now everyone, including our EU allies, can see Barnier has gone too far by rudely rubbishing Mrs May’s pleas for peace in our time and insisting we still cough up a £39billion ransom.Italian deputy PM Matteo Salvini spoke more clearly for Britain than Mrs May herself when he urged her to stand up to Brussels or walk away.“My experience in the European parliament tells me you either impose yourself or they swindle you,” says Salvini.His sentiments are echoed by other EU leaders bruised by the Brussels jackboot.Privately, many would like to see Barnier and Selmayr given a poke on the nose.All the more disappointing that Ireland, one of those victims, cosies up to Barnier against the country that bailed them out after the 2008 crash.Donald Trump showed how it’s done, with sozzled EU chief Jean-Claude Juncker lurching to Washington on hands and knees for a deal on tariffs.Yet Britain does more trade than America with the EU.While Mrs May dithers, Chancellor Phil Hammond deserves a special place somewhere for leaving us dangerously in the lurch.Thanks to him we are running out of time with virtually nothing in place to soften a crash landing.The mood in Britain has hardened dramatically against Brussels since the “turd- polishing” Chequers summit.Ministers, MPs and even Mrs May’s own local party fear she has already surrendered too much.It is now too late for the traditional EU stitch-up, with Brussels giving an inch and taking a mile. Forget about a second referendum.Leave campaign mastermind Dominic Cummings is right to warn Brexit would win an even bigger majority in the current atmosphere of rank betrayal.Remainers bleat about Brexit dividing the nation for generations to come. In fact, the wounds can ONLY be healed by a successful, clean-cut Brexit.We will NOT sink back into the Dark Ages, cut off from the world, adrift in the North Sea with no friends.More important, a successful Brexit is the ONLY way the Tories will beat off the threat from Labour and Ukip.Under a bolder, more dynamic leader — sooner rather than later — Britain will re-establish itself as a flourishing, tax-competitive trading nation.It is what Brussels, and Jeremy Corbyn’s Marxists, fear above all.Before we know it, we will be into our stride, making our own trade deals and wondering what all this fuss was about.From our new vantage point we will also be looking back at the EU — a bickering, cash-strapped political catastrophe that is already unravelling at huge cost to its member states.Among which, thank goodness, we will no longer be counted.Three Jewish newspapers blasted his refusal to accept the international definition of anti-Semitism.

In that same period, I didn’t see a single police officer.Since Spice, once a legal high, was made illegal in 2016, its miserable hold on vulnerable people such as street sleepers and prisoners has not weakened up and down the country. At less than £5 a gram - enough for a few hours’ fix - it’s cheap and accessible.The zombie drug, so-called because users often stagger around looking like the living dead, is a particular problem in Manchester and police here say they’ve received 1,300 calls relating to the drug in 18 months.And earlier in the summer, visitors to Piccadilly Gardens - a hugely popular main square in the city centre - were appalled to see a couple, allegedly high on Spice, having sex in broad daylight.The charity Lifeshare estimates that 95 per cent of Manchester’s homeless people take the drug and several users have been hospitalised after taking it.It is highly addictive, with withdrawal symptoms said to be worse than coming off crack or heroin. Users can suffer vomiting, seizures, hallucinations and psychosis. Stocks of the drug are believed to flood into the country through Eastern Europe, having come initially from China.Particularly strong strains are being sold in Manchester compared to elsewhere, which is why spice addicts flock to the city on the Spice Trail, named-so to mimic the historic East-West trade of spices.And the scale of the problem is much in evidence on an ordinary Monday in the city centre. Yards away, just beyond the stench of urine and the sight of Spice being smoked openly on the grass by an emaciated homeless woman with a baby in a buggy, excited children are playing in the fountains.The Spice-smoking mother, no older than 16, has one hand on the pram and a roll-up in the other as she chats and giggles with a toothless man in shorts and nothing else. It’s shocking that illegal drug users are staggering, hallucinating and catatonic so close to innocent kids playing, according to worried mum Angela, 37, from nearby Ancoats.“Where are the police? Angela asks. Two of her children are running together through the fountains, while her third is in her arms. I bring my three small kids here – they’re seven, five and nine months - for a nice day out, only to see Spice users being sick everywhere, running through the fountains all Spiced-up so I have to take the kids away until they’re gone away. “My three are terrified of them. It makes me not want to bring them here. There should be a restriction so the Spice guys can’t come here where the kids are.” Spice user Jed who’s sitting on the steps beneath the Queen Victoria monument, sees it differently.“I’ve got nothing, absolutely nothing, and nowhere to go, he says. I’ve as much right to be here as anyone else.Yes I take Spice, but who wouldn’t if they were living my life? It makes me feel good, it puts me to sleep, it blocks stuff out. It passes the time, and I have a lot of that.”He’s been living on the streets for 20 years, since he was 16, after a chaotic childhood with alcoholic parents and siblings. He looks 20 years older than he is: craggy, pallid and caked in dirt. Most of his teeth are missing and his jogging bottoms smell of urine.He says he started taking Spice when he was in prison for burglary and assault a year ago.“All I own in this world is a sleeping bag, I sleep wherever, usually in shop doorways where the CCTV cameras are. I’ve got four kids so if anything happens to me, the camera won’t lie. I smoke an ounce of Spice a day. That costs me £40. I go nicking to get the money I need. I do some shoplifting.”Jed talks freely for a while but starts scratching himself manically and becomes aggressive, eventually storming off for no apparent reason. Hours later, I see him slumped unconscious on one of the benches opposite McDonald’s.The buyers and sellers of Spice clutter a pavement where customers, often oblivious, are in and out of Debenhams, Halifax, Starbucks and Morrisons. They congregate round the two monuments in the gardens: a strutting dealer aged around 30, dressed head-to-toe in Adidas, a giggling guy in his 20s dancing with his jeans pulled down below his bottom an angry blonde 30-something woman shouting odds at a woman of the same age, slumped double beside a stained duvet. It’s hardly the ideal lunch break setting for people working close by, as three 19-year-old college students explain.“We’ve just had to move away from the monument over there because of the zombies lying round us and the dealers shouting out,” Jess says.“A big, topless, wasted guy was hassling us for money, so we thought it would be safer to move to where all the kids and their parents are. Not nice. We all felt intimidated over there.”A young couple, Grace and Matthew, who have just finished school, say that they often see people asking for money outside McDonalds.A middle-aged woman, Alison, from the Channel Islands, says: “This is my first time in Manchester for 20 years and I’m shocked by what I’m seeing. It’s like watching a horrible documentary about drug taking, but it’s real life and it’s happening 10ft from where I’m sitting on a bench waiting for my daughter to finish a college interview.“I’m angry that there are no police here, and sad for the mess these poor people have got themselves into. What a waste of their lives.”For the many shops and eateries bordering Piccadilly Gardens, Spice is bad for business. Spaced-out druggies, often aggressive, sometimes hallucinating, are off-putting.Lucas, the supervisor in a nearby restaurant, says: “They come in here wanting to use the toilet. One guy came in totally wasted on Spice and fell on the floor in the restaurant and started shaking.We called an ambulance, but when it came he just stood up and walked out.“The Deliveroo and Just Eat drivers don’t want to come here because they can get their bikes stolen when they’re picking up food. Some customers tell us they won’t come into the city centre after 5pm.”A security guard standing outside a café says: “Spice is a massive problem here and it’s a shame that a park that’s at the heart of Manchester is ruined by users. I know the police use Dispersal Orders but that only tends to get rid of them for 48 hours, then they’re straight back.”A store security guard who didn’t want to be named described the Spice problem as a nightmare which fuels shoplifting and puts customers off shopping.“You think someone is dead, they’re so out of their head, but five minutes later you see them begging on the McDonald’s wall, and so it goes on, day after day. Very troubling.”The manager at a hairdressing salon on Tib Street says he’s concerned about the fire hazard caused by street sleepers bedding down in shop doorways with carrier bags, sleeping bags and duvets. Last year the evening newspaper here described Piccadilly Gardens as a dystopian scene of seemingly unending human misery.An impassioned article continued: “This has not happened overnight. That human beings are rotting away in our busiest public square has been evident for a long time. It is a sight that should shame Manchester.”“Tackling spice use and dealing in the city centre is still a high priority for us and we continue to work with our partners to help people get the support that they need and ultimately get this harmful drug off our streets.“Enforcement action has seen us tackle dealers and use intelligence to target organised crime gangs across Greater Manchester - 55 people have been arrested for possession with intent to supply spice since January 2017 in the city centre alone.In addition to this we have also arrested 90 others for being in possession of the drug, with many of these people directed to support services.“It’s crucial that we continue to work with partners, including Manchester City Council’s Antisocial Behaviour Action Team, the CPS and the courts to take dealers off the streets but also with health and support services to refer users to that they can get the help that they need and ultimately help us tackle the issue.“We remain committed to working together to keep Manchester safe for everyone, but we do need the continued support of the community in reporting suspicious incidents through 101, or 999 in an emergency.”Big Issue seller Charlie, 46, is sitting with his dog Monty outside the H\u0026ampM store on Market Street. Charlie has been homeless, on and off, since he was 13, though he recently qualified as a plasterer and now has a flat in Stockport. He says: “I’ve never touched Spice, it’s an idiot’s game, but the problem here in Manchester hasn’t happened overnight – the authorities are just ignoring it. “Spice is giving Manchester a dreadful name. It needs sorting out. That horrible corner of Piccadilly Gardens is like Skid Row.”Back there, Spice business remains brisk. On the hottest afternoon of the year, a woman is comatose in a phone box underneath a duvet. There’s a loud argument going on between two shouting women, both of them emaciated, and four men are unconscious on benches.It’s as depressing a snapshot of life on the streets in 21st century Britain as one could see.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Britain is a NATO partner but not good enough for such a project?“Now that Davis and Johnson are gone in the UK, the EU should also replace Barnier and Verhofstadt to be able to reach an atmosphere of mutual trust.”Mr Henkel, who sits in the same European political grouping as the UK Conservatives, urged the bloc’s negotiators to accommodate Theresa May’s new plan for alignment on goods secured at Chequers.He said: “The new proposal is better than a hard Brexit or no deal. However, a real customs union would be better and so would be uninterrupted access for financial service institutions.“It is now up to the EU to accommodate demands for British industry and banks to admit that what is good for British business is also good for their continental counterparts.”And the top German MEP also invited top eurocrat Donald Tusk to intervene in the talks and steer Britain away from the exit door.He said the EU Council chief should offer the UK a “new deal” with constraints on free movement to persuade it to stay inside the bloc.He said: “Still better would be for both, Britain and the EU, to call the whole thing off.“For that I ask President Tusk to offer Britain a New Deal, giving it what it always wanted - more autonomy, especially in controlling its immigration.

A year ago they seemed resigned to Brexit’s inevitability, but focused on one so soft as to be indistinguishable from Remain.Now, boosted by Government ineptitude, they dream of going one better: a second referendum, its three options cynically designed to skew the result towards staying in, exactly as we are.For two years they lied that they “respect the referendum result”. In truth they hope to annul it before it has even been carried out. And THEIR victory, in the unlikely event it occurred, would of course be final and beyond reproach.It should all be laughable. But No10 is turbo-charging their hopes with the new Project Fear, a barrage of dubious warnings of chaos, recession and wartime shortages in the event of no-deal.The Sun long ago urged the Government to plan seriously for this scenario. But No10 is also using it to intimidate Leave voters into swallowing Theresa May’s wildly unpopular Chequers offer.This not only does the dirty work of the second referendum mob. It paints Britain into a corner with Brussels — with Chequers seemingly our only option and the Government petrified of Angela Merkel finally rejecting it. The Sun always said Brexit could be rocky. Far worse would be to reverse it.Remainers say Leavers shouldn’t want “Brexit chaos on their conscience”. Would it trouble theirs to overturn the biggest UK democratic mandate ever, before its instruction had been fulfilled?To negate the sworn pledges of the Government and Opposition, and Commons votes carried by huge majorities? What about the destruction of trust in democracy? The inevitable breakdown of law and order? Would riots bother them? Or our great nation being humiliated before the world, scaring itself into surrender and begging Brussels’ forgiveness?Or are they simply in denial about the hideous costs of what they propose?Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A spokesman said “2018 is the never-ending summer.”Ladbrokes also cut odds to evens on August highs beating Britain’s 38.5C (101.3F) record, set on August 10, 2003, at Brogdale, Kent.Met Office forecaster Richard Miles said: “With 48C expected in Iberia, highs are likely to beat records. Tourists in Spain and Portugal clearly need to take care in such high temperatures.“Continental heat will move up to Britain from the south. The South and East will be hottest and it will be a warm weekend for most, although cooler in the North.”The Met Office earlier confirmed in a tweet that the heat was returning as a sea of red sweeps across the globe towards the UK.Brits will be rushing to beaches and parks across the country to soak up the sun and BBQ’s are expected to be sold out as the temperatures soar.They have been told to brace for even more sweltering weather over the weekend when it could reach possible highs of 33C.Many parts of the country the dry scorcher is set to return - with forecasters warning the mercury will hit 30C across the South of England by Friday.While the south is blasted with sun, northern parts of the UK will continue to see showers with temperatures sitting in the mid 20s.A spokeswoman for the Met Office said on Tuesday: In terms of the weekend just gone, they were the first two days this month where temperatures havent reached 25C (77F) but we have got back to that point today, it hit 25.3C (77.5F) in Cavendish in Suffolk so its already starting to warm up again.Over the next few days there will be something of a north and south split - high pressure is already starting to build up in the south, bringing dry, fine and weather.She warned: Southern England and Wales are going to turn quite hot by Friday - temperatures will probably reach 30C (86F) by that point.This is likely to include quite a wide area across the southern part of the UK - it will widely hit 30C (86F) across southern England and Wales, and the very hot weather will return as we approach the weekend.The north of England, Scotland and Northern Ireland can expect outbreaks of much-needed rain on Tuesday, Wednesday and in to Thursday.The spokeswoman said: Its a more varied picture across the north but its an improving situation - sunshine with some showers and a similar story across the weekend.By Friday the temperatures could get into the mid 20s, so warming up, just not as hot as it is in the south.The weather broke on Friday, treating the parched landscape to a deluge of rain.It meant this July will be wetter than the blistering heatwave of July 1976.An average 49.9mm of rain fell across the UK from July 1 to July 29, according to provisional figures from the Met Office, and with further rain expected this week, the final total could be higher.The UK suffered a long heatwave during the summer of 1976, which helped make July 1976 the joint ninth driest on record.Currently, July this year is the 13th driest on record, the Met Office said.The driest ever July was in 1955, when an average of 30.6mm rainfall was measured across the UK.Comparable records for rainfall date back to 1910."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000423925391.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"erin town sea parasite devon infection cryptosporidiosis","story":"Erin Town swam with her friends almost daily at Wildersmouth Beach in Ilfracombe last month when she contracted what she thought was an ear infection.But within the days the schoolgirls temperature had soared to 40C and she had a racking cough - which the doctor initially put down to tonsillitis.Disturbing symptoms also included bad stomach cramps and heavy vomiting.Terrified mum Paulina parent took her to North Devon District Hospital, where they found she had contracted cryptosporidium.The vile parasite can live in the intestines of humans and animals and be spread through soil and water - such as when humans accidentally swallow contaminated water.Paulina told Devon Live: When I told the nurse that she had been swimming there, she pulled a bit of a face and said several people had been ill after swimming there.She said she wouldnt even take her dog in the water there.Erin was discharged after one night at the hospital before she had to be readmitted on Thursday for a second night.Paulina said: I was absolutely petrified, it was awful.Children and people with weakened immune systems are the most at risk of falling ill.Boiling the water kills the parasite and makes it safe to drink.The parasite can live in the intestines of humans and animals.It is spread to people through soil, water, or surfaces that have been contaminated with the poo of an infected person.Humans most often become infected when they accidentally swallow something that has come into contact with infected stool, swallowing contaminated water in pools, hot tubs, streams and water systems, and eating uncooked contaminated food.It is is one of the most common causes of waterborne diseases.Weve lived in Ilfracombe for 12 years now and I never knew that you werent supposed to swim at that beach. I had no idea the water was that bad.If wed known I never would have let Erin go swimming there.Signs warn people against going into the water at Wildersmouth Beach - but Paulina believes far more could be done.The signs should be made bigger and more obvious.When I posted something to Facebook about this, most of the comments were from people who also didnt realise you werent supposed to swim there - so it cant be that obvious.Erin certainly wont be going back in there again and I think its important to let as many people as possible know about it.I would hate for anyone else to go through this, it has been petrifying.Katy Nicholls, public protection manager for North Devon Council, said: “North Devon Council does not have any record of being notified about this incident by the child’s mother, nor have we received formal notification from any health body confirming a diagnosis of cryptosporidium.“We currently consider this to be an isolated incident, and in light of Wildersmouth Beach being an undesignated bathing beach we do not intend to take any further action.In the event that we should we receive any further reports of this kind we may look to liaise with other appropriate bodies, such as the Environment Agency."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000423882431.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"tv advert orgasms love honey watershed","story":"The saucy advert shows couples ripping off each others clothes to reveal racy lingerie as they build to a climax.It ends with a woman in suspenders tapping her bum with a feather tickler, saying: It’s time to say yes to more yes!

Or call Hamas terrorists “brother” after they have helped slaughter Jews.Or discipline two veteran MPs who accused him over anti-semitism . . . but not an actual anti-semite in Willsman.This is the dark heart of the man Labour wants to install in Downing Street.We don’t just mean the hard-left muppets on his front bench. We mean the Yvette Coopers, Chris Leslies and Chuka Umunnas — all still on Team ­Corbyn, all ready to campaign for Jezza and his vile goons to run this country.And as for the “progressive” millennials who think Corbyn is Christ, how do you like this racist party you’ve joined?Or is Jew-hatred cool, like bringing back Communism and its inevitable horrors?WE like Jeremy Hunt’s punchy tone towards the EU. But he’s wasting his breath.He is right that the chance of no-deal rises every day Brussels, Berlin and Paris continue assuming Britain will eventually surrender to them.We agree that is “a profound misunderstanding of us as a nation”, even if many Remainers WOULD roll over. We also agree the City, the powerhouse of our economy, will thrive come what may.But we get no hint that Merkel or Macron will back Theresa May’s Chequers offer despite its excessive generosity risking her Government’s survival.She is trying to negotiate with people religiously committed to EU ideals, sworn to preserve them against a tsunami of euroscepticism and delusional enough to think punishing us will do it.They will sacrifice their prosperity and voters’ jobs if need be. We see no prospect of a deal with leaders like that.WELL done, Theresa May, for insisting on Brit-only passport lanes post-Brexit.We don’t want to hear Home Office gripes about cost, or UK-only lanes being slower than others. Make them work, as other independent countries do. We will need plenty of visible signs that we have left the EU, and this is one.While we’re at it, let’s get those Brexit stamps printed up for next March.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Shetland document claims that under a \"no deal\", 86% of sheep farms are expected to be loss-making, compared to half under current arrangements.The increase in losses arises out of the imposition of tariffs on lamb exports to Europe.Almost all councils expressed significant concerns about how the treasury will replace crucial EU structural and regional funds - particularly now the PM has promised any money that might materialise after Brexit to the NHS.But another common feature in the reports is exasperation that councils just do not know what to plan for as they wait for the government to agree a deal.  Some councils said impact assessments were impossible until the government firms up its position.Wirral council, for example, told Sky News: \"Given the lack of detail from government about any proposed deal or arrangements, it is difficult to carry out an assessment that is not purely speculative at this time.\"It did however say once \"firm details\" of any deal were available it would produce an analysis including \"wider general implications for residents such as food costs.\"The government is pondering when to release its own preparedness notices for Brexit.

It brought record-breaking viewing figures for ITV2, with the launch show in June attracting the channel\u0027s largest ever audience with 2.9 million viewers.That figure was topped just a few weeks into the run, with three million viewers tuning in mid-week.But why is it so successful? An idyllic location (Majorca), beautiful contestants and plenty of screen time (six hour-long episodes per week) certainly gave the show a boost from the start.BAFTA-winning presenter Iain Stirling\u0027s quippy voiceover also helps to lubricate the on-screen action.Stirling studied law at Edinburgh University before going on to present children\u0027s TV and earning his presenter stripes alongside a scruffy terrier puppet called Hacker. The voice of Love Island, he now dates former MTV presenter and Love Island fan Laura Whitmore - who apparently pumps him for Island gossip on a regular basis.And she\u0027s not the only celebrity fan - ex-Oasis frontman Liam Gallagher, rapper Stormzy (who made a surprise appearance during last year\u0027s series three) and DJ Nick Grimshaw have all expressed a liking for the reality show.American hotel heiress Paris Hilton appears to be watching too, tweeting to her 18 million followers: \"@LoveIsland Jack \u0026 Dani are goals! 😍 #LoveIsland\". There\u0027s even the odd minor-celebrity thrown in to give the show a little star dust, with Danny Dyer\u0027s daughter Dani (yes, really) eventually justifying her status as favourite to win.Dani and pen salesman Jack Fincham have been coupled since the start, and say they plan to move in together now the show has come to an end.The popular pair have even received the thumbs up from The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds thanks to Jack\u0027s penchant for bird watching during his time in the villa. Winning an A* for ingenuity, the show\u0027s producers even managed to wangle an appearance of sorts from Daddy Dyer over the weekend.The always awkward meeting of boyfriend and father was given an extra excruciating twist, with Jack meeting the EastEnders actor over Facetime.Luckily the soap star, who was speaking from his family holiday in Florida, said he \"approved\" of Fincham, telling him \"I think you\u0027re absolutely bang on\" and a \"proper geezer\".He also told him he had a bit of a belly using cockney rhyming slang - a classic Dyer move. Viewers were quick to share their love for Danny\u0027s appearance on social media, hailing it the best moment of the series so far.The highest-rated show across all channels in its 9pm time slot, it is not just Britons who love it. Love Island is now produced in seven other countries.Within 24 hours of launching last month, Love Island Australia received the largest catch-up service ratings for an Australian reality TV show ever. With three successful series behind it, the UK show even took home a BAFTA earlier this year, winning the award for best reality show and paving the way for the current series\u0027 success.Thorpe Park has opened its own Love Island-themed attraction - complete with beach - this summer.And more than one university student has written a dissertation on the reality show.Labour MP Stella Creasy tweeted amid the Brexit votes to say she hoped he was all right.The show even had its own underdog.Unlucky in love Alex, an A\u0026E doctor from Wales, won the hearts of the nation before being dumped from the villa just one day before the final. One fan explained her newfound love for the show: \"It\u0027s the first series I\u0027ve ever watched, but I\u0027m addicted. It\u0027s the same appeal as Big Brother. Seeing into people\u0027s lives - into relationships which are normally secret. You know they\u0027re not real, but it doesn\u0027t matter.\"Plus, as a girl, you get to see how the men act when they are with a date, and then how their behaviour changes when they are with their friends. And then again, how that dynamic changes when they interact with the girl\u0027s mates.\"It\u0027s on six nights a week but I wish it was seven. I look forward to 9pm. Most of my friends watch it too. And every episode ends on a cliff-hanger, so you have to watch it the next day.\" The world, it seems, cannot get enough.With the show recently commissioned in Denmark, Finland and Norway, there will be a version of Love Island on somewhere around the world every single day between now and Christmas.A daily Love Island podcast which dissects each night\u0027s antics - presented by Kem Cetinay, one half of last year\u0027s winning couple, and DJ Arielle Free - has barely been out of the top spot on the iTunes podcast chart since launching at the end of May. Free - who appeared in one of the Harry Potter films and briefly worked as a foot model - landed the job as Morning After podcast host after throwing her own Love Island final party last year.A true Love Island fan, she puts the success of the show down to its authenticity: \"It\u0027s a real insight into how we function as adults when it comes to dating. There are always those moments you can relate to - the uncertainty, the lust, the love.\"Last year\u0027s show moved away from all the sex and focused more on the relationships between people, I think that\u0027s why everyone became so gripped. You want them to fall in love, you want them to work and you\u0027re always rooting for someone or a couple. I genuinely feel heartache when it doesn\u0027t work out for some of them.\" Love Island commissioning editor Amanda Stavri agrees that the tone of the show is of primary importance. Explaining how the production team carefully edit any intimate scenes, she says: \"It\u0027s really important that it\u0027s not a salacious show - that it isn\u0027t grubby.\"Stavri also puts its success down to \"not being full of conflict\" and the fact \"it doesn\u0027t feel exploitative\".When whittling down the vast numbers of entries, producers insist they don\u0027t cast for potential conflict, instead relying on the natural dating dynamic to create tension.Some 85,000 people applied to be on the show this year - more than double the number of applicants for Oxbridge. Love Island producer Richard Cowles has called the non-scripted show \"aspirational, relatable and all about falling in love\".However, Cowles goes on: \"If people don\u0027t like it they don\u0027t have to watch. We\u0027re not pretending to be anything other than an entertainment show that\u0027s a distraction from real life.\"Geared towards a younger audience, over half of Love Island\u0027s launch night viewers were aged 16-34.Only Britain\u0027s Got Talent - shown on ITV\u0027s main channel - has attracted a bigger audience for that demographic on any channel so far this year. Arielle Free says the show\u0027s success is in large part down to the hard work of the production team: \"I think Love Island winning the BAFTA was a true reflection of what audiences are consuming and enjoying. It\u0027s such a great accolade, especially for all the cast and crew who work tirelessly over the year and the two months in the villa to make it as entertaining and memorable as possible.\"It\u0027s also possible that Love Island can put its popularity down to the simple fact that people love to see their own experiences reflected on screen.If you take away the location, honed physiques and perfect hair, what you are left with is people attempting to connect, along with all the pitfalls and pleasures that come along with that gamble."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/08/2048x1152/skynews-baby-talk-liguistics_4377361.jpg?20180801112822 ","title":"zimbabwes ruling party zanu pf wins parliamentary election","story":"With elections under Mr Mugabe marred by fraud and often deadly violence, his successor president Emmerson Mnangagwa promised a free and fair vote and invited international observers."},{"url":null,"title":"zimbabwe election results announced ruling","story":"NewsZimbabwe election results announced as ruling Zanu-PF wins majority in first poll since Robert MugabeRobert Mugabe\u0027s reign ended its last chapter today as Zanu-PF, his old party, won a majority in Zimbabwe\u0027s elections - without himShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByMacDonald DzirutweDan BloomPolitical reporter08:25, 1 AUG 2018NewsIt sets the stage for Mugabe\u0027s nemesis, Emmerson \u0027Crocodile\u0027 Mnangagwa, to claim victory and remain President (Image: AFP)Get politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailRobert Mugabe\u0027s reign ended its last chapter today as his old party won a majority in Zimbabwe\u0027s elections - without him. Mugabe ruled the nation with an iron fist for 37 years before he finally quit in a bloodless coup in November. Speaking this week, the frail 94-year-old said he couldn\u0027t back ruling party Zanu-PF claiming: I cannot vote for those who have tormented me. But today Zimbabwe\u0027s Electoral Commission said Zanu-PF were cruising to a big majority after picking up 109 seats - compared to just 41 for the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). That sets the stage for Mugabe\u0027s nemesis, Emmerson \u0027Crocodile\u0027 Mnangagwa, to claim victory and remain President.  Voters in Zimbabwe pick a presidential candidate based on their party affiliation. And the trend in the parliamentary election was expected to continue when results for he president are announced this week. The House of Assembly of Parliament has 210 seats. Another 58 seats were yet to be declared in latest results reported by Reuters on Wednesday morning. Zanu-PF would need to win 30 more to have a two-thirds majority that would allow it to change the constitution at will. The opposition MDC, led by Nelson Chamisa, won in most urban centres, where it enjoys majority support. But Zanu-PF won sweeping majorities in rural areas, the electoral commission said.

The raiders struck at the 30-room mansion of biotech multi-millionaire Sir Christopher Evans OBE, and made off with \u0026pound1million worth of gems belonging to Lady Anne Evans. CCTV shows the gang brazenly strolling back and forth across the grounds of the Evans\u0027 mansion in broad daylight, carrying several basket-loads of their loot. It is thought that the four suspects scaled a seven-foot wall to gain entry to the grounds, whilst Lady Anne took her dog Scooter for a walk. Amongst the high-value jewellery and antiques taken from the mansion were four George III silver candlesticks, a gold and amethyst choker, and a late 19th century gold, diamond and sapphire tiara. Distraught Lady Anne also lost an 18-ct white gold diamond ring, an 18-ct yellow gold brooch set with four pearls, and a platinum and white gold diamond line Cartier bracelet in the raid.   Swimmer\u0027s arm severed and another\u0027s leg amputated after they are hit by speedboat propeller in Majorca  And three Art Nouveau silver rose bowls were also taken, dating back to 1901, and with the embossed inscription Flowers are the playthings fair left by angels long ago. The jewellery and antiques had an estimated value in excess of one million pounds, and it is believed the offenders made off in a grey or silver Audi S5, headed in the direction of Cirencester. Gloucestershire Police are now investigating the theft, which took place on July 9 between 5pm and 8pm at Glebe House in the quiet village of Bibury, Glos. Sir Christopher, an internationally renowned life sciences entrepreneur who is worth \u0026pound158million, has spoken of the audacity of the burglars. He said: On behalf of my family I am offering a substantial reward for information that will lead to the conviction of these thieves. It is a sign of the times that people have the audacity to scale a perimeter wall in broad daylight and walk across open grounds to steal from someone\u0027s home. We\u0027ve lived in Bibury for many years and have never encountered anything like this before.   Man legally changes gender \u0027so he can get cheaper car insurance as woman\u0027  Of course, there is always a financial loss when something happens like this, but the real pain comes from what these stolen items mean and symbolise in our lives. The burglary has had a particularly devastating effect on my wife Anne as many of the pieces of jewellery, silver and ceramics have huge sentimental value for us both. For example, Anne\u0027s engagement ring, her late father\u0027s signet ring - the only thing she has left of him. Then there is an irreplaceable rose Ramsden and Carr rose bowl - dated London 1901 - and a diamond ring I bought my wife when our first child was born - which cost almost our entire savings at that point. There are many small value and large items that have been stolen but they all have the same emotional and sentimental impact. Detective Constable Faye Satchwell-Bennett, who is investigating the burglary, added: We are trying to identify the offenders and ask that members of the public watch the CCTV footage and think back to that day. Do you know who these people are? Did you see a silver or grey vehicle driving at speed through Bibury between these times or anything suspicious that may help with our investigation? As with any other burglary this has had a marked impact on the victims.

A witness reported him to the police after the absolutely horrendous incident in a public park. The partially-sighted attacker and his partner were playing fetch with the guide dog and his other black labrador at around noon on July 9.  The man, from Blackburn, told one of the dogs to fetch the tennis ball, which was being thrown by his wife, and he told the other dog to stay but instead they both went to fetch the ball, witnesses said.  One onlooker said the man, who was wearing sunglasses, started shouting abuse at the guide dog before hitting it in the face with his fist \u0027at least 10 times\u0027 and dragging the dog into the back of his car. The incident was later reported to the police, RSPCA and Guide Dogs For The Blind Association, which trains and places guide dogs with clients.  A 59-year-old man, who walks his dog in the park twice a day, said he was in shock when he saw the incident unfold. He said: I couldn\u0027t believe what I saw. It was absolutely horrendous. It would have to be horrendous to have to remove a guide dog from an owner. There were four or five people just standing there not knowing what to do. It was truly shocking. I went over and explained to the man I would phone the police and RSPCA and he just put two fingers up at me. In hindsight I should have taken the dog and driven it to the police station myself or videoed him doing it and showing to the police as evidence. Since the incident members of Guide Dogs and the RSPCA have taken action against the man and removed the guide dog.

The enormous lion\u0027s mane jellyfish put three people in hospital last month and now could be heading to the sea near you.  The terrifying creatures, which administer a nasty sting, have already been seen swimming off the coast in Cumbria, Blackpool, Anglesey, Dublin, and Ayrshire, reports Wales Online  They can grow to extraordinary lengths, with the largest on record found in Massachusetts Bay, USA, in 1870 with a bell diameter of 2.3 metres and tentacles at 37 metres long. In contrast, blue whales, the largest known mammal, can only manage up to 30 metres in length.  The jellyfish, binomial name cyanea capillata, use tentacles to capture prey, which can include fish, smaller jellyfish and other sea creatures. They are also capable of a nasty sting, like a bad nettle sting, according to Swansea University expert Dr Nick Flemming. Three people were in hospital last month after encounters with the creature in Galway, Ireland. Dr Fleming is one of the resident jellyfish experts at Swansea University.  He explained: “These jellyfish are part of a community of jellyfish present all around UK coasts every year. “These are not exceptional circumstances sometimes there are years where we see more of them, and sometimes we see less. In terms of the lion’s mane jellyfish, it is probably one of the most venomous jellyfish, with a sting like very bad nettle sting. “Steer clear of them if you see them on the beach - they can still sting. The best way to deal with a sting is warm/hot water which will neutralise the venom.  Different people would advocate different remedies - some studies have said vinegar can deactivate jellyfish - but I’d say the best way is warm/hot water. “The sting is like a toxin, and the best way to neutralise a toxin is to put as much hot water on as possible. Vinegar does work, but to really nullify the venom, use water of 45 degrees or more, or even a heat pack. “Some people might enter an anaphylactic shock from jellyfish stings - but this only happens on very rare occasions. The nettle-like stings they can produce will be felt for a couple of hours.

Miss Stevens, from Neasham, and Miss Coulson, from Middleton St George, near Darlington, Co Durham, were stuck on the volcano until Monday because many of the trails and bridges had been destroyed and they were among hundreds of tourists trapped there overnight.  Their families faced an anxious wait until the British Embassy traced the former Hurworth School pupils. The women eventually managed to get into an area for a mobile phone signal to call their loved ones. Miss Coulson’s aunt Victoria Toas said: “They actually believed the volcano was erupting until they spoke to us and we told them it was an earthquake. “They were absolutely terrified. There were boulders flying past them and then there were aftershocks.”  She said they had learned there had been looting in following the earthquake and there were concerns that the pair may not have passports to leave the island. But later, she added: “I have just spoken to Kathryn and they have located their passports and luggage and are heading to the port. So thankfully all is well.” The students saw an army truck heading up the mountain to collect bodies as they descended, so it was feared the official death toll may increase.  The earthquake early on Sunday killed 16 people, including an Indonesian student who was among the Mount Rinjani climbers. The shallow quake set off landslides on the rocky mountainside, blocking the normal pathways out. The National Disaster Mitigation Agency had said more than 680 people were stranded on Rinjani, based on figures from its entry gates where visitors are registered. Most are foreign - from 26 countries - including more than 330 from Thailand.  The Foreign office said last night that six Britons who registered to climb the mountain confirmed to officials that they had made their way safely to its base – but others may have gone unreported. More than 1,400 homes were damaged on the island after the tremors struck from a shallow depth, which tends to inflict greater devastation. Indonesia’s meteorology and geophysics agency has recorded more than 270 aftershocks. President Joko Widodo said the government would give each family whose home was destroyed 50 million rupiah (\u0026pound2,670) to rebuild.

The Royal Family’s patience with him has finally snapped over his outbursts about Meghan and husband Prince Harry. Advisers have held at least three top-level crisis meetings on how to stop the former Hollywood lighting director piling distress on his daughter, who has not spoken to him since the wedding 10 weeks ago. It is also claimed the 74-year-old’s public ramblings about the Duchess of Sussex and the royals are now so out of hand the Queen may have to get involved to end them. His most recent interviews include claims Meghan, 36, is “terrified” in her new role as a duchess and that Harry’s mum Diana would have “loathed” the way he is being frozen out by the Royal Family.    A source said: “Meghan is deeply hurt by what is happening and everything is being done behind the scenes to make sure her welfare is at the top of the agenda. “It’s an increasingly desperate \u0026shysituation and now it’s come down to three options being on the table. “Firstly, Meghan could contact her father straight away and appeal to him directly to ask him to stop hurting her, but right now she’s decided to cut him off. There is a possibility an \u0026shyintermediary could meet with him and appeal to him to stop making such hurtful \u0026shystatements. “The final option would be for Meghan to cut him off completely in the hope he will stop, but the \u0026shysituation is so precarious no one knows when that would be.”  There are fears if Meghan does make contact with Thomas he will reveal details of the conversation or sell his story. Both Harry, 33, and Meghan are \u0026shyunderstood to be angry at a recent TV interview when Thomas revealed details of conversations with the prince, including his views on Brexit and US President Donald Trump. The duchess was also said to be “deeply embarrassed and hurt” that her dad mentioned Diana. Our source added: “This could be the final straw for Thomas.

The Summer Kitchen initiative at Drapers Mill school in Margate, Kent is believed to be the first of its kind in the UK.  Families are being served home cooked meals with ingredients donated from local allotments, farmers and supermarkets, Kent Live reports.  Sharon Goodyer started the scheme, which runs three nights a week for anyone in need, to help the \u0027forgotten\u0027 children who go hungry during the holidays.  She said: “We forget all the children on free school meals throughout the holidays. “We give children meals in the term time, but what happens to school children in the holidays? “Teachers see children come back thinner after the holidays, children go hungry.  “We just decided that life is pretty grim at the moment in Thanet, and wouldn’t it be lovely if we all just sat down and had dinner together? “So we do it three times a week in August, for free.” Parents at the kitchen\u0027s opening on Monday expressed their gratitude for the scheme, and some said they would struggle to feed their children healthy meals throughout the holidays without it.  Carrie-anne Gibbons, 37, said: “I came here first as a volunteer, but said I will bring my son for dinner and try to prove this is much better than McDonald’s. “When we came in you can see everything that goes in your food. “I found being a single mum, healthy food is very expensive and there is no guarantee he is going to eat it. “It’s absolutely fantastic. To be able to educate my son about healthy eating, it’s so helpful to him. He thinks all dinners are chicken nuggets and chips.  A mother-of-two, who didn\u0027t wish to be named, said she was unable to afford food last week for her family. She said: “I went to buy some shopping and I had used up all my vouchers and all my change. “My bank card kept getting declined, and I had to walk away with nothing. There was a bloke behind me who offered to pay for it, but I was too embarrassed for them to put it through again. “As soon as he offered I burst into tears, the fact someone had to offer made me feel like a pauper. “It’s the worst thing that’s ever happened to me.”  She added: I would not be able to feed them a healthy meal. They would get chips, sausages or chicken dippers. The community kitchen is also open to single people. Graham Dawson, who is currently being supported by the Salvation Army, is one of them. The 51-year-old said: “It’s nice to be able to come somewhere because people on low income eat tinned food, processed food. A lot of poor people are overweight. When you are living on your own, it\u0027s not easy. When you haven\u0027t got much money it\u0027s not easy to go out much.

Survey after survey reveals that many young people struggle with relationships .  But many parents feel embarrassed to talk about relationships and sex, especially if they’ve experienced relationship breakdown themselves. We can’t leave young people flailing about in what’s now a toxic environment for healthy relationships.  It’s imperative that RSE (relationship and sex education) classes arm pupils with solid advice which helps them address real relationship themes that affect them in countless ways and which will affect every serious relationship they have in the future.  Here are 10 lessons which I would advocate.  Learn the Five F Factors before committing to each other These factors determine long-term compatibility and harmony and are also the source of many divorces:  Finances and how much you agree/disagree on spending and saving.   Family – and how much time you are willing to spend with your respective families.   Friendships and what part they play in your day-to-day life.   Fun and leisure and how you may have very different expectations for how to spend, such as on weekends and holidays.   Frisky factor – your sexual compatibility.  Marriage won’t solve a problem relationship Always keep in mind that problems you have remain the same after marriage unless you work on them. Also don’t go into marriage believing “love will conquer all” because it doesn’t. For instance, it’s totally unrealistic to believe that if you give you partner all your love, they’ll change issues they have like addiction. They won’t. What you see is the personality you get. The person they are doesn’t miraculously change with a wedding band. If they’re unreliable, disrespectful or a cheat, this will continue after your vows unless you both work on it. A wedding isn\u0027t the same as a marriage Many people get so involved in the excitement building to the big day that they struggle afterwards, wishing the excitement could continue. Keep one foot on the ground when caught up in your perfect wedding plans. Married life will have more highs for you to enjoy but it’ll also have lows.  Cherish your self-esteem It’s essential that youngsters learn about building self-esteem and how good relationships are impossible without good self-esteem. With mental health issues on the rise in teens, far too many struggle.  Good self-esteem is all about knowing who their partner is, accepting that their feelings  count, and recognising when they need support.  It includes having the self-belief that they can move forward successfully with a person and will not crumble in the face of life and relationship hurdles. Respect and responsibility for yourself and others Many teenagers struggle with understanding what self-respect and respect are. It’s about valuing themselves and their needs, and equally valuing their boyfriend or girlfriend’s needs. Lack of self–respect makes it difficult for them to set boundaries when a boyfriend or girlfriend treats them badly. Equally, they need to be aware of how to respect a partner, and to accept it when they say yes or no to something. It’s essential young people realise that relationships are two-way streets. It’s no good getting caught in the blame game, always saying it’s the other person’s fault when things get difficult. Instead they must understand their responsibility for how a relationship is progressing. They must share responsibility for the wellbeing of their relationship, whatever their age.  Talking and listening  Many teens fear rejection, meaning that they don’t want to risk asking for something they need within  the relationship.  They don’t want to rock the boat or appear to be a burden. Equally, many adults get into the trap of believing they’re mind readers when it comes to what their partner wants. Learning to truly listen is vital for any successful long-term relationship. Never be pressured into sex until you are ready Whether 17 or 37, no-one should ever have sex before they’re ready. If you’re nurturing your self-esteem and respecting yourself, you’ll be able to tell your partner you’re not ready. You’ll also be able to set boundaries on any further pressure. And again, if you aren’t sexually compatible before you commit, suddenly having a ring on your finger won’t change that.  Managing expectations in a relationship Everyone has an idea of what a romance or relationship should be like. Such ideas can become absolute expectations. Everyone should expect to feel valued within a relationship, to have fun, to grow in understanding of their partner and themselves, plus to seek solutions together when hurdles arise. But when it comes to getting married, they need to have learned that it’s not simply about love. Commitment is about making they both want the same things from their lives together. Secretly hoping your husband-to-be will change his mind about wanting children once you’re married simply means you’re fooling yourself.

After a brief respite from the heat, parts of the country are bracing themselves for another scorching spell as the heatwave is set to return. Weather forecasters have warned that temperatures are likely to hit 30C (86F) across the south of England by Friday, instead of being concentrated in the south east. The mercury will continue to climb over the weekend reaching highs of 32C (89.6F) and possibly 33C (91.4F). While the south shrivels, northern parts of the UK will continue to see showers with temperatures sitting in the mid 20s.  A spokeswoman for the Met Office said: In terms of the weekend just gone, they were the first two days this month where temperatures haven\u0027t reached 25C (77F) but we have got back to that point today, it hit 25.3C (77.5F) in Cavendish in Suffolk so it\u0027s already starting to warm up again. Over the next few days there will be something of a north and south split - high pressure is already starting to build up in the south, bringing dry, fine and weather. She warned: Southern England and Wales are going to turn quite hot by Friday - temperatures will probably reach 30C (86F) by that point. This is likely to include quite a wide area across the southern part of the UK - it will widely hit 30C (86F) across southern England and Wales, and the very hot weather will return as we approach the weekend.  Today (Wednesday) : It will be a bright morning for many with a scattering of showers in north-west England and Scotland. Turning largely cloudy in the afternoon for most with persistent rain in Northern Ireland and western Scotland. A bright and sunny day in East Anglia and the south-east. Moderate southerly winds.   Tonight (Wednesday night) : It is going to be a wet night in Northern Ireland, Scotland and northern England with showers that could turn heavy and thundery at times. A mostly dry night elsewhere with clear spells throughout. There is a chance of showers in the early hours in western Wales. Gentle south-westerly winds.   Tomorrow (Thursday) : It is going to be a cloudy day for many with rain in the north and north-west, though this will be mostly light in nature. It will be a dry and very warm day across southern England with plenty of sunshine in East Anglia and south-east England throughout the day. There will be moderate south-westerly winds.  UK Outlook (Friday and Saturday): On Friday there will be a few sunny spells at times, mostly in the south. In the north there will be showers that could turn heavy and thundery at times. Saturday is going to be a mostly dry day with just a few light showers in western Scotland. There will be sunny spells at times in the south-east.

The unusual cleaning procedure is due to a rare condition which leaves the tot’s skin covered in scales. Diagnosed with the rare autoimmune disorder lamellar ichthyosis, which sees her skin thicken and shed every couple of weeks, like a snake\u0027s, Raven Ford\u0027s daughter, Amelia Moe, cannot use soap as her skin is so sensitive. But retail worker Raven, 23, of Superior, Wisconsin, USA – also a mum to Benjamin Faice, six, and Cole Ford, two – has been criticised for her hygiene routine, saying: “Because Amelia can’t use soap, I put two tablespoons of bleach in her bath water every other day. “It’s controversial, and not everybody is comfortable with it, but it’s been recommended by dermatologists and it’s the only way to kill the bacteria under her scales.  “If we don’t do this, she can get infections or pockets of oil, which show up like yellow bumps on her scalp.” Raven said she and her partner, officer worker Gary Moe, 43 -Amelia\u0027s dad - knew the moment she was born at St Mary’s Medical Centre in Duluth, Minnesota, that something was wrong. She continued: “She looked like a little plastic doll. She had this build-up of really thick skin, which looked very tight and shiny. “She couldn’t close her mouth or eyes, so doctors weren’t sure at first if she had eyelids, and it covered her hands and feet so much that there were no visible prints.”  As ichthyosis is so rare, medics were initially baffled. But, the following day, they consulted with a specialist at the University of Minnesota, who confirmed the diagnosis, but could not determine at that stage what form of the condition Amelia had. There are several different types, all of varying degrees of rarity and severity – the most extreme of which can see babies dying shortly after birth. “The not knowing was the worst feeling in the world,” said Raven. “We were told not to Google ichthyosis, but I couldn’t help myself. I just wanted to know what was happening. “Some forms are really severe, and carry quite bleak life expectancies, so it was terrifying thinking Amelia might have to go through that. “I had so many questions, and just needed to know what type she had.”  While the family is awaiting genetic testing to be completely certain, doctors are now confident Amelia has lamellar ichthyosis which, according to The Ichthyosis Support Group, occurs in approximately one in every 200,000 UK births and is currently incurable. However, symptoms, including sore, thickened and flaky skin, can be managed using medicinal creams. For the first 10 days of Amelia\u0027s life, she remained in hospital – during which time her hardened skin began to crack and bleed at her joints, so her parents, and a nursing team applied ointments every couple of hours, including Vaseline around her eyes. We have to do so much day to day to care for Amelia,” said Raven, who takes her daughter to regular appointments at University of Minnesota Medical Centre to discuss her ongoing needs. “She takes fluoride supplements for her teeth, as we were warned the condition can cause some dental abnormalities. We also have to put Aquaphor petroleum jelly round her mouth when she eats otherwise the food will stain her skin. “Her hair is quite brittle and can fall out easily, and her nails have begun to build up and harden too. “We read on some support groups about people with ichthyosis having such thick, tough nails that they need to cut them with plyers, and the skin on the bottom of their feet being so tough they exfoliate with sandpaper. “We haven’t had to do that with Amelia though, thankfully.”  Now, Raven manages Amelia’s symptoms by bathing her twice a day, and keeping her skin constantly topped up with moisturisers and steroid creams. Where her skin is particularly scaly, she cannot wear certain clothing in case it snags and tears off. “Anything too loose risks snagging, but anything too tight cuts into her and makes her bleed, so we have to be really careful,” Raven said. “She’s just started crawling, which causes sores on her knees, so we’re keeping her covered up in trousers made of soft, gentle material.” As Amelia does not have sweat pores, summer is an especially difficult time. Mostly, her parents avoid taking her out in scorching temperatures but, if it cannot be avoided, they keep her temperature down with ice packs and a special cooling towel. Over time, the youngster’s skin has settled into a cycle of building up and shedding. Raven explained: “She starts out smooth, then her skin gets darker and shinier as it builds up. Eventually, she’ll be unable to close her eyes, at which point we have to start using a type of topical medication called Tazorac cream. “Then, her skin will start to shed and peel. Thankfully it doesn’t bleed anymore like it did when she was first born. “Her hands and feet are largely unaffected, but the peeling on her face takes around a week and the peeling on her scalp takes two.

These devastating - yet also moving - images show the spot where little Levi Cole Ellerbe was allegedly left to die after being set on fire. The youngster was rushed to hospital in a critical condition after he was found with severe burns in Louisiana, USA, one night in July. He died from his injuries the next day, police say. His mum has since been charged in connection with his \u0027murder\u0027, while another woman was arrested on suspicion of first-degree murder.  The touching blue-and-white memorial wreath was placed at the charred spot, near train tracks, by a retired law enforcement officer last week. Sharing the heartbreaking images of the cross online on Thursday, Tim Key said he had placed it at the location with a very heavy heart. He wrote: This is the hardest thing I’ve ever posted. Today I placed a wreath with a very heavy heart on behalf of the Natchitoches Police Department, Natchitoches Sheriff’s Department, Natchitoches Fire Department, Louisiana State Fire Marshal’s Office, Louisiana State Police, Northwestern Police Department, 911 Dispatchers and Natchitoches Regional Medical Center Emergency Room Staff. Tim, formerly of the sheriff\u0027s office, thanked each and every person that had worked nonstop on the case, adding: Also a special thank you to the Staff at Jeanne’s Country Garden for the beautiful wreath.  He finished: R.I.P. Baby Levi. Commenting on the Facebook post, one user responded: Tears flowing. Another wrote: A picture speaks a thousand words. And a third added: The most heartbreaking thing to see. Levi was discovered with obvious burns following a report of a blaze. It was claimed he had been kidnapped less than 90 minutes earlier when two people turned up at his mother Hanna Barker\u0027s trailer door. Barker, 22, told officers the pair \u0027beat\u0027 on the door, before she was sprayed in the face with a chemical substance she believed to be mace. She claimed she immediately fled her home to escape from the alleged attackers, but when she returned, she discovered Levi missing.  Officers received a 911 call at around 9.10pm on July 17, sparking a massive search for the young child in the Natchitoches area. Just over an hour later, at about 10.20pm, Natchitoches Police Department (NPD) received a report of a fire near railroad tracks. Arriving at the scene, they discovered Levi. The \u0027smiley\u0027 youngster was taken to Natchitoches Regional Medical Center, fighting for life, before being airlifted to another hospital. He passed away from his injuries on July 18, NPD said. Last week, the force said a woman from Natchitoches had been arrested on suspicion of first-degree murder over the death of Levi. Felicia Marie-Nicole Smith, 25, was booked into the Natchitoches Parish Detention Center on Saturday, July 21, it added.   And in a later statement, the force said Levi\u0027s mum had been arrested and charged with principal to first-degree murder over his \u0027killing\u0027. Barker was booked into the detention centre awaiting a 72 hour hearing, according to the statement, posted on Facebook last Wednesday. The Natchitoches Police Department and the Louisiana State Fire Marshal’s Office have worked tirelessly together in order to learn the facts behind this Homicide, the statement read. The two agencies have worked as one since this investigation’s conception through extremely long days and nights with little to no sleep. On July 25, 2018, Hanna Barker, W/F, 22 years of age, was charged with Principal to 1st Degree Murder in the killing of her 6 month old baby boy, Levi Ellerbe. It added: Earlier this week, Natchitoches resident Felicia Marie-Nicole Smith was arrested for 1st Degree Murder in the case. An additional charge is expected to be brought against Smith.  According to local media, Barker and Smith have both since been charged with criminal conspiracy. Police said the baby had been found set on fire off Breda Avenue. In an earlier statement, they said: At approximately 9.10pm on July 17, NPD received a 911 call in reference to a 6 month old baby being taken from a residence in Mayberry Trailer Park. Officers arrived and spoke with the mother of the child who advised that two unknown subjects came to her trailer and began beating on her door. She stated upon opening the door she was sprayed in the face with a substance she believed to be mace. She immediately fled the residence to get away from the attackers and upon circling back discovered the baby missing. They added that officers began immediately searching the area, with the help of additional officers from other precincts. Meanwhile, firefighters attended the scene to check Barker out.

Seth Owen, 18, graduated from First Coast High School in Jacksonville, Florida, this year with stellar results and was offered a place at prestigious Georgetown University in Washington DC. The talented student was cut off financially by his parents after leaving home over concerns about his well-being - and as a result was unable to afford the costly tuition fees to go there this autumn. Valedictorian Seth says he was forced by his parents to attend gay conversion therapy for over a year but was finally given an ultimatum: go to church or leave home.  Mr Owen was finally excluded from their lives in January after he refused their demands, citing his issues over their anti-LGBT teachings.  One of his teachers, however, decided to step in and set up a GoFundMe page for her pupil in an effort to help him realise his dream.  Jane Martin, who taught him biology, set an initial target of $20,000 but was amazed when the donations kept flooding in on the crowdfunding platform.

Belinda Brodie, 31, was humiliated when they \u0027made fun\u0027 of her 20.4st figure, with some locals claiming she was \u0027too fat\u0027 for any of their clothes. But New Zealand native Belinda, who now lives in Perth, Australia, decided enough was enough and has since dropped 8.5st. She has been enjoying the time of her life flaunting her brand new 11.6st svelte size 12 body all over the world - including luxury holidays around Australia, New Zealand, France, Norway and Spain. The brave mum even went back to Bali during her weight loss journey in 2014 with her husband Travis, 30, and son Oliver, six, and was elated when the locals recognised and even congratulated her on slimming down. Belinda said: Traveling when you\u0027re 130kg is not easy and I hated every minute of it. I was so anxious getting on planes because it\u0027s such a small space for a big person.  When I visited Thailand and Bali I could feel both locals and other tourists gawking at me and some would even laugh at me behind my back. It was heartbreaking. It\u0027s so hot in Asia so I\u0027d be wearing less clothing than usual and couldn\u0027t cover up like I normally would, so I felt extra vulnerable. When I was in Bali, I was looking at some clothes on the roadside stalls and the shop owner came out and told me I was too fat to buy anything, and that they had nothing big enough to fit me. I heard them laughing after I\u0027d walk away, and it really hurt. This happened a lot, and it totally gutted me. I love the Balinese people and I don\u0027t think they meant to be so mean about it. It\u0027s just a cultural thing, they\u0027re very direct and have no filter. Similar things happened in Thailand, too. Other tourists would move out of the way to let me pass with a big smirk on their face. It\u0027s so humid and I\u0027d be sweating all the time. While I still mostly enjoyed myself, I feel like my size just ruined things for me and spoilt my holidays. But after losing the weight, I\u0027ve never had any issues travelling and have had some incredible experiences.  I\u0027ve travelled everywhere now, and have been snowboarding, hiking, horse riding and bow and arrow shooting. I never could have done any of that before as I was so unfit.  The mum-of-one said her weight would constantly fluctuate due to yo-yo dieting - but began to pile on the pounds more than ever after the birth of her son in 2011.  Belinda revealed that she suffered from post-natal depression and anxiety, and would often find herself \u0027comfort eating\u0027 whole batches of homemade baked cookies, brownies and muffins. And with her husband Travis working away in the mines, the mum said she would isolate herself indoors and never wanted to leave the house. But after struggling to keep up with her son, Oliver, then two, at a local Perth zoo, Belinda said she realised she needed to change her lifestyle for good. In September 2013, Belinda totally overhauled her carb-heavy diet of bread, pastries and pasta with a clean-eating regime that focuses on healthy proteins and fresh fruit and vegetables.   She also began exercising daily by going for jogs every morning and working out at the gym with the help of a personal trainer and fitness classes.  Now Belinda is fitter than ever, relying on Brazilian jiu-jitsu and powerlifting six times a week to keep her toned. She said: I tried all the different diets, I\u0027d lose a little weight, but then pile it all back on soon after stopping. I wasn\u0027t happy with myself and was 100kg after giving birth to my son. All of a sudden, you\u0027re in the mum role and it\u0027s so easy to stop taking care of yourself because you just give everything to your baby. I was so happy to have this gorgeous little boy in my life, but I felt like I was losing myself a little bit. The post-natal depression just creeped up on me.  I think a lot of new parents can relate to this. I\u0027m just lucky I got myself out of that spiral before things got too bad. I finally decided to make a real change to my health after I visited the zoo with my son. I couldn\u0027t keep up with him. The next day I threw out all the bad things from my cupboard and started again. I began jogging each morning, and eventually joined a gym and went to fitness classes. I managed to lose 30kg in the first year. I felt incredible, and the weight just kept coming off. It was all just clean eating, exercise and determination. That\u0027s it.

the oldest in Scotland and the only one in the world that uses a 10¼ inch gauge.The attraction opened at West Links Park in 1935.John Kerr, 22, the third generation of his family to run the venture, fears it could come off the tracks soon and has put plans to extend the railway on hold.Visitor numbers have halved in the last decade, partly blamed on the relocation of the play park.Kirstene Hair, Scottish Conservative MP, has backed the planned extension and urged Angus Council to throw its weight behind the proposal.She has asked chief executive Margo Williamson to make a commitment to the future of Kerr’s but has acknowledged this may need to be a cost-neutral solution.She said: “Kerr’s is iconic to Arbroath’s waterfront, it would be incredibly disappointing if it was not able to keep going for at least another 80 years.“There must be some way of securing its long-term future, and I hope the council can assist Kerr’s with extending the track towards the play park to boost visitor numbers.”A spokesman for Angus Council said the local authority and the Angus Tourism Co-operative stood “ready and willing” to discuss the development of tourism and business opportunities.He added: “The links has a first-class play area and has benefited from recent investment from partners in leisure facilities, as well as there being proposals for a new hotel and restaurant in the area.”Welcoming the move, Mr Kerr said: “I have not had any communication from Kirstene Hair but it sounds good.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"competition for starting spots can drive dundee united to

As soon as my dad walked in, I just felt like I was going to burst into tears at any point.“I had to have a tissue in my hand when I got married just in case.“I am not usually emotional but that day I just kept on crying.”Waiting at West Park Hotel was Lewis with best man Ryan Bruce and ushers James Simpson, Gavin Smith and Euan McCafferty and Lisa’s nephews Ellis and Luis Mordente who were an usher and page boy respectively.By her dad’s side, Lisa was piped down the aisle to the tune of Highland Cathedral.It’s not unusual for Godfrey to be seen at weddings as he is a well-known Dundee photographer.Lisa said: “It was amazing having my dad walk me down the aisle and then he became the photographer for the day too.“Because my dad has been doing wedding photography for so long he knew a contact for every part of our big day so that made it a bit easier.“All of the suppliers were amazing and I can’t thank them enough for helping put our wedding together.”After, the pair, who live near Tannadice Park, said “I do” the evening reception got into full swing.Local band Pepper Pot got everyone up on the dance floor, which is exactly what the bride had dreamed of.“I didn’t want a boring wedding – I wanted everyone to get up and have a good time,” she said.“I first saw the band at my sixth year dance and always said I wanted them to play at my wedding as they were such good fun.

The first is my collections of jewellery which I design and make to be distributed to the shops that stock my designs up and down the country.“The second is my bespoke pieces.“This is where someone comes in with a design in mind or with a piece they want to be remodelled.“With my bespoke designs it is much more fun as I can be a bit more creative.“It can be a big responsibility as a lot of the time someone is grieving over the loss of a loved one and they want a piece to remember them by or they want a piece of their loved one’s jewellery reworked.“You can’t change it back, so it can be quite nerve-racking.“I have also incorporated people ashes into designs, so it can be a very emotional journey with my customer.“It is lovely that I can really help customers after the passing of a loved one with a piece that is incredibly sentimental.“The third part is teaching.“I have held workshops since the beginning. I think it makes the pieces more sentimental when someone has made the ring themselves.”After taking the plunge to work on her business full time only a year ago, Scarlett has urged anyone else in the same position to take that leap into self employment.“This business is my life and I love it.

He missed the penalty at Ross County and for this reason he talked to Adam and said ‘you take it’!“Nicky is a player sometimes you don’t see anything from for 90 minutes and then he’s there to score a goal, this is his strength.“His two goals definitely gives us hope for the league ahead.”That was Clark’s second and third goal in his first four games for the Tangerines.With 29 goals in 62 Championship games for previous club Dunfermline, United are hoping he can fire them to promotion this season.Another bright spot for the campaign ahead is youngster Declan Glass. The 18-year-old made his mark in the north, despite only replacing Clark for the final eight minutes.With the final move of the game, Glass jinked past his man on the edge of the area and smashed the goal beyond Kyle Gourlay, the Elgin goalkeeper on loan from Dundee.And Csaba says knocking in four goals sets his side up for next week’s league opener against the Pars.He added: “It was important we scored goals.“In the first half we tried but we had just two or three possibilities but we missed and I think the second half was OK, we used the possibilities to score.“It’s always the same against teams who are in a lower league, they defend very well and stay very deep.“I said in the dressing-room keep your patience, keep going, keep going and be more accurate in front of goal.“It was good, I am really satisfied.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures dundee united take on 100 young arabs at open day","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United players took on 100 young Arabs at Tannadice yesterday with many more fans getting a chance to meet the players.The Tangerines held their annual open day giving supporters the chance to meet the squad aiming to get their side back in to the Premiership."},{"url":null,"title":"proposal to modernise two dundee play parks","story":"\t\t\t\t\tTwo Dundee playparks are in line for improvements.Proposals have been put forward to upgrade the play area at Lochee Park and the Bankmill Road park.Council officers, residents’ group Community Spirit Action Group and West End councillor Fraser Macpherson held a “walkabout” when potential improvements were discussed.Mr Macpherson was told proposals to upgrade Lochee Park will be considered by Dundee City Council’s neighbourhood services committee in the autumn, with the possibility of improving the Bankmill Road park to be considered thereafter.He said: “I am pleased that improvements to the playpark at Lochee Park will be brought forward in the autumn for consideration as it could well do with modernisation and new play equipment.“During the community walkabout we also visited the park in Bankmill Road and it is hoped to upgrade it too.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b472af772e3d.jpg ","title":"thousands of extra visitors since opening of new dundee railway station","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee’s brand new railway station has attracted thousands of extra visitors since opening earlier this month, according to ScotRail.In all, the number of ScotRail passengers travelling to and from Dundee increased by 16% in the period from July 9-29.It’s a rise of approximately 16,000 passengers on the same period last year.While 2018’s passenger numbers have been buoyed by The Open in Carnoustie, railway bosses say it is not the only factor in play.A ScotRail spokesman said the firm believes that a quarter of the additional passengers were visiting Dundee for reasons other than golf – about 4,000 in total.The spokesman added: “There has been a significant boost in customer numbers since the new station opened, which is great news.”The figures do not include those using other railway services such as the Caledonian Sleeper or LNER, formerly Virgin Trains East Coast.

In addition to converting an equestrian centre into a holiday complex, the others are for a farm house, a detached house and an agricultural shed.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\"These may herald even more development in turn threatening to form a circle that, if unchecked, would eventually widen, join-up and constrict the core site protected by our charity,\" Mr Skinner said.He also cited the recent approval of a golf course at the Coul Links which falls within the Loch Fleet site of scientific special interest.He questioned whether either designation would still have any meaning if they were going to be run roughshod over by the current planning process.\"Culloden and the Coul Links are just two examples of a worrying trend,\" he said. \"Scotland\u0027 heritage is too often being cast aside for short-term economic gain.\"Four years ago, we argued for a planning framework which has the long-term wellbeing of our heritage sites built into it.

She said: \"Everything for kids is so expensive nowadays, I thought we could have some good old fashioned fun on the beach and bring a few families together.\"The idea was for the kids to have an hour

excited.\"There is too much red tape and so many barriers to get through to run an event, people will end up giving up.\"Unsure of how to save the event, she took to the Nairn Rocks social media page

has admitted.Public anger over a lack of visible action at the site \u0026ndash which went up in flames in April 2013 \u0026ndash has been growing as assurances of forward movement repeatedly come to nothing.Most recently it was suggested that the scaffolding could be down by June after a planning application was lodged to demolish the remaining structure and rebuild.This was scuppered when Highland Council\u0027 conservation and building officer objected that, at one storey lower than the original, the proposed rebuild would not \"preserve or enhance the character and appearance\" of a designated conservation area.Historic Environment Scotland also voiced disquiet, sending the building\u0027 owners back to the drawing board.Now Inverness city manager David Haas \u0026ndash who has generally sought to paint the protracted discussions over the building in the most positive light \u0026ndash appears to have fully acknowledged the depth of dissatisfaction as the city finds itself in the midst of a sixth tourist season with the unsightly ruin still in place.\"We know it is taking far too long and that it is an unacceptable length of time,\" he said after the Inverness Courier again sought answers over progress.\"It is not moving as fast as we would like.\"It is frustrating but we want to make sure we get it right and we want to make sure it happens.\"We respect the fact

Hayden, chairwoman of Crown and City Centre Community Council, said she is glad Mr Haas has finally admitted the situation is \"unacceptable\", believing the community is \"being made a fool of\" over the whole saga.\"It has been for a long time and we have the right as a community to ask for an update and to get one,\" she said.\"The whole thing has been kept very hush-hush and there has to be something wrong for it to have taken five years \u0026ndash there is a bad smell about the whole thing.\"Talking about the impact of so prominent a building sitting untended for so long she said: \"It

I did not vote to leave the trading union.“When I voted in the original referendum it was about joining a common market not becoming just one state in a union of European states. I want a trading partnership with Europe as I think that is good for the economy.”A male voter from Aberdeen, aged between 35-44, who voted leave in the referendum but would now vote remain, said: “The entire process has been a farce.“I feel that I was lied to continually by the Leave campaign and those lies are all coming to a head.“Turkey is decades away from joining, if it ever does.“There’s no ‘cake and eat it’ deal coming from the EU, the bankers are leaving London for Amsterdam, Frankfurt and Paris.“Leave told us we’d prosper immediately but now Jacob Rees-Mogg said last week it will be 50 years before we feel any benefit from Brexit.“I’ll be dead in 50 years and my children will be retired.”One man from Aberdeen, aged between 65-74, said he had changed his vote from remain to leave because of the “attitude of the EU to the referendum and negotiations”.A remain voter from Inverurie said he would vote leave now because of the “attitude of European bureaucrats” to the UK.He said: “They intend to ensure a poor deal for the UK to deter other countries from leaving the EU. This is not the behaviour of democratic government.”Ross Thomson, Scottish Conservative MP for Aberdeen South, said: “More than 33 million people voted in the 2016 EU referendum, with a majority of people – more than 17m – voting to leave.“We must respect the democratic outcome of that UK-wide vote. We would be straying into very dangerous territory indeed if we were to ignore the stated will of the British people on this issue.“This online survey suggests a small number of people may be reconsidering their decision.“However, detailed national polling has consistently shown very little movement in the views of people across the UK as a whole.”However, North-east Labour MSP Lewis Macdonald said he was not surprised by our survey results.He said: “I think the key comment is the one saying that people voted to leave a political union not a trading union.“That speaks volumes for a lot of people and certainly if the referendum question had been about our trading relationship, we might have had a different result.“That’s why the UK Government has to reflect the reality of public opinion and most people want to remain within the trading relationship.”Aberdeenshire East SNP MSP Gillian Martin said: “The results of this survey are not at all surprising. The UK Government has not listened to the people of Scotland on how Brexit will impact on their day-to-day lives.“Agriculture, fishing and the NHS will all struggle with staffing shortages which are already being reported upon here in the north-east and throughout the UK.“We have a government stockpiling medicines and blood in case of no deal and no clarity on the benefits of leaving the European

lane, there would indicatively be 268 seats available.“The sale of food and drink for consumption on the premises would serve Prime Four workers, Kingswells residents and people working at and visiting the new Aberdeen Football Club stadium.”Construction is under way on the first phase of the new £50 million stadium and training facility.However, a legal challenge has been launched by opposition group No Kingsford Stadium (NKS) which has concerns over infrastructure and the impact on the Westhill and Kingswells areas.The drive-thru application states the plans will provide new facilities in the area and lead to the creation of new jobs.It also added it would complement the neighbouring development at the Prime Four Business Park and Kingswells village.Although the site has not yet been developed, it did obtain planning consent in December 2014 for a three-storey office development.However, the application states this was not developed due to the “well documented lack of demand for new office floorspace”.Ardene House Veterinary Practice said it has “no plans” to vacate its site.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"renewed call for inter town cycling routes","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA call has been made for a special cycle path to be created between three north-east towns to make it easier for children to move around.East Garioch Councillor Glen Reid is looking for a route to be made from Blackburn and Kintore to Kemnay.The SNP politician argued it will give children more opportunity to move between the towns safely and without being driven by parents.His call comes after the recent opening of the Inverurie to Kintore cycle path linking the two towns.Plans are in place to link Blackburn to Kintore, but Mr Reid is hoping to create a wider cycle network, taking in more of Garioch.He has welcomed the opening of the Kintore to Inverurie route. He said: “This terrific path enabled my children and I to go on a 20km bike ride from our home in Kintore without having to pop the bikes on the car and drive to a safe cycle route.“Following its opening last Saturday and the planned next stage being Kintore to Blackburn, I am continuing my campaign for a route from Kemnay to Kintore and Inverurie.\u0026#8220Around 67% of the children who attend Kemnay Academy come from Blackburn and Kintore and are bussed there.“This route would allow them to access the school’s leisure facilities and clubs outwith school hours without parents having to taxi them.\u0026#8220I have asked council officers to look into this as the public transport links between our communities are poor and these paths not only benefit cyclists, they also provide a safe route for people to walk and jog.“The proposal has huge support within the local communities.”Mr Reid added: “This idea has been in my head since before I became a councillor.“One of my sons goes to Kemnay Academy and the bus services in that area are not very good, so it gives them limited options for using school services outside of school hours.“It makes sense to link up different Garioch communities and have a more comprehensive network rather than just focusing on the Inverurie to Aberdeen route.”Fellow East Garioch councillor Martin Ford has campaigned for a number of years for the cycle path between Kintore and Inverurie and has said he is pleased to see the route in use.Mr Ford, co-leader of Aberdeenshire Council’s Democratic Independent and Green Group, said: “The works to build the previously missing section of cycle path between Kintore and Port Elphinstone are now largely complete – including the actual path itself.\u0026#8220So the path is entirely useable all the way from Kintore to Port Elphinstone – and is being used, which is good to see.“A complete route for cyclists and pedestrians between Kintore and Port Elphinstone, without the need to cross the busy A96 dual carriageway, is obviously a big improvement.“I am very pleased Aberdeenshire Council has been able to provide this facility.”An Aberdeenshire Council spokeswoman said: “The creation of a shared-use walking and cycling path between Inverurie and Kintore is part of a larger project to develop a dedicated, traffic-free route between Inverurie and Aberdeen via Kintore and Blackburn.“In addition to this long distance route, Aberdeenshire Council is committed to improving walking and cycling infrastructure on a local level through the Integrated Travel Town projects.\u0026#8220The creation of a shared use walking and cycling path between Kintore and Kemnay is something the Council is willing to discuss with communities with a view to potentially developing in the future.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"bp boss hails progress","story":"\t\t\t\t\tBP’s boss has praised the oil major’s “steady progress” as profits soared in the first-half of 2018.The oil firm chalked up pre-tax profits totalling £6.7 billion, up 190% year-on-year, while revenues increased to £111bn from £86bn.The firm’s underlying replacement cost profits more than doubled to £4.1bn.BP chief executive Bob Dudley said: “We continue to make steady progress against our strategy and plans, delivering another quarter of strong operational and financial performance.“We brought two more major projects online, high-graded our portfolio through acquisitions such as BHP’s US onshore assets and invested in the future with the creation of BP Chargemaster.“Given this momentum and the strength of our financial frame, we are increasing our dividend for the first time in almost four years.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 25","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 23/06/18, 5:52 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,Labour and the Lib Dems must recognise and respect the recent vote in the Scottish Parliament and the views of their Scottish colleagues who refused to give consent to the damaging Brexit legislation proposed at Westminster.Labour amendments to former clause 11 of the bill require consent of the Scottish Parliament unless a UK Minister ‘has reasonable grounds for believing that regulations are required for the purpose of giving effect to any international obligations’.It would be catastrophic for Scotland if Labour left the door open for the Tory Government to breach the devolution settlement.Leaving Holyrood exposed to powers taken without consent in any area connected to an international trade agreement would be disastrous. This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"sun sweat and stunts at the mayds sports day","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 07/07/18, 7:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.The Mid Argyll Youth Development Services (MAYDS) Sports Day Not on the Green kicked off on Friday June 29 to sun and sports.The sun didn’t deter the many athletes filling the fields at Lochgilphead joint campus, with rugby, football and golf just a few of the many activities enjoyed.The annual sporting event celebrated their anniversary 10 years of healthy attitude and fun with a portable skate park set up in the car park and even Wonder Woman stuntman, Dom Kinnaird, demonstrating moves for taking down bad guys.With the help of the Year of Young People National Lottery Fund, the event was organised by MAYDS themselves and featured music and stalls with temporary tattoos, face painting, hot dogs and ice cream, with swimming also held at the MACPool.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 27","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 11/07/18, 6:12 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe pages of the July 6 edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser contain too many stories of sadness and pain.

It was difficult to hold the bottom at times, however, we managed to hook into dab, plaice, grey gurnard, haddock and a good haul of thornback rays to bring our species tally for the day to five.All in all a decent day’s fishing given the rough conditions. We returned to harbour a tad battered and soaking wet.Day two was almost as windy as the first day, however the rain kept away which was a bonus.Conditions were still far too rough for fishing the deep so we started off on the soft ground for flats but the spurdogs had other ideas. Everywhere we went \u0026#8211 singles, doubles, trebles \u0026#8211 there was just no getting away from them despite Robbie’s best efforts.I have never seen so many chunky spurs, with the best of the day tipping the scales at 14lbs 8oz.Needless to say a fair number of rigs were wrecked, leads snagged and lost on the rough ground, and quite a few fish dropped. On the plus side there were a few PBs and a couple of new club records set.In between the spur attacks, we picked up a few decent dab, plaice, cod, grey gurnard, red gurnard and coalfish (coalies) to take our species count for the day to eight.Despite the rough and tumble we enjoyed the trip and the opportunity to catch some decent fish. Hopefully the weather will be kinder next year and we’ll get to drop a line out in the deep water marks which hold so many more species.The combined scores over two days:Nikki Thompson 185%***********************It was no surprise to find ourselves fishing in the pouring rain yet again. We don’t seem to have much luck weatherwise, but at least it was relatively calm out of Oban with only the slightest breeze.We headed out on board the ‘Laura Dawn’ in search of fresh bait but despite several drifts the mackerel eluded us.With the big tides, skipper Ronnie suggested we fish the rough ground and reefs for pollack and coalies. The plan was to play around here until the tide eased off enough to drop the anchor.It was pretty desperate though with only a few miniscule whiting to show for our efforts. The incredibly rough ground and fast drift were challenging to say the least and most of us left a fair amount of tackle and lead stuck fast to the seabed.Enough was enough, so we decided to head for deeper water and anchor up even though the tide was still pretty strong, resulting in some horrendous tangles.It proved to be a sensible move from a fishing point of view though, with reasonable sized spurs hooked on the very first drop. More spurs, spotty dogs and a couple of bonus thornbacks were taken throughout the afternoon.It was nip and tuck right to the end with just one fish separating the top three placing.Final scores:\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert golf club is looking for players","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 26/07/18, 12:32 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowSort that swing because Tarbert Golf Club is holding its James Mundell Memorial gents open.On Sunday August 5 players will compete at Glenralloch for various gross and net prizes between £20 and £60 and, of course, for the coveted James Mundell Memorial trophy.So book your place for a chance to win.Tee off times are 7.50am to 9.10am, 10.45am to 12.05pm or 1.40pm to 2.50pm.To book, call 01880 820565 and entry fees are £15.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"teenie takes the title in myargyll","story":"\t\tSandy NeilUpdated: 31/07/18, 7:36 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA competition capturing #myargyll has been won by Teenie Wilson, an amateur photographer on the Isle of Lismore, who took this stunning image before an evening’s fishing at Port Ramsay, as the sun set over Glensanda quarry in Morvern.The competition, run in in association with Wyvex Media and Argyll and the Isles Tourism Co-operative, sought to recognise why you think our region is such a fantastic place to live, work and visit through photography, video and prose.Teenie, who runs the Lismore Post office and shop with her husband David, took up the hobby, which they share, two years ago.‘I love it,’ she said: ‘It gets me out. I take the camera wherever I go. I always keep my eye open for the right shot. With a good camera you can’t go wrong.’One summer evening last year, Teenie said their neighbour Duncan Black, a retired seaman, had asked if she wanted to go fishing. ‘I was waiting for him to bring the boat in,’ she recalled. ‘I thought it would make a great shot. We caught 40 fish that night. When I downloaded it, I thought ‘wow’.’‘Wow’ indeed, because it was voted the best from hundreds of brilliant photographs sent in by you – you can still enjoy them all by visiting #myargyll.‘I am chuffed,’ Teenie said. ‘I am not very confident in my own work \u0026#8211 everybody tells me they are good. This has given me a huge boost.’Thanks to her winning photograph, Teenie has won an autumn break for two on Islay, featuring an overnight stay at the Machrie Hotel, dinner and B\u0026ampB in Bowmore’s Harbour Inn, a tour of Islay’s newest distillery, Ardnahoe, a boat trip with Islay Sea Adventures, travel via Hebridean Airways, based at Oban Airport, a night at the Falls of Lora Hotel in Connel, and an Oban walking tour.Teenie said: ‘I am taking my sister, because she persuaded me to enter the competition.’Teenie also runs the island’s photography club and has just been awarded £1,000 to set up a junior one this winter.The runner-up was Alan Frew from Helensburgh. He was surprised but absolutely delighted with his achievement.His stunning picture was taken at Carsaig jetty, near Tayvallich.He said: ‘My son Aidan is an avid BMXer and wanted a picture of himself jumping.

As ever, I will looking into every issue brought to my attention by local residents across my council ward.After travelling back to Islay I checked up on the state of road repairs across the island. Some progress has been made in many areas like the Hospital Road in Bowmore and Mansefield Road in Port Ellen. The potholes in Port Askaig that I had been telling our roads department about have been filled in.After calling and emailing around about the large and dangerous potholes at An Creagan Place in Port Charlotte, I have been informed that the road in this area is not the responsibility of Argyll and Bute Council. It belongs to ACHA, and since obtaining this information I spoke in person to the very helpful and hard-working staff at the Bowmore ACHA office and asked them to fill in these potholes.Aside from road concerns on Islay, quite a number of my fellow Ileachs have mentioned lack of bed spaces in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital. Being an island community obviously means that transferring more and more patients to the mainland is hardly ideal.The consensus from my constituents who I have been in contact with is that the number of beds in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital is not enough. I have contacted NHS Highland to voice my constituents anger about this situation.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) is seeking volunteers to clean up Scotland’s beaches in the 25th anniversary Great British Beach Clean from September 14-17.Volunteers also record the litter they find, and this has really helped change policy and behaviours.Last year 1,588 volunteers in Scotland took part, cleaning 111 beaches in four days. A staggering 491.4 pieces of litter were found for every 100 metres cleaned, a seven per cent rise on the amount recorded during 2016\u0026#8217s event.The fight to stop the plastic tide has only just started and we need everyone to take part now more than ever. We need the evidence from these surveys to highlight the action we all need to take for the sake of Scotland’s seas.To volunteer visit www.mcsuk.org/greatbritishbeachclean or call 01989 566017.Catherine Gemmell, MCS Scotland Conservation Officer.Sir,The Tories’ hypocrisy on MoD wages has been exposed – after it was revealed that around 220 staff in Scotland don’t receive the Real Living Wage, just days after the Tories topped up the pay of some of the best paid MoD staff.An MoD Freedom of Information response revealed that 220 staff in Scotland earn below the Real Living Wage of £8.75 an hour – yet they are not in line to receive any pay boost from their employers. The Tories’ policy is set to cost around £4 million – yet boosting the wages of those receiving less than the real living wage would cost, at most, under £400,000.This smacks of utter hypocrisy from the Tories, after their comments of recent days regarding pay for forces personnel.What the Tories are choosing to overlook is the immense benefits service personnel have living in Scotland, like free prescriptions and university tuition fees for their children.  And it’s only those earning above £33k who pay a fraction more.If they are so concerned with equality – why aren’t they ensuring that all MoD staff are paid the living wage?Boosting the incomes of the lowest paid MoD staff could cost the Tories less than a tenth of what they are spending to top up higher incomes – yet once again, for people on lower incomes they are not prepared to lift a finger.The Tories’ double standards know no bounds – it’s one rule for the elite and another for the rest.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures 3","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 30/07/18, 6:22 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowReader Robin Morton provides this week\u0026#8217s photograph, which features a popular subject \u0026#8211 the Paps of Jura.

staffShare\u0026nbspByGary Fanning10:00, 29 JUL 2018NewsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHealth bosses were this week urging motorists to park ‘appropriately’ after complaints about parking chaos at Ayr Hospital. NHS Ayrshire \u0026amp Arran this week appealed for drivers to help to keep the grounds as safe as possible for patients, visitors and staff. The car parks at University Hospitals Ayr and Crosshouse have designated short and long stay areas which are clearly signposted. The short stay car parks have a time limit of three hours and the long stay car parks are for people who need to park for longer than three hours. When the car parking scheme was first implemented, there was a significant improvement in parking behaviours. However, this has not continued. John Wright, director for corporate support services, said: “Over the past few years we have carried out surveys and audits of the car parks at University Hospitals Ayr and Crosshouse and created more than 400 new spaces across both sites. However, we have now reached the limit of the number of new car parking spaces we can build. We are, therefore, asking for help from members of the public. “We need to make sure that we all play our part in parking appropriately and safely in all of our car parks across all of our sites. This will help traffic to flow better, reduce the risk of accidents and ensure that we comply with health and safety regulations.” Mr Wight is urging motorists to: park only in a designated parking bay and do not park on footpaths, or at road junction He urged drivers notto park in disabled parking spaces if you do not have a blue badge Mr Wright said people can help reduce congestion at car park by travelling to the hospital by public transport or car share. He added: “We know that parking is challenging on our sites, particularly at University Hospitals Ayr and Crosshouse. “However, we are limited to the number of spaces we have and this is why we are urging the public and our staff to help us and to park appropriately. We will also be looking at other ways of reducing the volume of traffic on our sites at particular times of the day.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyr HospitalUniversities and CollegesCrosshouseAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13014961.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_kmp_ayp_200718capsule.jpg","title":"ayrshire post set among items","story":"NewsAyrshire Post set to be among items in time capsuleAlso included in the stainless steel capsule is a Clydesdale Bank £10 note, with a picture of Burns on it.Share\u0026nbspByLochlin Highet12:28, 1 AUG 2018NewsTime capsule to be buried (Image: Ken McKissock)Get daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailWhat will they make of Donald Trump’s visit to Ayrshire in 200 years time? We’ll never know – but hopefully our newspaper will survive to provide some information. For an Ayrshire Post is among items going into a new time capsule at the top of the Burns Monument at Alloway. Also included in the stainless steel capsule is a Clydesdale Bank \u0026pound10 note, with a picture of Burns on it. Poignantly, there’s also a drawing of Robert Burns by National Trust for Scotland volunteer Isla Grant, 17. And there’s a letter by NTS trainee Parris Joyce on what The Bard means to her. Hopefully, the monument will survive well into the future as a result of a near \u0026pound500,000 restoration.  The old capsule turned up when workers removed the gilded urn that sits atop the monument. The urn is being regilded, and a new airtight-sealed time capsule will take the place of the old one. NTS staff suspected there might be an old capsule there.  That’s because of an old letter from a Thomas Hamilton to a John Connel (building contractor) on April 23, 1823. The letter mentions enclosing a hermetically-sealed glass bottle soldered into the tripod, and containing various items. As it happens, the Burns enthusiasts of the time chose a copper container, as the one that came out of the urn was covered in verdigris. Items inside included two Ayr newspapers of the day – an Ayr Advertiser and a West Country Journal – dating from 1816 and 1815 respectively. Although now in a poor state, these appear to have been chosen for stories they carried about proposals for a Burns Monument. The original capsule also contained a silver sixpence depicting George III. Spookily, the urn containing that capsule was erected following a parade to the then new monument on July 4, 1823. And the old capsule saw the light of day again, on July 4 this year.  The monument was built by public subscription and fundraising, and the restoration is also being funded  by donations.

The Honest Men kick off their Championship campaign at home to Partick Thistle on Saturday - the side they put to the sword last week to top their Betfred Cup group. And McCall, who is unfurling a title flag for the first time as a manager, hopes the fans can turn out for the occasion. He said: “We are all very much looking forward to the game on Saturday, where we will get the flag. “I am hoping for at least 3000 of our own fans there to make a hell of an atmosphere. “I think all the fans who missed the last game of the season will maybe want to come to this one. “Plenty would have thought we had blown the league, and they weren’t alone in thinking that - I thought we had blown it. “But we want to get off to a flyer and the fans can help.”  United will play Dundee at Dens Park in the last 16 of the Betfred League Cup on Saturday, August 18. For the second year in a row the Honest Men have topped the group with maximum points and still ended up with tough Premiership opposition away from home. McCall said: “The team that we beat in the group gets Celtic at home and we get Dundee away. “It’s just the luck of the draw. “But the way we are playing we will go up there and give it a go. McCall added: “We won the group convincingly, which was positive going into the new season.  “People seem to forget that it’s the second biggest cup in Scotland. “For a club like us to be a seeded team two years in a row is just exceptional. “I think our fans have bought into it too, as there was over 700 fans there at Firhill which was amazing.” Lawrence Shankland scored a stunning 35 yard lob to make it 37 goals from 37 games. McCall said: “He is very happy here so I think it would take a hell of an offer for him to leave.” Ross Docherty, who was on the bench against Partick, is expected to be in the squad on Saturay. Mark Kerr will be suspended due to bookings from last season carrying over. Chris Higgins is still sidelined, and Craig Moore and Andy Geggan will be assessed closer to game time.

A probe also uncovered suspected blood contamination on the shoes of staff at Crosshouse Hospital. The shock investigation, carried out by Healthcare Improvement Scotland in May, included A and E, the maternity inpatient ward and theatre department, and the medical high dependency unit. Examiners said they “observed good compliance with hand hygiene”. “This included medical, nursing and domestic staff,” they added. But the report said that maternity theatre staff “appeared confused” about infection prevention and control audits, which was raised with senior managers. Concerns were also raised regarding suspected blood found on staff’s shoes and contaminated equipment in the maternity theatre and changing rooms. It comes just 12 months after a government-commissioned report into the “unnecessary” deaths of six babies at the hospital which criticised staff shortages. The latest hygiene report stated: “We were told it is the responsibility of each member of staff to clean these, however, it was recognised this had been difficult to implement with some staff groups. “In the maternity theatres, two positional pieces were heavily contaminated on the inside covers. “This equipment is used to provide support and stability to patients during their procedures. “We were told these were removed immediately and replacements were ordered.” Inspectors said they were aware of “good segregation of domestic and clinical waste”. But their report added: “In the maternity theatres, clinical waste was not stored locked awaiting uplift. “We also identified a similar issue in the wards. This could allow unauthorised access to clinical waste.” Alastair Delaney, from Healthcare Improvement Scotland said: “A good standard of cleaning was found generally and it was noted that considerable improvements have been made to cleanliness of equipment in the emergency department since our last inspection. “However, to improve care, NHS Ayrshire and Arran should ensure theatre departments are maintained so they can be effectively cleaned to provide a safe environment for patients.” Hazel Borland, nurse director for the health board, said: “We fully accept these findings. “The HEI inspection was valuable in helping us identify areas where we need to improve and our staff found the visit to be informative and useful. “We are pleased the inspection team observed that there is a good standard of cleaning and cleanliness generally. “We have an action plan in place to ensure the requirements and recommendations highlighted are addressed and we will ensure we continue to provide high standards of care and hygiene throughout our healthcare settings.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnCrosshouse HospitalAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13014611.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS158038312.jpg","title":"new arrivals bring light parents","story":"NewsNew arrivals bring a light to parents\u0027 livesWe wish all the best to the new happy families, and any other recent newborns.Share\u0026nbspByLochlin Highet11:56, 1 AUG 2018NewsNew arrivals in AyrshireGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA number of new arrivals have been welcomed to Ayrshire.

Lawyer Ian Gillies pleaded guilty on Cooper’s behalf to a break-in charge against her. He said he was unable to explain her absence from court. The charge admitted by the duo says they broke into the home of a man, then aged 66, in Prestwick’s Adamton Road South, on October 10 last year.  Graham admitted an additional charge of breaking into the home of a 93-old man in Ayr’s Elba Court, also on October 10 last year. This charge states that she stole around \u0026pound400 in cash from the man. The court heard that Graham, formerly of an address in Ayr’s Russell Drive, now lives in Prestwick.

During this time there were three railway stations in Peebles \u0026ndash one where Tesco now stands, which was then extended to create a line to Galashiels the second in Dean Park and the third on Caledonian Road, serving travel to the west and Glasgow.\nThe rail link not only encouraged thousands of visitors, with The Hydro having its own spur, but underpinned the huge expansion of the weaving industry by providing fast, cheap links to world markets.\nUntil now there has been little recognition of the influence of the railway on the development of Peebles and, while some evidence can still be found in the Viaduct Bridge over the River Tweed and the railway tunnel connecting the bridge to the town, much has been lost.\nBut now railway enthusiasts are steaming ahead with plans to establish a museum which will house artefacts and photographs of historic trains during their journeys through Peebles.\nThe PCT is now hoping to gauge if there is an appetite amongst the people of Peebles for the museum.\nFurther investigations will have to be carried out, as it is believed the building is owned by Scottish Borders Council.\nIf the railway museum is given the green light, funding will be sought for the renovation of the old railway building.

We are very close but it won\u0026rsquot happen at all unless we reach the \u0026pound70,000 target with this final fundraising push.\nThe redevelopment will see all of the seating in the auditorium replaced or repositioned to increase space and improve the sightlines from the balconies, as well as installing new hand grabs on the aisle seats and improving the heating and ventilation systems.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"biking-bonanza-coming-to-traquair","story":"VISITORS to the Beyond Borders International Festival at Traquair House next month will be able to take part in free guided bike rides.\nLocal resident Andrew Marchant will be teaming up with authors and avid cyclists Kate Rawles, Peter Walker and Will Manners to lead a series of rides through the local countryside.\nFestival goers will be welcome to bring their own or simply hop on one of the hire bikes that will be available free of charge.\nAlong the stunning routes in the surrounding area, cyclists will listen and share a wealth of cycling knowledge with Andrew, Kate, Will and Peter.

faced a real pre-season test against the well-drilled, energetic and highly skilledPollock U19s.The visiting team had enough potential to produce players for the higher echelons of the game in the not too distant future.Coached by our Campbeltown\u0026#8217s Stuart Crossan, the Glasgow side impressed with their quick possession football and a willingness to close space, during a frantic opening quarter of a highly entertaining match, at the wonderfully prepared Kintyre Park.The visitors immediately seized the initiative using the ball effortlessly as they imposed their own brand of football across the full width of the park.The Campbeltown favourites were in no mood to play second fiddle and, after adjusting to Pollock’s enthusiastic start, the Pupils created a number of opportunities as Souden and Barr tested the defence down the flanks.The Pupils midfield and central defence dug deep to rest the initiative from their stubborn opponents, but gradually the pendulum swung as the home side played their way into the match.It was a fascinating encounter between two well-matched sides, a game enjoyed by what was a sizable crowd for a friendly fixture.The partisan home support were soon on song when the mercurial Sary Rhama broke free behind Pollock\u0026#8217s defence, a fleeting glimpse of goal before he was unceremoniously brought down from behind.Taking the penalty kick himself, the Pupil’s striker drove the ball straight down the middle to give the home side a slender advantage with 29 minutes on the clock.The pace was unrelenting, and the visitors were rewarded when the Pupils failed to clear their lines from a corner.In the ensuing play, the ball was skilfully carried to the touchline, before an accurate cutback found the incoming forward who drove the ball home at the second attempt beyond Ferguson.One each at half-time was a fair reflection, with neither side gaining the ascendancy.Both sides made a raft of changes in the second period.Pupils ‘blooded’ seven graduates from the under-16s eleven during the game.Pick of the day was an acrobatic scissors clearance from young Ross Brown,  saving the situation with a last ditch goal line clearance.Shortly after, the home side raced up-field to claim victory with a fine goal from player of the match, Ryan McConnachie.Instrumental in both defence and attack, Ryan controlled the ball expertly in the box, deftly shifted its position, before stroking the ‘leather’ beyond a stranded goalkeeper for a brilliant winning goal.A top drawer finish if there ever was one!Tomorrow Campbeltown Pupils bring top quality opposition to Kintyre Park in the shape of Bridgewater, last season’s Scottish amateur cup semi- finalists.A tough match is in the offing, as Bridgewater  lost narrowly by 1-0 to the brilliant

The Bustler was called in to coordinate 17 other tugs in a successful action to re-float her.The outcome was to try to find more of the human side of the life and times of Bustler and its crew, especially as we knew that many of its 45 crew were Campbeltown and Kintyre natives.The objective I had in mind is a shorter document that might be of considerable interest to visitors and readers of the Courier.During the months since our visit, I have gathered a wealth of material from RN service records, family photos, official books, The Campbeltown Book, newsletters and my father’s curriculum vitae.I have also found that another Bustler model is on show in the National Museum in Edinburgh.Most of my father’s papers are with family in Australia. He died there in 1981 \u0026#8211 and the family have some that should be of interest, so I am arranging  to bring them over here.One book stands out: \u0026#8216The Tattie Lads,\u0026#8217  by Ian Dear, published by Bloomsbury in 2016, available from Amazon at £22.50 hardback, also on Kindle.It tells \u0026#8216the untold story of the Rescue Tug Service in two World Wars and its battles to save cargoes, ships and lives.\u0026#8217Chapter one tells the history and background of the Rescue Tug Service (RTS).Chapter two is simply named \u0026#8216Campbeltown.\u0026#8217 Its 40 pages tell how the town became the world centre for rescue tug boats in the First World War and reopened in the next war.The chapter charts the rise of the U-Boats and the threats from aircraft, the re-establishment of the Royal Naval base from six tugs in 1939 to 85 world-wide by the end of the war.Campbeltown became the national training base and was responsible for naval discipline, including pilfering, looting and even a minor mutiny.Incidents, some amusing and others not so give a flavour of what life was like in those days, especially the anecdotes of the actual rescues that were attended round the world.The rest of the book recounts the feats and some failures of the RTS worldwide and RTS’s eventual closure at the end of the war. The only  direct  reference to my father, Lt Archie Leckie, is at pages 153/4 while stationed at an outstation of RTS at St John’s, Newfoundland.In March 1942, he had strongly reported after a tricky rescue with a tanker there that his then tug, Tenacity, should have had a modern towing winch.Shortly afterwards he was promoted to Lieutenant-Commander and appointed maintenance officer, rescue tugs base at St John”s.There is also a photo of \u0026#8216Bustler\u0026#8217 towing a conundrum used to lay the fuel pipeline Pipe Line Under The Ocean (Pluto) to Cherbourg after the Normandy landings.My father was mentioned in despatches for this action. I have donated a copy of the book to the museum and Elaine has placed it beside the model.I think there should, be a much bigger project to tell this story.My sister and I have many happy childhood memories of Bustler, and have even sailed on her but there are gaps as we were children at the time.We were shielded from the dangers my father faced and, of course, he was unable to tell us where he was going.Another of our difficulties is that having left school and Campbeltown in 1953, we also lost touch with Kintyre people.We are interested in any written experiences, or details of any surviving sailors.Donald Leckie,North Berwick.donaldleckie7@gmailHMRT Bustler in Campbeltown museum.

Charlotte Bliss, from Eastbourne, said: \"The cooked cheese items also amounted to no more than three stalls with huge queues.\u0026nbsp  \"I am appalled that this was allowed to be called a cheese festival.\u0026nbsp  \"I also purchased another ticket at the gate.  \"I will never attend another event like this in Brighton.\"  In an email to the event\u0027s organisers seen by The Argus, another guest, Flora Adam, said: \"I attended the event this afternoon and am extremely disappointed.  \"The event was in no way as advertised and had very little stands compared to what was promised.  \"Only a few hot foot stands (far from the 30-35 advertised) with no raclette cheese or fondue as detailed in your numerous Facebook promotions.  \"Stands were unprepared for the event and after queuing for 45 minutes we were told that halloumi fries were unavailable at about 2.30pm.  \"The gouda stand was running out of cheese as we left at 3pm.  \"Again, nothing as advertised and well overpriced at \u0026pound44 for two people.  \"I believe trading standards in this instance haven\u0027t been met and request a full refund.\"  Facebook groups have even been set up criticising the event, including one titled The Big Cheese Festival was a Load of Rubbish.

And while a little young to be enjoying a champagne celebration, Maisie will be returning to her Upper Stratton home as one of the youngest actors to have starred in an Oscar-winning film.      THE. SILENT. CHILD. HAS. WON. AN. OSCAR.    I genuinely don\u0026rsquot know what to do now. #Oscar2018 pic.twitter/lfXWlFBCj9  The Silent Child beat four contenders to the award: DeKalb Elementary, The Eleven O\u0026rsquoClock,\u0026nbspMy Nephew Emmett and Watu Wote/All of Us.  The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.  The film was given its first public screening in Swindon last month at the Swindon Arts Centre. Gilson, who spoke before and after the showing, said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a great pleasure to be able to finally show this in Swindon.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a film to be appreciated, and to spread a message.

A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.  The reporter is due to visit Cockenzie on Monday as part of her investigation into the application."},{"url":null,"title":"the-rahs-make-waves-across-the-world","story":"  The band, from Prestonpans, released their latest single Survival through their independent platform EH32 Records last week and have been thrilled by the response it has received.

And Prestonpans Labour Club, which Walter was a member of, has also joined in with recent fundraisers, helping it donate more than \u0026pound1,400 to Pancreatic Cancer Scotland.  Mattie Edmond, club steward, handed over a cheque for \u0026pound1,410 to Fiona Brown and Alison Clancy from the charity after they hosted Pancreatic Cancer Scotland following two events on Easter Sunday and a show with the Jersey Beats organised by Pete Barrie with support from the Prestonpans Hearts Supporters Club.  Derek Costello, club convenor, said: \u0026ldquoPancreatic Cancer Scotland is the Labour club\u0026rsquos nominated charity and we will continue to support Walter\u0026rsquos family and friends in their fundraising efforts in memory of Walter, who was a well-loved and respected member of our club.  Fiona Brown from the charity was delighted to receive the cheque and said the proceeds would go to help raise awareness of pancreatic cancer, which is the fifth most common cause of cancer death in the UK as the majority of patients are diagnosed too late for potentially curative surgery.  Walter, who lived in Prestonpans with Janet, was just 60 when he died. He had been diagnosed with the disease only 29 days earlier.  Wife Janet has vowed to continue campaigning to raise funds and awareness in her husband\u0026rsquos memory.  She said: \u0026ldquoI cannot thank everyone enough for the support they have given me and my family over the past 18 months.  \u0026ldquoRaising awareness of pancreatic cancer is just as important as the fundraising and I would urge everyone to learn and understand the symptoms of this \u0026lsquosilent cancer\u0026rsquo.

Svetlana Kondakova and Maja Quille, graduates of Edinburgh College of Art, worked on \u0026lsquoMusselburgh Archer\u0026rsquo, a life-size bronze cast of an archer and 12 steel arrows which will create a trail around the town.  In a joint statement, they said: \u0026ldquoWe hope that the artwork will link the heritage of Musselburgh to the modern day, as well as providing an interactive element of activity for both locals and visitors with the trail.  The lifesize figure represents layers of local history including the Roman invasion in AD 80, the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in 1547 and the Musselburgh Silver Arrow, which dates back to 1603 and is claimed to be the oldest sporting trophy in the world still competed for annually.  The artwork will be completed with a series of stainless steel arrows installed at different locations around Musselburgh. They are expected to be installed later this summer and will form a trail around the town to areas of cultural, historical, natural and community significance, supported by a Global Treasure App organised by Musselburgh Area Partnership.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoThis is a striking piece of art that represents so many aspects of local history. Residents of Musselburgh and visitors will no doubt appreciate this latest addition to the public art within the community.  Michael Johnson of Nottinghamshire created \u0026lsquoThe Mussel\u0026rsquo with input from local schoolchildren, and its installation was recently highlighted in the Courier. He has been making artworks for public places since 1991 and has now completed more than 180 commissions for both rural and urban sites throughout the UK and Ireland.  Mr Goodfellow added: \u0026ldquoThis is a work of outstanding beauty that truly complements the town and its cultural heritage.  East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos Arts Service formed a working group to select and commission artists to create the new public artwork. The group included representatives from Musselburgh Area Partnership, Musselburgh and Inveresk Community Council, Musselburgh Conservation society, East Lothian Council officers, councillors and other community representatives.

He told the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe are recording in July and August with Calum Malcolm as producer.  \u0026ldquoWe are just working on material at the moment. I have got 37 European dates and 15 in the UK, so it is hectic at the moment. We are recording in July and August and then out in September with new material.  A first gig in Edinburgh for several years \u0026ndash at the Queen\u0026rsquos Hall on September 22 \u0026ndash is immediately followed by performances in Liverpool and Royal Leamington Spa.  Then it is across to mainland Europe with Luxembourg, Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Poland, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Belgium all visited.  Fish said he was looking forward to the tour but added: \u0026ldquoIt is daunting \u0026ndash every tour is daunting.  \u0026ldquoBut we have got a super-duper German tour bus this time.

The crew chose East Lothian due to its great surfing beaches and its film charter \u0026ndash an agreement between council departments to work together to accommodate film requests in the East Lothian area wherever possible.

Mr Ramsay, who is from West Yorkshire, told the Courier: \"I think it is a disgrace that East Lothian has no contingency plan for shipwrecks despite being a fishing community.  \"I have been threatened and abused while staying at the beach at Prestonpans with my boat and when I managed to float it and asked for permission to move to Cockenzie Harbour I was refused by the MCA.  \"I\u0027ve lost everything, this was my home and I invested everything in it.

The announcement comes after another incident at the park saw goalposts broken and scorch marks left on the 3G and 2G pitches.  The park, which is home to various football teams, has been the victim of numerous attacks but the latest, earlier this month, led to calls on social media for security to be tightened up there.  Two summers ago the park was hit twice by vandals in two weeks, again during July, with the \u0026lsquopie hut\u0026rsquo broken into and items stolen, as well as damage caused to the pitches and surrounding area.

The plans went before by the council\u0026rsquos planning committee in March last year but members agreed to delay a decision while consideration was given towards improvements being carried out at the junction of the A199 and B1407.  But the developer opted to go straight to appeal and Christopher Warren, a reporter appointed by the Scottish Ministers, gave an indication that the plans would be approved towards the end of November last year.  Now he has issued a final decision, which allows 93 houses and 20 flats to be built on land beside Orchardfield.  Gerry More, managing director of Stewart Milne Homes Central Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoThe sensitively designed new homes planned for East Linton will have a mix of 19 individual home styles, with house prices set to appeal to a wide range of buyers, from first-time buyers through to growing families.  \u0026ldquoOur vision is to create a series of new communities in East Lothian that incorporate traditional values and features from historical East Lothian towns and villages.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos encouraging that this vision is being shared and supported by the local authority.  \u0026ldquoWith substantial investment planned for landscaping, design and placemaking, The Orchard in the market town of East Linton is set to be a prime example of Stewart Milne Homes\u0026rsquo innovative approach to creating unique, sustainable and aspirational communities.  Thirty-one objections were lodged with the council\u0026rsquos planning department ahead of councillors considering the plans last year.  Dunpender Community Council raised concerns that the development was \u0026ldquotoo large-scale and building so many new homes at once would \u0026ldquoput undue pressure on existing services and infrastructure both within East Linton and in the wider area.  Ward member Councillor Norman Hampshire, who is also the chairman of the council\u0026rsquos planning committee, said: \u0026ldquoObviously we as a council support the development \u0026ndash it is part of the Local Development Plan. However, we did have concerns regarding the entrance into East Linton and we had hoped to have made improvements to that entrance.  \u0026ldquoHowever, Stewart Milne Homes have now got consent.  \u0026ldquoWe can still try to negotiate with the company to see if improvements can be made to the entrance.  \u0026ldquoMy preference would be a roundabout, like we have on the eastern side of East Linton, but that might be difficult now they have got consent but we will still negotiate to try to make improvements for access in and out of East Linton.  \u0026ldquoIt is a fast road and cars come down that hill and try to make a left turn into East Linton.  The councillor added: \u0026ldquoI think there is potential for an accident blackspot.  Mr Hampshire described East Linton as \u0026ldquoa very attractive village and noted the development would fund an extension to its primary school.  Of the 93 houses, 64 would be detached, 16 semi-detached and 13 terraced.  In terms of size, two of the proposed 93 houses would contain two bedrooms, 33 would contain three bedrooms, 36 would contain four bedrooms and 22 would contain five bedrooms.  Eighty-five of the houses would be for sale, with 28 affordable housing units, which would be a mix of two different house types and one and two-bedroom flats."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8129137.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"map-highlights-alcohol-hotspots-of-east-lothian","story":"  The study by Alcohol Focus Scotland, alongside the Centre for Research on Environment, Society and Health, flagged up hotspots in Musselburgh, Haddington and North Berwick.

It also found that alcohol-related death rates were four times higher in neighbourhoods with the most outlets when compared to areas with the fewest in the county and crime rates were also two-and-a-half-times higher.

Users will be able to set themselves time limits and receive alerts when that time is up.  They will also be able to mute all Facebook notifications for set periods if they do not want to be distracted during that time.  Facebook director for the UK and Ireland Steve Hatch said the tools, which start rolling out to users worldwide on Wednesday, would help raise user awareness of how they are spending their time online.  \u0026ldquoWe all recognise that technology is playing a greater role in our daily lives, he said.  \u0026ldquoWe feel a responsibility to help ensure that time on Facebook is time well spent.  Earlier this year, Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg said the firm was committed to improving the \u0026ldquomeaningful time people spent on the site, even if that meant less time spent on Facebook overall.  It comes as the social platform continues to face intense scrutiny over some of its practices, including how it polices content and users.  In response to the new tools, children\u0026rsquos charity the NSPCC said the site is still not doing enough to protect young people.  Laura Randall, the charity\u0026rsquos head of child safety online, said: \u0026ldquoFacebook and Instagram state they want to ensure their platforms are safe but to do so, they need to tackle serious problems within their sites.  \u0026ldquoTime limits do not address the fact that there are still no consistent child safety standards in place. Apps, sites and games continue to allow violent and sexual content to be accessed by children and sexual predators are free to roam their platforms, targeting and grooming young people.  \u0026ldquoThis lack of responsibility is why the legislation the Government has committed to must include a mandatory child safety code with an independent regulator to enforce consequences for those who don\u0026rsquot follow those rules.  Facebook\u0026rsquos new tools are similar to digital well-being features being introduced later this year by both Apple and Google to their mobile phone platforms.  Both, like Facebook, will show users how often they use their phone and the various apps, with time limits able to be set to help them cut down.  Mr Hatch said digital health is an \u0026ldquoindustry-wide issue that requires an industry-wide response, and that there is an expectation on Facebook as a leader in the field, to be part of that response.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos not just about the time people spend on Facebook and Instagram but how they spend that time, the Facebook blog post on the new tools said.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos our responsibility to talk openly about how time online impacts people \u0026ndash and we take that responsibility seriously.

Scots who incurred expenses claimed, on average, \u0026pound994.77 in the last year, and the smallest amount they would claim for is \u0026pound8.43, according to new research.  At the top of the list of reasons of Brits who failed to file expenses included deeming the value \u0026ldquotoo low to be worth the hassle and losing receipts.  Half of those who incurred business costs were frustrated at having to pay for them using their own funds before being reimbursed by their company.  More than a third experienced cash flow issues while waiting for their expense claims to be reconciled, with almost one in ten even missing a payment on a personal credit card as a result.  Visiting in-laws, ironing and cleaning the house were all activities workers would rather do than submit their expenses, the team at Barclaycard found.  Personal finance expert, Annie Shaw, described the findings as \u0026ldquoeye-opening.  She added: \u0026ldquoWith some resorting to paying out of their own pocket to cover company costs, it\u0026rsquos clear action needs to be taken to prevent employees footing the bill.  However, the responsibility also lies with the individual and there are simple steps everyone can take to make sure they claim back any business costs they\u0026rsquove paid for.  \u0026ldquoMy main advice for those who submit expenses is to make sure it\u0026rsquos done on time.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos also important to hang on to receipts - making use of email receipts where possible for ease - and trying to make regular time in the working week to go through the process.  \u0026ldquoThere are also several ways businesses can make it easier for workers to complete their expenses, including providing corporate credit cards and encouraging them to submit claims on time."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8142305.jpg?type=article-full","title":"sponsored-content-discover-the-scottish-craft-brewers-who-arent-doing-things-by-halves","story":"  So hop to it and find out the Scottish craft beer brewers putting the country on the map...  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Harviestoun Brewery  BEFORE THERE WAS CRAFT THERE WAS HARVIESTOUN\u0026hellip  For the last 35 years, the independent brewery has been obsessively experimenting in the pursuit of perfection and their story is one of continuous innovation.

All Sulwaths ales are made and put into casks or bottled on the premises, with visitors able to sample the beers in the brewery reception and bar area.  Fully licensed, the visitor centre is open Monday to Saturday, with tours available on Mondays and Fridays.    Using different blends of hops and barley malts to create the distinct taste of each Sulwath ale, all the beers are made to exacting and labour intensive-standards, to ensure consistency of taste.  The main beers are Criffel Ale, which is an India Pale Ale and is the brewery\u0026rsquos original ale Cuil Hill, a pale amber, light and refreshing session ale and Knockendoch, a dark copper coloured beer, reflecting an increased roasted malt content. Other popular beers include Galloway Gold, a lager, Tri-ball Tribute, a refreshing Blonde ale, The Grace, which is a light coloured mild, and the robust porter/stout, The Black Galloway.

Andrew Chapman, Director of Sales \u0026amp Marketing at Keith Brewery Ltd, said \u0026ldquoWith the two breweries only five miles apart, the merger seems an obvious solution to reduce the duplication of costs across various departments in both businesses.  \"There were a lot of synergies across both companies and it is hoped that both breweries can provide missing pieces of the puzzle to each other, such as staffing, bottling and\u0026nbspkegging facilities, storage and logistics.  David MacDonald, Founder of Spey Valley Brewery, added \u0026ldquoThere has been a great relationship between the two breweries for many years and this move formalises that. It allows both to take advantage of cross selling opportunities with our existing customers and gives us time to work on developing new business that would have been difficult to achieve working independently.  It will also allow the brewers at both premises to share knowledge, information and best practise techniques, which is essential when producing the best beer possible.    The merger follows on from the success of both breweries in 2017, with Keith Brewery Ltd\u0026rsquos coffee stout (Stout Keith, 5% ABV) becoming the only Scottish beer to receive the maximum 3* from The Great Taste Guide and Spey Valley\u0026rsquos bitter ale (David\u0026rsquos Not So Bitter, 4.4% ABV) winning Best British Style Beer at the Scottish Beer Awards.

This prompted a joke, suggesting that the only remedy would be to set up a brewery. This must be the solution, right?  Three years later, in 1995, we brewed our first ales \u0026ndash Red Cuillin and Black Cuillin. We always knew that these were to be our first two ales - named after the two mountain ranges on the island. They were such a success, we still brew them to the same recipes today. The only difference? The names have changed \u0026ndash we now call them Skye Red and Skye Black.    The choice of names behind our beers are laden with meanings. For instance, the name of our Young Pretender beer was decided upon for its historic associations. Firstly, and most obviously, it was first brewed in 1995, which was the 250th anniversary of the 1745 rebellion. This was the rebellion in which Bonnie Prince Charlie (known as The Young Pretender) attempted to gain the British crown. It was Bonnie Prince Charlie\u0026rsquos historic association with Skye which led us to create our Young Pretender beer.    Our Young Pretender ale has went on to win numerous awards \u0026ndash \u0026lsquoChampion Bitter of Scotland 2016\u0026rsquo and finalist at Great British Beer Festival 2017. However, don\u0026rsquot be fooled, it\u0026rsquos not just Young Pretender winning all the awards. In 1997, way back when, we won the CAMRA (Campaign for Real Ale) Champion Beer of Scotland and we were shortlisted for the UK championship too. To date, we\u0026rsquove picked up over 60 awards\u0026hellipand counting. Not bad for what started as a joke over a few pints.

Leith could also now become a key part of the Edinburgh International Festival in the future, after the box office success of this year\u0027s coming concerts at the once shuttered, but now revived, Leith Theatre.  Fergus Linehan, the artistic director of the EIF, which begins on Friday, revealed several concerts at the historic 1932 venue are sold out, with several others close to that stage in its Light on the Shore programme.  Mr Linehan said that Leith Theatre could, if the Leith Theatre Trust completes its renovations, become the third main musical stage for the EIF, along with the Queen\u0027s Hall, used for chamber music, and the Usher Hall, the historic stage for orchestras and staged operas.  He has been impressed by the public\u0027s response to the concerts, featuring artists such as Mogwai, Lau, Anna Meredith, Django Django and Karine Polwart, among others.  King Creosote, the Jesus and Mary Chain, Mogwai on the 23 August and club night with the actor Alan Cumming have sold out.  However, the venue, out of use from 1988 to 2004, still needs a complete renovation to become a full-time venue.  The venue received \u0026pound1m from the City of Edinburgh Council earlier this year towards the on-going project, which could cost \u0026pound7m in total.  Mr Linehan said: \"Leith is going really, really well.  \"The thing with Leith Theatre is that it\u0027s an expensive building to be in [at the moment], because there are no toilets or power.  \"But it looks great - in a beautiful world, you talk about Queen\u0027s Hall and the Usher Hall, Leith could be the third venue for us.  \"For everything from Bang on a Can and the Kronos Quartet, through to electronic and folk and everything, it really could be that space.\"  He added: \"We\u0027d love to say we have 19 Queen\u0027s Hall Concerts, we\u0027ve got 22 Usher Hall concerts, we\u0027d love to have 19 concerts there as well.  \"It would make an awful lot of sense, it would give shape and boundary and identity to that kind of programming.  \"It would be gorgeous...but it needs the boring work done to become a plug-and-play venue.\"  Mr Linehan added: \"It may be that we are in this year, maybe the work gets done next year and we are in the following year.  \"It will also be the question of when we get up and running, whether it creates its own frisson, and people say \u0027I love this place\u0027, and people feel they have to go there.\"  Jack Hunter, chair of the Leith Theatre Trust, said: \"Our design team, led by Collective Architecture is due to conclude its feasibility and costing study in the autumn of this year which will give us a framework for bringing the main auditorium back into regular use for live music, performance and events in the short term, and the longer term development of the whole complex as a multi-space arts and community venue in line with the Trust\u0026rsquos vision.  \"We look forward to sharing more information on this later this year.  \"Meanwhile we continue to build up our profile and engagement with Leith and Edinburgh\u0026rsquos wider cultural community.\"  Mr Linehan said he was concerned about the effects of Brexit on the EIF, especially a \u0027Hard\u0027 Brexit where the Home Office clamps down on visa applications.  He said: \"A backlog at the Home Office would be the nightmare scenario for all of us, because if you bring in 200 people in an opera company, for example, quite often there is some queries, if that slows down, we are all in big, big trouble.\"  \"We\u0027d all assumed that we were all going to be adult about this and we\u0027d keep going after March and we\u0027d be dealing with this in 2021.  \"But if we\u0027re plunged into chaos after March, again the issue is going to be, if government services are going to overwhelmed, how are we going to go through the administration of that?  \"I can see how it will be a real problem for us.\"  Mr Linehan added: \"If people give us a steer, not just in August, but the UK generally, you are getting into consequences that we never envisaged, even for people who voted Leave.  \"To be honest, the problems we would hit would be terrible....a bumpy road and tough, but not compared to other parts of society, they are nothing next to the guys at a car assembly plant in Sunderland.  \"Even in the arts, the main concern for the art has to be for the wider consequences.  \"Problems getting visas are nothing compared to, say, a whole generation of unemployment.\""},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-in-plea-to-emmanuel-macron-to-back-her-brexit-offer","story":"  The Prime Minister\u0026rsquos dramatic dash on Friday to the French President\u0026rsquos summer retreat at the Fort de Bregancon on a small picturesque island in the Mediterranean comes after Jeremy Hunt warned that the EU27\u0026rsquos intransigence was \u0026ldquoincreasing by the day the chance of a cliff-edge withdrawal.

It followed two complaints that a poster and website for the service, seen in March and featuring the claim that the journey took 30 minutes, were misleading.  Govia Thameslink Railway, trading as Gatwick Express, said a total of 79.1% of scheduled trains between Victoria and Gatwick arrived at their final destination on time between April 30 and May 26.  It listed three unforeseeable exceptions to the planned services \u0026ndash if access was required for engineering work, if there was a failure with infrastructure such as signalling or points, or if there was an unavoidable incident such as a passenger falling ill \u0026ndash and said they were contractually obliged to adjust services for safety reasons such as speed restrictions.  It also argued that it was difficult to mitigate against certain causes of delays such as staff sickness, and said any driver involved in an operational incident had to take a set amount of time off work.  The ASA said consumers would expect Gatwick Express to achieve the stated journey time barring exceptional or unforeseeable circumstances outside their control.  It said: \u0026ldquoWhilst we acknowledged that a proportion of services were delayed due to exceptional or unforeseeable circumstances outside of Gatwick Express\u0026rsquos control, such as track faults, fatalities and power supply failures, we considered that a significant proportion of services were delayed for reasons that were within Gatwick Express\u0026rsquos control.  \u0026ldquoAs such, we concluded that the claims \u0026lsquoNon-stop to Victoria station in half an hour\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquoin just 30 minutes\u0026rsquo had not been substantiated and were misleading.  It ruled that the ads must not appear again, adding: \u0026ldquoWe told Gatwick Express to remove the claims \u0026lsquoNon-stop to Victoria station in half an hour\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquoin just 30 minutes\u0026rsquo unless they could achieve that journey time in most cases, save for exceptional and unforeseeable circumstances outside of Gatwick Express\u0026rsquos control.  Gatwick Express is part of the Govia Thameslink Railway franchise, which also includes Southern, Thameslink and Great Northern.  The operator has suffered major disruption on certain routes in recent years caused by a number of factors, including industrial disputes, a shortage of drivers, infrastructure failures and the introduction of new timetables on May 20.

Around three quarters of payments were small crisis grants for food, essential heating and other living expenses, which last year cost \u0026pound9.1m and averaged \u0026pound77.  The rest were community care grants, which last year totalled \u0026pound23.6m and averaged \u0026pound599.  These were to help people settle in the community after time in care or prison, and to help families with one-off items such as cookers, washing machines or flooring.  Community care grants given to \u0026ldquofamilies facing exceptional pressure were up 10 per cent last year, with the fastest growing reason \u0026ldquoa breakdown of relationships resulting in a move and a need to prevent homelessness.  Graeme Brown, director of Shelter Scotland, said the \u0026pound33m-a-year Welfare Fund provided a \u0026ldquolifeline for many struggling households.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe fact that 174,155 applications for crisis grants were made - over 9,000 more than last year - shows the sheer scale of just how many households in Scotland continue to struggle to make ends meet and keep a roof over their heads.  \u0026ldquoEven more worrying is another huge increase - 46 per cent - in the recorded reason for applying for a crisis grant as being \u0026lsquoemergency - nowhere to stay and may resort to rough sleeping\u0026rsquo. This has more than doubled in the last two years.  \u0026ldquoA 27 per cent increase in applications due to benefit payment delays is also very concerning - especially considering the flawed Universal Credit system has not been fully rolled-out.  More than half of payments went to people in the poorest 20 per cent of neighbourhoods.  SNP Social Security Secretary Shirley Anne-Somerville, said she was pleased nearly 300,000 households in need had been helped, but added she was \"angry\" that UK Government cuts to welfare were pushing \"more and more people into poverty\".  She said: \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government is spending over \u0026pound125m this year alone trying to allay the very worst effects of these harmful cuts and protect those on low incomes. Local authorities are dealing with new applications every week and we will continue to do all we can to support hard pressed families and individuals who, through no fault of their own, are struggling to make ends meet."},{"url":null,"title":"gambling-regulator-announces-crackdown-on-advertising-and-consumer-law-breaches","story":"  The Gambling Commission\u0026rsquos new rules come into force from October 31 and allow it to impose unlimited fines for any advertising breach such as campaigns that appeal to children or glamorise gambling, extending beyond ads that mislead consumers.  Operators will also face action for advertising failings by third party affiliates such as marketing agencies and for sending spam emails or texts to customers.  It follows an open consultation and aim to provide stronger protection for consumers and ensure they are treated fairly by gambling businesses.  The commission said the changes would make it quicker and easier to take action for breaches of consumer law, such as misleading promotions and bonus offers, or unreasonable restrictions on withdrawals of winnings.  Gambling Commission chief executive Neil McArthur said: \u0026ldquoProtecting the interests of consumers is priority for us and needs to be a priority for gambling operators.  \u0026ldquoThese changes will protect consumers from irresponsible advertising and misleading promotions, ensure that consumers can withdraw their money more easily and will mean that consumer complaints are dealt with more swiftly.

This announcement doesn\u0026rsquot cover all the injustices that occur, but it\u0026rsquos very welcome.  The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) launched a sector wide investigation in collaboration with the Gambling Commission in 2016 into whether online gambling firms were treating customers fairly.  This led to the CMA launching enforcement action in June 2017 against a number of online gambling operators suspected of breaking consumer law in connection with their gaming promotions.  In February this year it announced that Ladbrokes, William Hill, and PT Entertainment had committed to change how they offered bonus promotions to customers playing online, and in March it said BGO Entertainment Limited had made similar commitments."},{"url":null,"title":"neil-cameron-mike-ashley-doesnt-want-peace-he-just-wants-profit","story":"  I am not privy to the fine tuning of the deal, big Mike doesn\u0026rsquot tend to let outsiders in, but my guess is he\u0026rsquos not writing such a large cheque all doe-eyed because that\u0026rsquos the store where he used to tell Santa what he wanted\u0026nbspfor Christmas.

Users will be able to set themselves time limits and receive alerts when that time is up.  They will also be able to mute all Facebook notifications for set periods if they do not want to be distracted during that time.  Facebook director for the UK and Ireland Steve Hatch said the tools, which start rolling out to users worldwide on Wednesday, would help raise user awareness of how they are spending their time online.  \u0026ldquoWe all recognise that technology is playing a greater role in our daily lives, he said.  \u0026ldquoWe feel a responsibility to help ensure that time on Facebook is time well spent.  Earlier this year, Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg said the firm was committed to improving the \u0026ldquomeaningful time people spent on the site, even if that meant less time spent on Facebook overall.  It comes as the social platform continues to face intense scrutiny over some of its practices, including how it polices content and users.  In response to the new tools, children\u0026rsquos charity the NSPCC said the site is still not doing enough to protect young people.  Laura Randall, the charity\u0026rsquos head of child safety online, said: \u0026ldquoFacebook and Instagram state they want to ensure their platforms are safe but to do so, they need to tackle serious problems within their sites.  \u0026ldquoTime limits do not address the fact that there are still no consistent child safety standards in place. Apps, sites and games continue to allow violent and sexual content to be accessed by children and sexual predators are free to roam their platforms, targeting and grooming young people.  \u0026ldquoThis lack of responsibility is why the legislation the Government has committed to must include a mandatory child safety code with an independent regulator to enforce consequences for those who don\u0026rsquot follow those rules.  Facebook\u0026rsquos new tools are similar to digital well-being features being introduced later this year by both Apple and Google to their mobile phone platforms.  Both, like Facebook, will show users how often they use their phone and the various apps, with time limits able to be set to help them cut down.  Mr Hatch said digital health is an \u0026ldquoindustry-wide issue that requires an industry-wide response, and that there is an expectation on Facebook as a leader in the field, to be part of that response.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos not just about the time people spend on Facebook and Instagram but how they spend that time, the Facebook blog post on the new tools said.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos our responsibility to talk openly about how time online impacts people \u0026ndash and we take that responsibility seriously. These new tools are an important first step, and we are committed to continuing our work to foster safe, kind and supportive communities for everyone."},{"url":null,"title":"migration-helps-scotlands-population-reach-record-high","story":"  Statistics from the National Records of Scotland (NRS) show there were 5,424,800 people living in Scotland halfway through 2017, up by 5% in the last decade.  Its report found migration is the \"main reason\" for the increase in recent years, with almost 24,000 more people coming to Scotland than leaving in the year to mid-2017.  While the rate of population growth has slowed, Scotland\u0027s population is still expected to rise to 5.58 million in 2026 and 5.69 million by 2041.  The document stated: \"Scotland\u0027s population continued to grow over the latest year to mid-2017 and is projected to keep growing ... The population has increased every year since 2000 and in 2017 was the largest ever seen.\"  Statisticians found that \"natural change\" - the number of births minus the number of deaths - has not contributed to Scotland\u0027s recent population growth, since there were 3,800 more deaths than births last year.  The report said: \"Migration is the main reason for Scotland\u0027s population increase.  \"In the year to mid-2017, 23,900 more people came to Scotland than left. This contributed to the increase in Scotland\u0027s population.\"  The trend is projected to continue over the next quarter of a century.  The latest net migration figure was, however, down on the previous year when it stood at 31,700 people, statistics show.  Most people moving to Scotland were found to come from the rest of the UK (47,600 people). In contrast, the number of people coming to Scotland from overseas decreased (32,900, down from 40,400 the previous year).  EU nationals make up 62% of the non-British population of Scotland and Polish is the most common non-British nationality.  Last year, there were 99,000 Polish nationals living north of the border - 2% of the total resident population.  In further findings, experts predict the population will continue to age over the next 25 years, with the fastest growing group those aged 75 and over.  In 2017, about one in five people (19%) were aged 65 and over but this is expected to rise to one in four (25%) by 2041.  The number of births in Scotland is continuing to fall, the figures show. There were 52,861 births registered last year, 3% fewer than in 2016 and 22% fewer than in 1975.  Meanwhile, the number of deaths registered in Scotland increased in 2017. There were 57,883 deaths last year, up 2% since 2016 and the highest number since 2003.  While life expectancy in Scotland has risen over the past three decades, it has \"stalled\" in recent years.  Amy Wilson, director of statistical and registration services at NRS, said: \"This year\u0027s review shows that while the population of Scotland is at its highest ever, at 5.42 million, and has grown by 5% over the last decade, this growth rate has slowed.  \"Over the latest year, Scotland\u0027s population has grown at a slower rate than on average over the past 10 years.  \"This is because of reduced migration levels as well as an increase in the number of deaths and decrease in the number of births.  \"However, Scotland\u0027s population is still projected to increase to 5.58 million in 2026 and to continue rising to reach 5.69 million in 2041.  \"We expect this growth to be entirely reliant on migration, as the number of deaths are projected to continue to be higher than the number of births.\""},{"url":null,"title":"daviot to hold first flower pot competition","story":"        Residents of Daviot will notice a number of colourful and unusual flower pots around the village thanks to the first ever flower pot competition.

While staying there in 1952 the Queen Mother saw Barrogill Castle, purchased it and renamed it the Castle of Mey.She restored it and stayed there regularly from 1955 until her death in 2002. The castle has been open to the public since then and attracts 25,000 visitors a year.After the Vyners sold their property it was run as a hotel from 1967 until 1974. When it then went on the market, the rock band Led Zeppelin looked at it with the aim of turning it into a recording studio although the plan did not come to fruition.Stuart \u0026ldquoWoody Wood from the Bay City Rollers also showed interest as a buyer but it was purchased by a clothes manufacturer before he sold it to the current owner\u0026rsquos family in the mid-1980s.The house \u0026ndash built between 1895 and 1908 \u0026ndash was also said to have been used as the backdrop for a horror film in the 1970s.The property is in need of refurbishment but could be developed as a hotel, as serviced apartments, as a bed-and-breakfast business or as a family home, according to the auctioneers.The 1800 acres of land is suitable \u0026ldquofor sport and grouse shooting, while the six lochs are said to be ideal for brown trout fishing. It also has planning approval for 10 timber lodges which could be built and rented out or leased to a holiday letting company, the auctioneers say.There is also approval for a new-build detached house.\u0026ldquoThe estate enjoys a spectacular setting on a peninsula of the most northerly coastline of the Scottish mainland, overlooking Dunnet Bay to the west and over the Pentland Firth and towards Orkney to the north, the promotional material says.Asked why the property is being sold at auction, the spokeswoman explained it can help maximise the price and \u0026ldquomake a more secure sale.She said: \u0026ldquoWhen the gavel falls the sale is legally binding.The auction of the estate is due to take place at St Vincent Street in Glasgow on August 16.Wednesday 1 Aug 2018 12:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116795.jpg","title":"Mey Highland and Cultural Games to be bigger and better","story":"Event chairman Captain Richard Otley said that the Mey Highland and Cultural Games 2018 will be \u0026ldquobigger and better this year and \u0026ldquowill surely put Caithness on the map.The 2018 event is the first Highland games to include para-athletes\u0026rsquo events. People with physical, vision and intellectual disabilities are eligible to compete.\u0026ldquoThis is a golden opportunity for local groups, individuals and businesses to raise awareness to their cause and raise funds from their stalls on the day, he said. \u0026ldquoWe are hoping the event will showcase Caithness in a positive way for tourism, business and the community.Sixty para-athletes will travel from as far afield as America and Australia and all over the UK to take part in the milestone event. The Mey Games will be unique as it welcomes both para and Invictus athletes to compete in traditional Highland track-and-field competitions. This will be the first time that para-athletics has been included within a traditional Highland Games context in Scotland.America\u0026rsquos Alex \u0026ldquoThe Tank Armor, who holds the world record for wheelchair caber-tossing, as well as several top Australian para-athletes will be competing.Last year saw a revamped games event held at John O\u0026rsquoGroats, with Prince Charles \u0026ndash known as the Duke of Rothesay in Scotland \u0026ndash in attendance.The duke \u0026ndash whose late grandmother, the Queen Mother, regularly attended the games during her summer stays at the Castle of Mey \u0026ndash did an impromptu tour of the various marquees on the site to chat with local organisations and vendors.Capt Otley \u0026ndash who is also chairman of the Wick, Canisbay and Latheron branch of Royal British Legion Scotland (RBLS) \u0026ndash said that all proceeds from the games will be going towards supporting the veterans and their families within the branch area. There will be in the region of 15 marquees this year, including seven new ones as a result of successful applications to local community benefit funds.\u0026ldquoThe Mey Games is now a major annual event in Caithness, Capt Otley said.\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos organised by the Wick, Canisbay and Latheron branch of the RBLS who took on the running of the games when visitor numbers were dwindling to as low as just 30. Last year, we had 1500 visitors and this year we hope to welcome between 2500 and 3500 people.\u0026ldquoWe are all volunteers and work hard to ensure the event is a big success. It\u0026rsquos a community event and we want the local community to be part of it. We offer free stalls to local businesses as we want to encourage them to be involved.\u0026ldquoAt the RBLS we provide a lot of veteran support and our ethos is focused on military support and participation inclusion.\u0026ldquoWe are delighted to have so many para-athletes taking part this year from around the globe. A delegation from the RBLS Wick, Canisbay and Latheron branch visited Australia in April this year to mark Anzac Day so it\u0026rsquos fitting that we will have a number of Australian para-athletes taking part.\u0026ldquoWe want to make sure each of the para-athletes and everybody at the games has an enjoyable time.He stressed how the games have been \u0026ldquoramped up by comparing the number of marquees this year with the total put up two years ago, only three.\u0026ldquoThere has been a massive amount of work behind the scenes by a dedicated group of members to ensure the games not only takes place but grows to a more sustainable level.The build-up to the Mey Games will get under way with a North Coast 500 cycling challenge that will depart from Wick\u0026rsquos Market Square on July 28 and arrive back in the town on August 3, the day before the games.On the morning of the games, at 9.30am, there will be a rededication ceremony at the grave of General Lord Horne in Wick cemetery. \u0026ldquoWe shall honour Wick\u0026rsquos own hero of the Great War with a colour party and piper in attendance at this short but poignant event, Capt Otley said.Events kicks off at 11am and include Highland dancing competitions, pipe and drum bands, the tug of war, dog show and live music, as well as various exhibitions, local art, crafts and food stalls.The event will take place at John O\u0026rsquoGroats for the third time after travel company Natural Retreats stepped in after the previous games location, close to the Castle of Mey, became waterlogged.Since then the company has continued to provide ongoing complimentary use of the showground.Ewan Kearney, chief operating officer at Natural Retreats, said: \u0026ldquoWe are absolutely delighted to support the Mey Games again this year.For more information, visit the Mey Games Facebook page: https://www.facebook/MeyGames/Wednesday 1 Aug 2018 12:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"We just werent at the races says Academy boss after opening day derby defeat","story":"DEJECTED Wick Academy manager Tom McKenna watched his side succumb to a 2-0 derby defeat to Brora Rangers and admitted: \u0026ldquoWe just weren\u0026rsquot at the races.Goals by Kyle Macleod on the stroke of half-time and Craig Campbell just before the hour mark gave Brora a 2-0 win at Dudgeon Park on Saturday in Steven Mackay\u0026rsquos first competitive match as player/manager.Rarely will you see a more one-sided game with a mere two-goal margin of victory, and after the final whistle McKenna admitted his team had been second best throughout.\u0026ldquoWe were lethargic, we were disjointed, there was no fluency in our game, he said.\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom not going to take anything away from Brora \u0026ndash they were by far the better team.

Where vacancies are going to occur, boards are already planning their recruitment processes and keeping us updated on the progress. There are absolutely no plans to merge health boards.”Orkney MSP Liam McArthur also spoke out in response to the reports, emphasising the need to consider the repercussions for island health boards.He said: “Patients in Orkney and Shetland rely heavily on these mainland boards, particularly NHS Grampian, for specialist treatment and care. Any proposals to merge NHS Grampian, NHS Highland and NHS Tayside, therefore, must take full account of the impact on island health boards.“Traditionally, rural and island communities have not fared well from the centralisation of services. They will need some convincing therefore that their interests lie at the heart of these proposals.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The organisation\u0026rsquos chairman, Tony Vandyke, says the money will be used to complete the first stage of an extensive revamp ahead of proposed further work in the next five years.\"We are going to use the money for things like replacing the handrails and changing the electrics and lighting,\" he said. \"These are vital upgrades. It will also enable us to start some engineering works.There are some issues regarding the age of the harbour. Part of the stonework has shifted and needs some work. We have got to do a new support leg for the bridge.\"But the funding allows us to forge ahead with the things we need to do. It\u0026rsquos not a fix for everything, because we have concrete which is now over 100 years old and is past the end of its useful life. However, it\u0026rsquos important for us to preserve everythng we can.\"All of the help and funding we have received will give us a more modern harbour that is safer. The SSE funding will be spent over the next two years.

Joining them in almost equal numbers will be the performers – including many stand-up comics such as myself. We’ll be the less enthusiastic ones with a slightly haunted look who haven’t seen sunlight for a long time as we’ve been working on our shows like pit ponies only for you to ignore our feeble attempt to hand over a flyer.             And previews are tough. Especially when your material is all untested, rambling and you’re performing to eight people in a sweatbox. One preview went so badly a nice elderly lady asked me if was the first time I had ever tried stand up. Everyone’s a bag of nerves right now. Will I remember my show? Will anyone will come and see me? Should I have brought a proper coat? The festival is the place to ponder big questions. Last year it was Brexit and I’m sure there will be much more of the B-word, but one of this year’s big themes is sexual harassment and feminism as a result of the #MeToo campaign. The revelations about Harvey Weinstein, which were the catalyst for the campaign, were shocking. Especially the bit about what he did in the plant pot. Gross. He’s surely the only person to get a life-long ban from Homebase.It was a big moment because, for the first time, it was okay for women of to speak about the sexual harassment or abuse they had encountered over the lives – much of it in the workplace. Before Me Too, you weren’t meant to say what had happened to you. It wasn’t the “done” thing and was seen as vulgar. Obviously grabbing your arse was fine – but workplace etiquette can be odd that way.             Then it all came out thanks to the brave women who had the courage to break that rule and go public. And so the veil of secrecy which had protected these men and given them impunity was lifted. And yes it was mainly men – because men are still mainly in charge in society and so much of this behaviour was not just about sex, it was about power.The #MeToo campaign went viral and it was like this lid had been lifted. Social media exploded with women of all ages, races and walks of life telling their stories and you realised that pretty much every woman had been affected by this kind of behaviour at some point in her life.READ MORE: Ayesha Hazarika: Emotion over reason is the new politicsThen we had Times Up and, of course, Donald Trump – you wait your whole lifetime for a big juicy gender equality campaign, then three come along at the same time.             I was excited. I thought “this is it!” I thought that women of the world would unite to take on the system, but it didn’t quite work that way. Instead of women coming together to fight the patriarchy, it now looks like we came together to fight each other. I was hoping it would be like Made in Dagenham, sadly it seems to have gone a bit Prisoner Cell Block H.Whenever you turn on the television or radio or look at social media, women are always having a go at each other about feminism, which is what I explore in my show Girl on Girl. Whether it’s the gender pay gap or women on boards or up-skirting, the media (which is largely still run by white chaps) loves nothing more than seeing women taking lumps out of each other and shrieking – it’s like porn for the patriarchy, plus it keeps us women in our place and preserves the status quo. I have had some horrendous experiences after being made to debate women which feel more like a freak show or a dog (bitch) fight, than a considered discussion about important issues.             And of course, women don’t have to agree on everything – men certainly don’t. Men are allowed to have really diverse opinions and even if there is disagreement, they are allowed to be authoritative and respected.Their opinion may be challenged, but their right to hold it isn’t – especially by their opponent. There’s a mutual respect. Women, on the other hand, are pitted against each other on often highly sensitive gender-based issues and encouraged to get emotional and personal with each other. READ MORE: Ayesha Hazarika: The real reason Saudi women were allowed to driveI was once asked to have a fight with Esther Rantzen! Are you kidding? How can you have a row with Childline?The #MeToo campaign is important but the job of feminism is far from done and the same issues still endure today that the Suffragettes campaigned on – better pay and conditions, childcare, women’s health, violence against women and, of course, women and power. Some women first got the vote a century ago, but women’s voices are far from being heard and respected in the same way men’s are. So instead of tearing lumps out of each other about whether feminism has gone too far (spoiler – it hasn’t), let’s try and focus on the things that really matter.Ayesha performs her show Girl on Girl at the Gilded Balloon at 6.45pm from 2-11 August"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4776226.1533113310!/image/image.jpg","title":"readers react holyrood more interested in brexit obstruction","story":"        Almost 20 years since the creation of the Scottish Parliament, Whitehall officials are not properly trained to understand devolution and mechanisms for the UK\u0026#8217s governments to discuss vital issues such as Brexit are \u0026#8220not fit for purpose\u0026#8221, a committee of MPs concluded yesterday.

David Mundell will tomorrow warn that the Scottish and UK governments must work together to make Brexit a success for Scotland.                The Scottish Secretary will say the UK must “pull together at home” to take advantage of opportunities abroad as a he attempts to foster trade links with New Zealand.            His plea will be made in a keynote speech which will be delivered at the University of Otago, Dunedin, which he will visit as part of his trade mission to New Zealand.            The Brexit process has seen relations between the UK and Scottish governments deteriorate. Scottish ministers have accused the UK government of mounting a power grab on devolution. While the UK government has challenged the Scottish Government’s alternative Brexit Bill in the Supreme Court.Mr Mundell will argue that Brexit offered the chance for the UK to become a global champion for free trade. But he will add that to do so requres both governments to work together. READ MORE: David Mundell: There’s no alternative to the Brexit White PaperThe Scottish Secretary will say: “The referendum was a clear instruction to the UK government, and we will deliver on it. But it was not a vote to turn inwards and to turn our backs on the world. Leaving the EU will be transformative to our global trade policy. Outside the EU, the UK will be able to make its own agreements around the world as a global champion for free trade. We will be able to move nimbly to negotiate mutually beneficial deals in parts of the world where we can’t as a member of the EU.            “For the first time in over 40 years we will be able to determine who we trade with, and on what terms. But to seize the opportunities abroad, the fact is we need to pull together at home. We need to be ready for Brexit. This means working with the Scottish Government to make our exit from the EU a success in Scotland and for Scotland.” He will defend his position that UK-wide frameworks are essential for trade. It is the UK government’s proposal to temporarily freeze the transfer of powers to Holyrood in 24 areas that have led to SNP accusations that Holyrood is being subjected to a power grab.The UK government maintains that freezing the powers, which govern issues such as animal health and food labelling, is essential to create UK wide frameworks and maintaining the UK market. Mr Mundell will say UK frameworks will “safeguard” the UK’s ability to sign up to trade deals."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4776720.1533120822!/image/image.jpg","title":"snp s ian blackford accused of disfiguring last months of charles kennedy s life","story":"        SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford has been accused of \u0026#8220an odious attempt to re-write history\u0026#8221 by playing down claims that he led a vendetta against the late Charles Kennedy.                The accusation was made by former Labour MP Brian Wilson who said the last months of Mr Kennedy\u0027s life were disfigured by the “disgraceful” campaign pursued by the SNP.            Mr Wilson said Mr Blackford led a campaign that “unleashed a torrent of abuse” against the former Lib Dem leader.            Mr Kennedy lost his Ross, Skye and Lochaber seat to Mr Blackford in the 2015 General Election after a bitter and deeply unpleasant campaign. Shortly afterwards the former MP died in Fort William following his long battle against alcoholism.Writing in The Times, Mr Wilson was responding to an interview with Mr Blackford carried by the newspaper at the weekend.When questioned about the campaign, Mr Blackford said he was “proud” of the way the SNP conducted the campaign. He claimed to have no regrets when Mr Kennedy died claiming there was “absolutely no issue” between the Lib Dem and himself..But Mr Wilson said: “Nobody has sought to draw a direct link between Charles\u0027s death and the behaviour of Mr Blackford and his supporters during the campaign. But what is beyond doubt is that the closing months of Charles\u0027s life were disfigured by a vendetta that was as disgraceful as it was unneccessary.“As soon as Mr Blackford was selected as prospective SNP candidate in January 2015 he launched the hashtag `#Where\u0027sCharlie?\u0027, which became dog-whistle politics that undoubtedly unleashed a torrent of abuse.            “Anyone paying attention knew exactly where Charlie was. He was battling alcoholism. He was mourning the death of his parents. He was grieving the early demise of his closest friend. He was desperate to spend time with his young son. And he still had a better Commons voting record than any SNP MP.”Read more: Charles Kennedy\u0027s Scotsman obituaryIn the Times interview, the SNP MP was also asked about a now notorious incident when he marched angrily into Mr Kennedy\u0027s office during the election campaign and demanded that the Lib Dems remove a description of him as a “well-funded banker” from their campaign literature.Mr Blackford, a former senior executive at Deutsche Bank, said that he had brought cakes to his office and asked Mr Kennedy to “lay off” the personal attack on him.“With the benefit of hindsight, which is a wonderful thing, perhaps it would have been better not to do that, but that’s what happened and the Liberals have sought to characterise it in another way,” Mr Blackford told the newspaper.            Mr Blackford went on to claim that he was the victim of a “nasty” campaign.He said: “I did not enjoy the election campaign in 2015 but that was more to do with the characterisation of me from the Liberals. I’m not in any way blaming Charles, who was the MP. It was the campaign against me. It was pretty nasty.”Read more: SNP official quits over Charles Kennedy online abuseBut Mr Wilson described this version as an “odious attempt to re-write history”.Within days of Mr Blackford launching the “#Where\u0027sCharlie?” hashtag, Mr Wilson said the chairman of the Skye SNP branch Brian Smith was tweeted about whether Charles “has a `problem\u0027 that stops you going to Westminster.”According to Mr Wilson, Mr Smith bombarded social media and Mr Kennedy\u0027s constituency office with invective.            Replying to a tweet from the SNP MP Pete Wishart, Mr Smith described Mr Kennedy as “our own arch-Quisling”.A member of Mr Kennedy\u0027s staff worked full time to delete abuse from social media.Mr Wilson said: “Mr Blackford, undisputed author of the `Where\u0027s Charlie?\u0027 campaign now invites us to believe that he had no knowledge of these activities and no power to call off the dogs.

No, he’s not referring to his Strictly Come Dancing days (in case you missed it, he was the unexpected star of the 2016 series).            The former politician, 51, actually wears a skimpy Union flag number to enter the wrestling ring in new BBC Two show, Travels In Trumpland With Ed Balls.            “I’m not someone who previously had bikini line concerns, but they wanted me to wear a really tight-cut leotard, and I thought it would be unflattering,” quips the Norwich-born father-of-three, who’s married to Labour MP Yvette Cooper.“I got a pair of black boxers under it. Had I only worn the bikini line, that might have ruined it for the viewer…”He decided not to shave his legs and torso, like his fellow wrestlers did, either.“My kids think dads should be embarrassing but that I substantially overachieve,” he adds with a grin.“I could explain to my 13-year-old why it was important to do the wrestling, but if I’d have been waxed and shaved, she would have said it was too much.”            The factual entertainment series sees the ex-shadow chancellor walk in the shoes of a variety of supporters of US President Donald Trump, to try and understand why they voted for him.“Lots of people will assume they’re either deluded and don’t understand, or extreme and dangerous, but we just met really nice, ordinary people,” he says.“I thought that after the first year Trump would be losing support, but we didn’t find that at all and it wouldn’t surprise me at all if he won a second term.”The three episodes look at different issues facing Americans, whether that’s the gun control movement or immigration policies, and how they feel about their country since former reality star Trump was elected in 2016.            “I thought he’d drop the wild persona and become a more reasonable, centrist president but he hasn’t at all,” Balls notes.“You assume it can’t get worse, and it does.”As well as being an insightful and entertaining series, what might surprise viewers is how emotional it is to watch at times.In the first episode, Balls stays at a farm with a group of war veterans, and as well as hearing their thoughts on Trump, he joins them round a campfire for a toast to friends who lost their lives in service.And he asks to toast to Labour MP Jo Cox, a mum-of-two who was murdered by a far-right extremist outside her constituency surgery in Birstall, near Leeds, a week before the EU referendum.            “The only thing which felt comparable to me was Jo, who I knew very, very well,” Balls confides of the moving scene. “I did a lot of campaigning and fundraising with her.“From a personal point of view...

I didn’t want to try and be someone else.“If you asked me what the genre is, it’s a mix of old-style, early Louis Theroux meets The Real Marigold Hotel and little bit of Ruby Wax.“I tried to let the characters do the talking. I reveal my opinions to camera but not to the people I’m with.”It was the 2015 general election when Balls lost his seat in the Morley and Outwood constituency, in West Yorkshire.And he doesn’t seem to envy those currently working as an MP.“I’m regretful politics is so chaotic at the moment, and I look back at better times wistfully,” he says.“But if you said to me, ‘You could be in Parliament or you could do this show at the moment’, I’d definitely choose this show.”"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at different stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed.

It’s manufacture uses up valuable natural resources but this is a result of human exploitation. This begs the question, why are humans capable of natural behaviour and unnatural behaviour in what seems to be equal measure?  Is it normal and natural to drive cars, fly in ‘planes, build tower blocks, dig for coal, aim to fly to distant planet ? The list is endless. According to the experts, global warming and ice ages have occurred many times and certainly before life as we know it existed.  We are worried about what are threats to our welfare only because it is a seemingly an alien threat . Surely, if we are able to stand outside ourselves, we are now caught up in a “ normal” event. And in our short sighted stupidity we are adding to the dangers.

One of the most remarkable performances in the latter game came from Kari Arnason, recently deemed not good enough by Aberdeen but still able to do a pretty fair job on shackling Lionel Messi.\nThe introduction the Video Assistant Referee system, or VAR as it is commonly known, has caused a few talking points. There was the decision to allow Diego Costa’s first goal for Spain against Portugal, and also to award penalties to France and Sweden against Australia and South Korea respectively.\nThese “assistants” are apparently not even at the game. They are sitting in a office somewhere in Moscow, but bizarrely kitted out in full referees’ uniform!\nWhy on earth they didn’t disallow Switzerland’s equaliser against Brazil is beyond me, however. Everyone seemed to notice Steven Zuber’s push on his marker before making room for himself to head the ball home.\nEveryone that is except the boys in black in Moscow. The ITV panellists were unanimous in their opinion that the goal should have been ruled out. Even Roy Keane, who used to think decapitation was just about permissable, appeared to agree with the others.\nOkay, so we will mention the commentary and punditry. Apart from Keane and Slaven Bilic – I loved it when he said he couldn’t really care less about whether the Swiss leveller should have been allowed or not – there is really no-one who comes with an opinion which makes you think.\nMost of the time they are prattling on about how far England are likely to go, even when the focus is on an entirely different group. And surely it is high time Gary Lineker was pensioned off. His pathetic attempts at puns, which could have been written by a five-year-old, had their day a long time ago.\nMeanwhile in our office “World Cup Sweepstake”, which requires the entrant to basically predict the results all the way through the competition, things aren’t going too badly. Despite obviously getting the Argentina/Iceland and Germany/Mexico games wrong, plus a few others, I remain in contention on the leaderboard.\nSo what about the last 16?

The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin (tin shed). Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions (£16?), Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain ( hoped for ) credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nAs an artist myself (mainly in graphite but also in pastel and acrylic) doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen (left) and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships. Someone should tell him that waistcoats are the most pointless item of clothing known to man.\nBut hey, most of it is good. I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say. Just because he’s the best cyclist in the world does not mean he’s benefiting from a performance-enhancing drug.\n: : : : : : : :\nWith all the buzz of the World Cup an annual competition in southwest London has almost been forgotten about.\nYes, Wimbledon is in full flow once again and the British competitors are as usual struggling to make it into the second week.\nAndy Murray was probably sensible to withdraw, citing that he was not quite ready for five-set matches after his hip operation. There were signs at Queens and Eastbourne, however, that he may be able to scale the heights once more.\nThere is of course a capable replacement in Kyle Edmund, who is seeded having reached the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year.\nEdmund’s half of the draw looks fairly open, and he could well still be involved come Monday. But of course anything can happen, and by the time you read this he could be gone. Let’s hope not.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"115 north road lerwick 2 ","story":"OFFERS OVER £320,000\nEnjoying a commanding position and having the living area on the first floor affords this 2 storey house stunning panoramic sea views over Lerwick Harbour.

Even with the introduction of new flights our air connections remain some of the most fragile across these isles.\n\u0026ldquoThe Smith Commission was very clear when it stated that: \u0026lsquothe power to charge tax on air passengers leaving Scottish airports will be devolved to the Scottish Parliament.

However, the six houses are to be built on what was a King George V Playing Field, which was set aside and protected in 1962.\nFor anyone to build on this land they must notify and obtain the consent of Fields in Trust, a charity that acts to protect all KGV land. Even though the comhairle took over the management of the land in 1984 they must still obtain the trust’s consent.\nThe Barra Sports Forum have been pressing the comhairle for years to transfer a piece of derelict land near the Co-op, which is adjacent to the KGV area, for use as an all-weather pitch.\nA spokesman said: “The sports forum urge the comhairle to fulfil their legal and moral obligations to the people of Barra and Vatersay to protect the sports and recreation land in Horve by righting this wrong: firstly, by filing for a change of land use to Fields in Trust from ‘sports and recreation’ to ‘housing’ and secondly, by transferring an equivalent area of land to the KGV playing field in compensation for land lost to housing. Only by doing this will the comhairle avoid the danger of stalling the desperately needed new housing that helps secure the future of our islands.”\nRichard McKeever of Fields in Trust the charity recognised that that “sometimes it may be necessary” to change the use of recreational land.\nHe added: “As part of our protection, we have a responsibility to ensure the local owners and managers of these spaces seek our consent to undertake any changes regarding land ownership, land transactions, erection of buildings and structures \u0026#8211 and that proposed changes fit with the purpose of the protected space and benefit its recreational use.

Having beaten Juniors twice already this season \u0026#8211 2-5 and 0-6 \u0026#8211 Jamie MacGregor will have faith that his team can make it a hat-trick of success and book their place in the final.\nIn their last semi-final outing, Mallaig defeated Sleat and Strath 10-8 in an incredible game to secure their place in the GF MacRae Cup Final. The blues, however, will be keen to avoid a repeat of their performance in the final which saw Kyleakin run out 4-1 winners in a disappointing and underwhelming showing by Mallaig.\n\n \u0026#8220Another tough game for us, but it’s the type of games we wanted to be involved in at the start of the season. We now have a great opportunity to make a second cup final this season.\n\u0026#8220The season, in general, has been a learning experience but a very enjoyable one. The lads have picked up a lot quite quickly and we have had some good wins this season especially on our travels. It’s good to be back playing at home especially in such a big game, especially after being away for so long\n\u0026nbsp\nWith four wins from their last five matches in all competitions, and 37 goals scored in the process, Juniors have really hit their stride and will approach their third meeting with Mallaig with great confidence.\nNow just four points point off leaders Sleat and Strath with one game in hand, Phil McCaherty will hope his team can transmit their impressive league form into today\u0026#8217s cup match against the only side who have beaten them domestically this season.\nWhile Juniors\u0026#8217 recent free-scoring display will have given Mallaig some food for thought in their preparations for the match, the Portree side must avoid the lapses in concentration which cost them in their heavy defeats at home against Mallaig in the league and Loch Ness in the Highland Amateur Cup.\n\nIt\u0026#8217s a tough task for us away to Mallaig who have beaten us twice already 5-2 and 6-0. We are going with the same squad (minus Angie MacPherson and Paul MacKinnon) that played GA United in last round, with Nick Flanagan added for goalkeeping duties to free up backup goalie Will Brown to his normal defensive duties. I am hoping that David Potter doesn\u0026#8217t get lost this week!\u0026#8221\n\nIt\u0026#8217s been a fantastic season so far for the Broadford-based side who are the current league leaders, joint top scorers, and have the meanest defence to boot.\nWith an average of 5.2 goals a game in the league, Sleat and Strath have developed a ruthlessness in front of goal and appeared to have a strong belief when they take to the pitch that they can beat any team whether it be at home or away. Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch. Key to the result will be our ability to defend set plays, which is not our strong point as we are a very small team. If we can keep Gordy (Mccarroll) and Innis (Thompson) quiet we will hopefully cause them problems with our pace.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\nWith Sleat and Strath having burst out of the blocks in the league and new boys Mallaig also making their mark, it is perhaps easy to overlook the fact that Kyleakin is not only very much in contention for the league title but have already won a piece of silverware this season with a convincing victory over Mallaig in the GF MacRae Cup.\nWith 22 goals in their last three matches, which included their 10-2 quarter-final win over Kyle, the reigning league champions know how to win games, and ultimately trophies. As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/web-ad-sales.jpg","title":"recruitment highlighted as a priority at first emergency services","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\nRepresentatives of all the emergency services on Skye held their first ever partnership meeting in Broadford last week to discuss how they can support each other.\nPictured (left to right) are Dave Philips from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Nick Mort from the British Red Cross, Station Manager Mike Colliar from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, Sgt Andrew Shaw from Police Scotland, Neil Urquhart from Skye Mountain Rescue, Inspector Lynda Allan from Police Scotland, Area Service Manager Alan Knox of Scottish Ambulance Service.

It is central to community life and is active across the local community, working collaboratively with other sporting codes and community and civic organisations.\nThere are eight Gaelic Athletic Clubs active within the local council boundaries, with a combined membership reaching into thousands.\nPromotion and use of the Irish Language has been historically strong in the area. The language has become even stronger in the last 30-40 years particularly.\nToday in terms of Irish medium education (IME), four Naíscoileana (preschools) flourish, and there are two gaelscoileanna (primary schools), and another English medium school with IME provision.\nThe demand for IME in South Antrim is growing.\n\nSo, many citizens in South Antrim possess an innate sense of their own Irishness. It really matters to them.\nLike everywhere else in Ireland the rich local heritage and history of townlands, place names, geography, and topography of South Antrim cannot be understood without reference to the Irish language.\nTo take two local examples: Cranfield has its origins in Creamh choill, the woodland of the wild garlic: Farranflugh is the anglicised version of Fearainn Fliuch, otherwise, the boggy or wet ground.\nBilingual signage captures that rich heritage by making it visible and providing an educational reference point for the local community and visitors.\nThe council’s ‘English only’ policy effectively air brushes out access to a heritage we all share regardless of political allegiance.\nThe English language is only a small part of who we are and where we have come from as a community.\nSome in the leadership of both the DUP and UUP have sought to weaponise the Irish language and to demonise those who support its use and visibility.\nThey have prosecuted their own version of a ‘project fear’ which deliberately misrepresents the campaign for Irish language rights as cultural warfare.\nThat type of exclusive and bigoted mind-set goes right to the crux of why the political institutions do not currently exist in Stormont.\nThe DUP wrecked power sharing and partnership in recent years as the culmination of their 20-year campaign opposing the GFA since 1998.\nThose presently in charge of the DUP don’t want to exercise proper power sharing with Sinn Féin and are opposed to a rights-based society. \nThat’s the message which comes from the leadership of the DUP, and as a result, why unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey have now adopted an ‘English only’ policy in an act of abject disrespect to their Irish neighbours.\nPolitical unionism in South Antrim has form in the history of exclusion.\nNever once in the history of local government in Antrim and Newtownabbey have unionists shared the position of Mayor or deputy mayor with a Sinn Féin councillor.\nIn the 2017 Westminster general election 18.1% of the electorate voted for Sinn Féin in South Antrim.\nThat section of the electorate is synonymous, albeit not exclusively, with those citizens who consider themselves to be Irish.\nAn additional 12.9% voted for other non-unionist political parties.\nImportantly some citizens who vote for the unionist parties consider themselves to be both Irish and British. Unionism is not a culturally homogeneous bloc.\nSo when the unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey vote to adopt an ‘English only’ policy that tells a substantial cross section of local rate payers that they are unequal and do not deserve to be treated with parity of esteem and respect.\nThe only conclusion is that those in charge of the local unionist parties are not committed to a shared future and inclusion, and instead want to make South Antrim a cold house for the Irish identity.\nAnd, that mind-set is a throwback to the days of the old apartheid, orange state in the north of Ireland.\nThe ‘English only’ policy in Antrim and Newtownabbey borough council is now the subject of a judicial review.\nLocal Irish language activists and rate payers have begun a campaign to overturn this disgraceful policy.\nI have been encouraging local people to register their objections with the Chief Executive.\n\nIf there is ever to be a shared and united future in the north that must also apply within Antrim and Newtownabbey council politically, culturally and in respect of every aspect of community and civic life.\nLocal councillors and council officers have an obligation to ensure the operation of this council is conducted in a legally compliant, fair, equal, inclusive, transparent and democratic matter.\nThey should be actively promoting and ensuring adherence to the principles of parity of esteem, mutual respect, equality, and anti-sectarianism enshrined in the GFA.\nThat is what the republican and nationalist electorate and other progressives and fair-minded people in South Antrim expect from those charged with administering local government.\nCitizens in Antrim and Newtownabbey pay high rates with the expectation of good quality council services.\nThey do not pay high rates to be treated with such abject disrespect.\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27429  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna\n\nSpeakers at today\u0026#039s march urged attendees to make their way to Belfast over the next week to celebrate Belfast Pride, who will host Ireland\u0026#039s biggest LGBT festival, with the annual parade held on Pride Day which is celebrated on August 4th.\nSinn Féin were among the thousand strong crowd of people who marched at the first ever Transgender Pride parade that took place in Dublin this afternoon.\n The march started outside Liberty Hall and made its way to Fairview Park, where Declan Flynn was murdered by a gang of five so-called “queer-bashing” teenagers in the early hours of September 10th, 1982.\nThe suspended sentences for his attackers triggered a long march towards equality in Irish society.

a great way to save money.\nA spokeswoman for Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council this week refuted the claims, saying: There have been no instances lately of bins not being collected other than due to local access issues and these are always followed up the next day.\u0026#160 \nStaff in the Waste team have flexible job roles and are employed where needed across cleansing, waste and recycling centres.\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a06.jpg","title":"65378  ","story":"    \nTHE Opening Ceremony for the Atlantic Challenge International Contest of Seamanship has taken place.\nEleven international teams are making Antrim their home for this week\u0027s event. \nTwo hundred young people from USA, Russia, Belgium, Great Britain,\u0026#160 Republic of Ireland,\u0026#160 France, Denmark, Canada and Northern Ireland will compete, live and learn together as part of the Atlantic Challenge. \nSpectators will have a great view from the Lough Shore of the 11 picturesque gigs as they race on Lough Neagh.\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a05.jpg","title":"65379  ","story":"    \nTHE 2018 MCE Insurance Ulster Grand Prix is less than a month away and anticipation is certainly building. \nFollowing a TT that saw Peter Hickman demolish the outright lap record to win a thrilling Senior TT finale ahead of Dean Harrison, the 7.4011 miles of Dundrod tarmac is the next meeting ground for these road-racing heavyweights. \nPeter, UGP Man of the Meeting in 2017 and now the world\u0027s fastest rider, secured podium finishes in four classes, three of which were as race winner.\nUlster Grand Prix Bike Week runs from August 5-11 and is gearing up to be the perfect climax to the international road-racing season.\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a03.jpg","title":"65381  ","story":"    \nA SECTARIAN killer has appeared at Antrim Magistrate\u0027s Court charged with escaping lawful custody.\nStanding handcuffed in the dock, 32-year-old Christopher Kerr spoke only to confirm that he understood the four charges against him.\nIn addition to an offence of escaping lawful custody, Kerr is also accused of three drugs offences.\nThe alleged offences arose after he allegedly ran away from prison officers in Victoria Square shopping centre while out on day release.\nKerr, who is currently serving a life term for the shocking and horrifying sectarian attack which claimed the life of 15-year-old Catholic schoolboy Michael McIlveen, was arrested at Antrim Area Hospital the following day. \n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a02f2.jpg","title":"65382  ","story":"    \nA CRUMLIN family has again been hit by tragedy after the sudden death of a teenager, just weeks after his father passed away.\nHenry Turley (14)\u0026#160 fell from a hotel balcony in the beach resort of Playa de Muro on Majorca in the early hours of last Wednesday (July 18).\nSpanish Civil Guard said his mother Claire was holding on to his hand and attempting to save him after he overbalanced on the second floor balcony before he fell at around midnight.\nHenry\u0027s death comes less than seven weeks after his father Stephen, who ran the Ten Storey tattoo parlour in Crumlin, was discovered dead at a friend\u0027s house.\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a06f-jpg.jpg","title":"65469  ","story":"    \nWITH last weekend\u0027s downpour bringing Antrim to a standstill, it was no surprise that rain also stopped played at Muckamore Cricket Club!\nAfter weeks of fine weather, normal service was finally resumed with one of the most dramatic downpours in living memory.\nMuckamore Firsts were taking on North Down at the time, but the players soon beat a hasty retreat to the clubhouse when the skies opened.

It requires a cut and lift once a year in September where the meadow is mowed and the cuttings are lifted which prevents the grass from taking over. The school has achieved so much by doing less and spending no money.\n  \n“The principal, Mrs Lutton has been very supportive of the initiative and the groundsmen have ensured the meadow is looked after in the proper way.”\n  \nRachael said the meadow has been such a success that the school has agreed to extend its size. \n  \nRachel added: “These flowers have been lying dormont in the soil for years waiting for an opportunity. We now have over 20 of these rare flowers after just two years of changing the mowing regime.”\n  \nOther wildflowers found in the meadow include Self-Heal and Birds Foot Trefoil.\n  \nRachael continued: “We would love to see Ballymena schools become a showcase for meadow creation. \n  \n“Council has planted quite a lot of wildflowers around the town and it would be great to see less mowing and more and more of these wonderful meadows.” \n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_894394.jpg--.jpg?1533024971000\n","title":"antrim rose roisin sets her sights on tralee","story":"  \nA PORTGLENONE woman is making her way to the dome as the Antrim Rose for the 59th Rose of Tralee Festival.\n  \nRoisin McCloskey came out triumphant at the heat held in the Le Mon Hotel in at the end of May.\n  \nIn competition with nine others she was announced as the Antrim Rose which there hasn\u0027t been since 2010.\n  \nSpeaking to the Ballymena , she said she is delighted to be going to Tralee and is looking forward to meeting all the other roses.\n  \nI am so excited about the experience.

Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit. It\u0027s eight more families who need our help every month in a small town like Ballymoney.\nThe Trussell Trust, which compiles UK wide Foodbank figures, say that increases of over 50% are common in areas where UC has been rolled out for a year or more.\nThe Chronicle asked the Department of Communities, who rolled out UC, to comment on the issues raised, with a spokesperson saying: \n\u0026#8220People use food banks for many and varied reasons and it would be misleading to link them to any single cause.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ?

sale after the club rejected a bid from Irish League champions Crusaders.\nIt is understood the offer would have smashed the Irish League transfer fee record which remains the �50,000 Linfield paid for striker Glenn Ferguson in 1998.\nMcGonigle (22) has been the Stripes\u0027 top scorer in each of the last two seasons and notched 20 goals in the 2017/18 season.\nThe Dungiven man\u0027s eye-catching performances saw him nominated for the Ulster Footballer of the Year Award while he was named in the NI Football Writers\u0027 Team of the Year.\nThe bid being rejected is absolutely the stance that we have taken, Bannsiders\u0027 boss Kearney told The Chronicle.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this

And just before the youngsters left the nest to take to County Antrim skies, Aidan led a team of birders to ring them. It was a marvellous occasion for all who took part. These participants now share a special bond, a fellowship of the rings not unlike that from the famous trilogy Lord of the Rings itself.\n\nIn April, Aidan was overjoyed to see his first barn owl when, after a three-hour stake-out of the old cottage with Dúlra, one emerged like a ghost from the window and out over the shimmering, moonlit lough. That night one of the most significant barn owl projects was launched – if the birds successfully bred, Aidan determined to ring the chicks, setting in motion a structured, monitored process to analyse the population of one of our most threatened birds, one which was on the verge of extinction in Ireland.\n\n“Now that they have rings, these chicks have become dots on the map of barn owls in the world,” said a proud Aidan. “They are five ambassadors who will contribute to a national scientific study of these birds in Ireland.\n\n“And I want the public to help us. These five birds will leave their nest by next Friday and set out to make lives for themselves. Their territory will be from Hannahstown right out to Lough Neagh. We want people to look out for them. If anyone sees one, we want to know. \n\n“You’ll often see an owl in your headlights, and if you also see a flash of metal on their legs, then it’s one of ours. And we want to know about it especially if you see one of them hurt and in need of help.”\n\nThe team weighed and measured the chicks, discovering that four of them were male. “That’s four new territories for breeding barn owls next year,” Aidan said.\n\nAidan and pals – including Belfast Media Group editor Robin Livingstone – set out to ring the chicks in a slick operation.\n\n“This was all about planning,” said Aidan. “We wanted to keep disturbance to a minimum so we had it all worked out beforehand.\n\n“Everyone knew their job, be it climbing the ladder to the nest, weighing the birds, writing their details in the log book, putting on the rings. And everyone was caring and sensitive of the brood. We only spoke when we had to and were gone as soon as possible.\n\n “Adult owls leave their chicks alone in the nest, so the two parents were sleeping in the chimney pot when we went to the nest in the rafters and they weren’t disturbed at all. Owls could teach us a lot – once the chicks are four weeks old the parents sleep in a different bedroom. They know they’ll not get any peace with the young ‘uns playing and constantly pulling at them because they want the bird equivalent of McDonald’s and Pizza Hut. \n\n“The parents go somewhere else so they can get a good night’s sleep rather than stay with their teenage brood.”\n\nThe chick with Aidan is about 40 days old – owls incubate their eggs as soon as each is laid, unlike garden birds who wait until all the eggs are laid before they incubate to ensure they all hatch together – so the five chicks are all different ages and weights.\n\n“This was pretty special for me,” said Aidan. “Despite a lifetime of birdwatching, I’d never seen a single barn owl until this year. To see five chicks in a single nest is phenomenal. This is one of the biggest broods ever recorded, and shows that the birds here are healthy and finding plenty of food.”\nThe old abandoned cottage is on land belonging to the owner of Randox Laboratories Dr Peter Fitzgerald, who is said to be delighted that barn owls have chosen to nest there and is backing the study of the chicks.\n\nAidan added: “There may be only a couple of pair of breeding barn owls in the whole north of Ireland, so these chicks are precious and represent hope that they can make a comeback. A big congratulations is due to everyone concerned.”\n\n* If you’ve seen anything interesting or have any nature questions, you can text Dúlra on 07801 414804.\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Generation-identity.png","title":"fascist graffiti re emerges in north belfast","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\nA SINN Féin councillor has stressed the importance of challenging the far-right after the appearance of graffiti promoting a new fascist group in North Belfast.\nLogos representing the white supremacist Generation Identity movement were daubed on street furniture on the Cavehill Road, but were quickly removed due to the fast actions of Cllr Mary Ellen Campbell and maintenance workers from the Belfast City Council.\nGeneration Identity describe themselves as a “movement aimed at preserving the ethnocultural identity of Europe”, and are active in 13 countries across Europe and North America.\nThe shadowy group has been trying to gain a foothold in the North and have already been involved in a number of public demonstrations.\nLast month they were part of the “Free Tommy Robinson” rally at City Hall where demonstrators were pictured giving Nazi salutes.\nSpeaking to the North Belfast News, Cllr Campbell said that fascist graffiti has become a more common occurrence in recent times.\n“It’s about the fourth or fifth time I have had to get this type of graffiti removed in the area,” she said.\n“We need to keep challenging them to prevent them gaining a foothold.\n“More and more people are questioning what it is because they started putting their logo up. If you look at their logo it isn’t immediately recognisable, it’s not a swastika, but people need to be looking at it as such.\n“North Belfast is a very culturally diverse area and we don’t want anybody with that negative agenda organising here.\n“We can see what they are doing outside City Hall and we can see what they are doing in other countries. North Belfast is a welcoming area and that’s the positivity that we want to promote.\n“Thankfully the Council removed the graffiti almost immediately after I reported it.\n“The people of this area have been very welcoming to families that are here from Syria and other countries. We’re a diverse part of the city and that’s the part of the city that I want to live in and promote.”\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"name change opposed by belfast celtic society","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\n\nPLANS\n for Sport and Leisure Swifts to change their name to Belfast Celtic suffered a setback yesterday with the news that the Belfast Celtic Society has voiced their opposition to the move. \n\nThe Glen Road Heights outfit announced its intentions to change their name in a statement issued on social media earlier this month, with the aim of “improving the club and improving the footballing prospects for young people in West Belfast”. \n\nHowever, despite approaching the society prior to making their announcement, Sport and Leisure’s plans have been met with opposition from the Belfast Celtic Society. \n\nHaving distanced themselves from the name change in a previous statement, primarily due to their status as a charitable organisation, the Belfast Celtic Society held a full committee meeting yesterday morning (Wednesday) to discuss the matter. \n\n“The Belfast Celtic Society again reiterates that it had no involvement in this venture,” a spokesperson said. “The Society was only made aware of the development 48 hours before the public announcement. \n\n“The Society was surprised by this announcement and the reaction received from both our membership as well as the general sporting public has been overwhelmingly negative. \n\n“Since its foundation almost two decades ago, the Society has been approached on more than one occasion to endorse and support a range of commercial enterprises with the intention of exploiting the name of the club for commercial gain. \n\n“Over this period, our standard response has been that this is contrary to the constitution of the society which is regulated by the Charity Commission.” \n\nThe Society also expressed its concern that the families of the former players of Belfast Celtic were not consulted prior to the announcement. \n\nThe Belfast Celtic Society also claim that the trademark registered by businessman Anthony John Bonnar earlier this year is a new company and is not linked to the old Belfast Celtic Football and Athletic Company. \n\nHowever, speaking to the Andersonstown News, Sport and Leisure chairman Jim Gillen said that while he was disappointed the Belfast Celtic Society hadn’t supported the name change, he stressed that the club will be moving forward with their plans regardless. \n\n“We have everything in place. As of yet, the IFA (Irish Football Association) has yet to rubber-stamp it,” said Gillen. \n\n“We have to go ahead with it. We informed them (the Belfast Celtic Society) and we spoke to a few members. They seemed to think it was a good idea. They’ve obviously put it to their full committee and they have given a different outlook. There’s nothing we can do about that other than trying to change their mind. \n\n“We would like to go ahead with their blessing and indeed the blessing of everybody in West Belfast. We’ll stay positive on what we are trying to achieve.” \n\nSport and Leisure Swifts are set to play their first game of the new season against Armagh City on Saturday, August 18 and are hoping the name change to Belfast Celtic will be approved by the IFA before that fixture.\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article36707179.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/012-_Read-Only_%202.jpg","title":"revealed gcse league table for northern ireland 2018 where did your","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Grammar schools dominated the top of the league tables for GCSE results achieved in 2017, taking the top 54 places.\n\n\n\n\nRevealed: Budgets for every Northern Ireland school 2018-19\n\n\n\n\nThe Belfast \u0027s league tables include data on every secondary school in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe top non-grammar school at GCSE in 2016/17 was St Patrick\u0027s High School, Keady (91.3%), followed by St Colm\u0027s High School in Draperstown (87.7%), and St Patrick\u0027s College, Maghera (85.9%) - just ahead of the top performing controlled non-grammar, Castlederg High School (83.3%).Overall across Northern Ireland in 2016/17, some 70.3% of year 12 pupils achieved five or more GCSEs at grades A*-C (or equivalent) including English and maths.\n\nThis was up 2.4 percentage points from 2015/16.\n\nPeter Dobbin, principal of Assumption Grammar, described its joint topping of the latest league tables as a surprise 85th birthday present for the Co Down school.\n\n\"I am delighted with the phenomenal achievement of our Assumption girls at both GCSE level and A2 level,\" he said.\n\n\"The girls and the staff of Assumption have worked so hard and fully deserve this public recognition of our academic success.\n\n\"However, it is the school\u0027s \u0027Fully Alive\u0027 ethos which underpins every aspect of why Assumption Grammar is such a unique educational establishment and has been since we were first established by the Missionary Sisters of the Assumption 85 years ago this year.\n\n\"This is a surprise birthday present which will bring a smile to all our Assumption girls, past and present.\"\n\nDown High principal Maud Perry said the school was very proud of its results and she paid tribute to the hard work of pupils.\n\n\"We celebrate the many talents and achievements of all our pupils at Down High and we\u0027re very proud of the 100% pass rate at GCSE in both mathematics and English,\" she said.\n\n\"Our motto \u0027nothing is achieved without effort\u0027 reflects our belief that there is no limit to what can be accomplished through hard work.\n\n\"This hard work of staff and pupils, alongside the support of our parents, produced these fantastic results in the 2017 summer exam season.\"\n\nToday\u0027s tables also represent a triumph for south Belfast grammar school Wellington College, which scored 94.7%, significantly above the Northern Ireland average, as it works to be removed from formal intervention.\n\nPrincipal David Castles said: \"We are very proud of the excellent GCSE outcomes our students have attained. This significant improvement is part of our drive at Wellington College to raise standards, engage students and build pathways to success.\n\n\"Excellence in exams is a result of students, staff and parents working together, and these GCSE results give a great foundation for success at A-level and beyond.\"\n\nHow we did sums for the latest league tables\n\nThe Belfast  is the only source of comprehensive league tables showing the results of every post-primary school in Northern Ireland.\n\nWe obtained the data from the Department of Education for A-level and GCSE examinations sat in the 2016/17 academic year and compiled the figures into easy-to-read league tables, ordered from top to bottom. In the GCSE league tables, the Belfast  has used the percentage of pupils in the final year of a level 3 course who achieved five or more GCSEs - including English and Maths -between an A* to C grade in each school as the standard measure.\n\nThe Department of Education does not produce A-level or GCSE league tables and said it does not endorse them.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed transfer test grade intake for northern ireland schools","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

In the 2016/17 academic year 11,570 applications were made for the 8,743 available places at our 63 selective grammars.\n\n\n\n\nNI Transfer Tests: 2017 Grammar Schools’ intake and grade information\n\n\nThis is out of a total of 21,763 pupils who obtained Year 8 places at Northern Ireland\u0027s 199 post-primary schools in September 2017.\n\nToday the Belfast  can reveal what grades or scores it took to get into each of our selective grammars last year.\n\nThis exclusive data was obtained over several months by sending Freedom of Information Act requests to each of the selective grammars.\n\nCurrently there are no official figures provided by the Department of Education, because both the Post Primary Transfer Consortium\u0027s GL assessment and the Association of Quality Education\u0027s (AQE) Common Entrance Assessment are unofficial tests.\n\nOur data for tests sat in the 2016/17 academic year reveal:\n\n\nFive schools which use the AQE system did not accept a score below 100 in September 2017.\n\nFive schools which use the GL system did not accept a grade below an A in September 2017.\n\n30 schools accepted AQE scores, while 26 accepted GL scores, and seven took either.\n\nLagan College, which is partially selective, was the most popular first choice by far, with 456 applications for 200 places.\n\nFriends School Lisburn was one of the toughest schools to get into last September - the lowest score it accepted was 106 (AQE).\n\nThree of the 63 selective grammar schools were not oversubscribed.\n\nThe AQE and GL tests received a total number of 14,491 entries in the 2016/17 academic year - 7,725 sat the AQEs and 6,766 sat the GL tests. An unknown number of pupils sat both tests.\n\nThere are 199 post-primary schools in Northern Ireland, of which 63 are grammars that use academic selection for all or some of their Year 8 intake.\n\n\nLeaders in the AQE and GL organisations told the Belfast  that their entry rates have been steadily increasing over the last decade following the abolition of the old Department of Education-administered 11-plus by former Education Minister Caitriona Ruane in 2008.\n\nAQE chief executive Stephen Connolly said the number of entrants to the test is continuing to rise, with 8,169 pupils registered for the 2017 AQE tests, a rise of almost 6% on 2016 (7,725).\n\nMr Connolly said he can only speculate on the increase, but said he believed it may partly follow a decision by former Education Minister Peter Weir to allow primary schools to prepare pupils to sit transfer tests. That reversed a ruling by his predecessor John O\u0027Dowd, which saw schools receive warning letters from the department over preparing pupils for tests within school hours.\n\n\"That reflects a number of things, that is the steadily increasing primary school age population, also a backwash from the former minister taking the shackles off primary schools and allowing them to openly prepare pupils for transfer tests, and also word of mouth from parent to parent,\" he said. There was also an increase in the number of pupils who sat the PPTC\u0027s GL test, from 6,766 in the 2016/17 academic year to 7,150 in 2017/18.\n\nCarol McCann from the PPTC said parents remained very supportive of the tests.\n\n\"More than 30 schools use the GL test and it is used by a variety of types of school, including grammar and bilateral,\" she said.\n\n\"A number of PPTC schools also register pupils for the AQE test. Regarding the increase in the number of pupils sitting the test in 2017 for entry to post-primary in 2018, it is most likely as a result of a rising primary school population in a number of areas.\n\n\"It is very evident that the transfer test continues to be supported by parents in Northern Ireland who believe in educational choice.\"\n\nMeanwhile, talks between the two transfer test providers to create a single system of assessment remain \"ongoing and positive\".\n\nThe AQE and PPTC aim to have a common test in place by November 2019. Mr Connolly said that talks are continuing but the end goal is very complex, and they want to ensure any new single system is robust, will have the confidence of parents, and is of an international standard.\n\n\"The two negotiating teams made a very good decision at the outset to keep it confidential to not raise expectation or increase pressures and making sure the goodwill between us in this difficult process is maintained,\" he said. \"Trying to put together a single system is very difficult.\n\n\"I think it is very important that both groups think it is a matter of principle there should be one system.\n\n\"That principle has been agreed, but getting there is tricky simply because of the complexity of the two systems. People need to have confidence in schools, but also in the testing system.\n\n\"It needs to be reliable, robust and meet international standards. It isn\u0027t just a race to cobble together any old compromise, we are engaging in careful negotiation.\" Results for both tests are due to be released to pupils this Saturday.\n\nHow the figures are compiled\n\nUnder the Freedom of Information Act (FoI) legislation we asked the grammar schools in Northern Ireland which use academic selection to determine their Year 8 intake to provide the breakdown of the AQE/GL grades/scores achieved by the pupils they admitted in September 2017.\n\nThe data gives schools’ name, location, the highest grade/score/quintile/band it accepted and the lowest grade/score/quintile/band it accepted.\n\nOther information included is the number of first preference choices it received and total applications (which includes first, second, third choices etc).\n\nSeveral schools have provided bands for the lowest and highest scores they accepted, as this is the method they used to select pupils. Some schools accept both AQE and GL scores.\n\nNot all schools use academic selection to determine their entire intake. Wallace High School in Lisburn admits around 90% of its Year 8 intake on test results Campbell College in Belfast admits 70%, while Lagan College in Belfast and Slemish College in Ballymena select 35% of their pupils using test scores. Some other schools also use additional criteria to separate students with the same score vying for the final places. Two voluntary grammar schools, Loreto College in Coleraine and St Patrick’s Grammar in Armagh, no longer use academic selection.\n\nTotal pupil figures do not tally for a number of reasons, which can include pupils with a statement of special educational needs not being included in enrolment figures, and some pupils being accepted through special circumstances or on appeal.\n\nIn some schools pupils were admitted without using academic selection and some schools were undersubscribed.\n\nWhen comparing schools, the size should be taken into account. For example Glenlola Collegiate in Bangor has an annual Year 8 intake of 157 pupils. Its principal Mr W E Thompson pointed out that the 157th pupil they accepted in September 2017 scored 85 in the AQE test, but in the North Down area there are smaller selective grammars which accepted only 100 pupils.\n\nHe has asked us to point out that the 100th pupil Glenlola accepted scored 98 in the AQE tests.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"belfast trust spent 600k on consultants in","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

health bosses paid out more than £600,000 for advice from management consultants in just two years, it has emerged.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({})\n\n\nAccording to official figures, the Belfast Health Trust paid £7,100 to a private management consultant for 15 days of support in relation to the damning hyponatraemia report.\n\nMeanwhile, it has also tasked another private management consultant to help with work around the ongoing recall of more than 3,000 neurology patients in the Belfast Trust.\n\nThe work is expected to take 30 days to complete, at a cost of £15,000.\n\nThe information has been released by the Business Services Organisation (BSO), which revealed that the HSC Leadership Centre (HSCLC) provided consultancy services to the Belfast Trust at a cost of £630,701 between 2016 and 2018.\n\nIt comes as the health service in Northern Ireland faces unprecedented financial pressures.\n\nHealth trusts are becoming increasingly reliant on cash injections from the likes of in-year monitoring rounds and the DUP-Conservative confidence and supply deal just to make ends meet.\n\nIn January, the Healthcare Financial Management Association (HFMA) released a report warning that Northern Ireland\u0027s health service could have a funding gap of up to £540m a year.\n\nHowever, the figures released by the BSO reveal that while thousands of patients spend up to five years waiting in agony for operations for painful and debilitating conditions, the HSCLC is paying private consultants £500 a day for their services.\n\nAlliance MLA, Paula Bradshaw, said she was surprised and concerned to learn the private consultants had been engaged at such a cost to the public purse.\n\nShe continued: \"In my opinion, the role of the health service is to support patients and their carers at times when health needs arise and the funding that is allocated to the Department of Health for the provision of care and treatment to meet these needs is finite and in fierce demand right across the sector, and so I will be following this up to find out why the consultants were engaged.\n\n\"Having supported a number of individuals and families affected by the neurology recall process and the Hyponatraemia Inquiry, I am particularly curious to learn more about the nature of this commissioned work and sincerely hope that it is not for the purpose of crisis management.\"\n\nThe HSCLC, which comes under the BSO, provides a range of services to health and social care organisations in Northern Ireland, including consultancy services.\n\nThese include leadership development programmes, support for improvement, team development and other support, including investigations.\n\nThe HSCLC currently has a pool of about 90 private consultants, known as associate consultants, that can be drawn upon as and when required.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Belfast Trust said it has used the resources of the HSCLC for two specific pieces of work \"through normal business arrangements\".\n\nShe continued: \"Firstly, to provide additional support to the trust in the implementation of the 96 recommendations of the findings of the inquiry into hyponatraemia-related deaths which was published on January 31 this year and which are actively being addressed within the trust and as part of the departmental framework.\n\n\"Secondly, in preparation for the independent inquiry panel as a result of the recall of neurology patients, we have secured additional assistance to support us in providing the inquiry with all relevant, extensive, and detailed documentation in a timely way.\"\n\nThe Belfast Trust was criticised by the chair of the Hyponatraemia Report, John O\u0027Hara, in his report which was published in January.\n\nThe inquiry, which examined the deaths of five children, found that four of the deaths were avoidable.\n\nMeanwhile, work is ongoing to identify whether any patients seen by consultant

However, no meeting is scheduled before Saturday\u0027s parade. Calls have now been made for a special meeting of the council on Friday. If that does not happen, then the flags will not fly.\n\nThe \u0027call-in\u0027 move comes after a notice of motion brought by Sinn Fein on flying the flags narrowly passed 12-11 at a full council meeting last Monday evening. DUP councillors voted against the motion while the Ulster Unionists abstained after their amendment recommending that council buildings be lit in the pride colours instead was rejected.\n\nA council spokesperson confirmed the \u0027call in\u0027 had been received.\n\nSinn Fein group leader on the council Darren McNally slammed the DUP for trying to prevent the flying of the Rainbow flag.\n\n\"The move by the DUP to call-in Sinn Fein\u0027s motion to fly the rainbow flag at civic buildings across the area is disgraceful and disrespectful to our LGBTQ+ community,\" he said. \"This call-in came in the final hour - and is an effort to run down the clock on gaining legal advice and securing a special meeting of the council before Saturday.\"\n\nMayor of Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon Julie Flaherty confirmed: \"The call-in was received on Tuesday morning and it\u0027s now in the hands of the Chief Executive. That\u0027s where we\u0027re at as things stand.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in a separate development, Barnardo\u0027s has become the first children\u0027s charity in Northern Ireland to publicly voice support for the recognition of same-sex marriage.\n\nIt made the announcement to coincide with Belfast Pride\u0027s Coming Out for Change campaign, and just days before the city\u0027s Pride parade.\n\nBarnardo\u0027s has in the past supported marriage equality campaigns in other areas of the UK and in the Republic of Ireland.\n\nThe director of Barnardo\u0027s NI Lynda Wilson said it hoped to see marriage equality extended to Northern Ireland.\n\n\"We are committed to providing equality of opportunity and believe marriage equality is an extension of that,\" she said.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"fair legal process faced severe pressure in case enveloped by rumour and speculation","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Mr O\u0027Donoghue said her post had the capacity to reflect badly on his client and created a substantial risk of prejudicing or impeding proceedings if it was related to the jury.\n\n\"I do not know if her comments have been seen or relayed to any member of the jury in any way,\" he said.\n\nTurning down the application, the judge said: \"It is recognised that jurors are capable of following instructions and I have no reason to think they have not followed every instruction, nor do I have any reason to believe they have any knowledge of the tweet. \n\n\"I am not satisfied that there is a real risk of prejudice to this jury and I refuse the application.\"\n\nThe Alliance Party defended Mrs Long, saying: \"We are always conscious of our responsibilities when making any comment related to live court proceedings and exercise great care to avoid any remarks which could be construed as prejudicial.\"\n\nEarlier, Ireland rugby captain Rory Best faced heavy criticism on social media when he attended the trial.\n\nJudge Smyth was forced to addressed the jury explaining Mr Best\u0027s appearance at the court.\n\nShe told them: \"You may have been aware of Press coverage or coverage of some nature about the appearance of Mr Rory Best, who I understand is the captain of the Irish rugby team.\n\n\"I want to make it absolutely clear to you and clear to the public, the only reason Mr Rory Best was in this court last week was because he was directed to be here by senior counsel.\n\n\"That\u0027s the only reason he was here, and as a jury you should know that.\"\n\nAfter the case concluded it also emerged that the Attorney General John Larkin was investigating comments made online by a member of the jury.\n\nThe remarks were posted just hours after the jury returned their unanimous not guilty verdicts and appeared on a blogging website under a story about the case.\n\nBy law, jurors are not permitted to disclose details of their deliberations in any trial.\n\nThe Attorney General was asked by the Lord Chief Justice Sir Declan Morgan to investigate whether the comments represent a breach of contempt of court laws.\n\nThe remarks allegedly made by the juror - which were reported by the  - appeared on a blogging website under a story about the verdict.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"foster accuses varadkar of interfering in ni after questioning fresh talks claim","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

It later widened to take in issues such as the Irish language, LGBT rights and the legacy of the Troubles.\n\nThe last bid to resurrect the troubled institutions failed in February when the DUP pulled the plug on talks with Sinn Fein.\n\nSinn Fein insisted a draft deal had been signed off with the DUP at that point, and accused the party of getting cold feet in the face of an internal revolt from grassroots members angry about potential concessions in the dispute over the Irish language.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSinn Fein President Mary Lou McDonald during an interview with the Press Association (Liam McBurney/PA)\n\n\n\n\nThe DUP denied the claim, insisting it exchanged numerous papers with Sinn Fein during the negotiation process but none amounted to a draft agreement.\n\nThe main logjam relates to Sinn Fein’s insistence on a free-standing piece of legislation to protect Irish language speakers. The DUP will legislate to protect Irish, but only as part of wider legislation that takes in other cultures, such as the Ulster Scots tradition.\n\nOn Wednesday, Mrs Foster made clear that her opposition to a standalone Irish language act was “non-negotiable”.\n\nOn Monday, in an interview with the Press Association, Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald said the party’s stance in February remained its “bottom line” going into any fresh negotiations.\n\nOn Wednesday, she told Radio Ulster: “We can talk from here to eternity, what we need is delivery, we need delivery on agreement, we need delivery on people’s rights.\n\n“I think constructive politics, grown-up politics, responsible politics, recognises that the days of prevarication and allowing the DUP to hold back change are over and any set of talks needs to be premised on that very, very clear understanding.”\n\nIn response to Mr Varadkar’s comments on Tuesday, the UK Government said: “The Secretary of State (Karen Bradley) and UK Government’s top priority remains the restoration of devolved government in Northern Ireland.\n\n“She will continue to work with all the Northern Ireland parties – and with the Irish Government within the three-stranded approach – to remove the barriers to restoring the executive and a fully functioning assembly.”\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37173467.ece/87766/AUTOCROP/w620h342/u_McDonald_RTE_NEWS.jpg","title":"mcdonald uturn over border poll prompts derision from unionists","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

The Sinn Fein president has performed a sharp handbrake turn on the comments she made on Monday.\n\n“She initially stated that a poll on Irish unity should not be held while uncertainty around Brexit remains, yet by Tuesday morning the Sinn Fein Press office published a completely contradictory statement, where she was quoted as saying that she wants a referendum as soon as possible.”\n\nMr Aiken said Sinn Fein didn’t have plans for a border poll nor a case to make. “Rather than be distracted by this, they would be better concentrating their efforts on getting devolution restored and addressing the chronic pressures on our health service, schools and other sectors,” he added.\n\nDUP leader Arlene Foster also noted that Sinn Fein had changed its stance overnight.\n\n“Whilst there have been plenty of republican soundbites about a border poll, one interview exposed that Sinn Fein has no answers to basic questions about a united Ireland, such as what happens to our free-at-point-of-need health system,” she said.\n\n“Indeed, within 24 hours of that interview, the Sinn Fein leadership is rowing back from their ‘not yet’ position. As tempting as calling Sinn Fein’s bluff might be, the principle of consent is in place and should be respected. \n\n“Few dispute there is a clear majority in favour of staying within the United Kingdom, but it would be foolish to think that families across the country are itching for a destabilising border poll.”\n\nThe DUP leader said people here were more interested in seeing power-sharing restored than participating in a referendum on reunification.\n\n“The people I speak with want a functioning government today, where decisions about public sector pay as well as roads, schools and hospitals are made,” she said.\n\n“Sinn Fein is the only party blocking that. I have no objection to extolling the merits of the Union. I have done so and will continue to do so. \n\n“Unionism needs to be open and welcoming. Ultimately, if people are comfortable living, working and raising their families in a Northern Ireland within the UK, they will be less inclined to ever vote to leave it.”\n\nTUV leader Jim Allister said contradictions in Sinn Fein’s position weren’t new. “They claim to support peace while continuing to justify the IRA’s terrorist campaign,” he said.\n\n“This is just more of the same practice and is a recognition that their pipe dream of Irish unity is getting no closer.”\n\nAlliance deputy leader Stephen Farry said: “Brexit poses a massive threat to the cohesion of Northern Ireland and the shared society underpinned by the Good Friday Agreement. \n\n“While Alliance respects everyone’s constitutional aspiration, the priority today must be to agree a special deal for Northern Ireland to mitigate the risks from Brexit and to achieve the maximum cross-community support for such a pragmatic way forward.”\n\nWhat Sinn Fein president said in Belfast on Monday\n\nThe obvious thing would be to say ‘well, have the border poll and remove the border, if the border is the problem, simply take it away’ — and there is a certain logic to that.\n\nI am very, very conscious that you can’t come at this issue in that simplistic way.\n\nIt’s very important when we come to addressing the issue of partition we do it in the best possible climate and we do it in a way that maximises consent. \n\nIt is not my preferred option or our preferred option that we deal with the issue of Irish unity in a climate that is unsteady or unstable or chaotic, in other words in the context of a crash Brexit or a very hard Brexit.\n\nI would prefer, it is my strong preference, that we have sequencing that firstly delivers a level of economic and social certainty, in as much we can be certain, and stability and from that base we then continue the conversation about Irish unity.”\n\n... and outside Leinster House yesterday\n\nThe very nature of Brexit and the blatant disregard shown to Ireland by the Tory government underscores the imperative for Irish Unity. It emphasises the need for the people, north and south, to have their say on the constitutional question and the future of this island.\n\nA decision to exit the European Union was endorsed in England and Wales. It was rejected by the people of the North of Ireland and yet, it is to be imposed on them as though they didn’t vote at all. This again highlights the democratic deficit of the union and the utter failure of partition. Clearly, the chaos and prospect of a crash Tory Brexit, and the very real difficulties this will create in the lives of ordinary people, does not provide the best environment for a referendum on Irish Unity.\n\nWe want to have that campaign in an atmosphere of calm, respect and in a climate conducive to constructive debate and not in the shadow of Tory game-playing. However, and I have already put this to Theresa May, if the Tories continue to pursue a negotiation stance that can only led to a crash Brexit, the British Government will have to put the question on Irish Unity to the people in a referendum.\n\nIrish Unity makes sense. It has always made sense. Brexit is simply the latest political mess to underline that fact. The appetite for the Unity debate is growing every day. Sinn Fein wants to see a referendum as soon as possible.

Zeplin, Blaise, Maverick, Ace and Jupiter on the other hand, were some of the less common names given to baby boys in 2017.\n\nIn terms of girls’ names, Grace has once again taken second place in the top 10, whilst Olivia comes a close third. Roise climbed the greatest number of places to join the top 100 names for girls, moving from rank 151 in 2016 to rank 90 in 2017. Isla and Charlotte both joined the girl’s top 10 for the first time in 2017.\n\nCompared with boys, a greater number of girls’ names have held the top spot since the reporting of first names began in 1997.  Some of the less common names given to baby girls in 2017 were Lady, Divine, Rio, Star and Vogue.\n\nAlmost 1,000 new baby names were registered in 2017 that had not been registered since the reporting of baby names began in 1997. Blockbuster movies, popular television series, current celebrities and memorable places continue to appear to be influencing factors for some parents.\n\nOf those registrations containing details of the father, almost 500 boys were given their fathers’ name as a first or additional name.  However fewer than 100 girls were given their mothers’ name.\n\nMore generally, the statistics published today highlight that the popularity of baby names in 2017 (both boys and girls) varied, for example, by District Council, age of mother, country of birth of mother and month of registration.\n\nTop 10 baby names in Northern Ireland, 2017\n\n\nBoys:\n\n\nJames  – 243 Babies\n\nJack  – 226 Babies\n\nNoah  –  189 Babies\n\nCharlie  – 185 Babies\n\nJacob  – 180 Babies\n\nHarry  – 169 Babies\n\nThomas  – 158 Babies\n\nDaniel  – 147 Babies\n\nOliver  – 143 Babies\n\nLogan  – 125 Babies\n\nGirls:\n\nEmily  – 216 Babies\n\nGrace – 202 Babies\n\nOlivia  – 179 Babies\n\nIsla  – 153 Babies\n\nAnna  – 142 Babies\n\nSophie  – 132 Babies\n\nElla  – 128 Babies\n\nAmelia  – 127 Babies\n\nCharlotte  – 124 Babies\n\nSophia  – 121 Babies\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article36003102.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/RIDE%20PARADE%20%200025.jpg","title":"uniformed psni to take part in belfast pride parade for second year","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

And that’s why we are taking part.  \n\n\"From a hate crime perspective what we saw in the month of August was an increase in terms of reporting and I genuinely believe that out increased visibility and our participation enabled people to come forward and report incidents to police.\"\n\nAround 1% of PSNI staff are members are gay, while no members are registered as being transgender. \n\nThe PSNI has said it is actively seeking to increase diversity in its ranks, and will be undertaking recruitment activity during the event on Saturday. \n\nIn 2017, members of An Garda Siochana accepted an invitation to take part in the parade alongside the PSNI. \n\nThe Belfast Pride parade will take place on Saturday August 4 leaving Custom House at 1pm with build up starting from 11.30am. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople on Union Street for PRIDE.

Apps, sites and games continue to allow violent and sexual content to be accessed by children and sexual predators are free to roam their platforms, targeting and grooming young people.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Yui Mok/PA)\n\n\n\n\n“This lack of responsibility is why the legislation the Government has committed to must include a mandatory child safety code with an independent regulator to enforce consequences for those who don’t follow those rules.”\n\nFacebook’s new tools are similar to digital well-being features being introduced later this year by both Apple and Google to their mobile phone platforms.\n\nBoth, like Facebook, will show users how often they use their phone and the various apps, with time limits able to be set to help them cut down. \n\nMr Hatch said digital health is an “industry-wide issue” that requires an industry-wide response, and that there is an expectation on Facebook as a leader in the field, to be part of that response. \n\n“It’s not just about the time people spend on Facebook and Instagram but how they spend that time,” the Facebook blog post on the new tools said. \n\n“It’s our responsibility to talk openly about how time online impacts people – and we take that responsibility seriously. These new tools are an important first step, and we are committed to continuing our work to foster safe, kind and supportive communities for everyone.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"11 of arsenal rightback hector bellerins nattiest","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

The strategy is meant to prepare Zim mentally to accept fake presidential results.We’ve more votes than ED.We won the popular vote \u0026 will defend it !\n— Nelson Chamisa (@nelsonchamisa) \nAugust 1, 2018\n\n\n\n\n“We won the popular vote \u0026 will defend it!” Mr Chamisa tweeted on Wednesday.\n\nZimbabweans desperately hope the peaceful vote will lift them out of economic and political stagnation after decades of Mr Mugabe’s rule, but the country is haunted by a history of electoral violence and manipulation that means trust is scarce.\n\nWhile the electoral commission has five days from the end of voting to release the final tally, the national mood was growing anxious partly because unofficial results are already swirling on social media.\n\nThe opposition’s mood had dampened from Tuesday, when dozens of supporters gathered at their headquarters and celebrated in the belief that they had won the presidential election based on results they said they collected from agents in the field. \n\nAs they danced to music blasting from speakers set up on a truck, police with water cannon circulated nearby.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"storms force swimmer to suspend attempt to cross pacific","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

I’m not going to put thought into it. It is what it is, and that’s all.”\n\nThe swim was suspended on Friday. \n\nWhen the weather calms, his team plans to return to where Lecomte left off so he can resume his swim.\n\nThe typhoon season is under way in the Pacific, and three major storms were converging on the 20-metre (67ft) yacht. \n\nOne of them, Tropical Storm Jongdari, struck Japan last weekend.\n\nThe port call in Yokohama will also allow the team to repair an electric motor on a dinghy that escorts Lecomte as he swims.\n\nLecomte, who was born in France and lives in Austin, Texas, has been surprised by the volume of plastics and other rubbish that he has encountered, Seeker said. \n\nOne goal of the swim is to raise environmental awareness about the oceans.\n"}]
