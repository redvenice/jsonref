The remark is made in one of many terse conversations she has with an American film-maker, Chiara Brasi, who has come to the Philippines to shoot a movie based on her father’s experience in the 1970s of making a film about a notorious massacre of 1901.Magsalin reads Chiara’s script and objects not just to the accuracy of certain details and the viewpoints it adopts, but to the very motivation behind it. A Filipina translator and mystery writer on her first visit to her home country after many years in New York, she decides to put things right by writing her own script. In this jostle for primacy, narrative strands collide, history doubles back on itself, characters real and imagined merge into one version of events, only to be pulled apart again by Magsalin’s constant interrogation of Chiara’s – and her own – understanding of the history of the Philippines.As we follow the two women’s competing ideas on how and why we retell history, the question of whose version should take precedence gives way to a meditation on whether that story – or indeed any other – can make any real difference to our lives.At the heart of the novel lies the massacre of 30,000 Filipinos by American troops in Balangiga, in retaliation for the killing of 30 American soldiers in an uprising of nationalists (the notion of “insurrection” and the negative connotations of being an insurrecto as opposed to a freedom fighter is just one thing Magsalin objects to in Chiara’s script). One of these so-called insurrectos is the real life figure Casiana Nasionales, who becomes the protagonist in Magsalin’s script the fictional Cassandra Chase, an American who photographed the bodies of the murdered Filipinos, figures prominently in Chiara’s version. Who is the true protagonist? Which of the writers has the stronger claim to historical and cultural authenticity?To some extent the novel is tackling the issue of cultural appropriation, but it never ventures close to anything like a crass attempt at resolution, instead using the complexity of its narrative and thematic structure to hint at the difficulty in understanding the confluence of history, power and the inidual. None of it is designed to be easy for the reader, and the organisation of the novel constantly gives the impression of being in search of something that lies just beyond the grasp of total comprehension. “An abaca weave, a warp and weft of numbers, is measured but invisible in the plot. Chapter numbers double up. Puzzle pieces scramble. Points of view will multiply. Allusions, ditto.” In describing her film script, Magsalin is also describing the novel we are reading – a conscious articulation of the way Apostol is trying to reconfigure how we think of the historical novel.Insurrecto’s concern lies chiefly with the women’s motivations behind the telling of these stories rather than the detail or plotlines of the actual narratives. “The story Magsalin wishes to tell is about loss,” we are told quite plainly, and in this telling, “Any emblem will do”. But through the snippets of her experience, artfully yet movingly distributed through the novel, we learn more than enough to figure out that Magsalin’s motivations are not just political. “A poor and underfed student from the provinces,” Magsalin’s departure from her home country is expressed as an act of freedom, but her prolonged separation from the Philippines creates an anxiety within her that proves difficult to explain. Why was she unable to return, even when her mother was dying? Several times she recalls her mother’s last phone call. “Do not come home … I understand,” her mother says, but like Magsalin herself, we don’t fully comprehend the reasons for her staying away, and the novel’s energies hint at a deep-seated need to strip away the layers of the exile’s relationship with home and family.Loss and the inability fully to grasp what it means, or how grief can be healed, similarly lie behind Chiara’s movie project. She is haunted by the messiness of her parents’ marriage and the death of her film-maker father when she was very young.

What if the prime minister happened to be on the road when the four-minute warning came? The solution, decided the men from the ministry, was to issue the PM’s driver with a radio link, borrowed from the technology that the AA used to communicate with their mechanics on motorbikes. On receiving the alert, the driver would ert to the nearest public call box, whereupon the PM would phone Whitehall, pass on the nuclear codes, and escalate Armageddon. But what if neither the PM or his driver had the requisite coins to make a call from a phone box? After some back-and-forthing between various departments, Tim Bligh, the principal private secretary, came up with a ruling: if the PM found himself caught short, he should simply reverse the charges. By which time, you can’t help thinking, the four minutes would have passed, and Downing Street would be a handful of radioactive dust.Peter Hennessy has found this glorious moment of Ealing film comedy daftness buried deep in the national archives. But what makes him such a deft public historian is the way he stitches these patches of rich local colour into a narrative with the widest possible reach. Having dealt with the immediate postwar period in two of his previous books, Never Again: Britain 1945–51 (1992) and Having it so Good: Britain in the Fifties (2006), here he picks up his story in 1960, the moment Britain becomes modern. Don’t, though, expect a slack meander through the entire decade, stopping off at the usual staging posts: Profumo, the Pill, Beeching, Mary Quant, blah blah blah. What we have instead is a forensic look at the years from 1960 to 64, what one might call the low 60s, when everyone aged over 35 still wore a hat out of doors and fanned themselves theatrically with a copy of the Daily Herald if the thermometer looked as if it would go over 75F (24C).The Wind of Change was the name given to the speech that Conservative prime minister Harold Macmillan made in Cape Town when he acknowledged in 1960 that Britain could no longer stand in the way of its African colonies’ self-determination. Here, though, Hennessy tweaks and extends the phrase to cover every kind of social, political and economic gust blowing through Britain around the time of Philip Larkin’s “Annus Mirabilis” of 1963 when, in one of the poem’s lesser known lines, “every life became … a quite unlosable game”. Ironic, of course, because exactly the opposite was the case. No sooner had Britain acquired all those new motorways, hospitals, plate-glass universities and sexual freedoms than it became anguishingly clear that “every life” might be lost in a single afternoon of red-button madness.Still, Hennessy is careful not to simply rehash old historical paradigms. Many historians aiming to give a sense of the terror of living in the nuclear age fall back on the Cuban missile crisis of 1962. Hennessy, by contrast, lengthens the timescale and adjusts the point of view so that we start to see Britain not merely as a cowed bystander in the global arms race but as an active agent in its own nightmare. From the moment in 1957 when the RAF’s V force reached full operational strength, we effectively had radioactive skin in the game. Similarly, Hennessy shifts the likely flashpoint from Cuba to Berlin. Forget about Soviet gunboats chugging through the Caribbean. All it would have taken for the third world war to break out was for a particularly jittery East German border guard to attempt to halt a western military convoy somewhere along the autobahn leading from the free world to the partitioned city.It is entirely characteristic of Hennessy to leave space in this seismic account for the free play of inidual quirks. The Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev emerges as an oaf who could easily have postured his way into a third world war simply because he wanted to send a message to Mao Zedong about who was the biggest, baddest kid in the communist playground. Hennessy presents Harold Macmillan as a wounded war hero from the Somme – the old man still lived with a piece of Krupp ordnance buried in his thigh – who could never quite bring himself to trust the Germans since they were, he pointed out privately, the “people who have tried to destroy us twice in this century”. All the same, “Mac”, the unofficial hero of this book, was prepared to overlook his instincts about “the Teuton” if it meant advancing his grand design. This was an ambitious plan to position Britain as the hinge between the free world’s two great blocs. On the one hand was the Anglo-American alliance, the historical special relationship that had received such a boost during the recent war and was maintained under Eisenhower and, later Kennedy. On the other was a Europe that was forging itself into a bulwark against communism, and Britain’s relationship with it. Much as Germany still pained Mac literally, it made overwhelming sense for Britain to become fully European. It would take 10 years of hard bargaining, and a lot of undignified pleading with a hostile General de Gaulle, before the country was finally allowed to wave goodbye to Europe’s “outer seven” and join the central sextet at the top table. Oh, how badly we wanted it.Such is the length of this book – nearly 600 pages long – that it would be easy to slip and slide in the shale of detail. But Hennessy has such a keen associative eye and such a generous heart for the sheer oddness of everything that the narrative spins along like a comfortable chat. There is, for instance, Margaret Thatcher described by Mac in his diary as “a clever young woman MP”. At her first meeting with the great man after her promotion in 1961, she carefully chooses her “best outfit” in “sapphire blue” and announces that she wants to start her new job at the Ministry of Pensions immediately. Taken aback, and perhaps feeling sorry for the civil servants who are about to encounter their terrifying new boss, Mac drawls at her to wait until at least 11am the next morning before turning up at the office and then making a speedy exit – “I shouldn’t stay too long”. There are other wonderful cameos. Enoch Powell, so clever, so wrong, with a voice like “an air raid siren with a Birmingham accent”. And then there’s Reginald Maudling, the chancellor of the exchequer who, it transpires, liked to cut political meetings short in order to be in front of the television in time to watch Come Dancing.• Winds of Change: Britain in the Early Sixties is published by Allen Lane (£30).

Nominate your choice belowThis month on the reading group we’re going to have fun. The holiday season is drawing to a close, schools and colleges are starting again and the world is on fire. I’m not suggesting we hide from reality, but it might be useful to have something to offset the pain for a while. Think of it as a literary restorative.The form that tonic takes is entirely up to you. My first resources when it comes to fun books are always PG Wodehouse and Terry Pratchett and I’d be delighted to read either of them again. But we don’t have to choose something so explicitly humorous. There is plenty to be said for the warm glow that comes from reading a more quietly witty book such as Fup by Jim Dodge. Equally, we could go for something more noisily exuberant, such as Angela Carter’s Nights at the Circus, or something plain and beautiful, such as EL Carr’s A Month in the Country.Or we could lean the other way, into the caustic wit of an Elizabeth Taylor or the ghostly chill of a Shirley Jackson. Maybe your idea of fun is experiencing a gigantic Iain M Banks space opera or immersing yourself in the imagination of Ursula K Le Guin. Maybe it’s getting to the beating heart of a Zadie Smith or Michael Ondaatje novel. Perhaps it’s just the thrill of reading something as linguistically impressive as Virginia Woolf. This could even be an opportunity to revisit Dickens. (There are few greater pleasures in literature than the arrival on the scene of Betsey Trotwood, after all.)Or at least, that’s my opinion. But now it’s up to you. Any book that you regard as fun is fair game and nominating is easy. Just add the title in the comments below – if you can also provide reasons, so much the better.

Washington and Beijing have ratcheted up the tariffs they impose on each other’s goods, while Donald Trump spooked markets last week by demanding that US companies repatriate their operations from China. Central banks around the world have come under pressure to ease monetary policy to provide more support as the global economy feels the strain of falling trade volumes and weaker investment by increasingly cautious businesses. Trump is demanding the US Federal Reserve cuts interest rates, as fears grow over an economic slowdown in the US.Britain recorded the first monthly trade surplus in more than eight years in June amid a plunge in imports, as UK companies eased back from stockpiling goods from abroad. British firms had rushed to buy goods from the EU and elsewhere in the lead-up to the original 29 March Brexit deadline, leading to an imports surge and pushing the UK trade deficit – the gap between imports and exports – to the highest levels on record. Now running down their supplies rather than placing new orders, imports have fallen. Over the three months to June, imports plunged by £18bn. The UK goods and services trade balance was in surplus by £1.8bn in June, after a deficit of £2bn in May, beating the forecasts of City economists.Boris Johnson is on course to overshoot the government’s budget target by at least £8bn this year after extra spending on the NHS and preparations for a no-deal Brexit cut the surplus in July. The public finances were down by £2.2bn compared with July 2018 to leave a £1.3bn surplus last month, worse than had been expected by City analysts. Alongside January, July is typically a surplus month because iniduals make their self-assessment returns in those months. However, the surplus was smaller than expected due to rises in central government spending, much of it on salaries, as Whitehall departments stepped up hiring to cope with Brexit. The weaker position in the public finances comes as Johnson pledges to raise spending across the board, on areas such as police, defence, the NHS and Brexit planning.Mounting fears of no-deal Brexit appear to have dragged down house prices across the country last month, as families showed an increasing reluctance to moving home amid the political turmoil. A gauge of house prices from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors – which shows the difference between members reporting price rises and falls – dropped to -9 in July from -1 in June, a steeper decline than had been forecast by City economists. According to official figures, house prices in the south of England are falling for the first time since 2009, amid a broader slowdown across the country since the Brexit vote.Supporters of Brexit argue that leaving the EU would enable the UK to strike new trade deals elsewhere around the world. However, conditions for global trade have deteriorated significantly in recent months as the US-China trade war rages. The escalation of the long-running dispute between Washington and Beijing has sunk factory output around the world and dragged down business investment, with companies reluctant to spend while the world’s two biggest economic superpowers impose tariffs on one another’s goods. According to surveys of global factory output compiled by IHS Markit, the tensions have tipped world manufacturing into recession territory. Economic growth has slowed in several countries, including in the US and the eurozone, as fears mount of a global recession. Economists warn that leaving the EU – which is the world’s largest free trading bloc – into an increasingly protectionist world could further damage the UK economy.

If not, the CMA must intervene to ensure that pricing guidelines are followed.”An Iceland spokeswoman said: “We update our promotions throughout the year to offer the best possible value to our customers, and review our approach to pricing structures to ensure savings to the customer are as transparent as possible.“We have incorporated the findings shared by Which? into this process and will continue to review and improve our promotional calendar.”Tom Ironside, the director of business and regulation at the British Retail Consortium, said: “Supermarkets seek to provide the best value for consumers on the hundreds of thousands of product lines they sell. This is often through promotions and discounts, which can change week to week, even on the same product lines, as retailers seek to cut the cost for shoppers.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dce2b6c5d881a7abac4fcd57efc7768de7cb01ca/0_402_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7903c1fd03d4585465a8bece1469e6cc","title":"faith and freelancers why churches are turning into co working spaces","story":"Slick flexible working spaces are everywhere, but faith organizations offer a more basic service – with some unconventional benefitsLast summer, Ted Henken, a 47-year-old sociology professor at Baruch College, New York, was searching for somewhere to get some work done when he passed a sign advertising a co-working space. Although there is no shortage of these in Manhattan, this one was different: the sign was outside a 90-year-old Lutheran church. Henken was intrigued, but wary if he joined, would someone try to convert him?Curiosity, a sticker price of a $5 or $10 suggested donation and convenience won out. The unhip mess hall-esque kitchen of Our Savior’s Atonement (OSA) with its red concrete floor and farmhouse-style cabinets became Henken’s summer workspace.Their offer tends to be low-cost and homey – a distinct alternative to the more slick and corporate offerings of established brands such as The Wing and WeWork. The downsides to church working? There is generally no dedicated spaces for phone calls, storage, mail access or printing services, all of which are offered by WeWork and its ilk. For some users, those are minor inconveniences when you consider that rates for the WeWork closest to OSA start at $430 per month and go up to $850 for private access.OSA’s co-working program was inspired by St Lydia’s, a Lutheran “dinner church” located in a storefront on Bond Street in Brooklyn’s Gowanas neighborhood. With its Shaker-style chairs, mismatched mugs and colorful aprons lining the back wall, St Lydia’s looks as though it could be a farm-to-table restaurant or a rustic bakery. In reality, it’s where churchgoers gather for a meal, a homily and worship every Sunday and Monday evening. From 2014 until March this year, it also ran a co-working space. Costing from $80 per month for part-time use to $240 for full-time use, it attracted a group of around 25 workers, ranging from a remote-working day trader looking for space to scan the markets to an artist needing a paint-free place to tackle administrative tasks.St Lydia’s founding pastor, Emily Scott, believed that co-working was an extension of the church’s mission “to dispel isolation and reconnect neighbors.”St Lydia’s has now decided to end its co-working program, but for others the idea appeals as an answer to the perennial problem faced by congregant-and-cash-starved urban religious communities: how to build and sustain a faith community while paying the bills? Financing a church in decline can be close to impossible. Each year in the US 6,000 to 10,000 churches close each year and donations to congregations have been dropping for decades.For some, the answer is not to run their own co-working space but instead to rent out unused areas to co-working companies. In Dallas, the basement of White Rock United Methodist Church is home to the Mix, a flexible space for workers in the creative industries. For $150 a month members are given full-time access to a dance studio, conference room, sewing station and artist’s studio.Daryn DeZengotita, founder of the Mix and SyncLife Coworking at Central Christian Church in Dallas, Texas, believes the key to a successful program is cohesion between sacred and secular spaces. “At Central, we are using a model that can more readily be replicated by any church: leveraging existing space, furnishings and staff and recognizing the co-working space as a ministry of the church rather than a separate entity within the building.”This chimes with Scott’s experience at St Lydia’s – and she warns that opening a co-working space is not as simple as some might think. “There’s this misconception: ‘Oh, this will be easy because we have space and we’ll just open it and we’ll put out some desks and people will use it.’ You really have to have events happening to call people back to the space.” At St Lydia’s, that mean a shared weekly lunch and activities such as meditation.Since he first discovered OSA, Henken has learned his child attends the same school as Flack’s and the pair attended a community meeting together to help migrants separated at the border. Is that sense of connection enough to keep him co-working at OSA? “I guess two things draw me in: the desire to have a community of connection and the open-minded attitude of the pastor and staff,” he says. “However, I’m still a bit wary of getting too close to organized religion. So we’ll see how it goes.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe1247ea24eba80745a27f111e5326b01781b8e1/0_72_3742_2246/master/3742.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3a926c0d0b3ed6bb2053580f2849f2a0","title":"labour hard brexit pro eu vision corbyn","story":"Boris Johnson is not a skilful manager, except of expectations. He impressed dignitaries at the G7 summit in Biarritz with a capacity for seriousness that used to come as standard in prime ministers. Johnson sets the bar low, then clears it. He steered a traditional British diplomatic course between Europe and the US. His style is a flattering tribute to Donald Trump but on the substance – Russia, Iran, the climate emergency – the UK still sides with Germany and France. That balancing act will be harder outside the EU, and the messier the Brexit, the wobblier the tightrope.Johnson needs a trade deal with Washington. It is the totem pole around which Tory Eurosceptics perform their frenzied anti-Brussels war dances. But Trump does not distinguish between commerce and state power. He will set the price of a deal at total loyalty in foreign affairs and surrender to US corporate interests. The UK must switch regulatory and strategic alignment from European to US standards, and thereby forfeit privileged access to the vast market on its doorstep. Few Brexiteers understand what that means in practice. The UK voice will be heard in Brussels from the wrong side of a closed door – and in Washington from the end of a tight leash. That is what a hard Brexit looks like once the bombastic rhetoric is stripped away. Theresa May worried that the price was too high Johnson doesn’t care. This dramatic pivot in Britain’s global orientation is easily overlooked because the contrast in political style between the new prime minister and his predecessor is more conspicuous. May was ready to swallow the Northern Irish backstop because she was not horrified by the prospect of perpetual European alignment that it implied. For Johnson, ending that alignment is the whole point.Continental leaders perceive the shift better than many in Westminster. The debate in Britain is consumed by the question of whether a no-deal Brexit can be averted, which is understandable given the pain involved. MPs have poured energy into procedural innovation. Some dream of exotic coalitions, but a more feasible short-term fix, judging by the result of cross-party talks on Tuesday, is the erection of legislative crash barriers to stop the UK flying off a cliff on 31 October. That would be a remarkable achievement, considering the old tribal enmities that had to be overcome simply to convene a meeting in the Labour leader’s office. There is no doubt about the determination of opposition parties (and a handful of Tory rebels) to slay the no-deal dragon. The missing component is any suggestion of what UK-EU relations should look like if they succeed.In Brussels the orderliness of the transition also matters. With Johnson in Downing Street, no deal and a last-minute deal are correctly understood to be rocky and smooth roads to the same destination. The UK has finally chosen from the menu of possible future relationships that Michel Barnier depicted back in 2017 as a staircase descending from membership, via Norway and Switzerland to WTO terms.It is to be a Canadian-style free trade deal. Talks to get there can begin promptly, on friendly terms if the UK accepts some kind of backstop for Northern Ireland and pays the money it owes to the EU budget. Otherwise there will be a pointless, messy, bitter interlude followed by much tougher negotiations.Those are the options that Johnson has created for himself and either way the outcome is the same. The UK sets itself up as a vast tax haven and tries to poach investment away from its neighbours with low wages and lax regulators. Brussels, determined to avoid having such a piratical marketplace on its doorstep, demands “level playing field” provisions in any trade deal. The UK resists. Talks are bogged down for years, during which British living standards stagnate or decline. It is not a good model but, with a bit of spin, it is a concept that most Tories can rally around and sell in an election: the classic Eurosceptic myth of buccaneering Albion, sailing to liberty on the open Atlantic after decades of captivity in a grotty Belgian harbour.What is the opposition’s alternative? Jeremy Corbyn positions himself as standard-bearer for resistance to a no-deal Brexit – but that is a rearguard action, not a forward march. The Labour leader’s primary goal is power, to which end he needs the support of pro-European MPs and remain voters in the country. Fear of upsetting that constituency has brought him to reluctant endorsement of a second referendum, but not yet to any declaration of enthusiasm for the EU. If Corbyn has a strategic concept of Britain’s place in the world today, he is not sharing it. His sparse forays into the technical side of Brexit are marked by hostility to Brussels rules on state aid and competition. If he ever found himself trying to negotiate a deal with that as a red line, he would encounter the same level playing field problem that makes Johnson’s deregulation fantasy hard to enact in practice.Labour isions over Europe can be hard to discern in the melee of factional vendetta and bickering over tactics. Corbynism itself contains an ideological tension over the EU. There is a moderate view that values the European project as a historic expression of international solidarity, and a hardline tendency that sees Brussels rules as an impediment to socialist autarky. Labour remainers see the EU as a way for many states to regulate global markets with clout that lone nations cannot muster. Radical left Eurosceptics think the whole enterprise is infested with profiteering capitalism.Before he became leader, Corbyn’s instincts lay with the sceptics – and there is no reason to think they have changed. In the middle are MPs who were pro-European once, but too afraid of their pro-Brexit constituents to make the case.Those cracks are papered with opposition to no deal. Being against the worst possible outcome allows the Labour leader to make hostile noises in the general direction of Brexit without opposing the thing itself. He raises his voice against Johnson’s way so no one can accuse him of complicity, but there is no Labour policy to save EU membership, nor any effort from the leader to argue that doing so might serve UK interests.The Tories like to denounce Corbyn as a remainer and Labour’s pro-Europeans wish he would be one – so the opposition leader gets to hide in plain sight, as he has done since 2016. He talks around the subject without saying anything meaningful about it. He stands adjacent to the biggest strategic question facing the country for a generation without grabbing hold of it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2257f290748139bf807967847b7f8313b78d6c38/263_0_5394_3237/master/5394.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=003afb5439c4176b23cc4e171760914c","title":"highschoolers phones yondr distraction","story":"Soon more than 1,000 schools nationwide will be using Yondr, a pouch that students lock their phones in during classPut your cellphone away. Stop texting. Stop using the camera as a mirror. Stop looking at Instagram. They’re the familiar commands of teachers and educators in the age of the smartphone.Most schools have put in place policies banning or regulating phone usage during school hours, and teachers now routinely find themselves confiscating devices or writing up students for being on their phones.Educators are now exploring more drastic measures. This school year, more than 1,000 schools nationwide will be using Yondr, a pouch system that allows students to lock away their phones while they’re in class. Each morning when students arrive at school, they magnetically lock their devices into their own personal green and gray pouches. They maintain possession of their pouches and devices, but they cannot unlock it until the end of the day, when they tap it on an unlocking magnet station located throughout the school.The concept is not new. Musicians and performers have been using Yondr to prevent people from filming their gigs since the San Francisco-based company launched in 2014. But in recent years, more and more schools have begun using the pouches to keep kids off their phones during school hours, with dozens in the Bay Area alone. “Demand has tripled this year,” the Yondr spokeswoman Kelly Taylor said.Allison Silvestri, the former principal of San Lorenzo high school east of San Francisco, implemented the tool three years ago. The results “were tremendous”, she said. The students were paying attention more in class. The school saw a decrease in referrals for defiance and disrespect. “It was just so powerful to hear students interacting with each other and interacting with adults on campus,” she said.Edward Huang, 16, was part of a pilot program that tested Yondr at San Mateo high school before launching it this school year. He has mixed feelings about Yondr. He’s noticed a difference in his peers. “People aren’t distracted,” he said. “Even people who were on their phones in minor ways, like checking the time and checking notifications, those minor ways add up and have an effect on how engaged you are. Socially, it has improved us. Even if it’s all of us talking about how much we hate it, having something to hate is a conversation topic.”But he’s already heard about issues some kids have had because they couldn’t check their phones. Employers have tried to get in touch with students during the day, and couldn’t.Students have also figured out ways to hack the pouch. A few days ago, someone started an Instagram account that showcased ways to break the Yondr, said Audrey Morganstern, a 16-year-old junior at San Mateo high school. “There was footage of them breaking the pin in the Yondr that controls the bag’s magnet” she said. Morganstern is a fan, however, likening Yondr to “training wheels for people that want to get off their phone”.“There are some people that I might not have been as close to that I’ve had some pretty cool conversations with because before I might have had my phone as a crutch to avoid awkward situations,” she said. Leadership high school in San Francisco started using Yondr this year, but allow students the opportunity to unlock their pouches at lunchtime, said Beth Silbergeld, the school’s principal. She liked the concept of Yondr because the responsibility for the phones remained on the students. “We are not in education to confiscate and manage property,” she said. “Even some schools that use a system that checks the phones into a box, it becomes a huge responsibility for the teachers.”Some teachers have struggled to implement Yondr, just as some students have struggled to adhere by it and have found ways to hack the magnet lock, Silbergeld said.“Our sophomores believe (this program) is because of them,” she said. “They say, ‘We were so bad so you did this.’ But this was a decade of noticing that something wasn’t working and the efforts we were making of asking students to put their phones away and taking some of their phones away weren’t working.”At Berkeley high school, the freshman class is trying a Yondr pilot program this year, but the rest of the school is still operating as usual. School policy states that students cannot have their phones out during class, and Angela Coppola, who teaches 10th and 11th grade history, confiscated up to six phones a class last year.“Adults struggle with the addictive nature of this technology, so you have to have compassion for children who have grown up with this technology,” she said. Coppola would support an effort to get students to go device free for the day. In her 11 years teaching, she said she’s seen the toll constant communication taken on her students. “If you talk to any teacher, we’ve all noticed in the past five years, we’ve definitely seen a spike in anxiety,” she said.“The technology is so persuasive,” Coppola said. “How can we expect people who are still developing to have stronger willpower than actual adults? We can’t.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6dfcca9d879b974c4c42738f490bd5c247014c03/0_236_3543_2126/master/3543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=17caa3bd9c69114ed8f0e60998f5cc92","title":"leaked documents reveal tories dramatic plans for schools","story":"Exclusive: crackdown on behaviour coupled with more money for schools and teachersA raft of dramatic and controversial education measures including billions of pounds in new funding, a crackdown on student behaviour and a further wave of free schools are to be announced by the government within days, according to a confidential briefing paper seen by the .The briefing document, dated 22 August and marked “Official-Sensitive”, details policy proposals for schools in England designed to be rolled out over the coming weeks in an attempt to seize the initiative on education before a possible autumn election.While proposals including a £3.5bn funding announcement and plans to increase teachers’ basic pay may be broadly welcomed, there will be concern in some quarters over a package of disciplinary measures that include a renewed emphasis on exclusions and allowing teachers to use “reasonable force” to improve behaviour.The paper, which is under discussion between Gavin Williamson’s Department for Education (DfE) and No 10, is understood to have been inserted into the government “grid” of announcements, as families prepare for the new school year in England.The headline figures include £2.8bn for primary and secondary schools up to the age of 16, including £800m for children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND). The details for an extra £800m for sixth form and further education colleges are still under discussion with the Treasury.The main proposals in the package include:Any additional funding is likely to be welcomed by school leaders, although many will want to wait until they see how much of the headline figure has been “reprioritised” from the DfE’s previous spending commitments.Aside from funding, the DfE paper includes a major focus on poor behaviour in schools, said to be driven by No 10’s view that recent polling has shown strong public support for policies taking a tougher line.The announcements will include explicit support for headteachers who use “reasonable force” in their efforts to improve discipline.“This government backs headteachers to improve behaviour and will support them to create safe and disciplined school environments,” the document states.“We will back heads to use powers to promote good behaviour including sanctions and rewards using reasonable force to search and confiscate items from pupils (including mobile phones) impose same-day detentions suspend and expel pupils ban mobile phones.”While the DfE expects members of the public will welcome “a harder narrative on discipline”, the document warns key stakeholders will be worried the policy could result in increased rates of permanent exclusion, which have in any case been climbing since 2012.The document notes police and crime commissioners “worry about rates of exclusion driving knife crime” and acknowledges concerns it will impact disproportionately on children from some ethnic minority backgrounds, in particular black Caribbean boys, and those with special educational needs (SEN).The success of the Michaela free school in GCSE results last week is likely to be used by ministers to promote its behaviour policies, while four “behaviour tsars” are to be named, including Charlie Taylor, the former head of a school for children with SEN and the current chair of the Youth Justice Board for England and Wales.While recent coverage of school funding cuts has included widespread reporting about teaching assistants being axed and headteachers’ concerns about the detrimental impact on classrooms, the briefing paper reveals – on the contrary – that Downing Street and the Treasury are more concerned there may be too many TAs rather than too few.The Treasury “firmly” rejected a radical attempt to improve recruitment by making teacher training courses free for students. But it appears more enthusiastic about a scheme to reimburse trainee teachers for their student loans.A DfE spokesperson said: “We do not recognise these figures. The prime minister has made clear that we will increase minimum levels of per pupil funding in primary and secondary schools and make real terms increases to education funding. We will be announcing more details in due course.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f153a88aaf7448daa58f80a867b60548a5d437f3/0_0_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0d6beccde0981ddb8932eb09e6ac7230","title":"share your thoughts on the proposed education measures","story":"Whether you are a teacher, school leader or work in education, we would like to hear from you A confidential briefing paper seen by the  reveals education measures including disciplinary changes to improve behaviour and increase pay for teachers.The document, marked “Official-Sensitive”, includes plans to increase teachers’ basic pay to £30,000 by 2022, open a new wave of free schools and encourage school leaders to confiscate or ban mobile phones, allowing teachers to use “reasonable force” to curb bad behaviour.If you are a teacher, school leader or work in education we would like to know your thoughts on the proposals.What do you think of the proposed measures?

Other dolphin tours that interact with different species of dolphin in other parts of the country are still permitted.Alongside banning tourist swims with bottlenose dolphins, DoC have stipulated that tour operators may interact with the dolphins only for periods of 20 minutes (reduced from 30 minutes) at a time, and all tour operators will be restricted to visiting either morning or afternoon, in order to provide a block of time where the dolphins are left alone.The possibility of creating a marine mammal sanctuary in the Bay of Islands is also being investigated by DoC, research partners and local Māori tribes.Tour operators in the Bay of Plenty have raised concerns about the impact the new ban will have on tourism numbers, and said less tour operators on the water will mean fewer eyes watching out for how private boats interact with the vulnerable population.Tourists can still swim with common or dusky dolphins in tours operated in the South Island."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8fd4fd1e44d5e2c294e74af580c252f5b6a83c25/213_1543_6529_3917/master/6529.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2e30340f6d4f80abf98a08a96d776811","title":"why stella tennant wants you to stop buying new clothes","story":"The model explains why she is joining forces with Oxfam for Second Hand September – a campaign that aims to reduce the environmental impact of fast fashion With September for some a month of heightened consumption, it might not be the easiest ask. As the heat turns to cool, it can be a time to think about a new coat, to ponder the new-season woollen offering and whether you ought to invest in a new pair of boots.But new clothes come with a cost about which we can no longer claim ignorance – there is no avoiding the ways in which the fashion industry threatens the planet. Especially this month, as Extinction Rebellion gears up to disrupt the source of so many trends with protests planned for London fashion week.For Tennant, who first appeared on the cover of Vogue in 1993 and has stalked down catwalks for Chanel and Jean Paul Gautier during her career: “It’s going to take us a long time to change our habits, but I think that this is so obviously a step in the right direction,” she says over the phone from what sounds like a breezy Scotland.For her, the next generation – her daughter’s, for instance – will be able to change their shopping habits more easily. Iris already visits charity shops and it can’t hurt that she has a secondhand treasure trove that most other teens couldn’t even dream of, thanks to her mum. “It looks different on them when they’re wearing clothes I’ve had since the 90s,” says Tennant. “I’m so pleased I kept them and they’re having a second outing.”The charity shops near where she lives are great on cashmere jumpers, while her favourite secondhand garment is an emerald green Yves Saint Laurent shirt from the 70s that she bought in a vintage shop on holiday.With Second Hand September, Oxfam is hoping to make a dent. There is already something of a silver lining: the clothes that Oxfam saves from landfill every year weigh as much as the Eiffel Tower. For Tennant, it is a fun challenge for people to take on. Of course, as she puts it, “the fashion industry really is all about creating a desire that you didn’t even know you had”. This is about trying to counter that desire, or, at the very least, look to secondhand instead.To find out more about Oxfam’s Second Hand September campaign and pledge to buy second hand fashion for 30 days go to po.stSecondHandSeptember"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/191205732edd59824b8b6e69c436b7ac6a30f5d1/1_0_5330_3200/master/5330.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a65295270fc0ae6e3d2ec10cd8cd737","title":"it made a great corpse bride costume meet the women recycling and reusing their wedding dresses","story":"Many women are refusing to retire their bridal gowns to the back of the wardrobe, in favour of wearing them again or repurposing them.  readers reveal what they did with theirs Catherine O’Nolan wears her wedding dress every year on her anniversary, regardless of where she is or what she is doing. That meant she once wore it on a ferry. She has also worn it to walk the dog on the beach near her home in Suffolk. She has eaten fish and chips in it, cut the grass in it, flown to Dublin in it. It’s not just any old frock made by the bridal specialist Jenny Packham, there is no mistaking what it is. Strangely, she says, nobody ever says a word.O’Nolan is one of a number of women who refuse to consign their wedding dresses to the back of the wardrobe – whether by repurposing them, recycling them or simply reusing them as they are. Some are building in flexibility ahead of the wedding, opting for outfits that will transition smoothly from aisle or register office to boardroom or holiday. After all, single-use dresses are bad for the environment and the bank balance, with the average British wedding dress last year costing nearly £1,400.Anita Gera was one of those who answered our call for stories about reusing wedding clothes. She got married in Copenhagen in 2006, and has continued to wear the constituent parts of her outfit – a tunic, trousers and dupatta (a long scarf) – to parties, although the marriage is now over. On a recent mini-cruise with her mum to Hamburg, a gala night provided an opportunity to wear the whole ensemble. It helps that it is bright red. “I grew up in India,” she explains, “so, to me, white is the colour of funerals and red is the colour you wear for joyous occasions.” While she wouldn’t wear her outfit in India, she felt comfortable on the cruise ship: “I know it’s my wedding outfit but to most people it will just look like some glamorous Bollywood-style outfit.”Sophie Pollard also bought an outfit she could wear again. Having met her wife at primary school in the Somerset village of Westbury-sub-Mendip, she married her in the local register office last year. She found the navy dress decorated with sunflowers for £14 on the internet it has seen outings to the dental laboratory (where she makes false teeth), as well as to a friend’s wedding where she was “best man” – she paired it with a black jacket to “jazz it up a bit”.Sanji, who married in 2017, has already reworn the lehenga (full ankle-length skirt) she wore then and plans to bring out her entire outfit later this month for a teej party, a traditional Nepali festival where women dress up, often in red.It can’t come too soon for the Dublin-based sustainability advocate Emma Gleeson. While much of the world is paring back in the name of the planet, she says, “the wedding thing seems to be getting more and more extreme”. For evidence, see the growing trend for multiple wedding outfits, as worn by the Duchess of Sussex and the singer Solange Knowles. For her own wedding, Gleeson settled on a white dress with a pattern on it. Not only did she want something she could wear again, but she disliked much of the culture surrounding wedding dresses. “I could see how bad my friends were made to feel by the shopping experience – people saying: ‘Oh well, you’ll be a size smaller by the time you wear this’ … horrible things like that.”Lesley Kazan-Pinfield was rejecting this kind of talk as long ago as 1980, when she wore a pair of homemade dungarees to get married at Truro register office. She continued to wear them until they fell apart.Other women find ways to recycle their dresses, beyond handing them down or selling them. It was only a week or two after her wedding in Burnley, 16 years ago, that Shaista got a call about a woman who lived in her mum’s old neighbourhood in Pakistan. Her husband had just died. “She had three or four young children. In Pakistan, there’s no welfare state, so Mum rang me saying: ‘Can you contribute anything? I’m having a whip-round.’”Shaista decided to donate her wedding dress. When it made it to the woman, “She just burst into tears – she saw it as ‘I’m going to be less reliant’” than if she had just been given some one-off money. The woman began charging people to borrow it for the day as Shaista describes it, it was “a micro-business for her, a wedding dress for those who could never afford to buy”.There are a number of charities that use old gowns for new purposes. When Georgia Keogh-Horgan got married in 2013 in a secondhand dress from eBay, she thought that it might be something a future child would be able to wear. Tragically, her son died just hours after birth, but she found a charity called Cherished Gowns that turned wedding dresses into funeral gowns for babies. “I think my wedding dress has been made into 11 gowns and little nappies. Babies who are born very small don’t always have nappies that fit,” she explains. “When your baby dies, you still want to dress them normally … Little things like that are quite important.”The repurposing of wedding outfits fits in with today’s fashion for crafts – sales of sewing machines have risen, and YouTube is now full of tutorials on how to knit hats and darn socks. But it has been going on for decades. When Lyn Armstrong got married in Sheffield in 1971, she didn’t have any preconceived notions of recycling her dress. Then, a few years later and six months pregnant, she needed an outfit for a dinner dance and didn’t want to buy something that she would probably never wear again. So she set to work turning her wedding dress into something inspired by Mary Quant. It seemed, she says, a “very appropriate fate for a wedding dress to become a maternity garment”.For her part, Mia Smith turned a section of her wedding dress into a stole when she was ordained as an Anglican priest in 2013, as well as fashioning others into christening gowns for her grandchildren. Ann Hill turned her wedding dress into a tennis outfit when money was short in the 1970s, while Angela Lorenz, a contemporary artist, cut her wedding dress up “for art”. Pieces of it are now in the British Library and other museums around the world.Rachael Falkner, who got married in Oxfordshire in 1990, discovered that her wedding dress was starting to yellow. So, a couple of years ago, after much pestering, she agreed to let her daughter use it as a corpse bride Halloween costume. “My friends were shocked. One described it as like using 100-year-old wine for beef bourguignon.” But “it made a great costume and we’ve had a good laugh out of it”.And then there are reuses that deliver much-needed catharsis. Lucy Morgan’s white wedding dress stayed in the loft for a long time after her wedding in 2002. But the year she got orced and turned 50, she retrieved it and dyed it green. It was a meaningful move for her: “New life, new growth,” she explains.Melanie Renn got married in the Appalachians in 1984. Twenty years into the marriage her husband left her. “I loved that dress and I’m sure I could have worn it again,” she says. Instead, she gave it to his new girlfriend, who was “thrilled”. The decision was an impulse but Renn stands by it: “I couldn’t bear to look at it any more. Everything that reminded me of him had to go.” It was, she says, the “best repurpose ever”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6298284385878bd5d65f0b9d918f406e64f3a28f/0_284_5832_3499/master/5832.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=071c5e0b84ad53a0ceafcad389f45f08","title":"bury and bolton two of englands oldest clubs face tuesday expulsion","story":"Collapse of 11th-hour rescue deal on Tuesday night puts club’s future in grave doubtA day that began with optimism ended in despair, disbelief and fury in Bury as one of England’s oldest football clubs was kicked out of the English Football League (EFL) after 125 years.The future of Bury FC was plunged into grave doubt after the 134-year-old club was expelled from the league at 11pm on Tuesday, hours after the collapse of an 11th-hour rescue dealThirteen miles away, the fate of Bolton Wanderers also looked increasingly perilous as the club was given 14 days to save its membership in a league it helped found in 1888. The process of closing down the club could begin as early as Wednesday.There was widespread shock and demands for reform of football governance when Bury’s dramatic expulsion was announced by the EFL, which described it as “undoubtedly one of the darkest days in the league’s recent history”.It is understood that the EFL rejected late pleas for Bury to be given a 24-hour extension to its deadline, up to 5pm on Wednesday, to thrash out a deal between the owner Steve Dale and two new potential bidders after a sale to the data company C\u0026ampN Sporting Risk fell through shortly before Tuesday’s deadline.Ivan Lewis, the independent MP for Bury South, said the expulsion was a “devastating blow to us all” and that securing the club’s future was “now a massively uphill struggle and to give people false hope would be unfair”.“On the other hand, we can’t afford to leave any stone unturned and the fight goes on,” he said.Lewis said Dale had agreed in principle to sell the club to a potential owner before 5pm but that the EFL refused to allow more time for a deal to be done: “That’s one of the issues we want to discuss with the league as a matter of great urgency … But all options remain open to us – the fans, the council, the MPs – and we’re not going to lie down and die.”Hundreds of volunteers gathered at Bury’s Gigg Lane stadium earlier in the day, scrubbing toilets and cleaning the stands in the hope the club would survive and play its delayed first game of the season on Saturday.Those hopes were dashed when the English Football League announced shortly before 5pm that the late takeover deal had collapsed, as crowds of anxious fans, some in tears, gathered outside the ground.The fate of Bury and Bolton, two of the oldest clubs in English football, has fuelled calls for a complete overhaul of the rules and regulations governing the sport in Britain.Outside Gigg Lane, Clive Roberts, 73, said he had travelled 7,000 miles from his home in Canada hoping to watch his beloved club’s first few games of the season “only to find I was attending a wake”.Roberts said his great grandfather watched Bury win the FA Cup in 1903, while his own father played for the RAF team at Gigg Lane during the second world war. “I hoped my own grandchildren would be coming here in years to come – that’s not going to be the case,” he said.“The family will lose that link to Bury and lose what the history of the area means. It’s a very emotional day – I’m trying to hold it in. It maybe hasn’t hit home yet but it will.”Greg Edyvean, 38, has had a season ticket at Gigg Lane since he was six weeks old. He continued the tradition with his own two children, now aged 12 and two.As the news of the deal’s collapse filtered through, Edyvean was allowed to sit alone in his regular seat inside the stadium. “I’ve been sat there for the best part of two hours in tears,” he said. “It’s my favourite place on earth and it could be the last time it happens. It’s horrific. There’s not words to describe it.”Some volunteers drove 300 miles to take part in the clean-up operation, with plumbers, bricklayers, electricians all chipping in alongside fans of rival clubs including Leeds United, Accrington Stanley and Blackpool.Carrying her gloves, bucket and sponge, 72-year-old Joan Lingard was cleaning the stadium’s seats by 9am on Tuesday. It would be “absolutely awful” for Bury if its club disappeared, she said. “Everybody’s come down, whether they come to the matches or not. I’d hate to see it go. Next to Bury black puddings, this is the next thing, Gigg Lane. The two are synonymous.”Ian Frazer, 48, a Leeds fan, joined the clean-up, motivated by the financial crisis experienced by his own club 12 years ago. Wearing a Leeds shirt while scrubbing pigeon droppings off Bury’s Manchester Road stand, Frazer said: “It’s simple stuff like this that’s fantastic to see – all the kids here. I kind of welled up when I got here.“It’s very, very moving in many ways. To see this reaction from Bury supporters, from people who live in the town who maybe aren’t football fans. This is a tremendous outpouring of community spirit. I’ll be honest, out of adversity over the last few weeks and months this town has really shown its strength.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6b314a9c3f0b57c1aa454dbed7be766999562a9/0_85_5456_3273/master/5456.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d0156f30d2a74c03fb9a55125cb26f18","title":"fans uefa final tickets human rights record","story":"A coalition of Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and Tottenham supporter groups has called on Uefa to improve the experience of fans at European finals and to avoid awarding showpiece occasions to countries with questionable human-rights records.Liverpool and Tottenham fans were awarded only 33,286 of the 68,000 tickets for last season’s Champions League final in Madrid and complications were caused by the Europa League final between Arsenal and Chelsea being held in Baku, with many supporters staying away because of the cost and inconvenience of the 2,500-mile journey to Azerbaijan.There was further outrage when Arsenal’s Henrikh Mkhitaryan did not travel to Baku because of fears over his safety. The Armenia midfielder pulled out after deciding it was too risky to travel to Azerbaijan amid the conflict between the countries over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region.With the draw for the Champions League group stage to take place in Monaco on Thursday and the one for the Europa League on Friday, the Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham supporters’ trusts and the Liverpool fan group Spirit of Shankly have urged Uefa to place the needs of supporters over sponsors.The groups said football would be nothing without fans and demanded Uefa stage finals in cities with good transport links and stadiums with large capacities, plus suitable accessibility for supporters with disabilities. Large numbers of disabled supporters of Arsenal and Chelsea chose not to travel to Baku.The groups said in a statement: “Reaching a Champions League or Europa League final should be a wonderful experience for a club’s supporters. Instead, they can face a struggle just to attend the match. Problems range from inadequate numbers of tickets being awarded to the finalists through to all-but-impossible travel arrangements. Too often fans who had supported their clubs in every round up to the final were left out of pocket or not able to attend the final at all.“Tomorrow’s much hyped draw will involve everybody from the football family except the very people without whom there would be no European football – its supporters. We call on Uefa to strengthen its dialogue with fans and request they start by engaging with groups like ourselves to discuss the proposals we have put forward.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb1c21fe411817b67626522193ed7e2ebeca9409/1019_843_2786_1672/master/2786.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aeb7926209b4ed3ef38dfe6fc423afa4","title":"the knowledge most unusual non football events staged at a football stadium","story":"Plus: passmasters, players to score in the top four isions and a deaf footballer“What is the most unusual non-football event to be staged at a football ground?” asks Zara Wildoom.The answer to this is as strange as you’d expect.

Elsewhere, Goodison Park was used for Territorial Army drill training during the first world war, Songs of Praise once visited Old Trafford, and Billy Graham has held prayer rallies at Wembley, Maine Road, Bramall Lane, Carrow Road, Ashton Gate, Anfield, Roker Park, Villa Park, Upton Park and, according to Darren Leathley, Elland Road.Plenty of grounds have hosted plenty of music. Cardiff City’s former home, Ninian Park, offered hospitality to the Pope and Bob Marley, though not on the same bill, while Hampden Park has been visited by Hollywood stars and Status Quo. There are, of course, many other examples.No doubt you’ve heard of the father-son stunt duo who created and showed off this ode to Transformers at FC Oryol’s Central Stadium in Russia, while just this year visitors to Carrow Road enjoyed Fightmare 3, starring Grant Holt.But it’s not all high culture: the opening ceremony of the Edinburgh International Festival took place at Tynecastle.But let us finish with the greatest of them all, as pointed out by @YPLAC:There is a new name to add to the list of people who have scored in all four isions. “Ian Ashbee scored 10 league goals for Hull City over nine seasons three in the fourth tier, one in the third, five in the second and one in the Premier League,” Rob kindly points out.Meanwhile, as we like to plan ahead, we’ll be keeping an eye out for Charlton’s Lyle Taylor who has “scored in Isthmian Div 1, Isthmian Prem, Conference South, Conference Prem, League 2, League 1, Championship as well as Scottish First and Scottish Premiership,” James O’Brien explains. But can he do it on a mild Saturday afternoon at Old Trafford?“Has there ever been a deaf professional footballer?” asked Clinton Mansell 2004.There has indeed, including one very big name. “Although not totally deaf, Arsenal’s former record goalscorer, Cliff Bastin, was almost deaf,” Andy Kelly explains. In fact, he had an inherent problem with his middle ear, part of which had to be removed. “So much so,” he continues, “that he was not conscripted during the Second World War. His deafness was bad enough that during play he was unable to hear his teammates calling him. It obviously wasn’t too detrimental to his game, as he won five league titles, two FA Cups and 21 England caps.”• For more from the font of nerdvana, click this thing here.Aron Royle ponders: “The referee for the Cambridge United vs Oldham Athletic game this weekend was non other than a Mr Scott Oldham.

Does any other club boast a greater number of players that share a birthday?” Michael Daunt wonders.“Earlier this season, my father-in-law’s team, Crewe Alexandra, were top of League Two after four games with a goal difference of zero,” Robbie Swale points out. “I remember that West Ham once finished high up with a negative goal difference, but what is the latest in a season that a team has been top of their ision with a goal difference of 0 or below (or, if teams have won their isions with 0 or less, who are they and when)?”• Email your questions and answers to knowledge@the or tweet @TheKnowledge_GU."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e41412fb0c14e21b455ffdf722b2367f3b74073d/79_41_4798_2878/master/4798.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ba63dce440d5d4891019b7ef854c5e09","title":"borja baston swansea striker misfit undroppable record signing championship","story":"Thirty-eight days ago Borja Bastón replaced Oli McBurnie in the final throes of Swansea’s third pre-season friendly. It was there at St James Park in Exeter where the Spaniard’s improbable resurrection began in earnest, with his return to the first-team fold after an 805-day hiatus paving the way for an extraordinary rebirth that has led to the striker firing Swansea to second in the Championship and topping the goalscoring charts, with five goals in five games. In weeks Borja has gone from a lesser-spotted misfit to something of an undroppable force.A £15.5m club-record signing three years ago, Borja proved a poster boy for the wrong reasons, a footnote of Swansea’s sorry decline after one goal from 20 top-flight matches en route to relegation. When Borja struck on the opening day this season, it was his first Swansea goal for 1,022 days, only his fifth league start and his first 90 minutes for the club since November 2016, when Bob Bradley was in charge.The numbers provide some perspective for a player afforded a second chance under Steve Cooper, who is yet to taste defeat as Swansea’s head coach. The club have made their best start to a league campaign for 41 years and have a tasty clash at the leaders, Leeds United, on Saturday to follow Wednesday’s Carabao Cup tie at home to Cambridge. Swansea’s home form has been particularly irresistible only Manchester City have won at the Liberty Stadium since Boxing Day.Borja’s renaissance was envisaged by few fans, with the forward – who spent the past two seasons on loan in La Liga – explicitly for sale this summer and absent from the 24-man squad that travelled to Andalucía in pre-season, when he stayed at home to train with the under-23s. “He has been a bit ‘out of sight, out of mind’ in the last couple of years and he didn’t really do anything in Spain to grab the attention,” says Steve Carroll, the editor of the Swansea Oh Swansea fanzine. “No one really expected him to come back and what he has done has been a big surprise. There was always a belief that he had that ability but you just didn’t think we’d ever see it at Swansea.”When McBurnie, Swansea’s talisman, was sold on the eve of the season, Borja was handed the No 9 shirt. Borja is in the final year of his contract but together with André Ayew – the club’s highest-earner and also made available by the chairman, Trevor Birch, during another summer of upheaval – £33.5m-worth of talent is determined not to go quietly. Jefferson Montero and Jordan Ayew have been offloaded and it is not impossible Borja or André Ayew – or both – will depart before the European deadline on Monday, though the sales of McBurnie to Sheffield United and Daniel James, who came within minutes of signing for Leeds in January, to Manchester United have given Swansea, who expect the pair to stay, some financial leeway.“We had been desperately hoping that somebody would come in and take them off our hands now we’re looking at it and thinking: ‘What happens if we do let them go and if we lose them?’” says Nigel Davies, the editor of the fanzine A Touch Far Vetched.Borja’s transformation has been particularly costly for Davies, who, along with fellow season-ticket holder Aaron O’Shea, has pledged to donate £1 for every Championship point and goal Swansea score this season to the local Samaritans branch. “Every time Borja scores now, there is a bit of a cheer and then it’s: ‘That’s another quid gone but, if he can hold off on the hat-trick until my next payday, I’d appreciate it,” Davies says, laughing. “It will help them with some of their training costs, which in turn may save someone’s life.”Cooper, a former academy manager at Liverpool who won the Under-17 World Cup with England two years ago, has continued where Graham Potter left off, handing a core of young players responsibility and opportunity to thrive, with the Jamaica-born winger Jordan Garrick the latest youngster to follow a path from the under-23s to the first team, in the manner of James, Connor Roberts and Joe Rodon. Garrick’s explosive speed and trickery helped win a penalty at QPR (where Swansea were cheered on by McBurnie in the away end) and the 21-year-old has not looked back since swapping Ossett Albion and training with the rugby league side Bradford Bulls for Swansea 18 months ago.“He has pace to burn and a box of tricks to go with it,” says Davies. “For a fan-base trying to get over the loss of Dan James, Garrick has filled that little niche and, as for Borja, he is filling the McBurnie role, getting goals and working his nuts off. It looked as though his Swansea career would go down as an unmitigated disaster but it’s probably the greatest comeback since Morecambe and Wise went back to ITV after nine years at the Beeb.”Comparisons to Michu are far‑fetched but the hope is that there is more to come, with Borja settled in Swansea with his partner and seven‑month-old son, Enzo. “The first time he was here, he was in and out of a struggling team when we were fighting relegation at the bottom of the Premier League,” says Lee Trundle, the former Swansea striker. “I don’t think he ever really felt that love but I think Cooper has had him in, talked to him, put his arm round him and I think he feels wanted more than anything.“That has given the freedom to go and play. And I don’t care who you are, as a striker you need that love off the fans, off your manager. When you have that, you can have a totally different mindset. Sometimes I would try a trick or try a shot and sometimes it wouldn’t come off – but the fans always got behind me – and when you are playing with that freedom you are not scared to make mistakes or get your shots off, and Borja is really benefiting from that at the moment.”• Three league wins in 25 games does not cut the mustard and Nathan Jones knows as much. Three years ago Stoke finished ninth in the Premier League but after kicking off this season with four defeats and a draw, they are bottom of the Championship before Saturday’s trip to Birmingham. “We’re a shoulda, woulda, coulda team at the minute,” Jones said.• Scunthorpe and Paul Hurst are not having a good time: rock bottom of League Two after five matches. This was not what either party had in mind on Hurst taking the job following relegation in May."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/565aa442deccd410dd268645bebb3d7fa3a6b095/0_613_5528_3317/master/5528.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f60034cb4125159e4efa4fb84732b67","title":"bury expelled from efl after 125 years updates and reaction live","story":"“I shed tears this morning when I read about Bury FC’s demise,” John Harkey says. “That surprised me. Why I asked myself as a Sheffield United supporter celebrating life in the Premier League, should I care about a lower league club I have no connection to, do not support and never will.“The answer is I think because I love the game, its history and traditions. I am connected to Bury and to Bolton Wanderers as is everyone who loves the game in this country whether we know it or not. No man is an island, just as no football club is an island. There but for the grace of God go we. Every football supporter knows that in hisher heart of hearts. They know it even more this morning.“The only crumb of comfort I can offer those loyal supporters is that this isn’t necessarily the end. Look at Accrington Stanley just up the road. It took time but it can be done. The best of luck to you.”Neil Danns, the Bury FC captain who helped win the club promotion last season, said the club’s collapse had “damaged many, many lives” and called for “the powers that be” to be held accountable.He told BBC Radio Manchester: “Devastated is an understatement. You see some of the staff members that have been working thee for years in turmoil and wondering what’s going to happen. It’s been something I wouldn’t wish on any fan or player.”Danns said owner Steve Dale had contacted him earlier this summer and assured him that “everything was going to be okay” despite mounting questions over the club’s finances. He said questions now need to be asked of Dale, the previous owner Stewart Day, and the EFL.He added: “People have got to stand up and be accountable because it’s damaged many, many lives. You see people crying outside the ground, young fans waking up this morning with no football team, and that’s a sad, sad situation in this day and age ... There’s definite questions that have to be asked, not just of the owner and previous owners but also the powers that be.”Chair of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee and MP for Folkestone and Hythe Damian Collins has said the role of the football authorities and any possible changes to power will be reviewed in the House of Commons next week. EFL executive chair Debbie Jevans admitted rescheduling five postponed matches became a major factor in reaching the decision to expel Bury from the Football League. This is an action that was taken, that was done with much regret and I’m feeling devastated to be here talking to you. We simply ran out of time, having already postponed five matches, it would have been six matches. We were struggling to fit that in and it was with deep regret that we just couldn’t go on anymore. We went into everything that was sent to us with detail, trying to do everything that we could to save the club.”Jevans admitted that the EFL “needs to learn some lessons” and she believes lower league clubs should consider the option of a salary cap. We need to sit back, we need to look back, we need to learn some lessons. I’m speaking personally, I’m speaking for myself here. I think absolutely we need to look at the spend of clubs as much as the revenues, and looking at salary caps is absolutely something that I think the clubs should consider.”Bolton have confirmed that “any plans that may have been made for the immediate closure of the club have been put on hold” by the administrator.A petition calling for the creation of an independent regulator for football has almost 6000 signatures.Former Wigan chairman David Sharpe has offered his sympathy to Bury.An email. “A very sad day for Bury FC, their supporters and the town,” David Roberts says. “As a lifelong Hereford United fan I know what you are going through and the anger and frustration. There is however light at the end of the tunnel…..we rose from the ashes as a phoenix club, Hereford FC, and started over again. A long road back but one to look forward to. Keep the faith!!!!!!!!”The Bolton Wanderers Supporters Trust has sent its “heartfelt sympathy” to Bury fans and offered any help it can this morning. The mutual support shown by fans of both financially-stricken clubs, north-west rivals who were due to play each other a week on Saturday, has been brilliant to see.This is without doubt a sad day for Bury FC, their supporters and the local community. We appreciate how hard this decision has been for all parties involved.Following on from their expulsion from the English Football League, Bury FC will no longer be able to participate in the Emirates FA Cup for the 201920 season. We are therefore now consulting with our stakeholders regarding the first round proper following their exit from the league.If the club re-forms we look forward to them applying to make an application to The Football Association to re-join league competition further down the English football pyramid from the 202021 season.Sports minister Nigel Adams has said the EFL must look into the circumstances surrounding Bury’s plight.This is a very dark day for English football. It is a tragedy for the fans of Bury, the local community and everyone connected with the historic club. There will be a huge amount of anger and disbelief about how this happened. I have been in regular contact with the EFL and it is right that they closely review the processes at Bury to see if any lessons can be learned. The club’s passionate fans don’t deserve to go through this. I hope once the dust has settled they can begin to rebuild and take inspiration from other clubs that have done so before them.”Here’s a strongly worded thread on Twitter from Accrington Stanley owner Andy Holt.The PFA have released a statement on Bury’s expulsion from the Football League.It is with great sadness to hear that Bury have been expelled from the English Football League after a takeover bid from C\u0026ampN Sporting Risk collapsed.We have been in regular communication with the players, the EFL and the club over the last eight months to try and protect our members and secure a long-term future for Bury FC.Unfortunately, despite our efforts to support the process, the club has been unable to fulfill its financial commitments or complete a possible take-over deal.This will be a desperately sad time for Bury’s players and staff.We will continue to support all our members who have been impacted by the current situation, including former players, the remaining players who are contracted at the club and also those who were hoping to sign contracts.Our thoughts in particular go out to the supporters, the town and the wider community who will be devastated by this news.Our reporter David Conn wrote a damning piece on the Bury debacle yesterday.After such grinding and unnecessary failures precipitating expulsion from the Football League for Bury, a 134-year-old club founded by late Victorian civic-minded chaps in 1885, there have to be inquiries, lessons learned and reforms. The English Football League has promised to upgrade its rules to prevent such an implosion ever happening again. The Labour MP for Bury North, James Frith, who has worked relentlessly to expose ugly truths and to help save the club, has called for investigations and parliamentary scrutiny.The two modern, analytical young football men, Rory Campbell and Henry Newman, who decided not to proceed with their deadline-day proposed purchase, made clear in their statement that stronger governance is needed and the Bury wreckage was the result of “systemic failings ... over a number of years”.The FA have announced that Bury will not be involved in this season’s FA Cup. They would have entered the first round in November.If you’re a Bury fan, what do you do without football on a Saturday? This could happen to fans of any lower league club, you know. A football club plays such a crucial role in a local community and means so much to so many people. It’s part of their lives. You never think it won’t be there. What do you do without it?In other grim news Bolton Wanderers could yet go the same way as Bury. They have been given 14 days to find a buyer.Bury captain Neil Danns delivered a strong message to owner Steve Dale yesterday.“I would say look what you’ve done. This should never have happened. If you thought you could not move this club forward in a positive way you should never have taken over because you’ve literally destroyed lives, because that’s what this football club meant to so many fans. When you see the devastation of the fans I just think I have to say something. It’s unbelievable. I still can’t believe it. We have been in as normal, training. I don’t think anyone really believed that this was going to happen. We were just preparing every single week as though the next game was going to be on, the next game was going to be on. For it to happen so suddenly, it’s still really unbelievable. For a club with so much history and that has added so much to the league, for it to just be gone like that is just unimaginable.”Danns was captain of the side that won promotion from League Two last season. I’ve come to have a special bond with the fans and created some amazing memories, especially last year. At this moment in time I just feel for them the most because you have got people who have been going to the game for years. It’s like every story, you go to the game with your Grandad, your Mum, your Dad, your brothers, it’s such a community. It means so much to people. For me, it’s starting to hit me harder because I have got young sons myself. I know what it is like to take them to watch my boyhood team Liverpool and the bond that gives us. To see that taken away from future fans is just devastating. Football brings not just football on the pitch but it is so much more than that. This whole situation just does not feel real.”Dave Giffard, the chair of Forever Bury Supporters Club, says that fans are discussing their next move. We have got a meeting this morning to look at our next move. What we would like to do is try and save this football club. If we have to restart as a phoenix club we would like to get hold of this ground. We have the support of the council.”Hello. This is a dark day for English football. Bury have been expelled from the Football League after 125 years of membership after after the EFL board finally ran out of patience with its financial collapse and owner, Steve Dale. The deadline for the club to find a new owner passed on Tuesday afternoon, with a proposed sale to C\u0026ampN Sporting Risk collapsing earlier in the day. Shame on Dale, shame on the EFL, shame on the Football Association.

It leaves him unable to see or respond to tweets on the president’s official handle, @KagutaMuseveni, used as a public forum to disseminate information relating to the activities of his public office in his official capacity and to get feedback from citizens.On 30 July 2019, he says Museveni or his aides blocked his account, without notice or affording the applicant a hearing – infringing his right against discrimination as guaranteed in the constitution, his freedom of speech and expression, and his right to participate in the affairs of government and peaceful activities to influence the policies of government.Government spokesperson Ofwono Opondo and the director of political commissariat at Uganda’s police force, Asan Kasingye, who blocked Seguya on 8 August and 20 July respectively, are also named in the lawsuit.Male Mabirizi Kiwanuka, who filed the petition on his behalf, said Seguya could have been blocked by the president, or his aides, after a critical post he made in April, in which he told the Ghanaian president, Nana Akufo-Addo, that he would rather have him as president than Museveni.“I wish we could exchange you for our Ugandan president dictator, General Yoweri Kaguta Museveni, who has been for 33 years,” said Seguya after Akufo-Addo made a presentation on Pan-Africanism to a group of students at Harvard University.“We are telling him enough is enough. He has to go,” he said.Kiwanuka said that Seguya was not aware of any reason why Museveni, Ofwono Opondo and Kasingye blocked him. “We want the court to set aside what they did because he was not heard,” he said.“We are suing under the judicial review for court to review this decision. It was reached without fair hearing.”The case comes less than a month after Stella Nyanzi, a Ugandan women’s rights activist who branded Yoweri Museveni “a dirty, delinquent dictator” and “a pair of buttocks”, received an 18-month jail sentence for cyber harassment against the president. She was acquitted of a charge of offensive communication.Nyanzi, a former researcher at Makerere University, was arrested on 2 November after posting a poem on Facebook that the state deemed abusive towards Museveni and his late mother.Don Wanyama, the senior press secretary to Museveni, said the president will only respond to Seguya’s lawsuit in court.Kasingye said that commenting on the matter would be sub judice. He added that he would give his reasons for blocking Seguya in court, “when I go to defend myself”. The president’s Twitter account, @KagutaMuseveni, has 1.1 million followers @OfwonoOpondo has 104,300 followers and @AKasingye has 59,500 followersIn July, 2017, Donald Trump was sued for blocking people on Twitter, a case he lost when a federal court ruled that it violated the first amendment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7356f79bcf35b9e9a6d565f50b1f7e8c02372df3/0_1014_4976_2986/master/4976.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aeca33f632beb08a3ed054fc14437c7c","title":"ethiopians yemen saudi arabia in pictures","story":"Escaping poverty and drought, Ethiopians are making the dangerous sea crossing from Djibouti to Yemen and then on foot to the Saudi border.

The standard L-shaped dormer came under permitted development rights which do not require planning permission. But when the work began we applied for an optional certificate of lawfulness from Lambeth council. It didn’t review our application until September when it was rejected. It turned out that the planning department had unilaterally reinterpreted the rules in August 2018 without notifying residents, builders or architects. L-shaped dormers are now no longer considered a permitted development, although they are in other London boroughs. Six weeks later, we were served an enforcement notice. The government’s guidance states that certificates of lawfulness are optional and many builders don’t bother to apply. This means there may now be hundreds of “illegal” lofts in Lambeth. If a council can change the rules overnight without notification, it creates a trap for builders and, by interpreting the rules differently, defeats the purpose of permitted development legislation. Permitted development rules were intended to free small projects from red tape. They have proved contentious, partly because of how poorly they were drafted.However, the guidance issued by the government seems clear that L-shaped dormers are permitted and, at the time you submitted your application, Lambeth council accepted this.In a letter to you it stated that an application for a certificate of lawfulness is not an application for planning permission, but is to establish whether works were lawful at the time the application was made.Which they were. However, Lambeth seemed intent on applying its new rules retrospectively, saying: “The council’s approach has been dictated by appeal decisions since the summer of 2018, which have shown government planning inspectors have, in the main, not been recognising most L-shaped dormers as falling within permitted development. The council is mindful that some of the proposals recently refused will likely be appealed and is awaiting the outcome as a guide to dealing with such proposals going forward.”The Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government merely says: “Interpretation of permitted rights is a matter for the local planning authority in the first instance. An applicant can appeal where it considers the authority has not interpreted the rights correctly.”You have since done so and won, but it has left you £5,000 out of pocket. The court refused to award you costs because it decided it was reasonable for the council to review its approach following a series of appeal decisions.Your experience suggests the law is a shambles. Anyone considering extending their home would be wise to apply for a certificate before starting work because, it seems, neither council nor government can agree on what the rules really mean.If you need help email Anna Tims at your.problems@observer or write to Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.

Parliament is expected to sit for little more than a week from 3 September.But asked if he was denying opposition MPs the time to stop a no-deal Brexit, the prime minister told Sky News: “No, that is completely untrue. We are bringing forward a new legislative programme on crime, hospitals, making sure we have the education funding we need.”In the letter to colleagues, Johnson said MPs would be able to debate his approach to the EU negotiations before the European council on 17 October, at which any new deal would have to be agreed by the EU27 – and to vote on it afterwards.“Parliament will have the opportunity to debate the government’s overall programme, and approach to Brexit, in the run-up to EU Council, and then vote on this on 21 and 22 October, once we know the outcome of the council.“Should I succeed in agreeing a deal with the EU, parliament will then have the opportunity to pass the bill required for ratification of the deal ahead of 31 October,” he said. Leaked emails revealed at the weekend that Johnson had sought legal advice about proroguing parliament for five weeks from early September, when MPs are already expected to break briefly for party conferences.Prorogation is the official term that marks the end of a parliamentary session. After being advised to do so by the prime minister, the Queen formally prorogues Parliament. This takes the form of an announcement in the House of Lords on the Queen\u0027s behalf. It is a speech, written by the government, which usually describes the bills which have been passed during that session, and summarises what has been achieved.It means that all work on existing legislation stops, and MPs and Lords stop sitting. Prorogation also automatically kills any bills, early day motions or questions to ministers going through parliament.\u0026nbspParliament can then be reopened a few days later with a fresh slate of legislation intentions, set out in a new Queen\u0027s Speech at the formal State Opening of Parliament.On Wednesday morning, the Conservative chairman, James Cleverly, confirmed the move on Twitter, saying that planning to hold a Queen’s speech was something that “all new governments do”.Labour’s deputy leader, Tom Watson, called the move “an utterly scandalous affront to our democracy. We cannot let this happen.”A meeting of opposition MPs, convened by Jeremy Corbyn, agreed on Tuesday to let legislative efforts take priority over a confidence vote in the new government as a mechanism to stop no deal – a priority that could be changed given the curtailing of the parliamentary timetable.The proposed new timetable would leave MPs with a far narrower window to pass anti-no deal legislation, cutting it short by two weeks, with new dates likely to be:The UK would be due to leave the EU on 31 October.Rumours swirled in Westminster on Tuesday that plans were afoot to stymie MPs’ efforts to stop no deal after it was revealed that Sajid Javid, the chancellor, would hold a fast-tracked spending review on the day after MPs return to parliament next week, promising a cash boost for schools, hospitals and policing..The swift timing of the review came as the first major speech by the chancellor was abruptly cancelled by the Treasury with less than 24 hours’ notice.A Treasury spokesman said the speech had been cancelled because the one-year spending review, called a spending round, which had been expected to take place later this autumn, was being fast-tracked.Javid, writing in the Daily , suggested he would not break his predecessor Philip Hammond’s strict fiscal rules, saying the government could “afford to spend more on the people’s priorities – without breaking the rules around what the government should spend – and we’ll do that in a few key areas like schools, hospitals and police.”The chancellor said his economic priorities were health, education and policing, suggesting that other key areas including housing may get overlooked for major investment.He said: “Health and education aren’t just the names of departments – they’re lifelines of opportunity, just as they were for me. The teachers who persuaded me that I had what it takes to study economics, and put me on the path to becoming chancellor of the exchequer.“The police officers who kept us safe when the street I grew up on became a centre for drug dealers. The NHS that cared for my dad in his final days. These aren’t just numbers on a spreadsheet. They’re the beating heart of our country.”The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said: “Nobody is fooled into believing that this is a proper and normal spending review. It’s a one off pre-election panic- driven stunt budget.Whitehall sources suggested there was considerable concern MPs could trigger a vote of no confidence in the government and an early general election, which could lead to departments being left in the dark about spending plans, with budgets running out in 2020.“We want people to be able to plan and there is a reason it is in early September because of the risks when MPs return to the house that week,” one source said.The 12-month review, instead of the usual three-year review, is intended as a short-term measure to give departments new budgets and also free up officials to focus on preparing for Brexit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/35514d04170a3f5941ff69c33f433dfe7ac451fd/1787_219_1863_1118/master/1863.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7175e9c096155c198c18d5dd4a146f79","title":"labour plans to phase out animal testing as part of manifesto promise","story":"Party also pledges, if in government, to ban trophy hunters from selling their spoils in the UKLabour would gradually phase out animal testing and ban trophy hunters from selling their spoils in the UK as part of the party’s animal welfare manifesto.After consultations with the public, the party would also carry out a review into the use of whips on race horses by jockeys, forbid electric pulse fishing and prohibit the sale and use of snares and glue traps, which are used to catch animals.Labour would pledge, if in government, to review the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 with a long-term commitment to phase out animal testing completely.The British Horseracing Authority has strict rules on the use of whipping, with jockeys limited to a maximum of seven times in a flat race or eight times in a jump race and the horse must be “in contention or clearly winning at the time” the force was applied. Jockeys disobeying such rules face suspension.The shadow environment secretary, Sue Hayman, confirmed that, under a future Labour government, the party would look to review whether the use of whips in horse racing should be further restricted. It was one of the top priorities raised in a consultation with members, animal rights groups and the public, said the party.Hayman said Labour wanted to “bring Britain’s animal welfare policy into the 21st century” and protect animals both in the UK and around the world, amid heightened speculation over an early election.Hayman said: “After consulting with the public and groups involved with research, it’s clear that we need to focus minds and resources on alternatives to animal testing by declaring our intention to phase it out. “It is not only harmful to the animals, but very often ineffective as a means to develop medical treatments for humans.In 2018, 3.52m experimental procedures involving living animals were carried out across the UK including more than 100,000 cases where animals suffered severely and about 90,000 where the animal died, according to Home Office figures.Other measures Labour would propose include ensuring the maximum sentence could be handed out if a defendant was found guilty of animal cruelty against a wild animal, and working internationally to stop the return of commercial whaling.More than 6,000 responses were received in response to the consultation, with the use of whips in horse racing one of the top priorities raised by members, animal rights groups and the public.The party said the manifesto would also reiterate Labour’s commitment to strengthening the Hunting Act 2004, ending the badger cull, giving tenants the right to keep pets, enshrining animal sentience in law and ending the live export of animals for slaughter. Last week it committed to a total ban on monkeys being kept in cages."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c69aabc1b8c25849499f7c29282073aad717d1c/0_400_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d95d61c457800a8608c8372a2c27fc48","title":"spending review set for next week fuels election speculation live","story":"Government will prorogue parliament in September, with Queen’s speech on 14 OctoberThis is a good quick backgrounder from the House of Commons Library on how exactly proroguing parliament works.A petition calling on the government not to prorogue parliament has already received more than 14,000 signatures. Its text reads: “Parliament must not be prorogued or dissolved unless and until the article 50 period has been sufficiently extended or the UK’s intention to withdraw from the EU has been cancelled.”The Financial Times’s Sebastian Payne is reporting that the government will call an election if MPs manage to pass a vote of no confidence next week.The SNP MP Joanna Cheery has confirmed that she has spoken to her legal team about speeding up the action in the Scottish courts to stop Boris Johnson shutting down parliament, which was due to be heard of 6 September.Ian Murray, another of the cross-party group of more than 70 MPs and peers behind the action, said they would consider seeking an interim interdict (similar to an injunction in England and Wales) in the court of session to block prorogation.Led by Jolyon Maugham QC’s Good Law Project, the group had been seeking a ruling from the court of session to prevent the prime minister going to the Queen with a request for prorogation until all appeals were exhausted.Cherry told reporters on Tuesday the team were prepared to get a judge “out of their bed in the middle of the night” to block prorogation.Meanwhile, the SNP’s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, has described Johnson as a “dictator”, saying: “The Tory leader has no mandate, no majority and is acting like a dictator by attempting to curtail parliament to get his way. “The SNP will do everything we can to stop Brexit and prevent a no-deal disaster. It is vital that MPs from across the parties urgently pull together to stop Boris Johnson driving Scotland and the UK off a cliff edge.”The Speaker, John Bercow, has issued an extraordinary statement. “I have had no contact from the government, but if the reports that it is seeking to prorogue parliament are confirmed, this move represents a constitutional outrage,” he says.Here’s the full text of the prime minister’s letter to MPs.The former chancellor Philip Hammond has said it would be “a constitutional outrage” if parliament were prevented from holding the government to account. Hammond quit the cabinet before Boris Johnson became prime minister and has become a leading opponent of no-deal Brexit.Downing Street has sent through its formal announcement. Here are the key points.And here’s a statement from the prime minister: We must focus on crucial public priorities – helping the NHS, fighting violent crime, investing in infrastructure and science and cutting the cost of living. We have made an important start – funding for 20,000 extra police officers and new investment in our NHS – but to deliver on the public’s priorities we require a new session and a Queen’s speech. I believe it is vital that parliament is sitting both before and after European council and if, as I hope, a deal with the EU is forthcoming, parliament will then have the opportunity to pass the withdrawal agreement bill required for ratification ahead of 31 October.Here is Boris Johnson’s letter to MPs confirming that parliament will be prorogued. It starts: “I hope you had an enjoyable and productive summer recess, with the opportunity for some rest ahead of the return of the house.” He says he will request an end to the parliamentary session in the second sitting week of September. Boris Johnson has been speaking to the broadcast media. He confirmed that the Queen’s speech would be held on 14 October and said the move to suspend parliament was purely about “getting on with plans to take this country forward”.As I said on the steps of Downing Street, we’re not going to wait until 31 October before getting on with our plans to take this country forward. This is a new government with a very exciting agenda ... We have to be bringing forward new and important bills. That’s why we are going to have a Queen’s speech and we are going to do it on 14 October.He denied that it was a move to deny MPs the time they needed to debate and vote on Brexit.That is completely untrue. If you look at what we’re doing we are bringing forward a new legislative programme on crime, on hospitals, making sure that we have the education funding that we need and there will be ample time on both sides of that crucial 17 October summit, ample time in parliament for MPs to debate the EU to debate Brexit and all the other issues.Asked if he was planning a general election, he said: No, all you should take from this is that we are doing exactly what I said on the steps of Downing Street, which is we must get on now with our legislative domestic agenda.Scotland’s first minister has tweeted, saying that unless MPs work together to stop Johnson, today could go down as “a dark one indeed for UK democracy”.She called on the Scottish Conservatives to back a cross-party effort to try to block the suspension of parliament.’s Scotland correspondent, Libby Brooks, has just pointed out that the SNP party conference will fall right across the date of the proposed Queen’s speech.Craig Oliver, who was director of communications at No 10 under David Cameron, has tweeted:More reaction from outraged opposition MPs is coming in. Anna Soubry, the leader of Change UK, has said UK democracy is under threat from “a ruthless PM”.The Conservative rebel Dominic Grieve has been speaking to BBC News. The former attorney general, who opposes a no-deal Brexit, said he would consult with likeminded MPs over the next few days ahead of parliament’s return next week. He said they would try to take steps to try to ensure that prorogation would not happen and suggested there could be a vote of no confidence in the government.I think that the prime minster’s decision is deeply questionable and frankly pretty outrageous. He knows very well that we are in the middle of a national crisis. He knows very well that parliament is very concerned about the possibility of a no-deal Brexit and this has very little to do with starting a new session of parliament. It is a deliberate attempt to make sure parliament doesn’t sit for a five week perio …This is an attempt to govern without parliament. It is pretty unprecedented and I think the government will come to regret it.When opposition leaders met yesterday they stressed they would prioritise legislative measures to try to stop a no-deal Brexit, rather than holding a vote of no confidence in the government, but Grieve said a vote of confidence was now more likely. If it is impossible to prevent prorogation then i think it is going to be very difficult for people like myself to keep confidence in the government and I could well see why the leader of the opposition would wish to table a motion for a vote of no confidence …I’ve always been of the view that bringing down the administration which is made up of a party of which I am a member is something I would only do as a last resort and that remains my position and I don’t wish to do it f there is any way of avoiding it. But if there is no other way of avoiding it it may be the only thing I can do.The Observer’s political editor, Toby Helm, tweets that his paper reported on Sunday that Boris Johnson had asked the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, whether parliament could be shut down for five weeks from 9 September. He said the report was rubbished by No 10.Best for Britain, a group committed to stopping Brexit “through any democratic means”, have issued a statement.It would make no sense for the Queen to back this deeply undemocratic, unconstitutional and fundamentally political manoeuvre from the government.If the Queen is asked to help, she would do well to remember history doesn’t look too kindly on royals who aid and abet the suspension of democracy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a22e3f9e70a5a4bfd4fcc9774b60f0eb9e4b816/0_82_5022_3012/master/5022.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a69cb1972548c04563dedada3500156","title":"childhood happiness lowest level in decade says report","story":"Charity describes finding that 200,000 are not content with their lives as ‘national scandal’Childhood happiness has fallen to its lowest level in a decade, with more than 200,000 children unhappy with their lives, according to a report.For the first time since it was launched in 2009-10, the annual Good Childhood report found overall contentment among 10- to 15-year-olds has dipped below eight on a scale of one to 10. It now stands at 7.89 on average, down from a high of 8.21 in 2011, at a time when adult wellbeing is improving.The Children’s Society, which conducted the research, said the decline in childhood happiness was a national scandal. The charity called on Boris Johnson to move the issue to the top of his agenda and introduce a national measurement of children’s wellbeing.The report is based on an annual survey of about 2,400 households and a longitudinal study involving 40,000 households.It found a significant dip in contentment about friends and school among both boys and girls and an increase in unhappiness among boys about their appearance.Asked why he is unhappy with his appearance, one boy surveyed said: “Like Instagram and stuff, right? You see all these models, you see all these weightlifters, bodybuilders, and you look at yourself and you’re like: ‘I look like a stick.’ I feel like we’re exposed to a lot more, so we are less secure about our appearance.”Richard Crellin, the policy and research manager at the Children’s Society, said the research provided observational data, so it was difficult to pinpoint reasons for the decline in childhood happiness.“The latest ONS data for adults suggests wellbeing is increasing and improving. Adults tend to be slightly less happy than children, but the proportion with high wellbeing is improving, whereas it is declining for children.”Mark Russell, the chief executive of the Children’s Society, said: “Modern childhood is a happy and carefree time for most, yet for too many it is not. It is a national scandal that children’s unhappiness is increasing so quickly.“We are urging the government to introduce a national measurement of children’s wellbeing so we can really listen, respond and show young people they matter.”Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, said the report should act as “wake-up call to ministers”.He added: “Our children’s health should be a national priority, yet after nine years of austerity, the government’s response to the issue of child health has been piecemeal as it continues to squeeze the NHS and take money from our public health system and schools.”A government spokeswoman said: “We want young people growing up in a modern Britain to feel confident tackling the challenges life throws at them. That is why we’re giving teachers the power to deal with bad behaviour and bullying in the classroom, investing billions every year in mental health support for young people, and providing quicker access to specialist treatment where needed.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ddd7d76a4d2969208d9ca7d7950e1d17da3e8cd/579_38_1758_1055/master/1758.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8122a16ead249047c832034fe1d5c08c","title":"we need to talk about the menopause as loudly as we can says campaigner","story":"Campaigner, who was once a fixture on the Britpop scene, had no idea what was going on when she became perimenopausal“I consider myself a woman of the world and I didn’t know what being perimenopausal was,” says Meg Mathews, the former music PR. But since launching a blog about the menopause in 2017, she has become a prominent campaigner on the subject.Mathews believes the subject is not discussed as much as it should be. “We need to talk about the menopause as loudly and as much as we can because we have to get past the stigma and shame our society places on the menopause,” she says. “We have to break the taboo.”Now 53 and on hormone replacement therapy, Mathews started going through her menopause at 49, although she now thinks she was perimenopausal in her early 40s. It hit her hard, but she had no idea what was going on.“The only thing I knew about the menopause was hot flushes and no more periods – but I wasn’t getting those two symptoms,” she says. Mathews later found out through her own research that she had been suffering 32 of the 34 lesser-known symptoms of menopause, including burning mouth, mood swings, problems sleeping, hair loss and low libido. Her GP prescribed her antidepressants to no effect.The menopause is a natural part of ageing and usually occurs between 45 and 55 years of age after levels of the hormone oestrogen have declined to the point where ovulation and menstruation stop. It is defined as a woman going 12 months without a period. In the UK, the average age for a woman to reach the menopause is 52. However, about one in 100 women have their menopause before the age of 40.Common symptoms can include hot flushes, night sweats, vaginal dryness and discomfort during sex, a reduced sex drive, low moods or anxiety and difficulty sleeping. Memory and concentration can also be affected.\u0026nbsp“But I couldn’t tell anyone: my mum had recently died, so I couldn’t talk to her, and we all know about ‘Meg Mathews’ rock and roll lifestyle’,” she says, referring to her reputation as a fixture on the 1990s Britpop party scene – she was married to Oasis’s Noel Gallagher for four years. “I thought it had all caught up with me,” she says. “I told everyone I had glandular fever and didn’t go out of the house for three months.”Then, at an AA meeting, she stood up to tell the room that she thought she was going mad. “A woman approached me afterwards, saying that I wasn’t going mad I was having my menopause. I went to an NHS menopause clinic, which I didn’t even know existed, and the light switched on. I was like, ‘Oh God, I have had all those years feeling like this – why isn’t it talked about?’”Making sure the menopause is talked about has become one of Matthew’s driving forces. In 2017, she started a blog about the menopause. It features articles and Q\u0026ampAs from menopause specialists, real-life experiences – including her own – and lists of products Mathews says have helped her.The blog has been a runaway success, with a million visitors in its first six months. “I’ve held two conferences in London with a range of the country’s best specialists talking on a wide range of topics. For the second one, in May this year, the tickets sold out,” she says.Mathews has given talks in unlikely places, including at the Foreign Office’s services ision: “They opened the phone lines to every embassy and Commonwealth office around the world so that they could listen in, too,” she says. “It went so well that they invited me back to their main office in Milton Keynes to talk to their employees there.”She has spoken at the British Library and the BBC, and is in discussions to speak at another government department.This, says Mathews, is just the start. “I want to take my conferences nationwide,” she says. “I want to help women create a sisterhood network, like Weight Watchers, where they meet weekly in a village hall-type setting to discuss their symptoms and swap advice because many women don’t have anyone to talk to – we’re in a bubble in London. I have learned everything just through my network of women.”Mathews plans to lobby the government for trained nurse practitioners to act as the first port of call for women experiencing menopausal symptoms – and to persuade writers of soaps to include a menopause storyline.“There have been storylines about paedophiles, rape, murders and drug addiction, LGBT issues – but they have never had Bet Lynch behind the bar having a hot sweat,” she says. “Soaps play a pivotal role in helping to start conversations within families on a national scale. So many women probably don’t know how to explain to their husbands what’s going on. But if it was on a TV show as a storyline, it’d be ‘look at what’s going on in EastEnders, she’s got the menopause!’”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d19df985060b01b2aa77af69e64d0686de3432ab/0_52_5166_3100/master/5166.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c4c61a12dddafe4eb697a446fdf0307b","title":"helping nine year old eating disorder recovery podcast","story":"We hear about the importance of early intervention in rare cases of pre-teen eating disorders.

I’m not fussed about it at all,” he said in a development that will almost certainly force the governing body of men’s tennis to suspend the Australian, having already said it was considering such a move.“I was fined $113K for what? Why are we talking about something that happened three weeks ago when I just chopped up someone first round of a US Open?”US Open officials had given Kyrgios the green light to play the final grand slam of the year despite tennis chiefs continuing to weigh up whether or not the temperamental talent should be suspended for his latest outburst in Cincinnati.The ATP offered no time line around when it would make any decision on Kyrgios’s fate when quizzed on the eve of the Open, which started on Monday.Believed to be the biggest fine in the sport’s history, Kyrgios was slapped with separate penalties for an audible obscenity, ball abuse, verbal abuse towards the umpire, leaving the court and four counts of unsportsmanlike conduct during his explosive second-round loss to Karen Khachanov.In addition to the fines, the ATP said it was “looking further into what happened during and immediately after the match to see if additional action is warranted under the Player Major Offence section of the code and that could result in an additional fine andor suspension”.But the 24-year-old was unrepentant after progressing to the second round at Flushing Meadows.“Have you ever sworn at someone before?” he countered at a journalist. “... You’re not an elite athlete.” Asked if he was saying it was acceptable for elite athletes to swear, he said: “No, I’m just saying people get frustrated. It happens.”Earlier, Kyrgios delivered heaps of brilliant shotmaking and a sprinkle of controversy in his 6-3, 7-6 (7-1), 6-4 win that put him into a second-round meeting with Frenchman Antoine Hoang, who beat Argentine Leonardo Mayer.Kyrgios was laser-focused for the first half of the match as he deployed a lethal mix of monster serves, stinging forehands and smart net play but nearly unravelled when he got agitated over a fan who interrupted his ball toss. The 28th seed was serving at 4-4 in the second set when a woman trying to get to her seat entered his line of sight during his serve, at which point an annoyed Kyrgios asked aloud if she was alright. Kyrgios then looked to the chair umpire who said he could not have prevented the interruption because he did not see it since he was focused on the players. But a clearly perturbed Kyrgios was not happy with that explanation and following a verbal exchange was given a code violation warning for an audible obscenity. After Kyrgios held serve to go 5-4 up he resumed his back-and-forth with the umpire on the changeover at which point a clearly annoyed Johnson asked his opponent when he was going to “play fucking tennis”. Kyrgios, who has repeatedly got in trouble for on-court actions and is known for his short temper, did not let the incident affect his sublime play as he settled right back down to business. The Australian blitzed Johnson in the second set tiebreak where he showed his lighter side when he broke into a little dance after chasing down a dropshot he sent back for a brilliant crosscourt winner and a commanding 6-0 cushion. “It was pretty clean,” Kyrgios said of the tiebreak. “I knew it was an important set. If he got that set the match could have been different and we’d still be playing right now.” Johnson, who was being thoroughly outplayed, did manage to finally earn his first break to get to within 3-1 in the third set but Kyrgios relied on his massive serve to carry him over the finish line.

Jimmy Anderson and Steve Smith are likely to return from injury: England’s best bowler and Australia’s best batsman. Smith will renew his duel with young pace sensation Jofra Archer, who could challenge for Anderson’s title sooner rather than later.Smith will first play in a tour match against Derbyshire after Archer concussed him with a short ball during the second Test. Their battle in the fourth will be at least as anticipated as whatever Stokes does next. But ahead of time, Smith was in no mood to be deferential to his opponent.“There’s been a bit of talk that he’s got the wood over me, but he hasn’t actually got me out,” said Smith of Archer. “He hit me on the head on a wicket that was a bit up and down at Lord’s. All the other bowlers have had more success against me, I daresay. I’ve faced them a bit more, but they’ve all got me out a lot more.”As for a short-ball attack, Smith replied archly. “If they’re bowling up there it means they can’t nick me off, or hit me on the pad or hit the stumps. With the Dukes ball – I don’t know, that’s an interesting ploy.”Smith certainly didn’t back away that day at Lord’s, repeatedly hooking Archer before one kept low and hit him on the side of the neck. There was alarm as Smith fell forward onto his face, like when batsman Phillip Hughes was fatally hit on the back of his neck during a domestic match in 2014. It wasn’t only onlookers who thought of that moment.“I had a few things running through my head, particularly where I got hit,” said Smith. “That was probably the first thing I thought about. Then I was like, ‘I’m OK here’. I was a bit sad, but I was alright mentally for the rest of that afternoon.”Smith’s concussion has started a broader conversation around safety. While making the point that a neck protector would not have prevented his injury, Smith said that he would have to get over his sense of claustrophobia when wearing one on the assumption that they would soon become mandatory.As for the fact that he initially resumed his innings before being diagnosed the next day with concussion, he noted the complexity of such situations. “I felt pretty good, passed all my tests and was able to go and bat and then it wasn’t until later that evening that it hit me.Plenty of time is ominous for England, given Smith looked utterly unhurried through his Ashes innings of 144 and 142 at Edgbaston, before Archer ruffled him towards the end of his 92 at Lord’s.“Edgbaston was just: first game back, fresh, and I just wanted to bat, I didn’t want to stop batting… All my movement patterns and the way I feel was really good so I’m comfortable with that, and hopefully I can ramp up my training over the next few days.More than anything, you could sense Smith’s impatience to be playing, after both agonising over and admiring Stokes’ matchwinning performance. “He completely turned the series on its head,” said Smith. “Even if you go back to two nights before, when he bowled 14 overs straight. I rocked up to the ground next day and someone said that on average he bowled the quickest for the day as well, over those 14 overs.”“You could just see the passion that he showed and the fight. He never gave up. You look at him, and I really admire this about him, when he scored a hundred he didn’t even celebrate, didn’t care.

Discussions around ethics in this job was a constant between workers, but we don’t know how to bring it up.”But, they added, “Apple, recruiting through vendor companies in Ireland, take absolutely no responsibility in the employment of contractors and their treatment in work. They do what they want, and when they’re done with your project or they screw up (like what just happened), they tell your vendor company to let you go, which they do … It’s been coming at them for over a year. How could they not see this coming? Did they think about protecting their employees at all? Or just their reputation?”“We’ve all been laid off after the scandal, with no protection against this. More than 300 at once just in Cork, with no redundancy, just one week’s notice.”The next software update to iOS, the operating system that runs iPhones, is expected in early October and was likely to be the first occasion where the company would have been able to implement a promised opt-out to the Siri grading system. The job losses suggest, instead, that Apple is not planning to resume the grading project in the immediate future.Apple did not respond to a request for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f84497bc9de67b670c7e67e2fe32c2cab139a42/0_0_1436_862/master/1436.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fe960be271d89f5ef6bf57d3641fac26","title":"australian who says he invented bitcoin ordered to hand over up to 5bn","story":"US court orders Craig Wright to share cryptocurrency haul with the estate of American programmer David KleimanThe Australian man who claimed to have invented cryptocurrency bitcoin has been ordered to hand over half of his alleged bitcoin holdings, reported to be worth up to $5bn.The IT security consultant Craig Wright, 49, was sued by the estate of David Kleiman, a programmer who died in 2013, for a share of Wright’s bitcoin haul over the pair’s involvement in the inception of the cryptocurrency from 2009 to 2013.Kleiman’s estate alleges Wright and Kleiman were partners, and therefore his family is entitled to a share of the bitcoin that was mined by the pair in that time. Wright denies there was a partnership.A US district court in Florida on Tuesday ruled that half of the bitcoin mined and half of the intellectual property held by Wright from that time belongs to Kleiman.One issue is it is not known exactly how much bitcoin Wright holds. It has been claimed that the Kleiman estate could get anywhere between 410,000 and 500,000 bitcoin, putting the value at between A$6.1bn and A$7.4bn as of Wednesday.Wright claimed to the court that he couldn’t access the bitcoin because he doesn’t have a list of the public addresses of that bitcoin. He claimed in 2011, after seeing the cryptocurrency had begun to be associated with drug dealers and human traffickers, he put the bitcoin he mined in 2009 and 2010 into an encrypted file and into a blind trust. The encrypted key was ided into multiple key slices, and the key slices were given to Kleiman who distributed them to people through the trust.Wright said this meant he could not decrypt the file until he gets access to the key from a bonded courier who will arrive in January 2020 – a claim Wright has made before in claiming to be Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of bitcoin.In the judgment, Judge Bruce Reinhart said Wright had not proved he could not comply and obtain the bitcoin. He said Wright made inconsistent statements and the whole story was “inconceivable” that he’d had a Dr Frankenstein-like revelation when his creation “turned to evil”.“During his testimony, Dr. Wright’s demeanor did not impress me as someone who was telling the truth. When it was favorable to him, Dr. Wright appeared to have an excellent memory and a scrupulous attention to detail. Otherwise, Dr. Wright was belligerent and evasive,” Reinhart said.In 2015, Wright was investigated by the Australian Taxation Office over his involvement with bitcoin with his Sydney home raided by the Australian federal police, leading to speculation he might be Nakamoto.In 2016, Wright claimed he was Nakamoto, but experts questioned the evidence he provided. He promised to provide further proof, but backed down days later, saying he was “sorry” and did “not have the courage”.Reinhart said at the start of his ruling the court “is not required to decide, and does not decide” whether Wright is Nakamoto, and the court was not required to decide and did not decide how much bitcoin Wright controls today."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/833edc16435de60d406f1a7367fc5f25b02be4c9/0_205_6016_3608/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2eec257a2b3ea255833e8a11875b9221","title":"mix it up the mixologists guide to drinking rum","story":"Still drinking gin? Update your drinking habits with tips from the experts on enjoying rum’s craft revivalWhile gin has had a dramatic rise in popularity over the past five years, bartenders have been quietly getting excited about rum. It offers huge cocktail variety, depending on the style from the unaged white variety to those aged in the tropics, it’s as complex and nuanced as any other spirit. I spoke to some top mixologists about their favourite cocktails.Jack Wallis and Chris Tanner at the VaultRum cocktails range from the super-simple to concoctions worthy of Michelin stars. Jack Wallis, operations manager at the Vault in Soho, is proud of the simplicity of their Captain’s Blood – a twist on a daiquiri, made with rum, fresh lime, sugar syrup and bitters that’s perfect to serve at home. For something a little more complex, Chris Tanner, also of the Vault, makes a version of Planter’s Punch with orange, pineapple, lime juice, grenadine, sugar syrup and Lugger Rum. Unlike some varieties, Lugger Rum is not dominated by vanilla, aiming instead to deliver a full profile of spices, including nutmeg, orange peel and cloves.Liam Cotter of Heads, Hearts and TailsBarman Liam Cotter, of events and consultancy firm Heads, Hearts and Tails, warns not to take shortcuts in rum-based cocktails: “Inexperienced bartenders may swap out a quality rum with an inferior one and wonder why their grog isn’t quite the same.” Cotter’s all-time favourite cocktail is a Jungle Bird not the original 1970s version, created in the Kuala Lumpur Hilton, but the reimagined New York classic, created by way of Giuseppe Gonzales (formerly of New York’s Suffolk Arms and long-standing patron of Milk \u0026amp Honey). He reworked it to become infinitely more balanced and appealing to a refined contemporary palate. It’s part all-night-fun negroni, part complex bitter daiquiri. He thinks this would be great with Lugger Rum.He also has a soft spot for something more straightforward: “There is something lovely about a simple rum and coke.”Mia Johansson at SwiftLondon bar Swift is known for its elegant and inventive cocktails, and one of managing partner Mia Johansson’s favourites is a Praline Flip. First, they make their own hazelnut orgeat – by heating the nuts in water, cooling and re-blending them – then combine with Angostura bitters, egg, Guinness and spiced rum. Their second cocktail is a little less complicated, but still one I wouldn’t try at home. It’s an espresso martini using Mr Black cold-brew coffee liqueur, coffee, vodka, rich demerara sugar and spiced rum.Thom Solberg at Black RockBlack Rock’s bar manager Thom Solberg loves a Mai Tai. Although this award-winning Shoreditch bar primarily focuses on whisky, it also works with rum. Solberg’s take on his retro favourite uses three rums – Jamaican, Lugger spiced and over-proof – along with triple sec and lime juice. All it needs is shaking up, pouring over ice and a garnish of orange and mint. He says spiced rum goes well with anything apple-y, and that a particular favourite rum modifier is pomegranate molasses. He incorporates this mix into a rum punch alongside dry cider, lime, allspice dram and a little vanilla syrup, garnished with cinnamon, nutmeg and apple slices.Kurt Maitland, cocktail authorKurt Maitland, author of Drink, can recommend something simple and something more showy. A Devil’s Kiss won’t tax you: shake up equal parts coffee liqueur, Grand Marnier and Lugger Rum with ice and strain into small glasses.The Kama’aina is a completely different kettle of fish, however. It starts with ginger syrup, almond paste and pimento liqueur, stirred to create a #9. Next add Rhum agricole, Lugger Rum, guava nectar, real cream of coconut, and fresh lime then shake with crushed ice and strain into a tiki glass, adding Angostura bitters and an orange blossom garnish at the end. Maitland describes a Devil’s Kiss as like an aperitif at home before the main drama of a complicated Kama’aina in a specialist bar. The former can easily be made in quantity for parties and the spiced rum balances beautifully with the bitter coffee and sweet Grand Marnier.Featuring fruit, spice and a genuinely fiery twist – careful with those matchesLugger rum 50mlStrawberry and lime syrup 20ml*Angostura bitters, 2 dashesWest country cider 30mlSprig of rosemarySpiced powder**MatchesStrawSugar 50gStrawberries x10Peeled lime skins (x2 whole limes)Juice of 1 whole limeIn a bowl, muddle all ingredients and leave for 10-30 minutes in fridge, then strain through a sieve.Mix equal parts of icing sugar, cinnamon powder and nutmeg powder.Lugger Rum is a Caribbean rum aged in Devon, featuring sophisticated notes of orange peel, nutmeg, cloves and vanilla.

When it makes spiced rum too. Find out what inspired Lyme Bay Winery to take the plunge with this dark and stormy spiritThere can be little doubt about it: Britain likes a drink. Considered by some as the core of the “drinksphere”, it’s home to pioneers in everything from cider to gin, but rum has barely registered on the radar. Unless you’re James Lambert, managing director of Lyme Bay Winery, that is.“We wanted to make a spiced rum, but not as we know it,” says Lambert, whose winery is set just a few miles from the sandy Devon coastline. The location is intricately entwined with the creation of their signature dark spirit, whose full name – Jack Ratt’s Lugger Spiced Rum – comes from infamous smuggler Jack Rattenbury.“Reading Jack’s book, Memoirs of a Smuggler, it just spoke to us, as it’s what we’re all about. There’s cheekiness, innovation and that sense of trying to be a little bit roguish – we just felt his character suited so well what we were trying to do with the rum,” says Lambert. In true Rattenbury form, the winery is not afraid to venture into the unknown. “We have a bit of an obsession with all things ‘off the beaten path’, says sales manager Sara Walters, who has worked at Lyme Bay for 10 years. “The fact that there was no one in Devon making a spiced rum made for an irresistible challenge, particularly given our rich smuggling history.”Taking inspiration from these tales, Lyme Bay embarked on its own voyage of discovery. It created a bottle design to convey the spirit of Jack Rattenbury – a black label to match his black-painted boat, and rakish typography – all the while showcasing the winery’s trademark elegance.Upon arriving in Devon, this exotic import is aged in a solera system, where it matures alongside older versions, aged up to six years. After years spent in charred-oak bourbon barrels from Tennessee, the rum is ready to provide the base character for Lugger Rum, bringing with it hints of caramel and molasses to give a complex and superior taste.The second spirit added to the blend is a premium Guyanan rum, “from the homeland of demerara sugar,” says Lambert. But if the mention of sugar sets your teeth on edge, don’t worry: this rum offers a soothing kiss of natural sweetness without having to add excessive amounts of sugar.Spices complete the symphony. Nutmeg, stem and ground stem ginger, cinnamon, orange peel, clove and vanilla are introduced to create an inviting yet complex flavour combination. “The intention was always to make a high-quality spirit,” says Lambert. “Many commercial spiced rums have an overpowering vanilla essence, but it was important to us to follow a more craft approach.” For Lugger Rum, they mellowed out the vanilla tones to bring forward the natural flavours of both rums, re-enforcing them with a distinct array of spices.That’s all well and good, but one imagines that the rum’s namesake would ask only one question: “How do I drink it?” Although the combination of rums with the charred-oak barrels has created a dark spirit that’s flawless in cocktails or with simple mixers, I like nothing more than three large ice cubes and a nice splash on the rocks. Sourced from afar, yet aged on our doorstep – and sitting at a refreshingly mid-tier price point – Lugger Rum is ideal for those who want something a little special in their glass.Lugger Rum is a Caribbean rum aged in Devon, featuring sophisticated notes of orange peel, nutmeg, cloves and vanilla.

These tales of infamous men – whose names have endured for centuries – bring to mind the smell of woodsmoke and sea salt, and warming brown spirits sipped from battered tin mugs.And so to Lyme Bay on the unspoilt Jurassic Coast of England’s south-west, where the fossilised remains of ichthyosaurs and plesiosaurs lay waiting to be discovered under the sand and shingle. For more than 100 years smugglers in this area, such as the notorious Jack Rattenbury, would paint their rickety little “lugger” boats black and pack them full of contraband to sell to the highest bidder.Fast forward to today, and these romantic scenes have given way to a vibrant, brilliant mix of influences. Nowhere is this blend of cultures more evident than in the food and drink we have on offer across the UK. Whether it’s Turkish meze or Korean fried chicken, chances are you’ll be able to find it here. In terms of food and flavours, Britain’s multiculturalism has always been a string in our bow, and for Lugger Rum – which is made in Devon’s Lyme Bay Winery – this international twist is essential to a modern-day rum.Lugger Rum seamlessly blends complex flavours and spices to create a rounded, subtly complex, yet richly flavoured sipping spirit. Here’s how:The Caribbean connectionTake your windswept Devon coastline and add Trinidadian and Guyanese rum, aged in charred Tennessee barrels to add smoky, vanilla notes. The resulting spirit pulls back on the sweetness thanks to the unique style of these aged rums, unlike many of the commercial, more confected varieties.Spice it upCloves were lauded by Chaucer and Shakespeare for the unique flavour they imparted to ales and pies, and Elizabethan royalty would use them in pomanders to mask unsavoury bodily aromas. During the spice wars of the 17th century ships went to great lengths to bring these spices to our shores.Nutmeg, highly sought after for its curative and mildly hallucinogenic properties, as well as its culinary ones, used to be worth more than livestock per kilogram. Britain couldn’t get enough of this exotic flavour, and using it became a sign of wealth. Now they’re two of the spices found in Lugger Rum.The Mediterranean twistLugger’s flamboyant, citrus peel kick on the finish harks back to Plantagenet times, when expensive deliveries of oranges from the Mediterranean would be requested by Edward I’s Spanish wife, Eleanor of Castile, to remind her of home. Their beguiling scent permeated London’s theatre scene during Restoration England, when oranges were sold to theatregoers by wenches such as the infamous Nell Gwyn, who became Charles II’s mistress.Lugger Rum is the result of centuries of British history and the inquisitive, innovative minds at Lyme Bay Winery. Here is a team who have been helping lead the surge in quality and discovery of English wines, and are now turning their hand to fine spirits. Their rum is a nod to all the delicious things that made the British food and drink scene what it is today, as well as the notorious smugglers who managed to supply more illegal brandy and rum to the West Country than was ever legally imported into the capital. The finish on Lugger Rum is sure to be a little smoother, however, than the contraband hooch dragged up the beach from those little lugger boats.Lugger Rum is a Caribbean rum aged in Devon, featuring sophisticated notes of orange peel, nutmeg, cloves and vanilla.

But have we been blessed with the new Nadiya? On your marks, get set … GET HAPPY! The Great British Bake Off – the show that brought the nation together at the exact same time everything else fell in the bin like a sabotaged baked alaska – is 10 years old. To celebrate, we get … another scrumptious series of The Great British Bake Off (Channel 4). No surprises hidden like currants in a fruit cake. No crimes or misdemeanours (not yet anyway). No boat-rocking channel switches. Just some decent folk getting in a tizzy over the height of their genoise in a Berkshire tent.Let’s face it, reviewing Bake Off is now about as necessary as scoring your nan’s scones. Of course they’re going to be just right, you ungrateful wretch. Nevertheless, like those scones, Bake Off commands attention, praise, respect. And we show this recognition not by making ‘mmmm’ noises and saying ‘your best yet, nan’ but via the cooking up of vast amounts of column inches, manufactured scandals, and thinkpieces on what it really means when Paul Hollywood describes Michelle’s Fairy House showstopper as “faultless” yet doesn’t give her the handshake. Is it unconscious bias? Because it’s the first episode and he doesn’t want to peak too soon? Or has the handshake been overused to the point of redundancy and will now only be rolled out in the event of another bread lion?We will never know, but I’m racing ahead when what we’re after is a low-and-slow bake. So to the opening tableau a riff on The Wizard of Oz. Noel Fielding, droll, kind, cheeky-faced, is Dorothy. Sandy Toksvig is the scarecrow with no brain (Noel: “That’s the QI gig gone!”). Prue Leith – she of the showstopper necklaces and compassionate judging – is the lion. And Hollywood is the tin man. No heart. “Is it weird that I fancy you now?” Toksvig asks Fielding as they wander across the lawn and we wait for the theme, the aural equivalent of stepping into a warm bath, to kick in. “So do I,” mutters Hollywood. Hil. Ar. I. Ous.It’s cake week, and the signature challenge is a fruit cake, which is all about batter consistency. Too thin and the fruit drops to the bottom, too thick and … whatevs. What we’re really interested in is the texture of the contestants. Will we be blessed with a Nadiya or Rahul? Who’s going to be the anal Brendan-y one? (Henry, without a doubt: just look at his royal iced house). The posh one who induces automatic fond eye-rolls whenever they mention using pullet eggs from their own chickens? (A toss-up between vet Rosie and geography teacher Alice). The clumsy one? (Michael: he keeps cutting himself but still makes a treasure chest cake with about three fingers.) As all Bake Off fans know, the ideal contestant will be the perfect cake mix of wit, compassion, baking flair, self-deprecation, team spirit, and comedy stress responses. It’s too early to say, but I’m keeping an eye on Steph and Michelle.Much has been made of how young the group is this year, and it’s true that seven out of 13 are in their 20s. Jamie, 20, is easily the silliest. One of those inexplicable people who looks like he’s having the best time even while failing to add eggs to his caramel schnauzer. “It’s like mixing concrete,” he grins. Special mention, also, to Helena, who “lives like every day is Halloween” and makes the droopiest bat wings ever crafted out of sugar. “From one goth to another I know you’ll be fine,” Fielding reassures her. God love him, and all goths who bake. Her genoise is so rubbery, she says, that if it fell on the floor it would bounce right back. Tragically, this doesn’t happen.But her showstopper leads to the episode’s best moment. Based on the fairy garden Helena imagined as a child, she explains that she now has an actual fairy garden at home. Hollywood looks a bit smirky. Turns out he thought she said furry garden. Oooooh, naughty! “Oh Paul,” says Helena, slightly hysterical. “I know what you’re thinking.” Cue a query about how big her furry garden is, at which point I started to miss Mary Berry, because her confused-amused face would have been priceless.No matter. Bake Off remains a constant in this otherwise sugar-free life. A place where catastrophe is a dropped cake that can always be squashed back together.

Instead, it will be available from 4 September exclusively on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and iView, designed to watch on that same device you’re told to turn off at the cinema.“The premise was: how do you take a conventional movie structure and put it on a phone? Then we developed it from there,” says executive producer for the ABC, Que Minh Luu.The show is a comedy about a narcissistic millennial determined to become an online influencer, no matter what it takes – from keeping the camera rolling during a literal car crash (prescient, it turns out), to performing her first “mukbang”.The high concept is that it unfolds in real time, entirely from the perspective of the protagonist’s smartphone.We not only see the social media posts, video calls and various online exploits of young Brisbane woman Lucy (Charlotte Nicdao), but also every action she performs on her smartphone, including backspaces and things she deletes. This enables the film-makers to put an interesting spin on the old “show don’t tell” dictum, providing a digital window into Lucy’s mind.Watching Content feels like eavesdropping on somebody else’s private communication – or observing a phone that’s suddenly become possessed.Presented in a portrait ratio that takes up the entirety of the viewer’s smartphone, Content has been billed as “Australia’s first ever vertical video series”. It belongs to a small genre of narrative productions told entirely through screens, such as the feature film thrillers Searching and Unfriended, which unfold via laptop and smartphones.Co-director Daley Pearson, who executive-produced the smash-hit animated kids show Bluey, attributes part of his inspiration for Content to the realisation that “if I was to die and whatever god there was gave me stats on my life, I’m pretty sure I would be shocked to find out how much of the relationships with people I love the most were lived through phones”.It required a different kind of writing. The question “what happens next?” is a common one in the construction of narratives. However, in this instance, the plot was written and developed in tiny increments, capturing the small but dramatically meaningful actions Lucy performs through her phone.Sign up to receive the top stories from  Australia every morning“Every day we would be making the next couple of seconds up,” says Pearson. “We would stick to the story – the spine was the same – but everything you see on the screen, every comment that pops up on the screen for example, was written. Everything was created.”To research how audiences would react to the show, focus group test screenings were held during which the film-makers observed viewers through two-way mirrors.“We had explained the concept to them, but most people were quite flummoxed until they actually saw it in front of their own eyes,” recounts Luu.“What we got out of those sessions was that people understood the format. They got it. They understood that this way of absorbing a story could be funny and dramatic and engaging to watch.”Presenting a narrative in this style led to unexpected discoveries. The film-makers, for example, observed how viewers responded when, while watching Content, notifications from their own devices appeared on the screen, mixed in with Lucy’s.When you compare this situation to traditional films, says Pearson, “the equivalent would be that you’re watching a western and somebody comes into the cinema on a horse. You’d think: is that for me? Is this part of the movie? We were a bit worried about this. We thought, do we ask people to put their phones on flight mode?“I was very concerned that we were putting the conceit ahead of the characters. That kept me up at night. But in this instance, the story felt like it couldn’t have been told another way.”• Content premieres on 4 September exclusively on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and iView"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13963b5aaa5214e2d29f95384993077f997ce6e8/0_284_4932_2959/master/4932.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d6ce323939ba2330bc59b859e97b2b82","title":"prince andrew virginia giuffre epstein accuser","story":"Royal has previously denied Virginia Giuffre’s accusation that she was forced to have sex with himAn accuser of the financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein on Tuesday addressed her accusation that she was coerced into sex with Prince Andrew, saying the royal “knows what he’s done”.Virginia Giuffre had already alleged in 2011 testimony that Andrew “knows the truth” about Epstein’s abuse of underage girls and said he should be made to testify. In a December 2014 court filing she alleged that she was made to have sex with Andrew and other friends of Epstein.The prince has always vehemently denied the allegations. In 2015 a court decided that the allegations made by Giuffre about the prince were “immaterial and impertinent” and ordered them to be struck out of a claim against Epstein.On Tuesday, Giuffre, who now lives in Queensland with her Australian husband, spoke to reporters outside federal court in Manhattan. She was one of nearly two dozen women who spoke about alleged sexual abuse by Epstein during a unique court proceeding scheduled after the financier’s death in prison on 10 August, which was ruled a suicide.Epstein’s death at 66 brought an end to his criminal case but the judge gave accusers the opportunity to speak publicly.“He knows what he’s done and he can attest to that,” Giuffre said about Prince Andrew, a video of the press conference showed. “He knows exactly what he’s done, and I hope he comes clean about it.”Brad Edwards, a lawyer representing a number of Epstein accusers, said that “with respect to Prince Andrew or anyone else who made statements, gratuitous statements, if anyone wants to come over here and talk with us, and answer real questions that the victims have, and that we have on their behalf, we welcome that invitation.“I personally extended that invitation to Prince Andrew multiple times.

The prince also said he stayed at several of Epstein’s homes.The prince also said: “His suicide has left many unanswered questions and I acknowledge and sympathize with everyone who has been affected and wants some form of closure.“This is a difficult time for everyone involved and I am at a loss to be able to understand or explain Mr Epstein’s lifestyle. I deplore the exploitation of any human being and would not condone, participate in, or encourage any such behaviour.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8d30e12770e2a852b78b6f3c7ccf990f4a441c4/285_220_2715_1629/master/2715.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cdf35f801a48d5d0d264088b302b868c","title":"coalition talks resume in effort to avert snap elections in italy","story":"M5S and Democratic party in last-ditch attempt to form new coalition governmentTalks between Italy’s anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S) and the centre-left Democratic party (PD) have resumed in a last-ditch attempt to form a new government.The longstanding rivals are under pressure to present a convincing pact to the president, Sergio Mattarella, on Wednesday.Discussions have been hampered because of clashes over who would lead the coalition and who would hold ministry positions. The PD succumbed to demands from M5S for Giuseppe Conte, who last week ended the fraught alliance between the party and the far-right League, to be reinstated as prime minister. The PD has insisted that the M5S leader, Luigi Di Maio, steps down as deputy prime minister in return.To complicate matters, M5S said it would ask members to vote on any deal agreed with the PD on Rousseau, the online network it often uses to make policy decisions. The vote would only takes place if Mattarella gives the parties a mandate to form a government.The chaos was prompted by the deputy PM and interior minister, Matteo Salvini, who dramatically withdrew the League from its coalition government with M5S this month as he sought to exploit his high popularity to force snap elections in an effort to become the next prime minister.Di Maio and Nicola Zingaretti, the PD leader, have been under pressure to strike a deal in an attempt to avert elections that could create western Europe’s first fully far-right government, despite their personal reservations and resistance from factions within their parties.Mattarella, who has the power to dissolve parliament and call new elections, will hold consultations with leaders from Italy’s main parties – the PD, Forza Italia, the League and M5S – from 4pm (CET). He said last week that unless a strong new parliamentary majority could be formed, he would call snap elections.Conte, a 55-year-old lawyer, has accumulated many fans since his blistering attack on Salvini in the Senate last week, not least Donald Trump, who gave his endorsement on Twitter.“Starting to look good for the highly respected prime minister of the Italian Republic, Giuseppe Conte,” Trump tweeted. “Represented Italy powerfully at the G7. Loves his country greatly and works well with the USA. A very talented man who will hopefully remain prime minister!”Conte met Trump in the US last year, and the pair were reunited at the G7 summit in Biarritz."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e71db12a977df2bf5d2e6b8d77ffe67971024d0/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=551e4ff3b77c25a55e28b5ef9a550fb9","title":"russia pushing unsuitable nuclear power in africa critics claim","story":"Moscow aiming to win influence by wooing African states with nuclear energyRussia is attempting to gain influence in Africa and earn billions of pounds by selling developing nations nuclear technology that critics say is unsuitable and unlikely to benefit the continent’s poorest people.Representatives of Rosatom, the Russian state corporation responsible for both the military and civil use of nuclear energy, have approached the leaders of dozens of African countries in the past two years.The company, which is building a $29bn reactor for Egypt, has concluded agreements with Uganda, Rwanda, Ghana, South Africa and others. Winners of an Africa-wide competition were rewarded with an “educational” trip to Russia that included visits to a nuclear power plant and the “science city” of Obninsk. Rosatom is among international groups that are exporting light-water technology, which is generally considered among the safest, and is building a $13bn light-water reactor in Bangladesh. But such reactors typically generate more than 1,000 megawatts and very few countries in sub-Saharan Africa have the capacity to distribute that amount of power.Nuclear power’s supporters argue that the lengthy construction times of nuclear reactors allow poorer countries to build up their infrastructure. But Névine Schepers, a nuclear expert at the International Institute of Strategic Studies in London, said light-water technology was not suited to many African countries.“In terms of economic sense smaller countries that have a long way to go to develop their grids would be better off aiming for something like smaller modular reactors,” she said.Technology for cheaper reactors that would produce about 300MW is being developed in Russia, China and the US.Another concern is that the expensive projects favoured by Rosatom would not benefit Africa’s poorest people. In most countries energy is generated in large, centralised plants and distributed over a national grid – a model that would be reinforced in Africa by nuclear power.“Access to energy is a basic human right and necessary for a dignified life. The majority of those denied this right live in Africa,” said Friends of the Earth. “However, the expansion of profit-driven nuclear energy in Africa would only exacerbate the problem.”The environmental NGO said the answer to Africa’s energy needs lay in “efficient technology that meets the daily needs of people, in the hands of communities and municipalities, and controlled democratically”. Only small-scale and interconnected grids that were democratically managed could deliver energy sovereignty to African people, it added.Rosatom has accused Friends of the Earth and other NGOs of “hardline anti-nuclear activism … based on a position well known for being completely biased and riddled with factual errors”. It said its priority was “sustainable development” and that nuclear energy was “intrinsically immune to any form of political manipulation”.Selling nuclear technology is part of an effort by Russia to build influence, power and trade across Africa, with growing involvement in nations across the continent.The involvement of Russian mercenaries in the Central African Republic and Sudan has attracted significant attention, as has an apparent effort to influence elections in South Africa in May.Many of the African countries that have signed commercial agreements of the kind being pursued by Rosatom are run by movements or iniduals who have long-standing relationships with Russia or – more often – the USSR.In early April João Lourenço, the president of Angola, visited Moscow for talks with Vladimir Putin and top officials, to discuss arms sales, diamond mining, and gas and oil production. Russia delivered six Su-30K fighter jets to Angola this year and two more are expected in the second part of a billion-dollar deal. Lourenç, who fought in Angola’s war of independence against Portugal, studied in Moscow from 1978 to 1982. Angola was a cold-war battleground and the USSR backed the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola, still the ruling party.Alex Vines, head of the Africa programme at Chatham House, said “reactivating old Soviet networks” had been a clear strategy in Moscow for a couple of years. “The old history can play very positively in some places.”Patrick Smith, editor of Africa Confidential, an investigative newsletter, said: “Russians can’t write big cheques but have mastered the art of making themselves really popular, albeit with some of the worst leaders in Africa. They want the ties too. The more powers they can play off against each other, the better.”The campaign has had setbacks. A deal in South Africa went wrong when Jacob Zuma was  removed from power amid corruption allegations last year. A furore surrounding a $75bn contract to build power stations with a combined 9.6 gigawatt output badly damaged the image of Russia."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c65d563f04c262ea5af171bf1281c1db1efa7bfa/1727_877_3745_2247/master/3745.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a61997bf9c2fcc0bb9961988b64ad8c0","title":"wednesday briefing alarm as government backs use of force by teachers","story":"Discipline regime for schools rolled up with £3.5bn funding … Epstein accuser’s message to Prince Andrew … and hits and misses at the box office Good morning from me, Warren Murray.

Rebel soldiers drive past their roadside bread ovens daily. A spectre of violence remains. Regardless, Yvette Abaka and her female baking collective make dough and roll with it.In this impoverished, rebel-held corner of the Central African Republic (CAR), this group of mothers came together last year to better their lot. Since then, their loaves have become a hit in the wider community, promoting the women as their families’ breadwinners and promising further, quietly profound, change.“This bakery makes us more powerful than before,” says Abaka, the group’s leader and a 50-year-old mother of two. “My husband respects my work. Now I am his equal.”In this turbulent country, scarred by years of conflict, Abaka’s bakers are not the only people hoping for something good to come out of the troubles. Following a major ceasefire brokered earlier this year between the government and 14 rebel militias, groups of women are coming together across the nation to reinforce the grand strategy for peace at a community level. They are rebuilding their country from the ground up, forging formidable sisterhoods in the ashes of a protracted conflict.High rates of sexual violence, maternal mortality and teenage births have made CAR one of the worst places in the world to be a woman. But now female activists, displaced mothers and survivors of rape have joined forces to heal deep wounds and restore trust between opposing ethnic factions as part of an ambitious attempt to mend a broken country in the heart of Africa.Besides Abaka’s bakers, another group called Femme Debout (“Woman Standing”) is defying religious tensions by bringing together Christian and Muslim widows in Bangui, CAR’s capital, teaching them commercial skills and helping traumatised iniduals recover collectively. Elsewhere, in camps for displaced people, where people shelter from militants who use sexual violence as a weapon of war, survivors enrol with associations to fight the stigma of rape and to cultivate hope.“Such groups are vital forces for social change,” says Viola Giuliano, a researcher in CAR for the Center for Civilians in Conflict, an NGO focused on civilian protection. “They are uniquely placed to find and prioritise solutions and enable a sense of ownership of the peace process, which is key for sustainable, long-term reconciliation.”Ever wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous? Could it be because news is almost always grim, focusing on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame?This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theIn the northern village of Bamingui, lead baker Abaka is familiar with such horrors of war, having survived six years of it. In 2013, an alliance of mainly Muslim rebels assembled close to her village before running amok through the rest of the country, committing atrocities and seizing power in a bloody coup d’etat. In response, “anti-balaka” militias consisting of Christians and animists rose up and carried out revenge attacks against Muslim communities.Increasing waves of violence killed thousands, displaced more than a million people and prompted warnings from the United Nations of an impending genocide. The rebel coalition has since fragmented into numerous armed groups competing over territory and access to mineral reserves.Among the many fatalities was Abaka’s son. Her brother, aunt and grandfather also perished in the bloodbath. Today, gunmen from the same rebel group that killed them frequently drive past her home and bakery. While the militants’ presence has taken on a surreal air of normality, Abaka’s war-weary community – like others nationwide – fear this uneasy truce could shatter at any time.“At first the kids were scared of all these weapons, but now they’re used to it,” she says. “But I do worry that the war will begin again. We’ve already lost so much. We cannot afford for it to happen again.”Despite these concerns she presses ahead, along with seven friends, with what they do best. They rise at dawn and congregate to scrub baking trays, gather large logs, chop up kindling and light fires in the kilns. Beneath a tin roof, they knead dough into hundreds of rolls. Small ones sell for the equivalent of 7p, a medium one for 14p, a loaf for 35p. Any profit is split between the women, allowing them to buy key household items and reinvest the remainder.Revenues are modest the impact, big. With almost half the country affected by acute food shortages and several regions teetering on the brink of famine, food production for malnourished communities is crucial. The bakers sell to local Muslim families, bringing once-ided communities together to intermingle in the marketplace.“This bakery is the only opportunity we have to make any money by ourselves,” says Estella Yarsara, Abaka’s fellow baker and a 27-year-old mother of five. “This work means I have some extra food for my children too. I do this to help myself and to help my family. We all want to lift up our community.”The job has upended a conservative hierarchy, helping Yarsara challenge her role in society: “If I have some money and my husband does not, I can intervene and support him. It is making our relationship more equal. I don’t have to depend on him. I have more strength in the family.”Their bakery opened last September, kickstarted by an EU-funded initiative. While this programme was focused primarily on wildlife conservation in the nearby Bamingui-Bangoran national park, officials were keen to reach out to the wider community. In addition to the bakery operation, other locals are taught how to farm guinea fowl, produce shea butter and air-dry beef in order to reduce an unsustainable dependence on bushmeat.Reverent Yakoudou, a park manager, knows the value of this investment: “Women are more reliable with money. They use all their profits to look after their family and reinvest in the business.” Abaka’s vision for the bakery’s future confirms this. She hopes eventually to open up a permanent shop, selling their bread among many other products: “That way we can help our children and our community even more.”Although separated by hundreds of miles of rebel-held roads, Abaka would find a sister in arms in Florence Atanguere, who runs the Femme Debout women’s association for widows and orphans in Bangui. Many of its members have suffered displacement and witnessed extreme violence, yet despite the war’s isions along religious lines, Christians and Muslims are welcomed alike.Supported by UNHCR, the UN’s refugee agency, the group meets every week on the edge of the capital to discuss their difficulties and successes. From sewing to soap-making, they are taught new skills, helping them foster solidarity and a boisterous, entrepreneurial spirit.“Little by little women are getting together to fight back,” says Atanguere, a mother of six who saw her brother stabbed to death when rebels stormed her neighbourhood in late 2013. She fled to a squalid camp for displaced people and eventually returned home three years later, founding the association with the women she met there. “We are sisters. We are all Central Africans. It doesn’t matter whether you’re Muslim or Christian. Here, we are all equal.”While the worst of Atanguere’s ordeal is over, more than 600,000 people remain displaced within CAR, with a similar number uprooted as refugees outside the country. Many of the women have been raped by militants. Yet among these exiled communities, there is resilience and a restless desire to rise above such harrowing circumstances.One of them is 18-year-old Céleste, who was five months pregnant when rebels attacked her village in northern CAR late one night. Gunshots and the roar of motorbikes woke her. “They raped many girls and tortured many men,” said Celeste, just 15 at the time of the attack. She wasn’t spared either. Four soldiers entered her house, each taking turns to rape her: “My pregnancy was visible but they still did it anyway.”Afterwards, she fled her village and hid in the bush for several days, surviving on whatever she could find to eat. Her distress was amplified by memories of what she had lost. Before the war, she had enjoyed helping her father farm cassava, okra and peanuts, participating at school as an enthusiastic dancer and eager pupil. Now, forced from home, her sense of helplessness grew when she learned a few days later that her fiance – the father of her unborn child – had been murdered in the course of a car-jacking.Céleste, whose name has been changed to protect her identity, eventually made it to a displacement camp on the outskirts of a rebel-held town called Kaga Bandoro. She moved into a cramped tent where she saw out the last few months of her pregnancy but could not shake off the psychological and physical pain of the attack. “Sleeping at night has been hard,” she said softly. “It is difficult to forget. I miss my fiance terribly.”Yet even in this overcrowded and perilous camp, where armed groups freely operate, Céleste has started to overcome this nightmare. A friend introduced her to a women’s association where fellow survivors of rape enter a shared process of mutual healing and, together, tackle the stigma of sexual violence.“I now feel that I have the strength to deal with what has happened,” said Céleste. “The pastor at church teaches us to forgive, let go and move on. During therapy sessions, we can express ourselves. We talk about what has happened and discuss any problems that we still face.”Céleste and her fellow members are keen to return to school. Their dream: to take up midwifery and help pregnant mothers receive the care that war and poverty have denied them.In spite of the camp’s dangers and dreadful conditions, her son is now two years old and in relatively good health. With her country edging towards greater stability, Céleste clings to the hope of a life beyond their tiny, dusty tent – for now, the only home her child has ever known.• Jack Losh is a journalist, photographer and filmmaker with a focus on conflict, conservation and humanitarian issuesThis article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

The CAO issued 74,657 round one offers to 51,513 applicants earlier this month but the round two offers are usually in the low thousands.Applicants should carefully consider their options and to be mindful of this Friday’s 5.15pm deadline (August 30th) by which an offer must be accepted.CAO communications officer, Eileen Keleghan said: “Many of the applicants receiving a second round offer today may have already accepted an offer in Round One, and it is important that they take the time to decide between these courses and inform CAO before the reply date of this Friday, 30 August at 5.15pm if they wish to accept the new offer.”Accepting a lower preference course in an earlier round does not prevent appplicants from receiving an offer in a subsequent round of a course higher up on their course choices list - if they are deemed eligible although accepting the new offer will automatically cancel the previous acceptance.“If this is an applicant’s first offer they can choose to accept this offer and this will not prevent them from receiving a higher preference course in a later offer round if they are deemed eligible,” Ms Keleghan said.“It is important to note, however, that the majority of offers have been issued at this stage and this may be the only offer that they will receive,” she added.Applicants who are unhappy with the course they have been offered, or those who have not received any offers, can check the “Available Places” facility on the CAO website .This option is where courses that remain unfilled are offered once all other offers have been made. Applicants who wish to consider this option can select it in the “My Application” section of the CAO website. The available places section o f currently has almost 200 courses advertised.Where there has been particular interest in a vacant places course, and the number of new applicants exceeds the number of places left, the normal CAO rules apply, where those with the highest points secure the offer.The list of vacant places will continue to be published on the CAO website over the coming weeks or for as long as places are on offer.For applicants who have already received an offer in a previous offer round, CAO provides the following advice:1. Accept the new offer by the ‘Reply Date’ of Friday, August 30th at 5.15pm if you prefer this course to the one that you have already accepted - this action automatically cancels your previous acceptance.2. If you do not wish to accept the new offer you can simply do nothing and your previous acceptance will still stand.3. If you wish to defer your current offer you must contact the Admissions Office of the offering institution immediately by email with the text ‘Deferred Entry’ in the subject line of the email.

She is now working as a locum junior doctor in a hospital in Mallow, handy training for the sleep deprivation which comes with being the Rose of Tralee where a round of early interviews are scheduled for the morning after the night before. She has long been a fan of the festival and says she used to cry when the ballad, The Rose of Tralee, was sung after the winner is announced, but was overwhelmed with shock that she couldn’t cry on Tuesday night after her victory. Once again the bookies were uncannily accurate. She was the bookies’ favourite and her odds were quoted at 74. “People had mentioned it in passing,” she said. “I find it hard to believe that anybody knew us well enough to know what was happening in that sense.“We weren’t looking at our phones. We were just living in the moment with each other.” She also missed the fuss surrounding the comments made by Newstalk host Susan Keogh who said the festival was not representative of modern Irish women and went on to inquire as to where were the fat women, the homeless women, the women from direct provision in the festival. Dr Flanagan’s predecessor Kirsten Mate Maher condemned the comments in trenchant terms describing Keogh as an “attention-seeker” who was ignorant of what the festival was really about. Dr Flanagan is slightly more diplomatic. She said the 32 women who were in the live final were a representation of “what it means to be Irish. It’s a celebration of family and of friendship. Just speaking for myself, I would like to think I was a modern Irish woman. For me it is definitely representative of me and 31 fabulous girl from all kind of professions and family.” She hopes to carry on working and carrying out her duties as the Rose of Tralee. a selection of the best pictures from this years International Festival  "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3999768.1566974361!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"epstein accuser urges prince andrew to come clean","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tVirginia Giuffre, an alleged victim of Jeffrey Epstein, center, pauses while speaking with members of the media outside of federal court in New York, on Tuesday. Photographer: Mark KauzlarichBloombergA woman who alleges she was a victim of convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein and claimed she was forced into a sexual encounter with the Duke of York has urged the royal to “come clean”.Virginia Giuffre was speaking to reporters after a hearing for alleged victims of the disgraced financier and said Prince Andrew, a son of Queen Elizabeth, “knows what he’s done”.Since Epstein’s death, there have been a number of reports about his relationship with the duke, including that the pair travelled together on Epstein’s private jet with teenager Virginia Roberts, now known as Giuffre.Mrs Giuffre has claimed in court papers in Florida that she was forced to have sex with the duke when she was aged 17, under the state’s age of consent.Her allegations, which the duke denies, were struck from US civil court records in 2015 after a judge said they were “immaterial and impertinent”.Buckingham Palace has contested reports about the duke’s links to Epstein, including the private jet flights, over “a number of inconsistencies”.On Tuesday, 16 women who claim they were victims of Epstein spoke at a hearing in New York after a judge offered the accusers the opportunity to give statements about the impact of the alleged offending.“He knows exactly what he’s done and I hope he comes clean about it,” Mrs Giuffre said outside court in response to a request for comment about the duke.Andrew released a statement at the weekend expressing “tremendous sympathy” for Epstein’s alleged victims.He also reiterated that it was a “mistake” seeing Epstein (66) after the American’s release from an 18-month prison term in 2010 for prostituting minors.In the statement, the duke said: “It is apparent to me since the suicide of Mr Epstein that there has been an immense amount of media speculation about so much in his life.“This is particularly the case in relation to my former association or friendship with Mr Epstein.“Therefore I am eager to clarify the facts to avoid further speculation.“I met Mr Epstein in 1999. During the time I knew him, I saw him infrequently and probably no more than only once or twice a year. I have stayed in a number of his residences.“At no stage during the limited time I spent with him did I see, witness or suspect any behaviour of the sort that subsequently led to his arrest and conviction.”Epstein was found dead on August 10th in his prison cell in New York, where he was being held on sex trafficking charges.–PA "},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons august 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Order The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514. To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to telegraphmattprints or call 0191 603 0178.Brexit latest news: Boris Johnson asks Queen to suspend parliament as John Bercow calls it a \u0026#39constitutional outrage\u0026#39How would a vote of no confidence in Boris Johnson\u0026#39s government work, and will he win?What does it mean to suspend Parliament, and what is the impact on Brexit?The Great British Bake Off 2019, episode 1 review: series 10 kicks off with soggy bottoms, sliced fingers and middle-class madnessMissing US girl, 16, flew to UK from New York after being \u0026#39lured by older man she was texting\u0026#39 Audio Briefings: Sign up to our WhatsApp group for essential twice-daily updatesPrince Andrew ‘knows what he has done\u0026#39 and should \u0026#39come clean\u0026#39, claims Epstein victimWednesday morning news briefing: No blank cheques for BrexitComment: Don\u0026#39t give in to the anti-clutter bullies, we need our bits and piecesTeenager arrested over murder of teaching assistant found in cemeteryHumanitarian aid can be used to open up markets for UK companies, says International Development SecretaryShoppers are being ripped off by supermarkets with misleading offers, despite government crackdown Which? findsSocial media and body image are making our children the unhappiest for 25 yearsVaping ad banned for using \u0026#39bald head and eyebrows\u0026#39 suggesting Sir Mo Farah endorsed product, watchdog rulesSajid Javid warns there will be no blank cheques for Government departments in lead up to BrexitComment: Next week\u0026#39s Spending Round will clear decks to let us focus on BrexitJeffrey Epstein\u0026#39s first British \u0026#39victim\u0026#39 tells court he coerced and abused herThirteen metal detectorists rushed to hospital after chocolate birthday cake handed out at convention is spiked with cannabis oilWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"childrens happiness lowest level 25 years amid excessive social","story":"Almost a quarter of a million children in the UK – around 219,000 – report being unhappy with their lives as a whole, according to The Children’s Society.   Duty of Care CampaignDepartment for EducationBanner: Duty of CareChildren are the unhappiest they have been for almost 25 years, new data reveals, as charity experts blame “excessive social media use” for their increasing loneliness and turbulent friendships. Almost a quarter of a million children in the UK – around 219,000 – report being unhappy with their lives as a whole, according to The Children’s Society. The charity is warning that the decline in happiness, which is now at a record low for 10-15 year olds, is a “national scandal” exposing huge failings for the country’s most vulnerable children. It cites increasing issues surrounding boys’ appearance and body image, social media pressures, school and a lack of strong friendships as potential driving factors for plummeting happiness levels.Mark Russell, chief executive at The Children’s Society said: “Modern childhood is a happy and carefree time for most, yet for too many it is not. It is a national scandal that children’s unhappiness is increasing so quickly.  “Today’s young people are becoming progressively unhappy with their friendships – one of the fundamental building blocks of well-being – as well as appearance and school. We also know that excessive social media use is a factor linked to children’s low well-being.“Children are also burdened with fears ranging from worrying about the future, not having enough money to not feeling safe at school and bullying. Many young people tell us they feel side-lined and ignored by those in power.”UK trends in children’s happiness with different aspects of lifeThe charity is urging the Government to introduce a national measurement of children’s well-being which experts can respond to. His comments come as the Government is currently drawing up legislation which will impose a statutory duty of care on tech companies - enforced by an independent regulator - following the The ’s successful Duty of Care campaign.However this year researchers have found that children are the unhappiest they have been for almost a quarter-of-a-century.Over the past eight years there has been a significant decrease in happiness with life as a whole among more than 2,000 10-15-year-olds.According to the latest available data, in 201617, on a scale of one to ten, the mean happiness level among children was 7.89.This figure has not been this low since records began in 1995. The last time it was so low was in 1996 when the mean happiness for life as a whole among children equated to 8.0.Over the past eight years, researchers specifically noted a significant and specific fall in children’s happiness with their friends. Between 2009-10 the mean happiness rate for friendships was 8.99. By 2012-13, this had dropped to 8.78. For every year since 1996 - which saw a record low of 8.51 - children have been happier with their friendships. However by 20162017 the mean figure for children’s happiness with their friends has fallen to 8.70.Duty of Care white paperExperts said 2.8 per cent of children are unhappy with their friends and that “the wider research suggests that this could be down to factors as varied as bullying, being unable to spend time with friends outside of school, excessive social media use and loneliness”.Researchers also found that nearly one in 12 boys (7.7 per cent)– the equivalent of 180,000 – are unhappy with their appearance. Over 13s were significantly less happy with how they look compared to 10-12 year-olds. Historically, boys have been happier with their appearance than girls however the new data suggests that the gap is narrowing.  One boy who submitted his answers to the survey said “Like Instagram and stuff, right? You see all these models, you see all these weightlifters, body-builders and you look at yourself and you’re like – I look like a stick. I feel like we’re exposed to a lot more so we are less secure about our appearance.”Duty of Care campaign | Read moreTom Madders, Campaigns Director at YoungMinds, the children’s mental health charity, described the declining trend in happiness and friendships as “worrying”.“The reasons behind these trends are complex and multiple,” he said. “We do know that young people today can face a wide range of pressures, including stress at school, problems with friendships, bullying and concerns around body image, which can all have a huge impact on a young person’s mental health.” He added that difficult experiences in childhood including neglect, bereavement or growing up in poverty can also have a lasting effect.A Department for Education spokesman said: “We want young people growing up in a modern Britain to feel confident tackling the challenges life throws at them. That is why we’re giving teachers the power to deal with bad behaviour and bullying in the classroom, investing billions every year in mental health support for young people, and providing quicker access to specialist treatment where needed. Through our new compulsory health education, pupils will be taught how to recognise the signs of poor mental health and how to stay safe online.  “We’re also giving young people a voice on the issues they care about, such as the environment, climate change and crime or violence, through the Youth Charter currently in development.”Duty of Care CampaignDepartment for EducationBrexit latest news: Boris Johnson asks Queen to suspend parliament as John Bercow calls it a \u0026#39constitutional outrage\u0026#39How would a vote of no confidence in Boris Johnson\u0026#39s government work, and will he win?What does it mean to suspend Parliament, and what is the impact on Brexit?The Great British Bake Off 2019, episode 1 review: series 10 kicks off with soggy bottoms, sliced fingers and middle-class madnessMissing US girl, 16, flew to UK from New York after being \u0026#39lured by older man she was texting\u0026#39 Audio Briefings: Sign up to our WhatsApp group for essential twice-daily updatesPrince Andrew ‘knows what he has done\u0026#39 and should \u0026#39come clean\u0026#39, claims Epstein victimWednesday morning news briefing: No blank cheques for BrexitComment: Don\u0026#39t give in to the anti-clutter bullies, we need our bits and piecesTeenager arrested over murder of teaching assistant found in cemeteryHumanitarian aid can be used to open up markets for UK companies, says International Development SecretaryShoppers are being ripped off by supermarkets with misleading offers, despite government crackdown Which? findsVaping ad banned for using \u0026#39bald head and eyebrows\u0026#39 suggesting Sir Mo Farah endorsed product, watchdog rulesSajid Javid warns there will be no blank cheques for Government departments in lead up to BrexitComment: Next week\u0026#39s Spending Round will clear decks to let us focus on BrexitJeffrey Epstein\u0026#39s first British \u0026#39victim\u0026#39 tells court he coerced and abused herThirteen metal detectorists rushed to hospital after chocolate birthday cake handed out at convention is spiked with cannabis oilBoris Johnson risks clash with Brexiteers if he only secures concessions from EU on the Irish backstopWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/cricket/2019/08/26/TELEMMGLPICT000207342971_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq-rliM5zHz0XWvGpEs52xCXzYxy3cFh7YvYpmjsGRqOA.jpeg?imwidth=","title":"cricket bosses squandering golden chance entice next generation","story":"Where will the next Ben Stokes come from with grassroots cricket under threat?Nobody knows the first thing about prejudice, wrote Paul Johnson, unless they are a red-haired, left-handed Catholic.

It’s going to be fine.” He went on to slice his finger three times during filming, requiring large plasters.The weekly showstopper challenge saw contestants asked to create the cake of their childhood dreams, with fairy gardens, toadstool houses, pirate islands and purple carousels from the younger bakers and a “retro” rocket from veteran of the group Phil, 56. Despite their difficulties, the bakers appeared to have impressed the judges. Hollywood said: “Every year of Bake Off, the standard has got better and better and better, and I expect this year to be just the same.”Evicted from the tent was 33-year-old support worker Dan, who said his wife had helped him practice along with his “amazing” parents.  “I am not going to miss the baking under pressure,” he said. “I’m just going to miss everyone in that tent.”The Great British Bake Off will be on Channel 4 at 8pm on Tuesdays.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

The Duke has always denied the allegations and any involvement. Lawyer David Boies, representing several of Jeffrey Epstein\u0026#39s alleged victims arrives with Annie Farmer, second right, and Virginia GiuffreMrs Roberts-Giuffre was one of several accusers on Tuesday to mention Miss Maxwell by name in an emotionally-charged hearing, held to close the case against Epstein, who died on August 10 from suspected suicide inside a Manhattan jail.Chauntae Davies gave a harrowing account of being recruited by Miss Maxwell, and raped on his US Virgin Island home.“I was searching for words but all I could say was ‘no’,” she said. “But that seemed to excite him more.“I ran off, my feet bloody from the rocks on the island. I cried myself to sleep that night.”Another Epstein accuser, South African-born Sarah Ransome, told the court that she too was “a victim of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.”She added: “We all know that he did not act alone. We are all survivors, and the pursuit of justice should not end.”Multiple women have filed civil lawsuits against Epstein\u0026#39s estate since his death, saying he abused them and seeking damagesMiss Maxwell, 56, has always denied accusations of any wrongdoing, and has accused Mrs Roberts-Giuffre of lying. Mrs Roberts-Giuffre then sued for slander in a case which was settled in 2017, but whose documents were unsealed last month.Since then the British heiress’s whereabouts have remained unknown, with her lawyers refusing to respond to The ’s requests for comment. On August 14 she was reported to have been lying low in a Massachusetts mansion a day later The New York Post published a photo of her – the first since 2016 - taken at a Los Angeles burger bar. The paper claimed the photo was taken earlier that week. She has not been seen since.In court on Tuesday, accuser after accuser stepped forwards to tell how Epstein and his associates inflicted immeasurable damage on their lives.Among them was the first British woman to publicly allege abuse by the late financier. Anouska de Georgiou, 42, an actress who was at school with the Duchess of Cambridge, gave a heartfelt speech about the impact of Epstein\u0027s actions.Anouska De Georgiou appeared in the 2004 film Alfie with Jude LawShe said: When I was introduced to Jeffrey Epstein I was young and full of hope and the foolishness of a teenager. Jeffrey Epstein manipulated me, coerced me and abused me.He cannot begin to fathom what he did to us. Although I think it is tragic when anyone died before their time, I am extremely relieved he will not be able to hurt any more children.Epstein was known to have travelled to the UK several times, staying at Sandringham as a guest of the Duke of York, and attending, along with the Queen, the duke’s 40th birthday party in June 2000 at Windsor Castle. Jennifer Araoz, who came forward on July 10 to accuse Epstein of raping her when she was 14, fought back tears to detail the years of torture she has suffered since her attack.“The fact that I will never have the chance to face my predator in court eats away at my soul,” she said.“This weak, evil coward will never steal our inner strength. And he will never, ever, ever steal our voice.”Death of a financier | Jeffrey Epstein’s final daysMany of Epstein\u0027s accusers agreed with the financier\u0027s legal team that an investigation into his strange death must give answers. Reid Weingarten, Epstein\u0027s lawyer, said that Epstein\u0027s body had been moved before forensic analysis could be carried out, and demanded to know why the prison guards were reportedly refusing to testify about events on the night of his death, and why his team had not been able to view video camera footage from inside the jail.The footage, he said, was corrupted, and he wanted to know how long the system had been malfunctioning.What if the tapes only broke down when he died? Then we are in a whole different territory, he said, saying that the whole case was full of conspiracy theory galore.I think it is the understatement of the year to say the world looks and feels different to when I last stood here, he said. The elephant in the room is what happened to our client.Courtney Wild, whose July 15 testimony helped ensure Epstein was not granted bail, echoed their anger at his untimely death.“Jeffrey Epstein sexually abused me for years, robbing me of my innocence and mental health,” she said. “Jeffrey Epstein robbed myself and the other victims of our chance to confront him, one by one. For that he is a coward.“I feel very angry and sad. Justice has never been served in this case.”Judge Richard Berman, presiding over the court, listened attentively as the women told their stories – many of them for the first time.In the front row sat Geoffrey Berman, US attorney for the Southern District of New York, whose decision to arrest Epstein on July 6 re-opened the case.He was surrounded by a roll call of America’s most high-powered and influential lawyers – among them Al Gore’s former lawyer David Boies, representing five of the victims Paul Cassell, a former federal prosecutor now working for four accusers and famed women\u0027s rights lawyer Gloria Allred, representing five women, and preparing to speak to several more.Time after time, Epstein was described as “sick” and “depraved”, a man who resorted to “insidious and pathological violence”.“In 2004, at the age of 14, I was flown to Jeffrey Epstein’s Zorro Ranch in New Mexico and molested for hours,” said one accuser, whose anonymous statement was read out by Ms Allred.“What I remember most vividly was him explaining how beneficial this was to me as he abused me. Especially as he positioned me on the floor, looking at the photos of him smiling with famous people.“After he finished with me, he wanted me to describe how good my first sexual experience was.”Brexit latest news: Boris Johnson asks Queen to suspend parliament as John Bercow calls it a \u0026#39constitutional outrage\u0026#39How would a vote of no confidence in Boris Johnson\u0026#39s government work, and will he win?What does it mean to suspend Parliament, and what is the impact on Brexit?The Great British Bake Off 2019, episode 1 review: series 10 kicks off with soggy bottoms, sliced fingers and middle-class madnessMissing US girl, 16, flew to UK from New York after being \u0026#39lured by older man she was texting\u0026#39 Audio Briefings: Sign up to our WhatsApp group for essential twice-daily updatesWednesday morning news briefing: No blank cheques for BrexitComment: Don\u0026#39t give in to the anti-clutter bullies, we need our bits and piecesTeenager arrested over murder of teaching assistant found in cemeteryHumanitarian aid can be used to open up markets for UK companies, says International Development SecretaryShoppers are being ripped off by supermarkets with misleading offers, despite government crackdown Which?

But we\u0027ve heard feedback over the years that the names weren\u0027t always understood by everyone in the global community.AFPGetty Images)Google is also updating the logo for Android, with the tech giant opting for a more modern, accessible look for Android 10.As with previous updates\u0026nbspof Android, Google will most likely roll out the latest version to Google Pixel devices before a wider release to other Android devices like Samsung and Sony.All versions of the Pixel, Pixel 2 and Pixel 3 will support Android 10, despite the original Pixel being outside Google\u0027s stated two-year support window.Other expected features of Android 10 include support for 5G, foldable phones, and improved privacy and security protections.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Tonight, the 10th series of the baking competition kicked\u0026nbspoff on Channel 4 (its third year on the network, after it controversially outbid the BBC). One particularly\u0026nbsphysterical tabloid headline predicted that\u0026nbspit was going to be filled with filthy innuendos and a simulated sex act. But to be honest, all things considered, it was fairly low in\u0026nbspdouble-entendres.\u0026nbspJudges Prue Leith and Paul Hollywood reprised their roles, as did hosts Noel Fielding and Sandi Toksvig.Just for fun, and with absolutely nothing to go on except their photos and a short bio, I predicted that this year\u0027s winner will be\u0026nbspMichael. And he\u0027s still going strong(ish).Here are the talking points from tonight\u0027s episode.\u0026nbspIt looked certain that Jamie –\u0026nbsp poor little Jamie, so young his voice broke midway through the episode – would be leaving, but it all boiled down to Dan’s terrible signature bake. Now Jamie has the chance to “prove to people I can actually bake”. Maybe he could tag team in with his twin and give it another shot?\u0026nbsp“I’m just so proud,” said the print shop administrator, whose carrot cake was “possible the best cake” Prue has ever eaten. Though I’m fairly sure Prue has said that too many times to be taken completely seriously.\u0026nbspIt’s one of the youngest years everThere is barely a grey hair in sight this year. The 28-year-olds are veritable veterans. But the very youngest contestants, who were barely into double figures when Bake Off began, have\u0026nbspproven themselves. Well, sort of. 20-year-old Jamie struggled, coming\u0026nbsplast in the technical challenge, and having to start\u0026nbspagain in the showstopper, but he managed to scrape through. And Henry, who’s also 20, is sailing ahead. The children are the futureBake Off has always been a show laden with double-entendres, but it is my belief that Paul should be banned from participating in them. Particularly when they’re directed at women. After becoming confused by Helena’s accent and thinking she was making a “furry garden” instead of a fairy garden, he then asked, a glint in his cold, blue eye, “So how big is your, er, FAIRY garden?” No. Fire him.\u0026nbspNerves get the better of everyoneWeek one is always the most nerve-wracking. It’s a wonder the contestants don’t collapse into a heap in the corner andor run off into the woods to start\u0026nbspa new life. “I can’t do it.” “The worst has happened,” and “I’ve dropped it,” are just three of the sentences uttered tonight. There was a dropped cake, a collapsed house, missing eggs…. Pull yourselves together, bakers.\u0026nbspNo one should ever try and make caramel.\u0026nbspIt crystallises. It does. It just does.\u0026nbspRemind yourself of this year\u0027s contestants and follow along with all the action from the tent live below:Meet the new Great British Bake Off contestantsPrue Leith opens up about sexist former head chef at SavoyHow to make chocolate crumpets from The Great Celebrity Bake OffPlease allow the live blog a moment to loadThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That is the highest number since February 2017.\u0026nbsp“It is possible that mortgage activity is being lifted by some people looking to complete their house purchases before Brexit occurs on 31 October, given the major uncertainties surrounding the UK successfully leaving the EU with a deal,” commented Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY ITEM Club.Data from Rightmove released last week supports this interpretation. House sales jumped 6.1 per cent over the month to 10 August compared with a year ago. Rightmove attributed the unexpected increase to the looming Brexit deadline and lower house prices.\u0026nbsp“There’s only so long that buyers and sellers can delay the familial, financial and emotional forces driving the need to move,” said Miles Shipside, housing market analyst at the company.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Nat Lofthouse statue is covered in flags at the University of Bolton Stadium, BoltonPerformers take part in Notting Hill Carnival.

Growth in net credit card spending slowed for the third consecutive month. The net amount – which is the\u0026nbspdifference between spending and repayments, adjusted for factors\u0026nbspsuch as\u0026nbsppopulation changes and write-offs –\u0026nbsprose by £49m, the weakest increase this year.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The rest wanted to move into the UK but changed their plans due to Brexit.\u0026nbspAnother 325 firms are thinking of setting up in the Netherlands for the same reason, the representative\u0026nbspsaid. Both sets of businesses include British firms as well as those from North America, Asia and Australia.“Brexit undeniably has economic implications for international businesses because they do business everywhere in Europe,” said Jeroen Nijland, NFIA commissioner.\u0026nbsp“The ongoing growing uncertainty in the United Kingdom, and the increasingly clearer possibility of a no deal, is causing major economic unrest for these companies. That is why more and more companies are orienting themselves in the Netherlands as a potential new base in the European market.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Nat Lofthouse statue is covered in flags at the University of Bolton Stadium, BoltonPerformers take part in Notting Hill Carnival.

That is the highest number since February 2017.\u0026nbsp“It is possible that mortgage activity is being lifted by some people looking to complete their house purchases before Brexit occurs on 31 October, given the major uncertainties surrounding the UK successfully leaving the EU with a deal,” commented Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY ITEM Club.Data from Rightmove released last week supports this interpretation. House sales jumped 6.1 per cent over the month to 10 August compared with a year ago. Rightmove attributed the unexpected increase to the looming Brexit deadline and lower house prices.\u0026nbsp“There’s only so long that buyers and sellers can delay the familial, financial and emotional forces driving the need to move,” said Miles Shipside, housing market analyst at the company.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Nat Lofthouse statue is covered in flags at the University of Bolton Stadium, BoltonPerformers take part in Notting Hill Carnival.

Growth in net credit card spending slowed for the third consecutive month. The net amount – which is the\u0026nbspdifference between spending and repayments, adjusted for factors\u0026nbspsuch as\u0026nbsppopulation changes and write-offs –\u0026nbsprose by £49m, the weakest increase this year.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The rest wanted to move into the UK but changed their plans due to Brexit.\u0026nbspAnother 325 firms are thinking of setting up in the Netherlands for the same reason, the representative\u0026nbspsaid. Both sets of businesses include British firms as well as those from North America, Asia and Australia.“Brexit undeniably has economic implications for international businesses because they do business everywhere in Europe,” said Jeroen Nijland, NFIA commissioner.\u0026nbsp“The ongoing growing uncertainty in the United Kingdom, and the increasingly clearer possibility of a no deal, is causing major economic unrest for these companies. That is why more and more companies are orienting themselves in the Netherlands as a potential new base in the European market.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Nat Lofthouse statue is covered in flags at the University of Bolton Stadium, BoltonPerformers take part in Notting Hill Carnival.

Customers can still access Online Banking via direct links, they can use their mobile app, ATMs, telephone banking, or visit their local branch.”New NatWest bank cards allow people to pay with fingerprintThe banks did however suggest that their apps are still working as normal, and that customers with pressing issues could message the bank through that for more help.They did say however that the problems mean that there may be a delay in hearing back.Customer support wait times may be longer than usual, NatWest warned on Twitter.

Despite a warning from Dominic Cummings, his top adviser, not to get carried away by positive talk from Angela Merkel, many Downing Street officials are convinced that there are signs the EU side is prepared to shift its ground.\u0026nbspBoris Johnson in his news conference at the end of the G7 summit said he was “marginally more optimistic” that a Brexit deal could be done that would avoid a no-deal exit on 31 October.\u0026nbspAnd a No 10 spokesperson told journalists yesterday: “What is clear is that if there is goodwill on both sides, and a determination to get things done, solutions to the backstop exist and the prime minister believes they should be discussed.”She was pressed on whether a change to the backstop – the\u0026nbspfall-back arrangements to keep the Irish border open – would be sufficient, and said: “We have been clear the changes we are seeking relate to the backstop.”This could go down badly with several Eurosceptic Tory MPs, who have warned that simply dropping the backstop would not be enough. Iain Duncan Smith, David Davis, John Redwood, Steve Baker and Mark Francois have all said the backstop is not the only thing that makes the withdrawal agreement unacceptable. They complain about the orce bill, the transition period and the persistence of EU law (because some citizenship issues have an eight-year phase-out).\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Biggest lies told by Boris Johnson Show all 5Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.15 Made-up quote for The TimesJohnson was sacked from The Times newspaper in the late 1980s after he fabricated a quote from his godfather, the historian Colin Lucas, for a front-page article about the discovery of Edward II’s Rose Palace. “The trouble was that somewhere in my copy I managed to attribute to Colin the view that Edward II and Piers Gaveston would have been cavorting together in the Rose Palace,” he claimed.25 Sacked from cabinet over cheating lieMichael Howard gave Boris Johnson two new jobs after becoming leader of the Conservatives in 2003 – party vice-chairman and shadow arts minister.35 Broken promise to bossIn 1999 Johnson was offered editorship of The Spectator by owner Conrad Black on the condition that he would not stand as an MP while in the post.

The Vote Leave campaign also produced a poster reading: “Turkey (population 76 million) is joining the EU”On the other hand, Duncan Smith and Davis voted for Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement, along with Johnson, on the third time it was put to the Commons, in March. So I suspect they would in the end vote for a “better” agreement if Johnson asked them nicely.\u0026nbspWe would then be back to the nail-biting numbers game that dominated parliament early this year. In the end 28 Eurosceptic Tory MPs voted against May’s deal, and she was 30 votes short of the total she needed to get the deal through. Johnson has appointed four of the 28, including Priti Patel, to government jobs, and may be able to persuade a handful more.\u0026nbspHow the Brexit tribes are preparing the blame game ahead of no-dealBut Redwood, Baker and others are never going to vote for a deal, so the prime minister would be left needing about another 20 votes. If he can get changes to the backstop that are acceptable to the DUP, its 10 MPs would take him half way to the target.\u0026nbspThen\u0026nbsphe would still need 10 more votes from Labour MPs – such as Sarah Champion, who says she is prepared to leave the EU without a deal, and Stephen Kinnock, who now seems to regret not having voted for May’s deal.\u0026nbspJohnson said yesterday the chances of doing a deal were “touch and go”. Even if he succeeds, the same phrase describes his chances of getting it through parliament.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

From next June, only those over-s on pension credit will be eligible for free TV licences — just one in five people.That means .million pensioners, including more than , service veterans, will have to find £. a yearthey want to continue watching television.To add insult to injury, the BBC then disclosed how much money it is paying its stars.Anti-Brexit activist and Match Of The Day presenter Gary Lineker is on £,,, Graham Norton is on £, and Claudia Winkleman is on £,.Lineker’s salary alone would pay for more than , TV licences.Asthat wasn’t bad enough, earlier this month the Beeb said it intends to spend £million on an advertising campaign to attract young viewers and listeners.That’s more than the annual budget of Radio .It’s particularly high, given that the BBC can advertise on its own TV channels and radio stations for free. Apparently, the money is going to be spent on targeting young people on social media.Are we really supposed to believe that the BBC cannot afford to pay for pensioners’ TV licences, but can fritter away £million on Facebook adverts There’s almost nothing Auntie won’t stoop to in its desperate pursuit of the “yoof” audience.It has earmarked £million to promote its new Sounds app — including spending £, to transform the London Eye into the “London Ear” — and poured money into a series of increasingly tawdry podcasts, such as Gemma Collins talking about her le, a reality-show round-up called Reality Tea, and Unexpected Fluids, in which teenagers tell embarrassing ­stories about when sex goes wrong.It’s all a far cry from Lord Reith’s mission to explain.No doubt the BBC is concerned about how few young people it manages to attract — and this manests itself in other ways, too, such as its massive investment in apps and podcasts and its extensive online coverage of ITV’s Love Island.Last year, Ofcom revealed that  to -year-olds are spending an average of an hour and  minutes per day consuming BBC content, which is about half the amount for all age groups.Even more worrying for the Corporation, one in eight young Brits consumes no BBC content at all. Why should they fork out £. for the licence fee, particularly as many of them will already be paying for subscription TV services The fundamental problem the Beeb faces is that consumers are becomingly increasingly accustomed to paying for the TV content they want to watch and resent having to pay a mandatory flat tax to a single provider.The equivalent would beeveryone who owns a phone, tablet or laptop had to pay £. for an “internet licence” to fund Apple’s iTunes, regardless of whether or not they use the service.It’s time to do away with the licence fee — for everyone, not just the over-s.That would mean stripping down the state-funded parts of the BBC to its core news and current affairs output and funding that out of general taxation.It should sell off its profitable private isions — such as BBC Studios, which has annual revenues of more than £billion — and plough the money into creating its own subscription service.With its global brand recognition and unrivalled back catalogue, not to mention its reputation for high-quality drama, the BBC could easily compete with commercial providers such as Netflix and Amazon Prime.Promising to scrap the licence fee would surely be a vote-winner for Boris Johnson.What other election pledge would save nearly every British household £. a year No s, no buts. When it comes to renewing the BBC’s Royal Charter, it’s time to say: “No deal.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

As Boris was arguing, the real barriers to trade are not practical ones — they are taxes and regulations.Remainers continually lecture us on the benefits of free trade with the EU — and they are right to do so. Hardly anyone really wants to leave without a deal. If we do have to take that route it will surely not be long before discussions on a free trade deal recommence.Yet those same Remainers bizarrely retreat in horror when anyone suggests we do a free trade deal with the US. “But we’ll have to eat chlorinated chicken,” they complain, as well as GM “Frankenstein” food.As shown by their failure yesterday to agree on a common course of action to thwart Brexit, Remainers are bumbling along in a state of confusion.But nothing demonstrates this better than their contradictory approach to free trade. They seem to think it a great benefit to the country when conducted with the EU, but a route to national disastercarried out with any other country.The charge that anyone will be forced to eat chlorinated chicken or GM foods is, needless to say, a far bigger porky pie than anything Boris has said on the subject.It is far from certain that a Johnson Government, when engaged in trade talks with the US, will make the concessions allowing these products into UK markets, butit does, then UK shoppers will continue to have a choice.They will still be able to buy chicken produced in Britain or the EU, or they will be able to choose to eat American chicken.I certainly have no fear of eating chicken which has been washed in chlorine. The idea that it is “dangerous” has been thoroughly debunked. Each of us ingests far more chlorine through drinking water than we ever would do through eating US-produced chicken.As for GM foods, we already eat them, vegans especially. The EU allows imports of GM soyafor simple practical reasons. Most of it is grown in the Americas and too many growers there use GM seed for non-GM soya to be sold as a separate product.If we want free trade we are not going to achieve it just by persuading other countries to open their markets to us. No, we will have to make the concession of opening our markets to them too. But there is no reason to be frightened.True, there are some products which need to be banned from sale for genuine health and safety reasons. But most of the EU’s food product standards are really just a form of protectionism in disguise, dreamed up to block competition for European farmers.If we do post-Brexit trade deals with the US and other countries — and in the process do away with the EU’s protectionist tarfs and product standards — some UK producers would suffer.But others would prosper as they enjoyed access to new export markets. Overall, as is almost always the case when trade barriers are taken down, we would benefit. Strong industries would grow and consumers would enjoy greater choice and lower prices.Boris’s vision of a global British pork pie industry shows the dference between him and the political opponents who spent much of yesterday scheming over how to stop him taking Britain out of the EU.While his glass is half full, theirs is half empty.They are driven by a pathological fear of le outside the EU.It is not that they have any great enthusiasm for the EU. After all, I haven’t heard one of them make a convincing case why the EU is an institution to be admired. It is just that they have a lack of ambition for Britain and so cling to EU membership.After meeting for several hours yesterday, what did the likes of Jeremy Corbyn, Keir Starmer and Jo Swinson come up with That they want to extend Article  yet further, to prolong yet again the endless drt which unsettled markets and put off investment.Thanks to the Remain lobby’s endless infighting and self-indulgent argument over who it would like as a caretaker Prime Minister, that is exactly what is overwhelmingly likely to happen on October . Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBoris Johnson has confirmed he plans to hold a Queen’s Speech on October . That means MPs face a race against time to thwart the Prime Minister taking the UK out of the EU without a deal. Johnson says he wants an opportunity to set up new bills to ‘level up’ spending on his priorities, including the NHS, education and policing. But his plan will also dramatically cut down the amount of time MPs have to block Johnson pressing forward with a chaotic no-deal Brexit . Here’s everything you need to know about Boris Johnson ’s new plan - and what it means for Brexit. What is Boris Jonson doing - and why does it mean shutting down Parliament  He’s setting the date for a Queen’s Speech and State Opening of Parliament . This effectively reboots Parliament, setting off a new ‘session’ and shutting down the old one. This usually happens every year - but it doesn’t have to, and Theresa May chose not to have a Queen’s Speech in -, so she’d have more time to push Brexit plans through. That means weaposve now had the longest gap between Queenaposs Speeches for more than  years. To trigger a Queenaposs Speech Parliament has to have a short break, which usually lasts a few days. And when MPs , the slate is clear. Any legislation that was in the process of passing through Parliament is cancelled and MPs start the new session effectively from scratch.    What does proroguing Parliament mean  aposProrouguingapos means to suspend a session of Parliament without dissolving it. So ending one session and kicking off a new one with a Queenaposs Speech. Rebooting Parliament. What is the Queen’s Speech   It’s theannual address given by the Monarch to MPs and peers, opening the new session of Parliament. It’s used by the Prime Minister to outline the Government’s legislative programme for the upcoming session. How long would Parliament be suspended for   That hasn’t been revealed, but here’s the most likely scenario. Parliament is expected tofrom recess on Tuesday September . It’s then expected to sit until September  or , when it would break up for party conference season. Usually, Parliament wouldstraight away after the end of Conservative Party Conference, which finishes on October . What’s being suggested is that the conference recess be extended for another full week, ing for the Queen’s speech on Monday October . How would this affect plan to stop no deal   It massively slashes the amount of time MPs have to pass any kind of blocking measures through Parliament. Let’s assume the Commons sits Monday to Friday - which it doesn’t always, but let’s assume it would in a crunch. If the original timeline were to take place, there would be a maximum of eight sitting days before the conference recess. And assuming they ed the Monday after Tory conference, there would be scope for  sitting days between then and the October  deadline. That’s  days in which an anti-no-deal coalition could work on ways to block it. Now,there’s a Queen’s Speech on October , in all likelihood Parliament would stay in recess for the week before. There are usually five full days of debate following a Queen’s Speech - and another two days of votes on the speech on October -. This would make it exceptionally dficult to schedule any further business in the Commons during that time. So that would leave just seven potential sitting days between conferences and the Brexit deadline - and just  in total. There’s also the small matter of the European Council meeting on October , which will be the PM’s last opportunity to seal a new deal with the EU. Boris Johnson this morning said there will be “ample time” to debate Brexit before and after the October  meeting.  She can, but she won’t. The Queen’s role in this is almost entirely ceremonial. Even her speech to Parliament is written by the Government. Constitutional experts have said The Queen would do everything possible to avoid becoming involved in any political battle the country finds itself in.

Cheryl Royle and Gary Dobell had been looking forward to a romantic week away in Turkey. They had booked a week-long stay at the Ramada Hotel in Antalaya, reports the Daily Star. The hard-working couple, from Manchester, booked the resort with TUI and were happy to splash out £, on the break. But they say the trip got worse as it went on as they were exposed to a dirty room, greasy food and soiled towels. Have you suffered a holiday from hell  Email webnews@mirror  Cheryl tried to move rooms but she was laughed at and says she was told another room aposcouldnapost magically appearapos. Speaking to Daily Star Online, Cheryl said: It was diabolical. We had booked the Ramada Hotel because it looked like a really nice five-star resort on the website. But when we arrived, the hotel was nice but everything  was diabolical... it was vile. Iaposve been on five star holidays before and I expected that kind of calibre again but this was far from it. As soon as we got there we werenapost happy, it was quite late at night but we could see it was filthy.  If you looked at the room with the naked eye you thought it was okay but when you looked closer it was vile. We put our bags down in the room and tried to speak to a receptionist there and then but she informed us nothing could be done as the hotel was fully booked and there wasnapost a way we could change rooms. Gary said we should grab a drink and sort it out in the morning so thataposs what we did but the next day we had the same problem so we decided to speak to a TUI rep. In a bid to make the most of their holiday, Cheryl and Gary tried to put the state of the room behind them. But things worsened when the couple went to dinner and found food drenched in grease. The -year-old said: The food was awful - it was generally very greasy and lukewarm.    You would find some evenings there would be sprouts and the next day it would be put in the salads! The food was swimming in grease and the majority of it was inedible. You could tell the staff were unhappy as well, they looked sad and downtrodden. As the week went on the couple tried to see the funny side and took a sad picture outside the resort aimed at reflecting their time at the Ramada. The -year-old and her partner were once again left feeling disgusted after cleaners delivered them poo-stained sheets. Cheryl said: One of the days the cleaners served us with towels and it had poo on it.    I went down to reception and was served with dirty towels - they did then send up clean ones but it shouldnapost have happened in the first place. Gary and Cheryl also claim the pool wasnapost cleaned for the entire time that they were there. She said: On one afternoon my boyfriend lost his ring and I asked the reception to let us known when the pool had been cleaned and they said they would once it had been. I went back nearly every day that I was there, this happened on the third day and I went every day three times a day and the entire time I was there the pool wasnapost cleaned. I just feel as though it was a complete s***hole - it was a s*** pit and TUI didnapost give a clear indication of what the hotel was - it wasnapost for couples.

Camelot, which runs the National Lottery, has withheld Mark Goodram and Jon-Ross Watsonaposs prize money over fears they used funds obtained without the owneraposs consent to buy the lucky scratchcard. They have now hired controversial celebrity barrister Henry Hendron to fight their case in the High Court in London , the Daily Record reports. Goodram, , and Watson, , have issued a writ accusing Camelot of breaching their contract.    The convicted burglars claim they bought their scratchcard “legitimately” with a bank card belonging to a friend. Their lawyer has only recently ed to practice after a three-year suspension for supplying recreational drugs that killed his teenage boyfriend Miguel Jimenez. Hendron’s legal papers for Goodram and Watson claim the pair are homeless and have to use friends’ bank accounts to process Universal Credit payments. They claim the winning scratchcard was one of five they bought from a Waitrose branch in Clapham, London, in April.    As well as the jackpot-winning card, their batch included a £ winner, which the retailer, as a partner of Camelot, paid out on. Camelot refused to honour the £million ticket because investigators claimed it was acquired using a “debit card without the consent or authority of the account holder”. The two men’s writ says: “The claimants had the full authority and authorisation of the account holder to use those funds for the purchase of the five scratchcards.”    It adds that by allowing the £ payout, Camelot accepted the validity of the scratchcard and the contract entered into when it was bought. Watson and Goodram, of Bolton, Lancashire, say they sent Camelot a cheque for the £ cost of the tickets to make good “any issues in respect of the price of the scratchcards.” In its defence papers, Camelot says Goodram claimed he had bought the scratchcard with a card owned by a friend he knew only as “John”.

John Cowtan, , and his nephew James, , were kayaking off the North Wales coast when they were approached by a fast-moving jet skis multiple times. The jet skiers were filmed intentionally splashing them over and over again in an apparent attempt to capsize them on bank holiday Monday. The incident was witnessed by Mr Cowtanaposs we, Catherine, and their five-year-old daughter Emily, who watched on helplessly from the beach.Video footage taken by an onlooker shows the jet skier ing time and time again to splash the kayakers, even as they try to move away, reports North Wales Live.   Mr Cowtan, from Chwilog, said: Their behaviour really annoyed me, more so for my nephew who was really shaken by the incident. Three or four of them came over and one splashed me as he passed by. I remember wondering what that was all about but I didnapost say anything. Then they went over to a group of paddleboarders and totally took them out. One of them got back up and got back on, but they just wiped him out again. Then they came back to us and tried to capsize us. We just wanted a couple of hours of fishing, but they totally ruined the day for us and for everyone  on the beach. Itaposs a good job they didnapost break down and have to come ashore, because I think theyaposd have probably been lynched as everyone on the beach was so angry.    We had to come in in the end because we were soaked and the kayak was full of water. They just wanted to harass and cause trouble, and I think something needs to be done about it. If you were in a car and started doing wheel spins around someone, it would be a police matter because itaposs dangerous. This is anti-social behaviour at the very least. North Wales Police said they received several reports that people were riding jet skis in an aggressive manner. A spokesman said: We received several calls reporting that jet skis were riding in an aggressive manner in Criccieth harbour towards paddle boarders and canoeists. The harbourmaster and coastguard were also contacted, and the local leboat team launched a craft to deal with the situation.  Scott Beeland, who runs the Personal Watercraftgroup aimed at promoting the safe use of watercraft, said not all jet ski users are as irresponsible as the ones caught on film. He said: We are horried as a community at the shocking behaviour of this jet skier filmed in Criccieth. He is not representative of the responsible majority and is getting no support from the community over his actions.

She was speaking outside Manhattan Federal Court on Tuesday where victims of billionaire financier Jeffrey Epstein had been invited by a judge to speak ahead of an expected ruling to formally dismiss the case following his suicide. After the hearing, Roberts said: “I was recruited at a very young age and entrapped in a world that I didn’t understand. I will never be silenced until these people are brought to justice.”    In , Andrew was famously photographed with his arm around Roberts in London. Previously, a judge threw out her allegations against him because they were “immaterial and impertinent”. The Prince has strongly denied any “sexual contact or relationship” with Roberts. Earlier in court, Roberts claimed that Epstein and socialite Ghislaine Maxwell committed “dark and cruel criminal acts” against her. It is the first time that Maxwell, , has been named in a court of being complicit in Epstein’s abuse. At the hearing, many of the women, who were preyed on as teenagers, asked prosecutors to bring his co-conspirators to justice. One said: “They need to be held accountable. He did not act alone.” Investigators allege Epstein’s abuse was abetted by a number of unidentied co-conspirators who are suspected of providing him with a stream of girls.    None of them have been publicly named or charged with any offence. But prosecutor, Maureen Comen, said: “This dismissal in no way deters the government’s resolve in seeking justice.” Courtney Wild, who was  when he began abusing her in Palm Beach, Florida, branded Epstein a “coward”.

Instead, she seeks out other family members, particularly her older granddaughter Zara Tindall and her rugby player husband Mike. Ingrid told the Sun Online: They are certainly light relief. She can be herself around them.    The Tindalls, who arenapost working royals, are known for being some of the most relaxed and down-to-earth members of the family. They are often seen out and about at events, and just last month Mike was pictured being very hands on with his kids Mia and Lena at a charity golf day. Zaraaposs mum Princess Anne decided not to give her daughter a HRH title, knowing she wouldnapost be high up the list of succession. This has allowed her to live a much more aposnormalapos le than her senior cousins, who have been in the limelight their entire lives. Ingrid also believes that the Queen would never get involved in any dramas between Kate, Meghan, William and Harry.    Speaking about the reported fallout between the Fab Four, she said: That would make her very sad. But she would never interfere with their lives. Itaposs been a dficult month for Meghan and Harry in particular as they were heavily criticised for taking four private planes in just  days. The couple were branded hypocrites for choosing to travel in private planes, estimated to use seven times the emissions per person compared to a commercial flight, while campaigning for action on climate change and further steps to protect the environment and wildle. Things were made even worse when Kate and William were seen taking Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis on a budget economy flight just a few days later.  The -seat Cessna plane that flew Meghan, Harry and Archie from the UK to the south of France last Wednesday belched seven times the emissions per person compared to a commercial flight, it is estimated. They also flew privately for their holiday to Ibiza the week before. A number of celebrities rushed to their defence, including Elton John who shared an emotional message referencing Princess Diana. He wrote: I am deeply distressed by today’s distorted and malicious account in the press surrounding the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s private stay at my home in Nice last week.    Prince Harry  ’s Mother, Diana Princess Of Wales was one of my dearest friends.

Not so long ago children were regularly slung out or cut off by parents for marrying someone of a dferent colour, faith, nationality, age, or the same sex. But then everyone relaxed a bit, stopped worrying about what the neighbours might think and realised all that mattered was that their child was in love – and was loved. Until... somethingway more important happened: Brexit. This week a survey reveals that two in five Remainers would be upsettheir child married a Leave supporter. % of those polled by YouGov said they would be ‘very upset’ and a further % said they’d be ‘somewhat upset’.  According to my O-level grade D maths, that equates to ,, people ‘upset’ – not by their child turning up with a multi-pierced serial killer Hells Angel with a swastika tattooed on his forehead – but with someone who doesn’t totally share their views on the UK EU’s future trade relationship.Meanwhile, the numbers of Leave voters who’d be upset by their child marrying a Remainer equates to around ,, people. So we’ve got around  million Brits who regard those who voted dferently to themselves in the Referendum as a more horrying marriage ­prospect than a Katie Price cast-off. Eight million people who, quite frankly, need to get things into a bit of perspective. Brexit has been used by extremists on both sides to tear this country apart and to make views increasingly hostile and entrenched.

The -year-old loves her job, and can make more than £, for just a few hours work, but the impact it has had on her parents still really upsets her. Speaking to , she said: The hardest part is knowing that my family are dealing with my career as much as I am. I want my parents to be just as proud of me as they were when I was working in medicine. I never wanted my parents to feel like failures. I have a college degree.    I had plenty of options but I chose sex. That bothered a lot of people including my family. I would love for my family to be proud of me and introduce me as their daughter who works in sex, rather than having to go to family reunions and pretend Iaposm someone . Iaposm proud of what I do. At first her parents were extremely against her decision but Sylvia says they are now slightly more accepting. My father is more understanding than my mother, my mother has religion. Obviously he says that as his daughter he wishes I wasnapost doing it. He understands that Iaposm safe, happy and making good decisions for myself. We donapost talk about the details.

She desperately wants to help get rid of the negative connotations around sex and the adult film industry. She said: I made it my mission to start talking about sex. We put so much shame around it. So Iaposve just been talking sex with everybody. Sylvia has been working in the adult movie industry for five years, and says it is now just completely normal to her. She now does between three and five shoots a week, and can earn about £, a time. Itaposs all very quick but it becomes so routine that I donapost even think about it anymore. It just becomes part of my job. A typical shoot can take anywhere between two and six hours. Itaposs an early start and Silvia will have to be on set for about am. The first job is to sign all the paperwork confirming she hasnapost drunk alcohol or taken drugs. Itaposs then time for hair and make-up which takes about an hour and a half. They then do an inidual photoshoot, known as the apospretty girl photosapos, before being introduced to their partner for the first time. Itaposs then time for more photos, this time together acting out each of the sexual positions they will be in during the film. Silvia has worked in the industry for so long that she knows most of the male actors she works with, however there are a lot more women actors so itaposs often a new face.  They then work through their aposyes and no listapos, the things they are not comfortable doing during the filming.  Silviaaposs include no hitting in the face, no spitting and no negative comments. This all takes about ten minutes and then itaposs straight onto filming which takes up to  minutes.

You donapost always like the company youaposre with, you might not like the director. She didnapost get into the industry until she was , slightly older than others. She said: After several years working I found myself very unhappy so I started doing standup. She took two jobs to pay the bill while she tried to make a name for herself in comedy, but after six month she decided to find out more about the adult industry. One of her friends worked as an adult film star and was making huge amounts of cash. She said: I wasnapost doing any comedy, and that was the reason I moved to LA. If I could make more money I could focus on comedy. And her plan worked and her work in the adult industry gave her the financial flexibility to work on her standup.  After three years of hard work her comedy started to really take off. She said: I identied with myself a bit more. I just found my feet in both comedy and adult and gained more confidence. My name was getting out there a bit. Confidence is key in both professions. They run very closely hand in hand. Being in entertainment is about knowing what people want to hear and see.

Legendary Colombian footballer Rene Higuita shed some light on the details about his encounter with Escobar in the aposLa Catedralapos prison and his relationship with the notorious kingpin. Higuita also said he was offered the chance to inform on Escobar when he was arrested for his role in a kidnap - but turned it down, serving time in prison instead. In a recent interview with Bocas Magazine he said: I was sort of friends with him, but with that apossort of friendsapos everyone wanted to peg me as their pal. In fact, the person I was actually friends with was Don Roberto Escobar .    Pablo Escobar was an acquaintance, he reached Congress and later when he left there, he went underground and went to prison. He was not a politician anymore and was only a drug trafficker and nobody had anything to do with him. As I was the face of Colombia at the time... I became more humanitarian and thought how prison leaves a person lonely. The former goalkeeper went on to say: ..one cannot change the beginnings of a friendship. I have made many friends and several have been drug traffickers, I cannot change that.    I met paramilitary soldiers, I also met guerrilla fighters and from the bottom of my heart, the things they have told me have given me respect for them, as they have shown me respect... I live at ease and I live in peace.I am a friend of everyone. Higuita was reportedly offered the chance to inform on Escobar and walk away free when he was detained for being the mediator in the kidnapping of the daughter of one Escobaraposs associates.

Kids splashing each other in the sea and locals wearing t-shirts were unheard of here in August  years ago. But now, alongside teenage girls wearing skirts to school and increasing mosquitoes, it is a common occurrence for the residents of Qaanaaq, in north-west Greenland, one of the world’s most northerly cities situated  miles north of the Arctic Circle. Greenland, the world’s largest island at almost three times the size of France, is now living with extreme environmental changes which could see the Arctic Sea free of ice by no action is taken.    I travelled to Greenland, home to just , people, last week to see first hand the drastic changes to conditions and to understand why it matters to us all. Away from headlines about melting ice caps and pictures of underfed polar bears unable to stalk seals on flimsy ice forced to invade towns for food, I found a community battling to adjust. Living alongside a backdrop of eerily beautul icebergs and utterly terrying melting sea ice and retreating glaciers is having a devastating impact on species, habitats and human le. This is the frontline of climate change.    Three-quarters say they have personally experienced the impact of global warming in their daily lives, from coping with dangerous sea ice journeys to having hunting sled dogs put down for economic reasons due to shorter winters - with many unaware of the full impact. While we may shrug at the decline of traditional hunting, it is impossible to visit Greenland and not be profoundly affected by their tales of how climate change has upturned their world in just a single generation. Families have been torn apart, livelihoods threatened giving us all an insight into the scale of the battle now facing humanity. “If all of Greenland’s ice were to melt, it would raise global sea levels by fett meaning cities like London, Sydney and New York underwater and the whole of Bangladesh would disappear,” says Mark Wright, director of science at WWF, who accompanied the Daily Mirror to the Arctic. “This is not science fiction. This is the reality of climate change.    “It is happening now – and here in accelerated terms – providing a crucial insight into what we will all face unless urgently tackle this now. Sea ice now forms here two months later and melts one month earlier - as temperatures rise twice as fast as the global average. This summer has seen more than  wildfires in the Arctic Circle devastating once pristine forests, turning them from precious carbon dioxide absorbing sponges into giant new emitters of greenhouse gases. The country is also experiencing record-breaking temperatures. In mid-June, along the eastern coast it was C warmer than the - average. Just as western Europe has baked in a heatwave with record temperatures at the end of July, the hot air moved as far north as Greenland with the gauge hitting C on August . The average high is around C.  Journeys around the coast which took three weeks in the s because of the sea ice now take a single day. Perched beneath the world’s second largest ice cap after Antarctica, nothing other than black moss and lichen grow here. Fourth fths of Greenland is buried under an ice sheet two miles thick, much of it three million years old. But in the blink of an eye in geological terms it has begun melting – and much faster than climate change models predicted. Around % is affected, including higher elevations that only rarely see temperatures climb above freezing. In July alone  billion tonnes of meltwater poured into the Atlantic – enough to raise sea levels by .mm. We take a small fishing boat out with Joseph Manumina, , who points to a glacier he used to cross in a five-metre sled pulled by  huskies in the winter.    But like thousands of others here, the fourth-generation hunter has been forced to abandon his family trade and is now a fisherman. Joseph stops his boat beside the Hiawatha glacier and points out when he was young it stretched hundreds of metres further into the fjord. “The land you can now see was not visible at all a few years ago. But heavy rains came in  and changed the landscape for good,” he said. Last year, thanks to signicant melting, scientists discovered a -mile-long crater – the first to be found under ice – believed to be a direct result of a meteorite impact. While similar melting effects are being measured in the southern hemisphere, the Greenland sheet may be uniquely vulnerable, lying much further from the chill of the pole than Antarctica’s. Scattered across  small towns and approximately  villages, all situated on a narrow coastal strip, Greenland’s residents have often been overlooked by data science. But a first-ever national survey has examined the human impact of the climate emergency – showing % of islanders interviewed fully accept that the climate crisis is happening. The Greenlandic Perspectives Survey was carried out by the University of Copenhagen’s Center for Social Data Science, the Kraks Fond Institute for Urban Economic Research and the University of Greenland.    Lead author Kelton Minor said: “The Arctic is a bellwether for the unequal impact of global warming on social and economic systems. “As countries struggle to limit future risks and overall warming to .C many Arctic and Greenlandic residents are already living in regional climates that have changed by more than this, in less than a letime. “Therein lies the paradox: while satellites and sensors monitor the surface of Greenland’s ice sheet, chase icebergs and scan sea ice daily, relatively little is known about what the residents of Greenland think about their changing surroundings.” July st was the biggest melt day since at least , when % of sheet experienced melt. Studies found ice melt periods like the one seen seven years ago typically occur about every  years. One occuring so quickly is an important sign how quickly the climate is changing, warn experts. “This is a double edged sword, says Mark Wright, director of Science at WWF. “What we do here in the UK, they way we live our lives by burning fossil fuels, is speeding up the change. “At the same time this is affecting Greenland and other Arctic countries. But what happens here will also affect what happens at home in terms of our weather patterns and security in coastal areas. “This is why we have to take action and now. “We don’t have long left to cap this rapid change that we’ve never seen before in human history.” The rapid melting is also opening up new shipping routes and mining opportunities for deposits of rare-earth elements used in technology previously buried under ice sheets hundreds of metres thick.  It has sparked the interest of American President Donald Trump with an attempt to buy it, while China already has a mine on the island. While it is impossible to put a price on the territory, estimates range from . trillion to .trillion depending on the mining potential - believed to be enough to meet % of the world’s demand in the next  years. Trump may have cancelled his trip to Denmark for now but his suggestion is a marker of the fact Greenland is also now at the heart of a new battle for supremacy in the Arctic, where superpower competition is heating up as fast as the ice is melting.

The first things she splashed out on were houses for herself and some of her family, as well as cars, and gts for other people.She told the Today show : “I liked being able to help my family and doing stuff for people I cared about, but I wanted to just go back to work and live my normal le again.“All of a sudden I couldn’t open my front door with photographers and stuff being there and, obviously, you have people begging for money, friends who weren’t friends before wanting to be your friends.”    And from there things spiralled out of control as people she didnapost know tried to take her money and sell stories about her. Even an ex tried to sell a story that she was addicted to cocaine, she said. She added:that’s what I had done, when I hadn’t - He was going to get a lot of money off it.

The hate for Thatcher was pure and the depth of feeling surged through concerts and rallies.He says with a chuckle: “Them were the days.“We thought it was bad then, but everything can get worse, as we see now.

There will be a few classics and there will maybe be a few extra poems.“Then I will add a bit of fun and I can guarantee – solid, copper-plated guarantee – that everybody is going to leave with a smile on their face.”John has fond memories of Dundee and spoke of savouring the atmosphere of a waterfront hotel and added: “I love coming to Scotland and Dundee. I’ve been many times and the reaction of the crowd is great.“I was here last year and saw the VA which is fabulous. I know of DC Thomson and the Sunday Post, the Beano and the Dandy plus Oor Wullie.“Maybe I will buy one of those sculptures.”Posh hotels and venues seem a world away from the clubs and student venues of the s with smoke-filled rooms and plastic tumblers full of warm beer.He used to travel to the shows on public transport and chuckles at the memory.John said: “Yeah, long time ago now, mate. Now I have a driver and I am too old for public transport.“But I still love doing live gigs. It’s smashing. Anywhere where there’s people is greatI’m doing my stuff.“I am working on my book of poems right now. It’s called ‘The Luckiest Man Alive’ and I’m also working on the memoirs. vw, px\"  “I am thinking of calling that ‘I Wanna Be Yours’ after the Arctic Monkeys. I just hope to live long enough to finish it.“But I am not finishing up any time soon. I have never even thought about that. I am not retiring, not yet and not in the foreseeable future.”John has the tour to contend with first and is also lining up some television work.And at the age of  there is definitely no holding him back.

And his Tarbert roots run deeper, he was the head chef in Stonefield Castle in  where he met his we Irene, whose family still live in the village.Together with his son Ryan and Ross Payne from the Anchor Hotel the chefs settled in for an afternoon of cooking the finest seafood for the  seafood lovers who had booked their tables though the festival’s Facebook page.No one was left hungry as food started to arrive on tables and by the end of the afternoon there nothing left to cook and the chefs could have a welcome break.While the sunshine certainly added to the enjoyment of this new seafood experience Mike was delighted with the lunch service, saying: ‘It’s been a fantastic day, everyone enjoyed themselves and most of all we’ve raised over £ for the festival. We were incredibly grateful to get all, or most of the fish donated, which allowed us to give all the profits to the festival. I’d also like to thank Seafood Scotland who helped with the funding of our equipment.‘Cooking in front of the boats which caught the fish was pretty spectacular.

They also make for an excellently contrasting pair.From Mendelssohn’s exuberant opening bars, we are swept through music that is complex yet captivatingly, joyously melodic throughout, while Enescu’s is moody, breathlessly dramatic and, in parts, simply volcanic.Guest directed by Marianne Thorsen, SE will explore the specic charm of seeing a small group of musicians performing live. With fewer instruments, the fabric of the music becomes more tangible, subtle shts in mood may have a new-found presence, and pieces you think you know well might offer surprising new colours when heard live. With fewer musicians on stage, it is easier to follow each inidual path and witness the beautul alchemy of eight artists creating something together.Thorsen is an acclaimed soloist and passionate chamber musician. Former leader of the Nash Ensemble, she regularly performs with Norway’s Trondheim Soloists, one of the founding ensembles of The Bridge network and festival.The first half of the tour, which is called Chamber Notes, will call at Crear Studio, Kilberry, on August , followed by a performance at Mull Theatre, Tobermory, on August  before moving on to Inverness and Dundee.Other Scottish dates, including Edinburgh and Glasgow, are programmed for February .PIC:Marianne Thorsen. no_aMarianne Thorsen"},{"url":null,"title":"kilberry sportive well supported in sunshine","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Kilberry Loop Sportive saw around  cyclists take on a -mile route starting and finishing in Tarbert.All eyes were on the forecast for the non-competitive cycling event on Saturday August .

We do at the moment have a dentist and fully qualied staff and are happy with their work.Rumour has it that the aforementioned dentist and staff will be taking on patients from Mid Argyll Hospital, which I presume they tend to already.But the practice is to lose its local NHS patients, so they will deal solely with patients who require dental treatment from the hospital. I think this situation leaves the NHS patients in limbo.I am sure we would rather that the current dentist and all of her staff be given a chance to voice their opinions on this matter as much and as well as the local populace.Yes, it will be brilliant to have both dentists in the town. There is the possibility that those on the local list who are currently treated well by the dental department at the hospital maybe still seen by the dentist and her staff, but I would like this to be confirmed by the local NHS trust.Brian MacDonald, CrinanSir,Hundreds of people across Scotland have been helped through their exam results by a local group of Skills Development Scotlandcareers advisers.Based across the north of Scotland, the advisers were part of a team taking calls at the SDS Exam Results Helpline from am on results day.The helpline is a vital service, supporting young people and their families at what can be one of the most stressful times of their lives.Expert advice and guidance is available all year round, not just on results day.Our professionally qualied careers advisers are working in every state secondary school in Scotland and from our network of high street centres across the country.In schools, careers services are delivered one-to-one, in classrooms and at school events across all year groups, supporting young people to develop the skills to make informed career decisions throughout their lives.

The deadline was broken on  minutes when Lee MacLean broke from midfield and managed to beat the offside trap, his cross from the left channel was met by the in-form Stuart MacLean whose shot beat Martin to give Star the lead.Tarbert looked to commit bodies forward in a bid to get back into the game which made for a more open contest, however the Star defence of Coll McCallum, Ricky Reid and Kyle Selfridge coped well throughout.Red Star should have made the closing stages a lot more comfortable for themselves with Gregor Peacock going close with a couple of opportunities and Aaron Moore having a shot well blocked but in the end Stuart MacLean’s goal was enough for a hard-fought but deserved win.On Saturday August  Star welcome Dunoon to the joint campus for their final game of the group stage, where a victory for the Lochgilphead side will see them progress to the quarter-finals.The kick-off time will be announced on the club’s social media pages during the week."},{"url":null,"title":"heres to ewe gordon","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowA -year-old  shepherd left the recent Mid Argyll Show with a clutch of prizes for his Texel sheep.Gordon MacLean, from Tarbert, saw off fine specimens of the Texel breed from more experienced sheep men and women to win the ewe lamb class.

The means for  protection is the European Union PGIdesignation, to promote and protect names of quality agricultural products and foodstuffs.Ruth, an experienced journalist, explained: #I became concerned about two years ago when, during Japan EU Canadatrade talks, the UK government did not submit one PGI for protection.#Across Europe, , food names were protected. It worries me greatly.#She continued: #I am also concerned about how hard it is becoming to source local food and drink. I live in rural Angus, and the carrots grown down the road from me started le just as Angus carrots, but they went away for packaging and came back as Great British carrots. Technically that is correct, butwe believe in supporting local farmers and making clear choices about food miles and quality, this is ridiculous.#She stressed: #This is not a protectionist campaign. I welcome trade with any part of the world as long as the farm assured quality is there.##Keep Scotland the Brand is about valuing the integrity of our food and drink and recognising that Scotland is the brand. Across the world, people recognise Scotland as a quality brand.#One in five Scots is employed in the food and drink sector, so it is vitally important to keep our brand quality.#We trust the food on our shelves at the moment. Butthe trade deals being proposed go through we#ll end up with a multi-tiered system of quality. If the Americans get the trade deal they want, the high food standards we have are really only going to be accessible to those who can afford to pay.#It#s bad enough people having to go to food banks to survive, without people not knowing why their kids are getting ill.Ruth Watson is keen to emphasise that Keep Scotland the Brand is not a political campaign and it#s not about Brexit.#It is a campaign looking at the realities of what is before us,# she says. #I think that we have to look with some alarm at the trade deals that have been done. The UK government just has not protected our food brands.##I do this campaign on a voluntary basis from my kitchen table,# she went on. #Many people do not know what is coming. Food is treated as a commodity rather than something we should be grateful for every day, that is how successful our farmers have been.#I just believe thatfarming fails, my community is going under.##I#ve been talking to elected representatives, I go round shows. I#ll talk to anyone about this.#But what can ordinary people do Ruth is quite clear. #Get out there and talk to each other, spread the word on social media, speak to politicians.#But most of all support our local farmers.#"},{"url":null,"title":"get dancing get fit and have fun","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowBack in April, the Mid Argyll branch of the Royal Scottish Country Dance Society held a ‘Bring a Friend’ evening.The result was a super evening of dancing and laughter, not to mention some delicious home baking at half time, and the branch was delighted at the number of people who came along.Now the dancing season is starting again after the summer break and the members are hoping to welcome those friends – and others – to their regular Monday evening classes.Scottish Country Dancing is a really great way to stay physically and mentally fit while having a lot of fun and listening to some lovely music at the same time.

Work is expected to start at the end of the month and should be completed by the send of September.Councillor Frank T. Spears stated that the work would not involve any long-term closure of the main roadway.The #dry bridge#, owned by Lord Margadale, has been the subject of much discussion and minor rows for the past several months. Since Western Ferries Ltd. began their sea service, heavy articulated lorries carrying malt and grain to the island#s distilleries have been unable to go under the bridge. Matters came to a head three months ago when Argyll County Council re-imposed a weight limit on the Glen road # the ersion used by the transporters to avoid the bridge.The bridge owners came quickly to the rescue and allowed the heavy traffic to use their private road at Bridgend for a three-week period, but following local protests and legal consultations the transporters were again allowed to use the Glen road.Leboat saves three on rocksThe crew of a lobster fishing boat were marooned on a partially-submerged rock for more than two hours when their vessel foundered off the north-east coast of Islay on Thursday morning.The ft #May#, owned and skippered by -year-old Mr Lachlan Clark of Port Charlotte # the veteran of several sea-dramas # struck the rocks while they were lting lobster creels.The Islay leboat was called out to rescue the skipper and his crew # Alastair MacDonald, a -year-old fisherman, and Norman Gardiner, a -year-old Colonsay doctor#s son who was making his first trip and deputising for a sick crew member.Following the rescue, the crew # who were unhurt # were landed at Port Askaig.ONE-HUNDRED YEARS AGONational Health Insurance ActA number of contraventions of the National Health Insurance Act were the subject of prosecutions in Campbeltown Sherf Court on Thursday # Sherf MacMaster Campbell on the bench.The first case was that of a Clachan merchant who was charged with neglecting to stamp the card of a female servant.Mr M. Dick, solicitor, who appeared for accused, tendered a plea of guilty, and said the observations he was about to make would apply equally to all the cases subsequently to be heard. These were the first prosecutions of the kind in this court. The Act, as his Lordship knew, was a most voluminous and complicated measure.The sherf observed that some excellent and very lucid summaries had been circulated.Mr Dick, proceeding, asked his Lordship to examine the contribution card. He would find that the part which was the very kernel of the offence was embodied in the middle of Art.  in very inconspicuous type. The employer was there required to stamp the card #not later than the time at which wages are paid# but to read that one required to hold the card at about  degrees.The sherf askedhe was to understand that this was the first occasion on which a domestic servant had been employed by accused  If not, he must have been trained in the use of this wonderful document years ago.Mr Dick said his Lordship must consider this, that in cases of this kind there were two standards of clearness. What was clear to the judicial mind might be very far from clear to the lay mind.It was a matter of common knowledge that there was a very general belief in this part of the country thatinsurance cards were stamped at the time they were run out the Act would be complied with.The card, of course, bore that the stamps must be affixed #not later than the time wages are paid#. He asked his Lordship to consider the phraseology. These cards came into the hands of many rustic employers of labour. Why should it not be stated in bold characters on the card that the stamps must be affixed at the time wages are paid In the country wages were paid sometimes by the half-year, sometimes by the month, and sometimes at irregular periods suitable to the circumstances of the worker.The cards represented not the half-year of the feeing terms, but the calendar half-year. All these circumstances contributed to the confusion of the lay mind, and encouraged the widespread impression thatthe cards were stamped at the end of the period the duty of a citizen was thereby fulfilled."},{"url":null,"title":"leader august 23 2019","story":"The Courier is honoured to deliver news to the community # during the good times and the bad.This week we were delighted to share the news that Campbeltown now boasts the #whisky bar of the year#, according to judges at the Scottish Bar and Pub Awards , who bestowed the title to the Ardshiel Hotel.Since buying the hotel more than a decade ago, Flora Grant and Marion MacKinnon have more than tripled the number of whiskies on offer, turning the hotel into something of a tourist attraction in itself.However, we also revealed that nine jobs have been lost at Campbeltown Creamery.While it is still hoped that a take-over by local farmers is the future for the site, it is terrible for the iniduals who have lost their jobs, some after many, many years.We know there is a market for Campbeltown cheese, and while the number of farms supplying the creamery has fallen over the years, there are still almost .Here#s hoping the future is bright for both Campbeltown#s whiskies and cheeses."},{"url":null,"title":"filming-taking-place-port-seton-high-street","story":"A short film called Fishing by LS Productions means that a rolling road closure has been created.This is when the road is mainly open, but traffic will be lsquopausedrsquo to clear the road at times.It is a system commonly used in cycling and road events.There will also be parking restrictions in place.When asked, LS Productions marketing team informed the Courier that due to signing non-disclosure agreements, they were unable to say anything more about the film."},{"url":null,"title":"surge-39-struggling-39-families-sees-demand-kids-39-lunch-club-soar","story":"More than  children took part in this summerrsquos club compared to just  when it began in .And Universal Credit has been blamed for the dramatic increase in families who need help providing their children with a healthy meal, during the holidays.Sandra King, from Preston Seton Gosford Area Partnership, who help fund the club, which runs in Prestonpans and Tranent, said there was no doubt the impact of East Lothian being used to pilot the roll-out of Universal Credit was being witnessed.She said: ldquoIt is like being back in the Seventies: the number of families who are struggling and need support is high and the Universal Credit pilot in East Lothian has definitely had an impact.The outward appearance of East Lothian as an affluent county was misleading, she added, with families in all of its town and communities struggling.She said: ldquoEven in places like North Berwick we are seeing families affected.

And Scotland is leading the way, with the Scottish government aiming for renewable sources to generate the equivalent of  per cent of Scotlandrsquos gross annual electricity consumption by .To allow us to use more renewable energy we need to upgrade our current system to a smarter energy network.This will ensure we make the most of the greener energy available and open the door to a more sustainable future.With the uptake of smart meters in homes around Great Britain will come a new, smarter system, which is a more flexible and decarbonised. Whatrsquos more, this system is central to the country reducing its CO emissions, whilst being more reliable, sustainable and cost-effective.The increased complexity of the system and the need to be able to flexibly match supply and demand means that digitalisation is an important part of the transition. Central to digitalisation is the accurate measurement of customer energy demands so the system can provide energy in the most efficient and costeffective way, and customers can accurately understand how they use energy. And that is where smart meters ndash available from your energy supplier at no extra cost - come in.Simply put, smart meters will make Britainrsquos energy grid, and energy system, smarter. This is because the data that they are able to generate allows our energy network to understand how much energy is being used, when and where across Great Britain. The system will also be able to draw on more local and renewable sources of energy.Our electricity needs are predicted to double by , so we have to upgrade our outdated energy grid.

I think for many parents who have childcare challenges,there can be a real sense of relief as the summer holidays end, and to some extent I feel that myself.The pressure to fill six weeks with entertainment and activities, and go on holiday, can be immense, especially on a tight budget. For some children too, the holidays can be a dficult time and school can offer them ato some familiar routine.However, I remember the impending dread I felt when I was a child in the final days of the summer holidays. I hated the back to school adverts on TV as they heralded the end of free days playing on the rocks at the Pans shore, and of loosely defined bedtimes.So I was glad that our youngest daughter Skye was looking forward to school as she enters P. She met friends she hadnrsquot seen in weeks this morning and smiled as she said hello to George the lollipop man.She seemed slightly anxious as she waited in line in a new place, but the friendly manner of her new teacher visibly lted her mood and she went in with a smile, unknowingly tracing my childhood footsteps and those of her big sister.But then as I walked home, I was suddenly overwhelmed with anxieties: money worries, work worries, deadlines, bills etc. It seemed asduring the holiday period I had consciously decided to put such thoughts aside, to just enjoy the family time. Now was the pay back, we had ed to lsquorealityrsquo.But then I suddenly remembered a tale a fellow storyteller had told me many years ago. It just popped into my head and it spoke to me as I wandered back. And the truth in the story was the antidote I needed in that moment. And so I will share it with you in case you may one day find you need it:There was once a weaver who was weighed down with worries. He had so many things to do, so many responsibilities he looked into the future with dread. His worries kept him awake at night, which of course made his worrying worse during the next day. It was a vicious cycle.Then one day, he was sitting at his loom working and his worries got in the way. He couldnrsquot concentrate and he made mistake after mistake. He cursed and this was heard by an auld guidewe who happened to be passing by his window.ldquoFir whit reason dae ye curse at yer loom son, is there nae joy in yer work  she asked.The weaver looked up, feeling ashamed: ldquoIrsquom sair sorry fir ma words. Itrsquos just that as I work I think aboot orsquo ma troubles.The old woman nodded in understanding. She knew about troubles herself.ldquoAye, she said with an understanding nod, ldquotroubles can fair get ye doon.Then she paused and thought for a moment. She could see in the weaverrsquos face that he was riddled with anxieties.ldquoCan I show ye something that will tak ye awa frae yer work fir only a few minutes The weaver was happy to have a break so he left his loom and came outside.ldquoDae ye hae a bucket  asked the guidewe.ldquoA bucket ldquoAye a bucket, tae put some water in, she explained.The weaver fetched his bucket, wondering what the old woman was going to do with it.She took it to the well and filled it with a little water.ldquoNoo son, I dinnae kenthis will be tae heavy fir ye tae hold up.The weaver laughed: ldquoOrsquo course itrsquos no too heavy, fir ye only put a wee drop orsquo water in it.So the woman asked him to prove this by holding up the bucket with arms outstretched. The weaver had strong arms because of his work and held the bucket before him without any effort.ldquoAh, said the guidewe, ldquosae itrsquos nae tae heavy.ldquoIt isnae heavy at arsquo, replied the weaver.The old woman smiled: ldquoIn that case, keep haudin it afore ye like that fir  minutes. He wondered why she was asking him to do this, andshe was just trying to make a fool of him. But he was also intrigued and knew her to be an honest old soul, and so he did as she asked.After a few minutes of holding the bucket in front of him, it began to feel much heavier. After five minutes, his arms began to ache and soon they began to shake. The pain began to spread to his back as he desperately tried to keep the bucket in position.ldquoIs  minutes no over yet  asked the weaver desperately.ldquoIf the bucket is now tae heavy fir ye, put it doon son.He was reluctant to admit that the bucket was now too heavy to hold and so put it down.ldquoThe water got heavier son, didnrsquot it ldquoThe water wasnae heavier, protested the weaver, ldquoye just made me hold the bucket for tae lang.ldquoSae the water did get heavier, no in itself, but for you!The weaver looked confused and the guidewe continued.ldquoWater can get heavierye haud it ower lang afore ye, evenitrsquos just a wee drop. Yer worries are like that water, son. I am sure that they are many but ye mak them much heavierye try tae haud them in yer thochts arsquo the time.She smiled at him: ldquoTry an put the bucket doon as often as ye can,ye ken whit I mean. Dinnae mak it heavier than needs be. When ye need tae, haud it, but no arsquo the time.ldquoIn fact, she added while raising a pointed finger, ldquohauding it arsquo the time gies ye pain and paralyses ye. Yersquoll hae nae ability left tae empty the bucket.And so the old woman wandered off, leaving her words with the weaver. He looked down at the bucket. He lted it again and held it in front of him. It wasnrsquot as heavy now as before, but still had the same amount of water in it. She was right, water can get heavieryou hold it for longer, even though itrsquos the same weight.He chuckled to himself and watched the woman as she waddled down the street.ldquoThank ye! he called out.He ed to his loom. This time he whistled and sang as he worked. He enjoyed his creation and made no mistakes, for he had put his bucket of worries down for a while.Later they would still be there, but they might seem lighter and easier to manage now that they had stopped paralysing him with anxiety.And so that was the story. And as I arrived home, I realised that although I needed to deal with lots of things, I wasnrsquot going to give my worries more weight by holding them constantly in my thoughts.Itrsquos really

The procedure for iding matrimonial property, which is any money and other assets owned jointly or inidually is that it is to be ided fairly, which may not simply mean equally. If the situation has to be resolved in court that can result in a decision that is far from satisfactory to one ndashor both ndashof the partners.ldquoItrsquos important that we advise clients about the fact that Alternative Dispute Resolution is available. These situations emphatically donrsquot involve an inevitable progress to court ndashwhich should be regarded as very much the last resort, he says.In fact, some % or more of cases are now dealt with through negotiation rather than a court order that determines the ision of assets. People who proceed to court, says Ferry almost inevitably have an urgent issue such as suffering from a serious shortage of money or protection issues resulting from circumstances of domestic abuse.The alternative routes principally involve collaboration or mediation. Mediation, involves an independent mediator guiding the parties toward a solution. The mediator does not usually give them legal advice as to their entitlements though in assisted mediation both parties have their solicitors in the background .ldquoThat is an option that sometimes works out well ndash but many people are looking for veriable answers, and this can be achieved through the collaborative approach which I find is generally a better way to resolve disagreements.Ferry, a trained collaborative lawyer, believes this route is best to minimise conflict and secure financial choices ndashwhile also, importantly, ensuring the best future for the children. He explains that collaborative law involves the parties and their advisers in four-way meetings with discussions around the table, in private and without the delay of correspondence and court proceedings. And this, he says helps to avoid subsequent, and potentially costly, misunderstandings.The problem with pensionsPensions, for example, can become very contentious. ldquoIn our experience pensions are frequently overlooked by clients when considering orce settlements. However, the value of the pensions built up during the marriage or civil partnership is taken into account and can be substantial. Our clientsrsquo settlements often involve pension sharing agreements.ldquoHowever, pensions can be extremely complicated ndashnot only in terms of valuing them and iding them but itrsquos also important to get the best advice on which pensions should be shared and which should not. Some have more benefits attached to them than others. For example, there may be spousersquos benefits attached to them which may be very valuable.In addition, he adds, there are ious types of pensions such as Self Invested Personal Pensionswhich can be convoluted when dealing with them in orce cases as sometimes these can involve multiple underlying property and other assets contained in the pension which may need to be valued too.ldquoYou need to take advice not only about its value at the date of separation but also its type of pension and current value. A failure to identy pension interests or to correctly apportion the value of a pension may have dramatic long-term implications for either spouse and there is a strict timescale involved after orce for implementing the pension share.Business assetsFerry says that clients also need advice about business assets and shareholdings, as to what constitutes matrimonial property as these can, inadvertently, be converted into matrimonial property in the course of, for example, restructuring a company that was founded or bought before marriage.ldquoShareholdings that may be worth several millions can be transferred into the joint matrimonial pot and that possibility is not often considered by the accountant or tax advisor involved, he says.These are just a few of the issues to be considered but despite the obvious vexations that separation and orce involve, Ferry believes in confronting them in a positive, proactive way. The Family LawAct of  was well thought out and is quite flexible, providing for the needs of inidual cases, he says.Divorce, he adds, need not end up in long, drawn out court proceedings. ldquoWhether via a pre-nuptial agreement or a collaborative resolution, with good legal advice parties can deal with separation and orce in way that achieves the solution that works best for them both.Noel specialises in all areas of family law but is particularly noted for acting in high value cases for high net worth iniduals, for example, celebrities, sports personalities, entrepreneurs, business owners, directors, professionals and executives.

His missionary work took him all over Scotland, including the coastline of the Forth. It is said his arrival at this small natural harbour gave the place its name.Last weekend, artist Andrew Crummy, who lives in the village, organised three lsquosunset eveningsrsquo at the Boat Shore. Local musicians, singers, artists and actors gathered on the beach with an audience of fellow locals to share the sunset.I sadly couldnrsquot attend the first two but was able to make the last evening with some of my children. It was a wonderful mix of music and song, with a very funny short drama, and a setting sun as the backdrop.It was a poignant evening for myself, and I know for some others too a moment of reflection as well as coming together. I had planned to tell a tale about St Kenneth, but I changed my mind just before the event.Instead, I told a tale of a friendship between a tortoise and a butterfly and what sunsets meant to them. In story, anything is possible, and I made this tale to help ease someonersquos sadness in experiencing an ending.I was later askedI could share it, and so here is the story:There was once a tortoise who became friends with a butterfly. On the first day of their friendship, the tortoise invited the butterfly to sit with him on his favourite rock, to watch the sunset.However, Butterfly had no idea what a sunset was, and so when she saw the sun fall gradually from the sky she became concerned.ldquoWhatrsquos happening to the sun  she asked in a worried tone.ldquoItrsquos the sunset, said Tortoise, ldquoitrsquos when the sun goes down and ends the day.ldquoWhat, already! Thatrsquos it  asked Butterfly, horried. ldquoThis is just my first day being a butterfly and my days are over Tortoise smiled: ldquoNo my wee friend, itrsquos not all over. The sun will come back and there will be another day.But Butterfly remained anxious: ldquoHow can you be sure the sun will come back ldquoTrust me, I know. Irsquove seen many sunsets, said Tortoise. ldquoThe sun always comes back. Sometimes it takes longer than others, sometimes you canrsquot see the sun because of clouds, but it always s and makes another day.Butterfly was now reassured and so settled down to watch, as the sun dipped lower, painting the sky. She expected the sun to sizzle and the sea to steam when they touched each other, but of course that didnrsquot happen. The sun slid quietly below the horizon, leaving a trail of bright red and orange.ldquoThat was beautul, wasnrsquot it  Tortoise said.But Butterflyrsquos reply was unexpected: ldquoI think I donrsquot like sunsets very much.Tortoise curled up the wrinkles on his old face in surprise: ldquoWhy not, donrsquot you think it was spectacular, the way it painted the sky ldquoSuppose, but it was sad, really sad, said Butterfly.ldquoSad ldquoYes, because the sunset ends the day and thatrsquos sad. Endings are sad.Tortoise nodded in a way tortoises do when theyrsquore thinking: ldquoYes thatrsquos true, endings can be sad. But everything ends sooner or later. Nothing lasts forever.ldquoBut thatrsquos what I mean Tortoise, itrsquos so sad. I donrsquot want to sit and celebrate the end of something.Tortoise thought for a moment: ldquoAlthough endings can be sad, they also give meaning and value to our time. Without sunsets we would not treasure our days. Our le would become one long blah of sameness.ldquoA blah of sameness ldquoYes, my expression, smiled Tortoise proudly.ldquoBut thatrsquos easy for you to say, Tortoise, because you have more time than me, you will have more days.ldquoPerhaps, but that means your time is more precious than mine. And your sunsets are greater celebrations of your days.Butterfly thought about this. ldquoYou seem quite wise, Tortoise, she said, looking at her friend.ldquoYes, he replied immodestly, ldquoI do have that reputation. I suppose I have a lot of time to think, sitting on this rock.It began to get dark and colder.ldquoNow itrsquos time for our dreams. Soon there will be the sunrise, said Tortoise.ldquoSunrise  Is that when the sun s Tortoise nodded: ldquoYes, you see you donrsquot get a sunrise without a sunset. Although endings can be sad, they open the door to new beginnings. At the other side of a sunset there is a sunrise.Tortoise was indeed wise and Butterfly felt reassured by his wisdom.That summer, the two friends watched many sunsets together. They would share stories about their day as the sun went down. Then one evening, as flocks of geese were flying overhead, Butterfly spoke sadly.ldquoTortoise, I need to go. Itrsquos getting cold. Irsquom off to Africa. Do you think there are sunsets there ldquoIrsquom sure of it, replied Tortoise.ldquoI love sunsets now, said Butterfly. ldquoThey have shown me to treasure and celebrate my days. But I am sad this is our last one together.ldquoMe too, said Tortoise.The two friends sat together on their rock as the sunset commemorated their summer with a blaze of colour. Then they said goodbye.A new dawn now lay ahead for them both, for the end of one story is the beginning of another.And at the other side of a goodbye, there is a

One way we can fight back against ecological collapse is to have wilder, unmown, unsprayed spaces around us.

This is an unpleasant fact of le and one that Prince Andrew is discovering belatedly to his cost.For some time now, speculation has been mounting after the publication of a photo showing the Prince walking in a New York park with his friend, the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who was recently found dead in a prison cell, where he awaited trial on charges of sex trafficking and conspiracy to engage in sex-trafficking.The headlines must have made the Palace shudder, their insinuations all too clear. After details of a US lawsuit mentioning him were released, a terse statement was issued distancing the Prince from historic accusations made against Epstein, and claiming that ldquoAny suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue.:Prince Andrew hosted Jeffrey Epstein at BalmoralClose observers of Buckingham Palace might have noticed a cloud of dust around the flagpole as the house was shaken to its foundations. When the Daily Mail published footage recently showing the Duke of York ushering a young woman out of Epsteinrsquos Manhattan apartment in , a further statement was issued. The Duke, it said, ldquodeplores the exploitation of any human being and the suggestion he would condone, participate in or encourage any such behaviour is abhorrent.Poor Prince Andrew. He is discovering what every child in the playground knows: that you are tarred and feathered with the same brush as those with whom you mix. If one of your gang throws a brick through a window, you are deemed guilty too, evenyou did nothing wrong.In the case of His Royal Highness, letrsquos put aside for a moment the suspicions his closeness to Epstein, following his release from prison, arouse. Bad enough that Andrewrsquos personal contacts are so dodgy they raise serious questions about his judgement, let alone his behaviour.If nothing , these images suggest one of two things: that the Prince was a loyal chum who stuck by Epstein, despite his ruined reputation and the risk it posed to his own. Or that, living as he did in a gilded cage, removed from real le and the consequences of any stupid decisions he made, he was utterly unconcerned about the effect their friendship might have on his prospects. When you are cocooned from birth in a cradle of privilege when you are feted, indulged, and pandered to by sycophants and liggers from the minute you can shake a rattle, it must be easy to believe you are above the normal rules and standards by which society works.Meeting in the park with Epstein was, at best, decidedly odd for someone in Prince Andrewrsquos position. Going to his apartment, however, where a stone satyr presides over the front door, was simply crazy. According to police who raided the property, they seized photos of underage girls. These and the fetishist decor would have led most ordinary visitors to make a swt exit.These images of the Duke of York date from the period when he was acting as British ldquoSpecial Representative for Trade and Investment. A bespoke role for an aimless aristocrat, it gave him licence to roam the globe, meeting fat cats in rich countries and opportunistic states in the hope that some of their wealth would find its way into Britainrsquos Treasury.:In Pictures: Commonwealth leaders gather for state dinnerDuring his deployment as an envoy, Prince Andrew made ious embarrassing ldquomissteps, among them some politically unwise associations. Nothing, however, could compare with being identied as one of Epsteinrsquos cronies, after which revelation he relinquished the post.As the grapevine quivers with anticipation over other high-profile names likely to be found in Epsteinrsquos fat address book, the Dukersquos predicament is increasingly grave. He can hide behind the Palace gates and hope the storm will pass, but this is a story that has been brewing for years. Until certain questions are satisfactorily answered, as far as hersquos concerned it is far from over.Doubtless, it will go against every royal instinct, but would he not be wiser to face the cameras, do an in-depth interview, and silence ndash perhaps even charm ndash his critics  In a situation like this, where unfettered gossip is fuelling supposition, Prince Andrew surely needs to explain his connection with Epstein and help suffocate the scandal. It would, of course, be a historic move. No member of the royal dynasty has ever voluntarily gone on record to put their side of a wildfire story, with the exception of Princess Diana. In her unforgettable, kohl-eyed interview with Martin Bashir, she was more focused on scoring points against Prince Charles than in illuminating her own often dubious actions.Sticklers for Palace protocol might feel sick at the thought of Prince Andrew going public. Even in the hands of the most measured journalist ndash Kirsty Wark, say, or Fiona Bruce ndash it would be viewed as stepping into the lionrsquos den, a suicidally reckless act. Added to which, the Windsors do not explain. They take a long view, recognising that the passage of time usually allows even the most unsavoury episodes to fade into oblivion.In this instance, however, that seems unlikely. So what is worse  Staying schtum, and waiting for more seedy revelations to be added to the blaze, or allowing the Duke to get ahead of the story, and give his version of events By remaining aloof, the Palacersquos response suggests it hopes to avoid further fallout. The implication of this is all too plain: royals might not be above the law, but its arm would have to be very long indeed to winkle one of them out of the front door and into a Black Maria. Inviting a Windsor to a police interview, let alone into a courtroom, would require Herculean effort, and a mountain of cast-iron evidence. By contrast,Andrew were willing to face, refute and defuse the rumours, it would be an act of bravery to restore family pride."},{"url":null,"title":"theatre-review-crocodile-rock-oran-mor-glasgow-four-stars","story":"Crocodile RockOran Mor, GlasgowMary Brennanfour starsA Play, a Pie and a Pint is still in the mood to celebrate  productions since its inception, so some previous successes are in the autumn roster alongside new scripts.

On the Yes side, nothing has substantively changed, when it comes to big ideas, since the SNP laid out its blueprint for independence in .Brexit has altered the backdrop of the constitutional debate, but apart from a decision by SNP members to support the creation of a new currency as quickly as possible after independence, which many Yes voters donrsquot agree with, therersquos been little in the way of political imagination, creativity and innovation. The plan for Citizensrsquo Assemblies was visionary but itrsquos been undermined by SNP politicisation.Thatrsquos not to say that hard work hasnrsquot been done on the nuts and bolts of independence. The SNPrsquos Growth Commission report on the finances of an independent Scotland presented some serious economic thinking, but this is not the stuff upon which visions of new nations are built, this is the stuff of the seminar room.: Neil Mackay:Irsquom a Yes voter, but Irsquom now sick and tired of my own sideThe No side is even worse. All thatrsquos heard from the No camp is the word lsquoNorsquo. Wherersquos their vision of what a Scotland remaining in the union will look like  Brexit has shown both the Tories and Labour to be intellectually bankrupt when it comes to the future of Scotland. Yoursquod get more vision walking around a darkened room with your eyes closed than you would listening to most unionist politicians in Scotland.The new co-leader of the Scottish Green Party, Lorna Slater, seems to share concerns about the level of intellectual debate around the future of Scotland. She too worries about the vision thing.Slater has identied a few problems. Firstly, the impression that the SNP ldquoowns the idea of independence. Many Yes voters donrsquot support the SNP ndash yet itrsquos the SNP which dictates most of the discussion around independence. When a monolithic, managerial party controls debate then the drain on vision wersquore experiencing is inevitable. Whatrsquos good for the SNP in terms of holding on to power isnrsquot necessarily in the best interests of independence.A resurgence of all those grassroots Yes organisations which sprung up as the first referendum approached would provide an intellectual counterweight to the SNP, and a laboratory for new ideas.Slater is also concerned that ldquomuch of the debate around independence has focused on whether or not there should be a referendum. We should be focusing on what we want an independent Scotland to look like.Shersquos right. A second referendum will happen at some stage in the relatively near future, but what really matters,you are a Yes voter, is making sure the vision for the country is in place in order to convince the people that independence is the right course of action when the time comes.Brexit has taught us hard lessons. There was no real discussion, no real vision, about what a post-Brexit Britain would look like. A national conversation needs to begin in Scotland about the kind of country we want to be after independence.What about a constitution  The monarchy  The nature of the army  Our relationship with America  A second parliamentary chamber  Our role in Europe These issues cannot be left up to the SNP. Politicians make decisions in the best interests of their party, not the country. Parties care about power not people.We need to know the substance of what wersquore voting for, rather than the intellectually bereft binary of Yes and No. The Greens are certainly setting out a clear vision for Scotland after independence. The environment will be the top priority, there will be a move away from oil and gas.Of course, the Greens also flatlined on around eight per cent of the vote during the European elections in May. However, that disappointment may account for their renewed push for a big vision for Scotland now.The Greens need to get out from under the shadow of the SNP. Being seen by voters as \"the other party which also supports independence\" isnrsquot a strategy, especially when Greens can provide a clear, progressive vision for the country which the SNP with its disparate factions cannot.The SNP is ready to splinter into left, right and centre the moment Scotland becomes independent. In the era of climate change, the Greens have a simple and important story to tell which other parties do not.However, honesty is the greatest storyline ndash the strongest vision ndash to present to Scotland. So letrsquos be honest. If Scotland votes Yes to independence in any future referendum, we need to accept that it is inevitable that the nation will need a confirmatory referendum on any deal negotiated with the rest of the UK regarding separation.Dr Alan Renwick, of University College Londonrsquos Constitution Unit, has raised this issue saying that a confirmatory vote would avoid the ldquoacrimony and gridlock of Brexit. He refers to the ldquograve democratic quandary where the public has not been allowed to make ldquoan informed choice about the type of Brexit the country goes through. Renwick suggests opting for a confirmatory vote might increase the turnout for Yes with the public willing to back independence in theory and then see what the politicians negotiate.A future independence referendum would be a ldquopre-legislative ballot, instructing politicians to negotiate a deal which we then vote on. That seems perfectly democratic and the kind of vision we need for this country.:Majority now want Scottish independence, says phenomenal new pollIt immediately shows a commitment to democracy over party politics, a willingness to tackle emotional and isive subjects in a collegiate way, and it projects an adult image of this nation while many other countries seem to be reverting to childhood.The First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and some of her inner circle may be publicly voicing their discomfort with the baggage that comes with the concept of nationalism of late, in an attempt to woo soft No voters, but the one thing which will change swithering minds is honestly tackling the dficulties which the journey towards independence will involve.It will not be easy - it will be hard. Admitting those dficulties is a good way to start presenting a vision of integrity and honour for a new independent Scotland.Neil Mackay is Scotlandrsquos Columnist of the Year"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10330358.jpg?type=article-full","title":"oscar-marzaroli-man-captured-forgotten-moments-glasgow-life","story":"The photograph is typical Oscar Marzaroli.

This poses a problem for many on the left who think politics isnt about achieving national sovereignty, but promoting social justice. They struggle to deal with it, and find a coherent vision of how to reconcile peoples need for identity and the demands of economic opportunity and social justice.Brexit has upset the UKrsquos constitutional applecart, and this English nationalist project has encouraged Scottish nationalism. Both projects seek to break up multinational unions in the name of sovereignty. Brexit has already split the UK down the middle, and similar vote in some future Scottish referendum would create a fissure in Scottish society that would last generations. We need something better.Whatever happens with Brexit, there is an alternative for the UK. The risks to economic opportunity and social justice presented by independence stem not from acknowledging Scottish identity, nor from increasing Scottish autonomy, but from breaking the economic and social bonds of the United Kingdom. Its domestic market is vital for Scotlands economy, and sharing resources across the UK supports social justice in Scotland through welfare and public spending programmes, as we saw again last week the latest GERS figures.We do not have to lose these benefits in order to gain more autonomy. Instead, Scotland, and the rest of the UK, should move to a more federal system. The structures of federalism, which means dferent levels of government each with their own responsibilities, can support dferent social models, but I argue for a progressive form of federalism, one designed to create the maximum scope for social justice in each part of the country. Here is what it would mean for Scotland.First of all, it implies a change of mindset in the whole UK, from the worn-out notions of parliamentary sovereignty which drive so much of our overcentralised government, especially in England, to an understanding that the UK really is a multinational state, a voluntary association of nations which come together to preserve their identities and promote their shared interests. That implies a better form of entrenchment for devolution in the UK constitution. Given the circumstances of Brexit, it means entrenching wider powers too.More important, perhaps, it implies a design which embeds the purpose of social justice in the territorial constitution. The federal UK parliament and government should be responsible for providing a guaranteed level of welfare and public service provision across the whole territory, irrespective of whether local taxable resources are big enough to support it, much as today.But government in the devolved nations should have the capacity to increase this from their own resourcesthey think it necessary. Thatrsquos an each-way bet for social justice.Wersquore already close to that for Scotland today. Not only is the Scottish Parliament responsible for most major public services, but it can supplement any welfare benefit it thinks unjustly small. It has the money too: not only is the devolved budget about  per cent per head higher than English levels, Holyrood has wide tax powers too.A UK which followed these principles would make a similar offer to the dferent regions of England. Many of those who voted Leave in the European referendum were expressing a beef with London, not Brussels: thats where they need to take back control from.Those obsessed with sovereignty and identity see nationalism as an end in itself. History tells us this is a dangerous road. But those who want to promote social justice and co-operation between dferent peoples cannot ignore the human need for acknowledgement of their identity. For them the right approach is a model of progressive federalism, empowering the UKrsquos nations and regions in a way which gives each level of government the power to promote a just society.This will be one of the themes explored by the new Think Tank Our Scottish Future being launched with an address by former PM Gordon Brown in Edinburgh this week."},{"url":null,"title":"four-go-trial-accused-trafficking-women-glasgow","story":"Three men and a woman are alleged to have brought more than a dozen women from Slovakia and held them in ldquoslavery or servitude.

Yet even those people, who previously promised to implement the referendum result, thenstood on a manesto promising to implement the result, then, by one of the biggest Commons vote ever, voted to implement Article , specying ldquono deal as the default, balked at putting Mr Corbyn in power as the price of stopping any hard exit.Itrsquos dficult to see how legislation guarantees the prevention of no deal, though. Itrsquos an illogical position, when no deal is the default, and when any restrictions wouldnrsquot be binding on the PM, nor even necessarily within his gt .It is, however, no more bonkers than the Brexit Partyrsquos insistence that only a no deal Brexit is real Brexit ndash a stance no doubt inspired by government failure to deliver, but one that no one was advocating three years ago.Mr Corbyn, unlike the other party leaders, mentioned the continued possibility of a vote of no confidence. As Leader of the Opposition, hersquos best-placed to table one, but that is the extent of his advantage. Assumingit were won, the Labour leader would then have to demonstrate he had the necessary support to form a government, which means about  votes: ie, persuading some  non-Labour MPs to vote for him.The prospect of Tories, even those practically demented by the idea of no deal, backing that is nil. The Lib Dems have ruled it out. It would be a huge strategic error for the SNP. And thatrsquos before you take into consideration the fact that there could well be about  of Mr Corbynrsquos own MPs who wouldnrsquot vote for it.Mr Corbyn, despite not banging on about it in his meeting, is still apparently insisting that a vote would mean him becoming prime minister .I think a GNU would be undemocratic, undesirable and unlikely. But in a fantasy world where the proposed interim PM were Ken Clarke, or Harriet Harman, itrsquos just about possible. But you would need a vote of no confidence first. So the person best placed to bring it about is Jeremy Corbyn, and the biggest obstacle to it happening is Jeremy Corbyn.Small wonder the other leaders preferred to make it a last resort, trying instead to rule out no deal by legislation. The problem is that you canrsquot, with absolute certainty, for both practical and political reasons. Practically, because MPs have to vote for something, anything  to avoid what is otherwise the default position, and so far they canrsquot agree on what that would be. Eventhey could, therersquos no guarantee itrsquos anything thatrsquos on offer.:Will SNP efforts to unseat Lib Dems be enough for Shetland by-election victoryAnd while the no deal absolutists are as deluded as the revoke extremists, there are potential deals ndash and the one negotiated by Theresa May is one ndash clearly even worse than no deal. Thatrsquos why MPs voted it down three times.Politically, this approach is tricky because, while Boris Johnson says he would still rather have a deal, he is totally committed to exit by October . Just as his mind wonrsquot be changed by a vote saying MPs wonrsquot accept no deal, nor will such a vote magic away the fact that itrsquos the legal default. His opponents would also have to commit to some positive course of action to replace it: either the blatantly anti-democratic nuclear option of outright revocation, or acceptance of some deal that is actually on offer at the time. Or an election.By contrast, the PM has nothing to lose by calling an election.

He also reacted angrily to the news that Mr Goodlad could not be in attendance, shaking his head as Mr Halcro Johnston explained his absence.SNP candidate Tom Wills began by saying that #Shetland is ready for a change# and asked for  months to show what he can achieve in Holyrood, while Lib Dem competitor Beatrice Wishart opened her speech with a defiant message: #If you want an MSP who will speak up for Shetland, I’m your woman#.The first question of the night revolved around transport, with Ms Wishart and Mr Wills clashing immediately, interrupting each other#s answers as Mr Johnston appealed for both candidates to let the other finish.Mr Halcro Johnston responded to Mr Wills# five-point transport plan by saying that #Tom Wills has a load of great ideas but they won’t be delivered#, while independent candidate Ryan Thomson added that #nothing gets done” because “Shetland is the pawn” in mainland politics.Councillor George Smith directed a question at Mr Wills, asking him how he expected the SIC to afford one of his election pledges, free foot passengers on inter-island ferries.Mr Wills responded to say that this could be paid for #, and when# the Scottish government provided additional funding to the council.Mr Thomson criticised the NorthLink ferries in response to a question about increased capacity on the ferries.

Ms Wishart responded to the issue of Brexit to say that it was #time for a peoples vote and time for people to work together across parties# to stop Brexit.Scottish independence was the next topic up for debate, and understandably provoked perhaps the most isive reactions of the night.Mr Scott, Mr Wills and the Green Party#s Debra Nicolson all came out in favour of an independent Scotland, while Mr Halcro Johnston, Ms Wishart and independent Peter Tait were against it. Both independent candidates, Michael Stout and Ryan Thomson, said they would wait to see what benefit Shetland could get from Scotland becoming independent before deciding how to vote, should another referendum come up.Mr Scott#s positive attitude towards independence was because, he said, # nothing  we#ll get rid of these damned Tories#.Ms Wishart wanted the audience to #imagine the chaos#Scotland tried to break up the union, citing Brexit as an example. She said the vote was supposed to be #once in a letime# and that there were better priorities for funding, such as healthcare.Mr Wills responded to this point: #which has been cut by the Tory Liberal coalition#, to audience applause.Conservative representative Mr Halcro Johnston said that #I think SNP talk about independence because its easier than talking about their failings#, and added that nobody would be surprised to find that he was against independence.I#m sorry, Tom Wills is havering. Independence will not keep Scots in, or bring us back into, the EU. EvenBritain stays in, Scotland will leave, automatically, with #No Deal#, on Independence Day and will have to reapply to join. The EU has confirmed this, in writing.Also,nothing changes, our starting budget deficit will be £. billion per annumversus the EU#s limit of about £ billion . The UK will stop paying funding that.We shall have to cut spending raise taxes by some £ billion p.a. on an annual budget of about £ billion, to satisfy the EU#s economic conditions for joining.That means we shall face years of withering austerity, just when we need to spend more to stimulate the economy.We also need to set up our own independent central bank which the nationalist think tank #The Common Weal# says will take nine years from an Indy Yes vote. So we shall be out of the EU, with #No Deal#, for at least, seven years from Independence Day.Scots are canny folk. They will not vote for such an independence prospectus.John, your oft repeated notion that an independent Scotland will start with a budget deficit of £. billionis an entire fancy. Whatdebt an independent Scotland may have to take on as a share of the current UK#s debt, in the event of Scotland becoming independent, will be a matter for negotiation and agreement . Similarly, matters such as whether, and for what fees , the rest of the former UK might be permitted to retain its weapons of mass destruction on Scottish soil will be for negotiation agreement in the event of Scotland becoming independent.I would not hold my breath waiting for their answer.Ian Scott and Tom Wills have very selective memories. The austerity cuts introduced by the last Conservative  Lib Dem coalition were in response to the mess Brown and Blair made of the British economy. The outcome of this prudent handling of the deficit was obviously popular with the British people because David Cameron’s government won an overall majority in the subsequent election. David Cameron also delivered on another election pledge to have an in out referendum on Europe. How can the SNP criticise any party for that they have never delivered on an election pledge in their le. Finally, the only racism and fascism that has come out of this by-election has been promoted by the SNP anti-English racism. The SNP are Tartan Fascists.Had it not been for the global economic crisis, and Blair#s US led wars, Brown#s finances could have seen him becoming PM. This shows the harm in getting too friendly with the US, not that there will be much of a choice for the remnants of the UK after Brexit. I won#t digny John M Scott#s final comment with a response other than to note that it is Trump and Farage that have been too close to white supremacists. Happily neither seem that popular north of the boarder.

I did not mention #national debt#. So let#s set aside the #smoke and mirrors#. I am talking about the £. billion gap between Scottish tax revenue raised last year and money received from Westminster. We have been running similar, sometimes larger deficits for many years. Unless something changes this will become our annual budget deficit on obtaining independence as Westminster will no longer fund the shortfall.Don#t take it from me. A couple of years back, the SNP#s own Sustainable Growth Commission conceded that we would start independence with a budget deficit of .% of our GDP, around £. billion per year, and proposed a multi-year plan to reduce it to less than %, which just happens to be the EU#s maximum permissible limit. @Brian Hill, Ok,we are to be pernickety:The UK funds the dference between our tax revenues and what Holyrood receives from the Exchequer so we are talking about a so-called #notional deficit# that has been ongoing for many years.This is recognised by the SNP#s Sustainable Growth Commission.UK funding will cease on Independence Day and the notional deficit will become , our budget deficit.The current UK funding of £. billion equates to around £ per head of population, per year.

The disease can lead to early loss of le, cause preventable sight loss in working age people, and is a major contributor to kidney failure, heart attack, stroke and even amputation, yet the illness is often preventable by adopting healthier lestyle changes.The new Diabetes Prevention Programme is aimed at people who have been identied as pre-diabetic – those who have been tested and have a blood sugar level slightly above the normal range – by their nurse, pharmacist or doctor.Cullybackey patient Thelma Shanks from Cullybackey was referred onto the programme this year. She said: “There is a history of hypertension and diabetes in my family. “Several of my paternal aunts sadly passed away due to complications that came with the disease, and my mum was found to be diabetic following admission to hospital for routine tests. “I was born in London, but grew up in my parent country, Jamaica. I ed to the UK for good in , and my husband and I moved to Northern Ireland, where all my children were born, in . “As a nation, we from the Caribbean tend to be a bit more susceptible to diabetes than others, so it wasn’t a complete surprise to be told I was at risk of developing the disease. “I am also a trained doctor so despite having given up my profession when I had children, I have knowledge of the medical risk.“I have a wonderful busy family le. I have four children, all of which I home schooled, and of course, their needs always came before mine. “When you’re running a busy house and looking after everyone  it’s easy to forget to look after yourself. However, in  when I heard that a health fair was coming to the area I decided to go along. For a small fee they carried out multiple tests which showed I had hypertension or high blood pressure. “I decided to make an appointment with my GP who put me on a number of drugs, first Irbesartan, then Amlodipine and finally a diuretic to bring my blood pressure under control.“I realised I needed to be more careful with my diet and tried to be a bit healthier but I admit it was a bit half-hearted. TESTS“My blood sugar levels were border-line they weren’t going down but they weren’t going up either, so I thought everything was all right. I was having routine check-ups with my nurse at this stage so I was on her radar and having blood tests taken intermittently. In April  I had my regular tests done and then hopped on a plane to London. “It was my daughter’s birthday and I had decided to treat her by going away for the week. We had just made it to the hotel when I received a phone call from my nurse. “She said tests showed my sugar levels were up and I was actually diabetic, which was the wake-up call I needed. Let’s just say it wasn’t quite the luxury week that I had planned! My daughter certainly ate well, but no sugar passed my lips that trip. “Needless to say, I had the blood tests repeated soon after our , and was delighted to learn that due to my dietary sacrices, my blood sugar levels had again receded into the ‘pre-diabetic’ band.“Prior to our trip away, my doctor had called me. She said there was a new Diabetes Prevention Programme starting soon in my area being run by the Public Health Agency. She askedI would be interested and of course I agreed.“The class has  others in it and we meet on Wednesday afternoons. There are eight women and two men, and together we re-learn what we should be eating, what to avoid, and how to step up our exercise routines. “I’ve found it really helpful because everyone is in the same boat and we can share our experiences and encourage one another. “Each week we build on the goals of the previous weeks, paying attention to diet and exercise and gaining strength from each other.“I used to believe that running after a busy family was exercise enough but now I’m walking every other day, trying to increase my pace and my distance. My daughter and I often walk together and I try to keep up with her. LONG TERM“One day I managed , steps in one walk and  of those miles were uphill. I’m trying to make long term changes and make sure these become habits I’ll stick to for the rest of my le. So far I’ve lost  kg, and my exercise levels have increased signicantly too. My blood sugar levels have decreased, but more importantly I feel better physically and psychologically. “The Diabetes Prevention Programme and the team who deliver it have been amazing. I’m looking forward to seeing a new me at the end of the nine and a half month course.”Thelma was referred onto the Diabetes Prevention Programme by her GP Dr Jean McCaughern, Maine Medical Practice, CullybackeyThe practice serves around , patients that live within a six mile radius of the surgery. Dr Jean McCaughern joined the surgery around  years ago and was placed in charge of the practice’s diabetes clinic.At first she managed this alone, today she heads up this specialist clinic with the help of two practice nurses. She does this alongside her normal GP responsibilities.She said: “When I first started the clinic around % of our patients were diabetic and that included those who had both type  and type  diabetes. Today that figure has more than doubled. In  we have a prevalence rate of .%. That’s how quickly the disease is on the rise. “Often patients don’t realise just how serious the illness is. I have overheard patients saying ‘I just have a touch of diabetes’ or ‘I only have diabetes’, but it’s a serious illness which can cause deterioration of vision, contribute to heart disease, kidney disease, stroke, and vascular problems which at their worst can lead to amputation.“Patients of mine have had all these problems and more. The reality is dferent to the perception and it’s only when dficulties start that people begin to understand what living with diabetes can mean. The longer you have the disease, the more likely you are to have any one of those complications.“Having diabetes presents practical problems too. In some cases the DVLA can revoke people’s drivers licensestheythey believe there is poor management of diabetes. This can include raised sugars, but more importantly sugar levels dropping and causing confusion in patients as is would be unsafe to drive.“For some people having diabetes is out of their control. Those with Type  diabetes have no choice but to manage it using medication. “For others who spot heightened blood sugar levels early, termed pre-diabetic, they have a window of opportunity to reverse or delay a diagnosis of Type  diabetes through healthy eating and exercise. That’s who the Diabetes Prevention Programme is aimed at and who it can help.“Once higher sugar levels are discovered, the earlier people can make changes and the higher the chance they have of reversing the outcome. Sometimes, it’s not about changing the diagnosis but delaying it by a decade or so. “The longer you can hold it off the longer you can hold off the complications that come with it. “It’s not all bad news though, having diabetes, whether Type  or Type , is largely manageable either by medication, treatment or diet. “Insulin, used primarily for treating type  diabetes, lowers blood sugar levels when diet and exercise alone aren’t sufficient, but the effectiveness of these medications depends on how early the disease is diagnosed and the size of the dose.“I was happy to get involved in the Programme. Having an interest in diabetes I was approached by the Public Health Agency at the operational stage to look at the programme’s viability in my area. I’m a big supporter. “So far I’ve referred around  people from the practice onto the programme which educates and empowers people of the contents of foods, the need to exercise and develop better eating patterns. “Often I’ve heard people say once they have to go on a special diabetes diet but that’s not the case, it’s just healthy eating, it’s the way we should all be eating.“As far as the success of the programme goes, it’s a little early to tell. The first cohort of people started on the programme in May and early results are positive. Certainly weight loss as a group has occurred and people have more knowledge of food, portion control and exercise.“So, there are benefits for all and for some the course is working really well. When you join the programme as a group you bond as a group, you encourage each other, you don’t want to let your group members down. “That shared experience and cohesiveness is a real motivator and works across all ages and all groups. For many the programme offers them a chance to turn a future diagnosis around and gives them the tools to change their future. “That can be le changing and what the programme is designed to do”.KEY FACTSThe Diabetes Prevention Programme is run by the Public Health Agency.It is aimed at people who have been identied as pre-diabetic – those who have been tested and have a blood sugar level slightly above the normal range – by their nurse, pharmacist or doctor.The Diabetes Prevention Programme is delivered over a nine month period and is free of charge.It is facilitated by health coaches who offer help and assistance to participants, helping them change their lestyle, diet and physical activity with the aim of postponing and even preventing type  diabetes.For more information on the ‘Diabetes Prevention Programmeemail your local Health Trustdiabetespreventionni@northerntrust.hscni.netst  "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_2094373.jpg--.jpg?1566376242000\n","title":"talent galore at music mania event","story":"Broughshane was alive with the sound of music last weekend when the Music Mania event rolled into the village.Local people were given the chance to take to the stage and show off their musical abilities and talents, both with instruments and voice.Many turned out to not only take part, but also to watch on and support those on stage.Bob Esler was the compare for the evening where there was live music on stage from pm with an open mic session and a BBQ proving popular with everyone.

With over thirty years experience in the field, he has been the head chef, first manager and then owner of the popular The Side Door restaurant, located at Febro Buildings on the Antrim Road in Glengormley for  years.Brendan grew up on the Cltonville Road until he was  years old when his parents moved to the Antrim Road. His first part-time job came in the old Lansdowne Court as it was known back in the day.Ever since a young age, Brendan was interested in the food and catering industry and decided to pursue a career in the field when he left school at . After three years at the College of Business in Brunswick Street in Belfast, he went on to complete a B-Tech qualication and an advanced catering course.Subsequent employment followed in the shape of a full-time role in the Lansdowne before spells in Belfast Castle, the Crawfordsburn Inn and Chimney Corner.But it is with his current venture The Side Door that he has made his name, establishing the -seater restaurant ever since taking over six years ago as the new owner.Brendan explained: “The Side Door is basically a family-style restaurant with something on the menu for everyone. The menu is very mainstream.“The previous owner’s menu was something close to fine dining but people were still ordering pizzas. I thought it wasn’t right so I changed the menu about a bit.“I had my own ideas and kept it mainstream to attract anybody and everybody.“The pressure was there to get bums on seats and it has worked ever since so I have no intention of changing it.”Brendan also acts as Head Chef at The Side Door and thanks to his wealth of experience, he has put his own style and spin on food.“I would cook things like lasagne, carbonara, scampi and burgers,” he added.“Everything is home-made. I am experienced enough to know what way things are cooked best and what sells well.“I used to be a sauce chef and I suppose sauces and soups are still my forte.It is still probably my favourite aspect of being in the kitchen.“I was brought up in the catering industry on a French theme which is something I still like doing, especially with some of the specials in the restaurant in some shape or form.”As for how things have changed in the industry, Brendan points to a number of ious things he has noticed over the years.“The food industry has changed massively over the years,” he explained.“Themes and customers needs and wants are like night and day now since when I started off over  years ago.“Food takes waves now, much like politics. whether Italian or Mexican themed.“There are more vegans and vegetarians than ever before but allergies is such a big thing these days. Celiac is definitely the main one and you just have to be so careful.“I probably wouldn’t have taken as much of an interest in allergies but when I found out my daughter had a nut allergy, it changed everything. It scared me.”Looking ahead to the future, Brendan reflected on what he has achieved so far at The Side Door.“Glengormley is a perfect setting. People thought I was mad taking The Side Door on with the amount of competition but my idea wasyou want to buy a washing machine and there is more than one shop available in the same area to buy it, you will still compare it, just like restaurants.“I think we stand out because we are not pretentious. Many restaurants are, in my opinion. We are not – what you see is what you get: fresh food bought from a number of dferent suppliers who I have built up a relationship with over the years. I buy the best produce that I can get but at affordable prices for customers.“I believe also in good service and to my knowledge, we are still the only bring-your-own restaurant in Glengormley.“As for the future, I am not getting any younger. I thought around two years ago about looking for a bigger premises. What I have to turn away from a Thursday to a Sunday now is scary some weeks, but I thought here was working. I decided to stay because things are good and long may it continue.“Customers keep coming back so I must be doing something right.”Brendan Rafferty is Owner, Manager and Head Chef at The Side Door restaurant in Glengormley.The Side Door,Febro Buildings,Ballyclare Road,Glengormley,BT DZ.Tel:   "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"speckled hen have got it well sussed","story":"IN a food market dominated by commercial farming, big drinks brands and unormity, the authenticity and quality yielded by do-it yourself approach is becoming all the more appealing, and there are few businesses doing it better locally than the Speckled Hen Bar and Dining Rooms.Having long brewed an exciting range of its own craft beers and ciders, the Lisburn-based establishment has taken the next crucial step towards self-suffiency by bottling its own still and sparkled water. Although a seemingly simple step, tapping into the natural springs below the bar has revealed interesting information about the geography of the area and, as owner Martin Caldwell explains, has created further links to the Speckled Hen’s -year history.“Right under our feet is the Triassic Aquer, which stretches from the Castlereagh to Black Mountain,” he said.“There has always been a well under the bar, so given that we’re filtering our own water anyway, it made sense to put in a chiller, a cooler and a carbonator to make fizzy water too.“There was originally a well there and the previous owner had tapped into it. During the winter time you can actually see little springs coming up out in the carpark. There used to be a well where our beer garden is now where they used to dip the buckets for water. The pub goes back to , so it goes back a fair while. They used to brew their own beers and everything here, so access to spring water was vital.”He continued: “It’s fantastic that a place of this age is still ing and providing hospitality and services. This used to be the old post road and was also one of the main roads to Dublin at the time, so coaches used to stop along here. It was actually alleged that Daniel O’Connell stopped here before. It would have had to have been self-sufficient. We’re essentially going back to the notion of our own self-sufficiency in terms of the supply of water as well.”The Speckled Hen started bottling its water last month, installing a new filtration system that provides fresh four-times-filtered water for its customers. The water is, of course, filtered through the rocks on its journey across the mountains that, according to Queen’s University researchers, began , to , years ago. As for the punters, Martin says they see it as a “great novelty”.“They’re getting their draft beer and now they are getting draft water, he said.“The kids come in and want cordials or juices, so now well ask themthey want still or fizzy water – they think it’s a great novelty getting the fizzy water in the cordial.”While making connections with the pub’s past, Martin and his team are also looking to the future with the installation of farming allotments that will provide fruit, veg and more for it’s kitchens in the years to come."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38421911.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/2008192-_Read-Only_.jpg","title":"1000 children on waiting list yet trust returns half its funds for","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It led to many months of disrupted business for retailers and shoppers in the area after a cordon was put in place around the unsafe building. \"We all really felt it,\" he said.Read MoreClaire McNeilly: Why do we still not know how Belfast Primark fire started In October alone footfall was down % on the year before. Fast food restaurant City Picnic closed on the day of the fire and hasnt been opened since, though hopes to be open again by the autumn. Others such as Pizza Boutique struggled on for a time after the cordon was reduced, only to also shutter their premises completely.Primark opened two stores, one at the back of its Bank Buildings shop and another on Donegall Place - though it is also planning a restoration of Bank Buildings. Fashion chain Zara was closed for around seven months, thanks to its close proximity to Bank Buildings.Mr Rana said the first impact had been to galvanise organisations in the city to work together with a greater sense of urgency than ever before. \"There was Belfast City Council, then ourselves in the Chamber, then the other business-type organisations like Belfast City Centre Management and also the Department for Communities, and Translink.\"It did throw us together and resulted in a great deal of co-ordination and co-working. Its probably strengthened that relationship and added impetus to work together.\"That led to initiatives to draw people into the city centre around Christmas, such as a winter-themed slide in Royal Avenue and stalls selling fast food. And a kids play park was also installed in Castle Place.Mr Rana said: \"The animation that the council provided in the peak Christmas season meant the city was very busy, and that did attract people into the city that probably hadnt been in recently. data-dfpadtargeting\"\" title\"Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  \" width\"\" \"\"  \" title\"Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  \" width\"\" \"\"  Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  \"Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  \"Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  \"Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  \"Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  \"Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  \"Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  \"Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  \"Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  \"Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  Aerial view over Bank Buildings following Tuesdays fire.

Discussions are taking place, too, about pedestrianisation and improving public transport into and around the city. Mr Rana - whose company Andras House owns a string of hotels in the city - said the crisis of the fire had led to creative thinking. \"I would say it did stimulate new ideas to try things, which dont always work but its good to try them. \"It certainly has highlighted the importance of the city centre. When it wasnt ing we all really felt it.\"He said retail was the biggest pull into the city centre, but that the night-time economy and the drive to get more people living in it were also a big part of planning its future. And he said retail in Belfast centre - despite the well-publicised dficulties of the sector as a whole - was performing well.\"Weve had a new store, Anthropologie, opening in Arthur Street two Primark shops opening and CastleCourt Shopping Centre has a new Matalan, which does very well. \"And in Belfast, we still have our big-brand retailers like House of Fraser, Debenhams and Marks  Spencer - retailers which have closed stores in other city centres.\"And he said other parts of the city centre were being redeveloped, such as a site close to Smithfield Market and the Tribeca development around the Cathedral Quarter. The Tribeca name has attracted objections as its also the name of a district in New York. But Mr Rana said he did not object to the name. \"The name gives definition to the area and at the end of the day, the priority isnt the name but making sure development starts, proceeds and benefits the city centre.\""},{"url":null,"title":"claire hanna ready to set aside differences with sdlp to run for mp","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

In addition, they are commencing their career at an average age of .“We are not looking for preferential treatment for these teachers – we are simply looking for all teachers to be treated equally. Needless to say, they are fully supported by longer-serving colleagues in this campaign for justice and equity, which remains TUI’s key priority.“Those affected by this injustice are rightly frustrated at the slow pace of progress. For the sake of teachers and students, equal pay for equal work should be restored as a matter of urgency.”The union also says the crisis in teacher supply is directly attributable to this Government’s policy of the pay dferences for new entrants.A survey of principals in a sixth of the country’s second level schools carried out by TUI in April found that over the previous six months, % of schools experienced teacher recruitment dficulties % of schools advertised positions to which no teacher applied while % of schools had unfilled teaching vacancies.The union is now calling for the elimination of the remaining dferences in the early points of scale and commencement of recognition of the six-year unpaid training period."},{"url":null,"title":"archbishop in plea to investors to help tackle climate emergency","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

first announced on Wednesday morning, it still slumped to a six-day low.Downing Street confirmed that Boris Johnson has spoken to the Queen to request that Parliament is suspended until October .The Prime Minister insisted the move will allow him to bring forward a “bold and ambitious legislative agenda”, but he has faced staunch criticism that it could stle opposition to a no-deal Brexit.Pound

said: “The pound is in freefall this morning after plans emerged to prorogue Parliament and prevent MPs from passing legislation to prevent no-deal.“Either way, it certainly caught markets off-guard and came at a time when the pound had been recouping some of its losses.“The FTSE, as ever, is the unintended beneficiary of the plunge in the currency, given that the vast majority of its earnings are generated outside of the UK.”Analysts at investment management firm Brooks MacDonald said: “Sterling’s reaction has been for a sharp fall versus both the dollar and euro from already suppressed levels.“Domestic focused UK stocks have under-performed international peers as the heightened risk of a no-deal secession begins to be priced into markets.“With the outcome of Brexit remaining volatile and unclear, sterling will remain under pressure and trade within a range that reflects the dual possibilities of a deal and a disruptive exit.”"},{"url":null,"title":"rare baby wildebeest

It featured dramatic images of the famous Selma to Montgomery civil rights march in , alongside work on the Northern Irish civil rights struggle, from the first march in August  to the Battle of the Bogside in .Picturing Derry brought together some of the most iconic images from the Troubles and the most recent exhibition explored anxieties around Brexit which were part of a series of cross-border projects.Local artists were also regularly showcased at the gallery.Earlier this year plans to build a whiskey distillery in Ebrington fell through.But last week positive news emerged of plans to build two Grade A office blocks and a -apartment retirement village at the Waterside site.The Nerve Centre was contacted for comment regarding the gallery’s closure but did not respond at the time of going to press.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"new cain documents highlight unresolved political issues","story":"A new batch of documents added to Ulster University’s CAIN archive demonstrate how important issues affecting Northern Irish politics twenty years ago remain pertinent today.The newly released material provides a valuable insight into the period between -, mostly notably in relation to the Brooke Mayhew talks.In addition, it also charts developments in Anglo-Irish relations for these years, ongoing discussions around ious political and security matters, as well as important issues such as fair employment, the Irish language and community relations.The Brooke Mayhew negotiations took place to secure “a new, more broadly based agreement” which would replace the Anglo Irish Agreement.On the  March, , the first roundtable negotiations, excluding Sinn Fein, took place in an attempt to end the political stalemate in N.I., and continued through to November .Although they appeared to achieve little the Brooke Mayhew talks were the first to have \"three strands\", the relationships within Northern Ireland, between Northern Ireland and the Republic, and between London and Dublin. A basis had been laid for future discussions.The CAIN website, whose workers are based at the Magee campus in Derry, provides an extensive range of information and source material on the conflict and politics from  to the present day.The site is used by a worldwide audience and has received more than  million visits since it was launched in March .Earlier this year, the Derry News revealed that it was under threat of closure but thanks to a staunch defence of the site mounted by academics and researchers, Ulster University announced a nine-month reprieve while funding options are explored.Around  documents relating to the years  and  have been added to the CAIN website as part of ongoing work involving the Ulster University and the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland .The latest additions will bring to more than , the number of PRONI records available on CAIN.Dr Brendan Lynn, CAIN Deputy Director, said the archive is delighted to have been able to continue its cooperation with PRONI and to update the existing section with material dealing with the years  and .Mr Lynn commented: “CAIN has always sought to work with and iniduals, groups and organisations with relevant information relating to the Northern Ireland ‘troubles’ in order to make it available on-line.“An obvious example of this has been the partnership that CAIN has developed with The Public Record Office of Northern Ireland . As the official archive for Northern Ireland, one of PRONI’s many responsibilities is to receive government records from the early s onwards and to make them available for researchers.“The development of ‘PRONI Records on CAIN’ therefore provides people with an opportunity to gain access to a selection of material from the official files, that to date, chart the period from  to .“Looking ahead both CAIN and PRONI hope to continue this work to enable researchers to examine the events and personalities involved in the evolving ‘peace process’ of the s which culminated with the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in April .”‘Political stalemate’In terms of the latest documents, one of the most striking features of this material is that some of the issues which are so prominent today are the same ones which confronted politicians and policy makers back then.“For instance the search for an end to the political stalemate in Northern Ireland was dominated by a series of long, drawn out discussions – often referred to as the Brooke Mayhew talks of -. Whilst these were ultimately to end in failure they did leave behind an important template that was to be used at a later date,” Mr Lynn added.Dr Michael Willis, PRONI Director, has welcomed the publication of previously secret records through a continuing partnership between PRONI and Conflict Archive on the INternet .He said: “PRONI’s mission is to identy, preserve and promote public access to Northern Ireland’s archival heritage.“This latest addition of official documents to the CAIN website enhances the opportunity to view and read key documents from the time.

Then I got a local engineer to sandblast it and paint it so that is was like new and that cost another few thousand.ldquoThe rest of the cost will be spent on the build and the fit out inside. I reckon that even after we live in it for a while, it would still retain some valuewe wanted to sell itwe decide to travel again or rent it out. I see the cost as the equivalent to three yearsrsquo rent and itrsquos money not wasted as we still have something at the end of it.The tiny home concept mdashnormally one bed studio-style homes mdash has become popular for people looking for a simpler way of living in locations that they can change and without tying themselves down to massive mortgage.Michael, who is from Whiterock, and Alex, who is from Saintfield, discovered the concept while travelling and living in a small van in New Zealand for a year.ldquoI had been aware of tiny houses before we went to New Zealand and over there it is really popular, explained Michael. ldquoThey really are everywhere. Seeing how people live in these tiny houses inspired me that it could be done here too.ldquoWe lived in one of them during our time in New Zealand and loved it. It did simply our lives and it was a bit more sustainable which is a big thing is for us.ldquoWe donrsquot like the idea of renting for the next few years or being tied down to a mortgage and this allows us to be flexible, plus it is a bit adventurous.The couple, who first began to date after getting together at their leaving formal at Down High School, have designed their home with a galley kitchen with sitting area, a small shower room and loft bedroom in a building that is six metres long by . metres wide and . metres high.The house should be finished in time for Christmas and is kept near Lisbane where the couple try to work on it every day.Michael, a design engineer graduate, and Alex, who graduated in textile and design, are both working part-time jobs at the moment in order to devote themselves to the build.Michael said: ldquoWersquove done all the work ourselves in order to save money and to gain more skills. The exterior is nearly finished so we will be moving on to the interior soon.ldquoRegarding installing the utilities, some have pretty easy solutions and some are more dficult. As we would like some flexibility as to where we can park it, we donrsquot want to plug into mains electricity or the sewerage system, so the shower will be a standard shower with an instant water heater. Any grey water from the sink or shower will be probably be handled by some kind of natural filtration.Michael and Alex donrsquot yet know where they will site their home when it is finished but hope to place it on land owned by friends, or to rent out a field.They say that part of the reason to build their tiny home is financial, but also down to the way of le that living in such a small space brings with it.Michael said: ldquoWe like to do something more meaningful with our money and prefer travel experiences. We would rather not spend loads of money on a sofa mdash we would prefer to go travelling.He added: ldquoI would love to convert a camper van and go around Europe. I really donrsquot see the sense of buying up stuff and would rather have experiences that I would remember more.The couple want to have a cosy feeling to their home but not something too modern.Like caravans or boats, space is at a premium in a tiny house and Michael has designed stairs up to their loft bed so that extra storage can be built in.ldquoWe donrsquot have that much stuff which is good. Often when people do move into these small houses they find it dficult to get rid of a lot of stuff, he added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Call for play park upgrade  ","story":"MOTHERS in Ballynahinch are demanding that immediate improvements are made to the play park in Hillfoot Crescent.The women claim that due to vandalism and a lack of maintenance, the play facility is in dire need of an upgrade and is not fit for purpose to serve the needs of local children.The members of Hillfoot Crescent and Windmill Residents Association also say that the play facility is long overdue for some general weed tidying up by Newry, Mourne and Down Council which is responsible for it.A large group of women and children held an open meeting at the park last Thursday and invited local councillors to attend to see at first hand the poor state the park has declined into.Rowallane councillor Terry Andrews told the mothers, grandmothers and children that Hillfoot Crescent was one of three local parks due to be upgraded by the council within the next two years.However, while Ursula Jess, secretary of Hillfoot Crescent and Windmill Residents Association, welcomed the news, she said that the association would still be pressing for some interim improvements.ldquoItrsquos good to hear that a new play facility upgrade is supposed to be in the pipeline but we need something done between now and then, she said.ldquoWe urgently need it upgraded as therersquos no summer seats and parents and minders either have to stand or sit on the grass to keep an eye on the children and itrsquos not good enough. The seats were burnt one by one years ago and never replaced sowe were to get summer seats between now and the upgrade, it would be helpful.Mrs Jess said that Hillfoot Crescent got a Lottery grant in the late s to install the park and over the years broken equipment has not been replaced.She added: ldquoItrsquos a massive park with a lot of potential. We still have some tyre swings, a climbing frame, a slide and baby swings. There used to be a basket ball hoop but that is away now.ldquoItrsquos all been down to vandalism and general wear and tear. When the little elephant rockers were broken, the council just came and took them away but they werenrsquot replaced.She said that the play arearsquos summer seats were only replaced on one occasion after local vandals burnt them and had have not been replaced for years.Mrs Jess said that the community has done its best to keep the play park safe by sweeping away any broken glass and rubbish and have raised money for equipment in the past.The play facility caters for a large numbers of families at Millbank Grove Windmill Gardens, Windmill Drive, Windmill View, Carlisle Park and further afield, added Mrs Jess.Cllr Andrews said that he welcomed the residentsrsquo invitation to come along and to find out about the play facility.He said: ldquoThe play facility at Hillfoot Crescent serves a big catchment area with new developments being built in recent years.ldquoI was very impressed by the excellent turnout of parents, neighbours and children to convey their frustrations, worries and concerns about the condition of the existing playground here and the sense of being forgotten about.ldquoThey are calling for an upgrade to state of the art play parks that others in the Rowallane District Electoral Areahave been supplied with in recent times.ldquoI was able to tell them that Hillfoot Crescent is included in the line-up for an upgrade to new state of the art equipment.ldquoI will be lobbying and supporting this call at council level for this much-needed new play park to go ahead speedily along with those for Darragh Cross and Kilmore.The councillor said the council will encourage local residents and children to have their say and input into the new playground.He was presented with a heart-felt plea from the children for their park to be improved which was written as a poem and presented to him.It read: ldquoOur park is dying, itrsquos so sad, No one cares that it looks so bad.A lick of paint a bench or two, A modern slide area all overdue, So come on Council what do you say  Help us out and let us play..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Call to clean up Mary Street area of Crossgar  ","story":"CALLS have been issued for a clean-up of the Mary Street area in Crossgar.South Down MLA Colin McGrath and Rowallane councillor Terry Andrews have highlighted the need for the work to be carried out following a recent visit to the village.Mr McGrath mdash who was in Crossgar along with Cllr Andrews to listen to residentsrsquo concerns mdash is keen to see a resolution to the issues in Mary Street.ldquoPaths at this part of the village have become very poorly neglected and a dumping ground for some, the MLA explained.ldquoThis is totally unacceptable at a location adjacent to residentsrsquo garages and homes and the issue needs to be addressed as soon as possible.Mr McGrath suggested that the Mary Street problems are indicative of a wider issue people and groups across the country are going to have to get to grips with mdash determining who is responsible for certain pockets of land.He continued: ldquoBy the time it takes to actually determine ownership of areas, the issue could have been sorted multiple times over.

The remaining minutes of the half were played at a hectic pace with some tremendous play on show.Sheila McGrath and Greville handed Westmeath a three-point lead before Mallon and Dowdall swapped points as the game entered added time.However, Down had the bit between their teeth and three inspirational scores from Finnuala Carr, Aoe Keown and Mallon brought the sides level at - to - with time practically up.Westmeath were not to be denied a first half lead and a converted Greville free sent her side in at the break with a hard-earned - to - lead.The second half was every bit as competitive with Down again dominating the share of possession, but they continued to struggle to put that advantage to good use.Frees from Greville and Mairead McCormick and a magical strike from McGrath suddenly had Westmeath - to - ahead after  minutes.Down went for broke and minutes after Mallon and McCormick exchanged points, the predatory Saoirse Sands struck with venom when she netted after taking control of a Fionnuala Carr free.Paula Gribben reduced the deficit to two points before Greville and Mallon again exchanged scores. Mallon was unerring in front of the posts and with four minutes remaining she left a point in it after scoring from play.Unfortunately, McCrossan took advantage of two more Down wides from frees when she gave her side a - to - lead with two minutes of added time played.Sara Louise Carr kept the pot boiling with a th point for Down, but this was the last score of the game as the referee blew the final whistle on the resumption of play.Down: M McNally, N Kelly, A Savage, C McGilligan, C Rocks, D Magee, K McMullan, A Keown , P Gribben , S L Carr , D Savage, S McCartan, N Mallon , C McGourty, F Carr .

Earlier this year, a planning application was submitted to formally designate the area as a car park for council vehicles and staff cars as well.Concerned residents who live nearby and Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran expressed opposition to the move, describing the unofficial parking area in front of the remains of the townrsquos former workhouse as an ldquoeyesore, highlighting the noise created by heavy refuse vehicles starting up in the morning.Council officials say they have sold part of the existing Strangford Road site to the Education Authority to pave the way for the development of Down Highrsquos new multi-million pound campus.They explained that part of the land which has been sold to provide a new main entrance to the school includes an area which is currently used for council staff parking.The local authority is seeking planning approval to develop remaining land at the front and side of the old workhouse to provide parking for staff and its fleet of vehicles.In papers submitted ahead of todayrsquos planning meeting, it is confirmed that  homeowners who live close to the Strangford Road site were informed about the car park proposal, with some expressing concern about the impact it will have on property values.Concern was also raised about vehicle engines starting as early as .am, particularly at weekends, with those opposed to the planning application insisting that commercial vehicles should not be parked close to residential properties.Outlining their reasons for recommending that the planning application should be approved, planners admit that the car park plan will impact on the remains of the former workhouse which is of special architectural and historic importance.However, they confirm that the Department of Communities Historic Environment Division accept the parking plan in principle, provided the scheme respects the character of the area, suggesting that ldquosoft landscaping between banks of spaces with a low wall constructed to the western boundary.ldquoThe site is well established as the former Down Council offices, with a refuse depot to the rear, the planning papers continue.ldquoThe area has been used for staff parking with this application to formalise the arrangement with staff parking to the front and small vans to be parked at the side. The works proposed will aim to upgrade the existing frontage and use hardstanding to provide a more formalised parking arrangement.Planners say the existing land is to be regraded and resurfaced with low walls and have confirmed that external lighting also forms part of the proposal, with the current entrance set to be widened and new gates installed. Hedge planting is also proposed to help screen some of the activities to the rear of the site.Signicantly, the planning papers spell out clearly that the new parking at the front of the site will be laid out for vans and staff vehicles, not refuse vehicles.

However, just hours before it was due to start someone painted lsquoIRA on the wall in front of the nearby Pilson Hall.The spokesperson revealed that when the graffiti appeared last week they contacted a specialist cleaner to have it removed and were prepared to meet the financial cost. However, the businessman agreed to do the work for free.ldquoNo one in Mount Crescent or Bridge Street wants sectarian graffiti. It does not reflect the good people who live at this part of the town, the spokesperson declared.ldquoWe were left disgusted at what happened given that we are working hard to promote our area and secure new investment, just like many other community groups across Downpatrick. This despicable act was not done in our name and we condemn those responsible.ldquoWe are not prepared to let those responsible have a negative impact on the good people, from all religions and races, who live at this part of Downpatrick.

We trust that our community collective colleagues will recognise that the sentiments expressed in the recent graffiti is not what we are about.ldquoWe work with people from across the town and liaise closely with them on a regular basis. We are vey much a mixed community and indeed are proud of this fact. The graffiti daubed on the wall of Down High School in no way reflects the people of this area.The spokesperson said residents were left ldquoshocked and upset by what was written and were in the process of taking steps to have it removed when a local businessman stepped forward to do it.ldquoWe have a fair idea who was responsible for the graffiti and hope that they will be apprehended. We cannot emphasis enough that what happened was not done on our name and we condemn those behind this. We will not let people tarnish the work that we are doing or the good name of the Mount Crescent and Bridge Street area.ldquoWe hope the fact that we took steps to contact a specialist cleaner when we were made aware of the graffiti speaks volumes about our views on this matter. Those responsible are clearly not aware of what we are about and the respect we have for all our neighbours across Downpatrick.The spokesperson added: ldquoWe will not allow what happened to drive a wedge between us and others. If those responsible hoped the finger of blame would be pointed at us, they have failed.

He said what happened last week does not reflect the town and its people and was in fact a hate crime.ldquoThose responsible do not speak for the majority of people here, declared Cllr Trainor. ldquoThere are many families who were impacted by the troubles, including some by collusion with the security forces, and this does not help to heal those wounds which are still very fresh.Cllr Trainor added: ldquoI condemn this act and all graffiti that is sectarian in nature which seeks to cause offence and hurt to a particular section of our community.Police investigating last weekrsquos incident have issued an appeal for information and want to hear from anyone who can assist them with their enquiries to come forward, using the non-emergency  number.

Their unique wing structure along with their light weight enables them to go to places that other land-based mammals would find unmanageable. Their limbs are highly modied for flight, so they find it dficult to move around on the ground. When they are not flying, they rest hanging upside down from a tree branch using their sharp claws.Roosting in caves, trees or draught-free buildings each species has their own preferred roost, usually near its main food source. They eat insects including moths and midges, so are considered a very important natural pest controller. Echolocation aids their navigation when hunting for prey on the wing at night. Bats are creatures of habit, ing to their favourite roost each year..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button Northern Ireland has eight species of bats, all protected by European law. Apart from being incredible little animals to watch, bats are a valuable part of nature across the UK and can be a very welcome visitor to our gardens. Sadly, though, they’re becoming increasingly rare in the UK. Like so many other animals, a gradual loss of habitat and roost sites are making numbers decline at an alarming rate. As old trees are cut down, buildings disturbed and mines filled in, bats are left with very few natural roost sites. Making sure our gardens are thriving insect-rich feeding grounds for bats can help a lot. And, just as we do with nestboxes for birds, we can also provide alternative roost sites for bats in the form of bat boxes. You can find out more information on how to help bats via our website . So while our Belfast Bat Walk is done for another year, we have another fantastic event taking place in Enniskillen in September. What better date for a ‘Bat Detectives’ guided walk than Friday the th  It’s a great opportunity to learn more about bats, to see and hear them and immerse yourself in their world. There will be a short introductory talk about bats followed by a night-time walk using bat detectors to identy the dferent species living in Enniskillen town centre. Tickets are £ per adult, £. per child and free for all RSPB members.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong. We can do what we want when we work hard.Whatrsquos a girl to do  will be distributed to schools across the area and copies from the initial print run, funded by Tarmac Cement and Lime, can be requested by emailing kara.bennett@tarmac article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Have the courage of your convictions, Boris Johnson.ldquoCall an election now ndash with polling day before Oct  ndash and let the people vote. Or are you frit It was also announced on Wednesday that petitioners who launched legal action to stop Boris Johnson from suspending Parliament are considering the option of pursuing an emergency ruling from the courts.A cross-party group of more than  MPs and peers has indicated it will now consider seeking an interim interdict ndash similar to an injunction in England and Wales ndash at the Court of Session in Edinburgh to block prorogation, with a hearing currently scheduled for September .Scottish Labour MP Ian Murray, one of the petitioners, said:ldquoBoris Johnsonrsquos plan to suspend Parliament is an assault on our democracy.ldquoThis is the peoplersquos Parliament and the people deserve to have their representatives in Parliament during this vital period. This is the opposite of taking back control.ldquoLegal action to prevent the Prime Minister suspending Parliament has already been fast-tracked through the courts and the legal team will now consider the appropriate next steps, including seeking interim orders. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Ruth Davidson has been urged to oppose the Prime Ministerrsquos move  --Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie urged Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson to condemn the move by Mr Johnson.ldquoThis is an Eton coup and a democratic outrage, he said.ldquoI hope that Ruth Davidson will join the chorus of condemnation that this decision deserves and confirm that Scottish Conservatives will oppose any measures to prevent parliament having its say.ldquoThis process began with a democratic vote, it must not end with a behind closed doors stitch up.Scottish Greens co-Leader Patrick Harvie said: ldquoBoris Johnson led a Leave campaign which cheated and broke the law to win.ldquoItrsquos no surprise that now hersquos the Prime Minister he is continuing his assault against democracy.ldquoIf we need to lsquotake back controlrsquo from anyone, we need to take it back from him.ldquoThe people of Scotland are used to the UK Government treating them with contempt but this move by Johnson takes this contempt to a whole new level and reinforces the need for the people to have a say over the future direction of our country..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Sturgeon laments  udark day for democracy u article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

Now in its st year, the region’s longest established listing of company performance provides insight on the accomplishments of Northern Ireland based companies, either Northern Ireland registered or where a signicant proportion of their business is transacted in the province. The  edition of the Top  incorporates analysis of figures filed at each companies year end and posted at Companies House and primarily relate to financial periods ending in late ,  and . SUMMARY Sales have grown to £.bn from £.bnwhich is a growth of .%. While extremely encouraging this result needs to be tempered with the fact that profits for the top companies decreased by nearly % to £.m. Shareholder value for the Top  companies increased by .%. Revenue sales Sales revenue is the income received by a company from its sales of goods or the provision of services. The performance of the Top  showing a .% sales growth to £.bn is exceptional in what is a dficult trading environment and period of uncertainty for the provinces businesses. The Brexit question came to the fore on June ,  so all the financial figures shown in the listing have come post the referendum and in essence since the suspension of the Assembly in January . Moy Park continues to hold sway with the highest turnover, currently £.bn, up from £.bn previously – snapping close at their heels is WR Barnett Ltd . Next in the listing are a number of high fliers, LCC Group Ltd and John Graham Holdings Ltd. John Graham Holdings Ltd, which trades as Graham, is another privately owned company based in Hillsborough and specialising in building and civil engineering projects – Graham posted annual sales of £.m in its latest financial accounts up from £.m – an increase of some .% year on year. One of the perennial high performers of the Top  showed a signicant decrease in sales dropping it from a position last year of  to a position this year of . Fane Valley Co-Operative‘s sales decreased from £m to £.m – this is a result of their change in ownership of Linden Foods. Linden Foods is now a joint venture and has entered the list at number  with sales of £.m. Another indicator of strong performance within the listing is that turnover figure required to gain access to the Ulster Business Top  is at its highest ever, with Heron Bros Ltd posting year end sales results for    of £.m. Last year’s number  was Cranswick Country Foodswith sales of £.m. This represents a rise in sales required of .%, to make the Top . Cranswick Country Foodshas risen to  in the listing posting impressive sales growth of %. Profitability Since the Ulster Business Top ’s inception in , we have identied the top companies by measuring turnover, while also accepting that both profitability and tangible shareholder value are also key measures of performance. This year has seen a drop in profit margin for the Top  companies from a margin of .% to .% with total profits now sitting at £.m compared to £.bn for the corresponding companies in their prior year. Northern Ireland Water Ltd has retained its position as the most profitable business within the listing, posting pre tax profits of £.m on a turnover of £.m a margin of .%. Northern Ireland Electricity Networks Ltd is second most profitable with pre tax figures of £m against a turnover of £.m . While the reduction in profitability of the Top  is disappointing this can be tempered by the fact that a number of the companies made signicant losses during the last filed figures recorded for the compilation of the listing. Short Bros PLC after currency adjustments filed losses of £.m, CaterpillarLtd posted losses of £.m, Northern Ireland Transport Holding Companyfiled losses of £.m, EP Kilroot Power losses of £m and Dunnes Stores Bangor Ltd losses of £m. The level of losses across the Top  listing is unprecedented with the  companies that posted losses amounting to £.m. Tangible net worth Tangible net worth is most commonly a calculation of the net worth of a company that excludes any value derived from intangible assets such as s, patents, goodwill and intellectual property. Tangible net worth is a simple calculation of a company’s total tangible assets minus the company’s total liabilities. A business’s tangible net worth provides a snapshot of your financial situation at this point in time. The current tangible net worth of the Ulster Business Top  currently sits at £.bn – as the Top  listing is fluid with companies entering and leaving the list any comparison with previous listing can be distorted, however compared to the  listing tangible net worth has increased by £m. Six of the companies within the Top  have liabilities that outweigh their assets. Increasing the tangible net worth shareholder value is of prime importance for the management of a company. So the management must have the interests of shareholders in mind while making decisions. The higher the shareholder value, the better it is for the company and management. The shareholdersfor the Ulster Business Top  equates to profit tangible net worth and as a percentage sits at % The sales to equity ratio defined as turnover tangible net worth provides an indicator of how much money are generated by the business with each pound invested, for the current Top  this amounts to .. Employees A total of , people are employed by Northern Ireland’s Top  Companies, a decrease from , employed by the companies in the  listing. Moy Park Ltd , Almac Group , Short Brothers PLC , Queen’s University , and Northern Ireland Transport Holding Companymake up the top five employers within the listing. Each employee within the Top  accounted for £, turnover – sales employee and accounted for £, profit – profit employee. Location Since the inception of the Top  we have periodically looked at the geographic location of the companies within Northern Ireland – historically the east of the province has held sway over the west – however, we are beginning to see a sht with currently  businesses based in Belfast, Co Antrim and Co Down, with Co Tyrone being a major recipient of Top  activity. Breaking down the sectors As would be expected when looking at the line of business activity of the Top , both the wholesale retail and manufacturing sectors dominate, accounting for some  of the companies. NOTES A date of the June ,  has been used as the cut-off for the filing of accounts for the inclusion in this year’s Ulster Business Top . The listing has been compiled by using a combination of data sourced from both Dun  Bradstreet’s information database and Companies House.   . Short Brothers files in dollars, while KN Networks Ltd and Lakeland Dairies Ltd files in euros. To allow for fair comparison their financial results have been amended to reflect the currency value at their financial year-end. .

We speak to founder Daniel Crawford and his team about the journey so far A spark in the mind of Daniel Crawford as he studied for his masters degree in Glasgow just a few years ago has grown into a business at the sharp end of technology. axialD is tasked with turning the complicated and laborious process of converting D medical scans into D models – and producing them for use by surgeons and medical professionals. It’s an ever-growing business, spun out of Ulster University, which is expanding its reach across the UK, Ireland and now into the US where it’s targeting a burgeoning fresh marketplace. The company has been involved with Catalyst since , been directly involved with a host of its programmes, and is participating in the EU INTERREG funded North West Centre for Advanced Manufacturing , managed by the Special European Union Programmes Body . Catalyst is Northern Ireland’s leading technology hub, home to  companies and around , staff. Daniel has a strong team around him – growing to  staff based in Belfast city centre, including Niall Haslam, chief technology officer, Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships and Cathy Coomber as operations manager. While studying medical visualisation and human anatomy in Glasgow, Daniel was exposed to the raft of imaging available – including CT, MRI and ultrasound, and began examining how the crucial data could be better used. The biomedical physics undergraduate grew the idea into his thesis – looking at converting D data sets and converting them into fully D printable files. “That allows us to turn images into D models to allow surgeons or registrars, to understand digital pathologies, before going in to theatre,” he said. “But we discovered it wasn’t just good for that and surgeons also wanted to get their hands on the D models.” That gave Daniel greater scope for developing the concept. In one early case, a surgeon was able to use one of the D prints to identy small fractures in a patient who had suffered a motorcycle crash, that weren’t initially apparent using more traditional methods. The company was thrust into Catalyst’s Springboard programme in  – a  week scheme which allowed a would-be entrepreneur, fresh out of university, access to business training and development, which included working with PathXL’s Stuart Harvey. From there, it was into the Halo programme – bringing axialD together with angel investors in order to get the start-up off the ground. It landed £, through Techstart and private investors, which allowed the company to get the ball rolling. Through Catalyst, Daniel also got the opportunity to visit MIT and the entrepreneurial development programme, Way to Scale, bringing axialD to Massachusetts and the Boston area – the global heart of the health technology sector. Niall Haslam is axialD’s chief technical officer. He said a Belfast and Boston partnership has helped strengthen the links between the cities, bringing firms from Northern Ireland to the US for both networking and scoping out the potential for setting up shop across the Atlantic. “The Way to Scale program brings entrepreneurs together. It’s a great networking opportunity,” Niall says. axialD is now a partner in the EU INTERREG-funded NW CAM, which brings together a network of research institutes, universities and enterprises to carry out research in advanced manufacturing. It is working with Ulster University on a number of projects, including looking at developing custom designed jigs for hospitals to produce D models. Cathy Coomber has been with axialD for three years. “What we have done in that time is looking at standardising the processes,” she says. “Biomedical engineers from Ulster University and those across the UK are producing data, manually segmenting thousands of medical images in order to help them develop an algorithm. “That allows us to massively improve our standardised process and reduce the time involved in producing those files.” That could mean reducing the time down from up to five hours, to as little as an hour. “When the company started, Daniel was able to get those early users excited in Glasgow, and then setting up in Belfast there were key surgeons which helped set the pace,” Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships said. The company has since been involved with NHS frameworks as a means to help remove as many bottlenecks as possible. This involves developing and marketing the products to the NHS and HSC in the Republic – helping them to learn about the product, the process and what area of specialism it can be used in. “In the last  months with the development of the algorithms, we are moving in to the US,” Katie said. “We’re seeing a lot of growth in the US.” And the axialD team is also growing fast. “We have  staff at the moment but are looking to expand in  months,” Daniel said. “That includes new staff in the US to help grow and manage that market as we further expand our software team back home.” The success of axialD mirrors the overall success of Catalyst, since its inception  years ago. It’s an independent not-for-profit organisation across its four sites – including its largest base at the Titanic Quarter in Belfast, alongside its Londonderry hub, Ballymena, along with the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub at Danske Bank in Belfast city centre.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
