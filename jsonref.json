File photograph: Damien MeyerAFP via Getty ImagesThe milder impact of the Omicron variant of Covid-19 on infected people and hospitals has led the Government to relax the rules on isolation and testing to allow more people return to work and to protect essential public services. Here is a guide to what you need to know about the new rules in this regard.What are the changes?The Government has agreed to loosen rules on Covid-19 testing, self-isolation guidance for those who test positive for the virus, and restrictions for people who are close contacts of Covid cases.What is the biggest change?The most significant difference is on fully vaccinated close contacts who have received their vaccine booster and are not displaying any symptoms of Covid-19. They no longer have to restrict their movements for five days. Instead, they are being asked to wear a medical (typically blue) or higher-grade face mask (the typically white FFP2N95 variety) for 10 days when in crowded or enclosed spaces and to take regular antigen tests over seven days, with the last test on day seven. Close contacts who have not been boosted only have to restrict their movements for seven days, instead of the 10 previously recommended.Close contacts of any age who have themselves recovered following Covid-19 detected by a PCR or antigen test since December 1st are not required to restrict movements or test if asymptomatic.What effect will these particular changes have?This new arrangement will likely affect tens of thousands of people who are stuck at home and cannot go to work, ensuring – most importantly – that essential services can continue.What is happening with testing?Previously if people between the ages of four and 39 with symptoms tested positive for Covid-19 on an antigen test, they had to get an official PCR test through the HSE to confirm their infection. From now on, anyone who has a positive antigen test no longer needs to go for a PCR test. They can register their positive antigen test result on and upload their close contacts to the HSE’s system and antigen tests will then be sent out to their close contacts.What is changing in relation to the rules for those who test positive for Covid-19?There has been no change in the rule for people who have received the vaccine boosters: if these people test positive, they still have to self-isolate for seven days. For those who have not received a booster dose who test positive, however, they only have to self-isolate for seven days, instead of the 10 previously. In other words, everyone who tests positive for Covid-19 will only have to isolate for seven days. People should only exit self-isolation after seven days if their symptoms have substantially or fully resolved for the final two of those seven days.Are any additional precautions being recommended?For 10 days including any isolation periods, both confirmed Covid-19 cases and close contacts are advised to limit close contacts with people outside their household, especially in crowded, enclosed or poorly ventilated spaces to wear a face mask in crowded spaces to take an antigen test before entering crowded spaces or prior to close contact with others outside their household, and to work from home if possible.Everyone over 12 who tests positive should wear a medical grade or FFP2 face mask for 10 days under this new advice and children aged between nine and 12 who test positive should wear a well-fitted mask for 10 days. Any close contacts over 12 who have not been boosted should wear an FFP2 or medical grade mask for 10 days. The State’s chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan has said that booster vaccines for children aged 12 to 15 will be considered shortly.When will these changes come into effect?From midnight on Thursday, so most people will not enjoy the benefit of these changes until they wake up on Friday morning.Will the State be sending out antigen tests and medical and respirator masks for free?The HSE is already sending out antigen tests to close contacts but the Government is not planning on providing them to the general public. There are no plans to distribute free medical-grade masks or the more expensive FFP2 respirator masks. Opposition parties have called on the Government to cover the cost of both antigen tests and medical grade masks for all households.What has led to these rule changes?New EU advice from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) issued last weekend paved the way, with a change in guidance for close contacts. The ECDC said that if any close contacts had a negative PCR or antigen test, they may not need to restrict their movements so long as they self-monitor for symptoms, continue to wear a mask and stay away from vulnerable groups. Dr Holohan told Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly in a letter on Tuesday that the updated guidance from the ECDC, considering the rapid spread of Omicron in Europe, aimed to provide options on quarantine, particularly when countries face “high or extreme pressure” on health systems and other essential services.What is the motivation to make the changes now when daily case numbers are still so high?The vast number of confirmed Omicron infections since Christmas has affected two or three times this number because of people being identified as close contacts of those cases. Given that Dr Holohan estimated that up to 500,000 people were likely to have been infected last week, this would mean well in excess of 1 million additional people may be forced to stay at home, based on the average number of close contacts. The Government had expressed concern that the rules on close contacts were causing major difficulties for businesses and public services. An estimated 15,000 HSE staff are currently out on Covid-related leave, putting hospitals under severe pressure.Is it premature given the high number of cases?Some have suggested that it is, particularly when the seven-day average of new daily cases is still north of 20,000. Dublin City University immunology professor Christine Loscher expressed surprise at the “blanket” easing of close contact requirements amid concerns over how much more transmissible the Omicron variant was and how little was known about what percentage of close contacts become infected.How do the changes compare with what is happening in other countries?In the UK, since Tuesday, most people with a positive antigen test have not been required to take a confirmatory PCR test to confirm they have Covid-19. Last week, Germany reduced self-isolation for positive Covid-19 cases and close contacts from 14 days to 10, with the option to end their isolation period on day seven with a Covid-19 test. The US has gone further, reducing the amount of time that confirmed Covid-19 cases must isolate to five days last month.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"up to 220 000 doses of covid 19 booster vaccines may expire by end of month","story":"The Health Service Executive says 400,000 to 500,000 doses are due to go out of date over the next two weeks. Photograph: iStockUp to 220,000 doses of Covid-19 booster vaccines may expire by the end of the month unless the current rate of uptake increases.The glut of supplies is the result of decreased demand after Christmas and a higher than expected number of infections, which makes people ineligible to receive a booster for three months.The Health Service Executive says 400,000 to 500,000 doses are due to go out of date over the next two weeks. The Pfizer and Moderna doses were delivered to mass vaccination centres, community hospitals, GP surgeries and pharmacies late last year.A spokesman said it was expected “a lot of these” doses will be used but acknowledged some supplies are likely to expire before they can be given to people. Out of date supplies will have to be destroyed.About 120,000 boosters were administered last week and 200,000 the week before. If this rate was maintained over the coming fortnight, that would leave 120,000-220,000 doses unused before going out of date.The HSE estimates more than 700,000 vaccinated people have yet to receive their booster, although about 140,000 of these are ineligible at present due to recent infection.Next stageIt plans to renew appeals to all those eligible to come forward and take advantage of the availability of vaccines and boosters over the next couple of weeks, the spokesman said.The next stage of the vaccine rollout, the administration of fourth doses to immunocompromised patients, is likely to make some additional inroads into supplies.The National Immunisation Advisory Committee is expected to make a decision soon on booster doses for 12- to 15-year-olds. However, a five-month interval is expected to apply between completion of the primary vaccine and the delivery of a booster, so delivery of the extra shot to this group cannot start in earnest until February at the earliest.A different dosage also applies to this age group compared with adults.Dr Denis McCauley, chair of the GP committee of the Irish Medical Organisation, said family doctors have about 200,000 doses on hand and many “probably won’t be used”.He said GPs had done all they could to ensure supplies were not wasted since vaccination started and “that’s the situation still”.Dr McCauley said the reason stocks on hand were so high was because so many people got the Omicron variant of Covid-19 and also because of “some apathy” among under-25s.While about 45 per cent of the population had received a booster, 75 per cent had either been boosted or got Omicron, so this left only a small proportion eligible.He said the decision to provide many GPs with a month’s supply of boosters before Christmas was the right one, as it ensured the maximum number of people got boosted in time for the wave caused by Omicron. About 250,000 people received a booster from GPs in the four days before Christmas, he pointed out.Dr McCauley also called for clarity on the issuing of certificates of recovery from the virus, which can be used as alternatives to the Covid-19 pass held by vaccinated people. A positive PCR test or professionally administered antigen test is required to obtain the certificate of recovery, but since last week the HSE stopped requiring a confirmatory PCR test where someone tests antigen positive.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"dublin castle ceremony marks 100 years since british handover of power","story":"President Michael D Higgins inspects the Guard of Honour 3 Infantry Battalion  at the State commemoration to mark the centenary of the handover of Dublin Castle, at Dame Street, Dublin. Photograph: Dara Mac Dónaill President Michael D Higgins has unveiled a plaque marking 100 years to the day since Dublin Castle was handed over by the British administration to the Provisional Irish Government.The plaque, in Irish and English, is located over the archway between the lower and upper yards of Dublin Castle, where the handover ceremony took place.The inscription reads: “In a room above this archway, Dublin Castle was formally handed over by the last Lord Lieutenant of Ireland Viscount FitzAlan of Derwant to the Provisional Government of Ireland led by its chairman Michael Collins. ”The handover of power 100 years ago was recalled in a reconstruction of the events of that day by actor Phelim Drew.The original ceremony, on January 16th, 1922, was to have taken place at midday, but was delayed because Michael Collins was not in Dublin.When he arrived in the city, he went to the Mansion House and was duly elected chairman of the Provisional Government.At 1.20pm, the Provisional Government telephoned Dublin Castle and told the British there that they were on their way.At 1.40pm, eight members of that government arrived in three taxi cabs and made their way to the Privy Counsel suite above the archway in Dublin Castle to meet FitzAlan.One anecdote – that FitzAlan had chastised Collins for being seven minutes late, to which Collins allegedly responded that the British had kept the Irish waiting for seven centuries – was most likely apocryphal, Drew told the assembled crowd.“This seems unlikely, as he and his colleague were an hour and 40 minutes late,” he said.Later, Collins told his fiancée Kitty Kieran of the handover: “I am as happy a man as there is in Ireland today.”The original day of the handover was described as a “cold, raw January day”, but the centenary ceremony, the first State commemoration held since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, was conducted in beautiful winter sunshine.Taoiseach Micheál Martin, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar, members of the Government, members of the Council of State and relatives of those who had negotiated the Anglo-Irish Treaty in 1921 were present.The event, which was held at the same time as the events of 100 years ago, was also attended by UK ambassador in Ireland Paul Johnston.Mr Martin said it was appropriate to honour the achievements of the revolutionary generation, and “we do so with pride that the State they helped to create is entering its second century of independent, democratic government”.Earlier, President Higgins hosted a reception at Áras an Uachtaráin for relatives of the Irish delegation that attended the negotiations around the Anglo-Irish Treaty.President Higgins said those who negotiated the treaty “all had the most honourable intentions, were concerned to interpret what could not be anticipated in terms of a definitive mandate, and did their very best in an extremely challenging context”.British prime minister David Lloyd George’s threat of “immediate and terrible war” was a “defining aspect of the treaty negotiations”, President Higgins added.‘Complete independence’Nevertheless the treaty negotiators were able to secure “complete independence for the new State in its domestic affairs, powers to levy all taxes, regulate foreign trade, raise an army, and considerable freedom on foreign policy”.The people too gave their blessing to the treaty for a “settlement that was seen, both at home and abroad, as the best hope for what might be a long road to peace”.The treaty also had to be seen from the perspective of the British, who had conceded much to Ireland, and the Irish example would provide “an inspiration, as indeed it did, throughout the emancipatory decolonisations of the 20th century”, the president concluded.The actual handover of power to the Irish Provisional Government 100 years ago was a low-key, hurried affair that was the culmination of years of war and revolution in Ireland. It also came following the partition of the island and the creation of Northern Ireland in 1921.The State is coming towards of the end of a so-called “decade of centenaries”, which have seen the events leading up to Irish independence remembered and publicly discussed.In the months to come, the State will also remember the Civil War, which was sparked by isions over the contents of the Anglo-Irish Treaty. – Additional reporting: PAStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"coveney ordered internal investigation into champagne celebration","story":"Simon Coveney asked the general secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs, Joe Hackett, to examine the circumstances surrounding the impromptu gathering.

The interview saw long pauses and hesitancy on his part when asked about the status of the gathering.Asked if because of his uncertainty over its legality should it be investigated, he said it was a role for the civil service. Asked if Mr Coveney should ask his department to carry out an inquiry, he said: “That’s obviously a matter for him to decide.”"},{"url":null,"title":"miriam lord colourful handover ceremony restores dignity to dublin castle","story":"President Michael D Higgins inspects the Defence Forces guard of honour during a ceremony at Dublin Castle to mark 100 years since the handover of Dublin Castle. Photograph: Julien BehalPA WireIt began in 1922 with a simple handover of power from the British to most of the Irish.But many decades along the way, with the new nation modernising and monetising, Dublin Castle became less known as the home of the historic handover and increasingly notorious as a home from home for hand-over-fist merchants.After 70 years a-growing, the hot news from the upper and lower yards went from accounts of a low-key transfer of power to lurid reports of the abuse of that power. The castle became a place where successive tribunals explored how money went into brown envelopes and secret bank accounts.So while the old walls witnessed many more powerful men traversing those ancient cobbles, their motives were not exactly in the Michael Collins category of state service.Dignity and honour reasserted itself on Sunday for a State commemoration of that historic handover of power, the ceremony taking place beneath the room where it happened exactly 100 years ago.As the historians have been pointing out for the past week, the event was a brief and somewhat rushed affair, with the British keen to get the formal process over as quickly and quietly as possible and the Irish side in a hurry to get back to the Mansion House, where the provisional government was meeting.The ceremony in the courtyard a century later kept to the same short, early afternoon timetable while the tone of the proceedings echoed the deliberately low-key nature of one of the most significant events in Irish history. But where Michael Collins and his fellow ministers were driven through cheering crowds as they approached the castle gates, the turnout on this occasion was sparse.There were no flags flying at the castle when the last lord lieutenant of Ireland, Viscount FitzAlan of Derwent, formally handed over Dublin Castle and the power that went with it to Collins, chairman of the provisional government of Ireland.It was different on Sunday, with the raising of the Tricolour a central part of the ceremony. That honour was accorded to Sgt Shirley Stafford from Newbridge, Co Kildare, whose family has a record of unbroken service in the Defence Forces since 1922.It was a proud moment for Sgt Stafford, who is a member of the Air Corps and has served on five overseas missions. Her great-grandfather Christopher Jordan signed up in 1922 and retired as a gunner in the Artillery Corps, while her grandfather Jack Stafford served during the Emergency and retired as a sergeant in the Artillery Corps. Her father, Séan, who died in service in 1997, was a member of the Armoured Cavalry Squadron base in the Curragh.Three of Sgt Stafford’s siblings are in the Defence Forces, while the fourth is a garda. “It was very emotional to be out there and representing my family,” she said afterwards, confessing she had to fight back the tears during the national anthem. “It was such an honour to be chosen. I really enjoyed the moment and will cherish it always.”Her mother, Alacoque, was in the viewing stand for the occasion. She knew Séan would have been proud to see one of his children raising the flag on such a historic day. “He is watching over all of us today, that’s for sure.”Another handoverThe President, the Taoiseach and the lord mayor of Dublin led the cast of dignitaries invited to the castle to mark the centenary. Members of the Cabinet were out in force – Simon Coveney seated between two Fianna Fáil colleagues. Tánaiste Leo Varadkar was marched in under the arch by an Army officer, with a blast from the band, and deposited in the front row.He will have had particular interest in the ceremony: was he looking for ideas on how to mark that other big handover at the end of the year, when he is due to swap places with Taoiseach Micheál Martin?Maybe bring in some food trucks and replace all the retired dudes with more happening celebrities? And get Champagne Coveney to organise the after-show party? Lots to think about.Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald headed the Opposition turnout.It may have taken her party a lot longer than all the others to recognise the State and its government and the real Óglaigh na hÉireann on parade in the castle, but better late than never. There was some quiet comment about her choice of handbag, which appeared to be adorned with a very large lily, but even for image-conscious Sinn Féin that seems like a sartorial statement too far.She was seated next to the all-powerful secretary general to the Government, Martin Fraser. With her party riding high in the opinion polls and a stint in power within her grasp, did Mary Lou take the opportunity to bend Martin’s ears for a few little insider tips?Two former taoisigh attended, Enda Kenny and Bertie Ahern. Bertie who must have been thrilled to be back in Dublin Castle and not appearing before a tribunal. And there were two former presidents in the audience, Mary Robinson and Mary McAleese.The Social Democrats were represented by co-leader Catherine Murphy, while Alan Kelly and Dublin lord mayor Alison Gilliland were the Labour standard bearers.The British ambassador, Paul Johnston, looked happy out, which couldn’t have been said about the viceroy back in 1922. Imagine if things had gone differently and Ireland were still under British rule. This country would be party central now, with Boris Johnson hosting cabinet on tour sessions in Coppers and an Irish political press corps that isn’t bored out of its skull most of the time.Imaginary medalsAnyway, earnest and sensible Micheál Martin (there’s a lot to be said for it) was next to be tootled into the courtyard by the Army Band. The Taoiseach, a keen student of Irish political history, was taking things very seriously. We could hear him before we could see him, his heels crunching off the cobbles as he marched under the arch in the upper courtyard at alarming speed, three senior officers quick-stepping in his wake.“Clip-clop, clip-clop, left-right, left-right!” Micheál powered up past the viewing stands to the guard of honour. Unlike the Army lads and lassies, the Taoiseach hadn’t any ironmongery to show off, but judging by the way he was moving, in his head he had a row of 40 medals on his chest.He took his place on the VIP platform as distant sirens indicated that Michael D and Sabina were on their way. Eventually, the President’s car and motorcycle escort arrived in the upper yard, where he took the presidential salute before inspecting the guard of honour.Back to 1922 and the formal handover of power in a room over the archway between the two courtyards. Collins commented afterwards on the lavish “gilded and purple” decor in the Privy Council Chamber. He made particular note of the carpets. “We had red carpet laid for us that momentous moment.”Interestingly, the ceremonial carpets in the Dublin Castle courtyard for the VIP guests in 2022 were a dull grey. Who ever rolls out the grey carpet? Nobody.But the rest of this short and dignified ceremony shone with colour.At the end of it, President Higgins unveiled a plaque on the stone wall between the two yards. He pulled back the blue velvet curtain to reveal the inscription: “In a room above this archway, Dublin Castle was formally handed over by the last Lord Lieutenant of Ireland Viscount FitzAlan of Derwent to the Provisional Government of Ireland led by its chairman Michael Collins.”There was talk of a ceremonial Cabinet meeting afterwards, with the nod to the meeting in the Mansion House. We overheard the word “reception” mentioned by a few ministers, but invitation came there none. Again this was in keeping with the historically accurate objective – the press wasn’t allowed inside either 100 years ago. Of course, there was no social distancing back then.One wonders how many Ministers were willing to chance a socially distanced sausage on a stick on Sunday.Perhaps the most special guest of all was Elizabeth Berney, who will be 101 in May. She is the daughter of Gen Richard Mulcahy, and her two aunts – Phyllis Ryan and the Mary Kate Ryan – were married to Sean T O’Kelly and her mother was engaged to Seán Mac Diarmada. As a baby she survived a raid by the Black and Tans.Hale and hearty, she rounded off the event by having her photograph taken with the Taoiseach in the centre of the sunlight courtyard."},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"maureen dowd joe biden better build better or he won t be back","story":"Joe Biden President Biden ‘fancied himself another Master of the Senate. Unfortunately, he was thinking about the Senate of 1984’. Photograph:  Brendan SmialowskiAFP via Getty ImagesOh, the tribulations of Job Biden! Kyrsten Sinema humiliated him. Mitch McConnell disrespected him. The supreme court blocked him. Vladimir Putin scorned him. Inflation defied him. Covid stalked him. Even Stacey Abrams stiffed him. There are any number of sentiments to feel about what the president is enduring right now, and we should feel all of them. Pity, anger, disappointment, embarrassment – and hope that he can get it going, because the alternative is really bad.As hapless as Biden and his coterie are, we can’t give up on the president because he’s all that stands between us and the apocalypse at the hands of Trump, DeSantis, Pence, Kristi Noem and future chief justice Amy Coney Barrett. President Biden fancied himself another Master of the Senate. Unfortunately, he was thinking about the Senate of 1984. He was supposed to be Mitch McConnell’s equal in senatorial cunning. But, so far, McConnell – the Einstein of obstruction – has been astonishingly successful in ruining Biden’s agenda.Biden’s one big accomplishment, infrastructure, was achieved with McConnell’s support because there was enough home-state pork in the bill to fix the potholes on Kentucky’s Bourbon Trail. When Biden went up to the Senate on Thursday to have lunch with the Democrats, after being publicly stabbed in the heart by Sinema, he couldn’t help but lapse into the gauzy mists of the past, the good old days when he could reason with Webster, Clay and Calhoun. (Maybe not with Calhoun.)In the private meeting in the Kennedy Caucus Room, Biden said how much it meant to him when he was newly elected to the Senate and Ted Kennedy took him out to lunch, according to some in attendance. The president noted with melancholy that he had seen the Senate dining room empty, where once all the senators hobnobbed and worked out deals in a hive of bipartisan collegiality. Reiterating a point he made in his big voting rights speech in Atlanta, he said that even Strom Thurmond – the onetime segregationist presidential candidate – had become more supportive of voting rights than Republicans are now.But slurping navy bean soup with McConnell and John Thune isn’t going to break the fever. No matter how many times Biden mentions Strom Thurmond, he’s not coming back. “Strom Thurmond?” Nancy Pelosi said after Biden brought Thurmond up in the voting rights speech in Atlanta. “None of us have a lot of happy memories about Strom Thurmond.” FallaciesThe problem has been the same from the start. It’s not the Senate, country or world that Biden longingly remembers. Republicans aren’t open to persuasion. Their goal, as it was with Barack Obama, is to make Biden’s presidency a failure. One of the many fallacies of zanycreepy Sinema’s tremulous logic in her Senate speech about why the filibuster must be preserved is that she faults the Democrats for not working harder and striving more to bring Republicans on board for protecting voting rights.Psst! Senator Sinema. That’s the whole point. Republicans don’t actually want everyone to vote, unless they’re rural or white. And they don’t want to help Biden. This is all to their advantage. McConnell is not a sucker. The Republicans know that making it easier to cast ballots during the pandemic helped elect two freshman Democrats from Georgia and made Chuck Schumer, not McConnell, the leader of the Senate. And McConnell doesn’t want that to happen again. Even though Schumer is such a pushover that he backed down from his promise of a voting rights showdown by Martin Luther King Day because winter weather threatened.But Sinema feels more talking is required. “We need robust, sustained strategies that put aside party labels and focus on our democracy,” she declared. Yeah, like that’s going to happen. She’s as delusional about the Senate as Biden is. Biden was elected to be Not Trump, to be a comfortable old shoe. He overpromised and underdelivered. People wanted competence and stability, and instead we get incompetence and instability. Biden is running the White House like a Senate office with his familiar white-guy innermost circle from the old days. But the real problem is the president himself, who can’t shake the cobwebs of the judiciary committee that held its biggest hearings in the same ornate caucus room where he met with Democrats on Thursday. He is too in the weeds on process. He’s so lost in the snows of yesteryear that he is continuing his Amtrak Joe nearly-every-weekend commute to Delaware, albeit with better wheels, trading in the train for Marine One. We want the president to rise above it and be an inspirational figure. We don’t want the incremental updates of his negotiations with Joe Manchin. We want to see Covid under control.

Jars of Arenkha - a caviar substitute created from smoked herring - were also up 47 per cent. At the same time, sales of oysters jumped by 24 per cent and magnums of champagne were up 48 per cent. English sparkling wine had its best ever year, the supermarket said.Martyn Lee, an executive chef at Waitrose, said: Hosting friends and family at home continues to be popular, with many of us opting for higher quality products and more luxury ingredients in our cooking to impress our guests.”Food industry experts noted that more people had been experimenting with dishes at home, whether that’s adding caviar to a white chocolate dessert or adding a spoonful on top of a salmon roll.Fine food producers said that demand has risen considerably since the start of the  Covid pandemic as people had been trying to recreate restaurant experiences at home. Not only are they investing in luxury foods but they are also spending on crockery and table decorations. The trend continued even as hospitality businesses reopened their doors when restrictions eased.Exmoor Caviar, which makes sustainable caviar at a sturgeon farm in Devon, said it had sold out for two years in a row, with sales up 35 per cent year on year in 2020 and 45 per cent in 2021.Kenneth Benning, chief executive of the company, said: “It’s the feeling of having something special that people are after. Customers are a lot more adventurous in their culinary tastes than they were 20 years ago. It’s definitely something that is more mainstream now.”The company supplies 74 Michelin star restaurants in the UK but has increasingly been serving customers who are purchasing directly from its website. It also stocks its caviar in Harrods, where 50g tin sells for £100.Francesco di Maddaloni, managing director of Mr Truffle London, which sources Italian truffles from the Apennines, said that demand soared last year as people “spent more time at home, finding recipes and cooking. Sales are twice as high as they were in 2019 and many customers are ordering truffles for the first time.Although inflation is rapidly eating into household budgets and the cost of living is rising as a result, analysts said that consumers were still making the most out of special occasions.Mintel, the market research company, said sales of champagne were up 30 per cent on 2019 levels last year. Jack Duckett, associate director at the company, said: “The lifting of social restrictions has given the nation cause for celebration and brought back the social aspect that, for many, makes special occasions worth marking with premium food and drink. This drove sales growth for all of the leading Champagne brands. Own-label Champagne sales also grew strongly in the year to August 2021.”Richard Bainbridge, a chef who has worked in Michelin star restaurants across the world, said diners had become more adventurous.People are realising that they can have these culinary experiences at home, he said.The fact that people are ordering truffles for their pasta...that was unheard of two years ago but now it\u0027s becoming more normal. It just means we have to keep up in the restaurant world because what was once considered refined isn\u0027t necessarily anymore.More from NewsBoris Johnson grilled by Sue Gray over Downing Street parties as Tory anger boils overCriminals motivated by misogyny should spend longer in jail, says former justice secretaryDowning Street advisers could face sack as Boris Johnson battles to stay in No10Young woman died of cardiac arrest after falling from bucking broncoCan the Prime Minister change, or do the Tories need to change prime minister?Chinese spy’s meddling in British politics is ‘tip of the iceberg’, says Iain Duncan SmithMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"can prime minister change do tories need change prime minister","story":"Conservative MPs face a decision. Do they stick with the Prime Minister – whom most voters, most Conservative voters, and most Conservative members believe has lied about breaching Covid rules – or do they force him out of office?There is an uneasy peace in Westminster, a phony war, as ministers and backbenchers and the few diehard Johnsonites await the publication of the Sue Gray report. But whether they want the Prime Minister to stay or go, or if they cannot make up their minds, the conversation is about one topic only: how can Boris Johnson survive?Government insiders expect Gray to reveal more breaches of Covid rules, mainly by civil servants, than those reported to date. She is expected to come down hard on the absence of leadership at the centre of the Civil Service, and criticise drinking culture in Whitehall.Downing Street hopes that Gray will say Johnson did not, knowingly at least, break any rules. If she hands her report to the police before publication, they hope the Met will decide against a criminal investigation. Senior figures will be sacked, the Prime Minister will try to draw a line under the matter, and they will fill the Government grid with announcements: ending Covid restrictions, tackling the Channel crossings and launching Michael Gove’s levelling-up white paper.For some Conservative MPs who have been keeping their powder dry, whatever Gray reports will be enough to call for the PM to go. But for many others – who dislike the thought of regicide, worry about iding the party, are nervous about the next election, or remain uncertain about who should take Johnson’s place – it will be tempting to conclude that there is not yet quite enough evidence against him.The line among these MPs will be that the PM is “on probation”. Some will give him until the local elections to put things right. Come May, some will give him until the end of summer, party conference, or the end of the year. It is easier to defer a difficult decision than make one, especially when such a decision is taken by a group of people with different interests and little mutual trust.Those who put Johnson on probation will seek assurances from him. They will want to know that no further revelations will emerge, and that the PM’s personal conduct will not undermine the party or the Government again. They will demand policy and political momentum, and a stronger and more professional team in No10.Even if Johnson gives such assurances, however, he will be in no position to stick to them. Insiders warn about other stories of serious breaches in the rules. There may be parties – or details of parties or photographs – that emerge after Gray reports. We might learn of other breaches, concerning for example Johnson’s travel between Downing Street and Chequers during lockdown. We might see evidence confirming rumours that he hosted friendly political advisers at Chequers while isolating during the so-called pingdemic.The idea that policy and political momentum can be regained easily is also fanciful. The Tories have collapsed in the polls. Seventy per cent of voters think the Prime Minister has lied. The sources dripping out new stories about rule-breaking in Downing Street are likely to have held back material to release after Gray publishes her report. A new No10 team – replacing those sacked in the next week or so – is unlikely to be heavyweight. First-rate advisers will be reluctant to join a listing ship, so new recruits are likely to be civil servants and third-rate politicos: exactly the opposite of what Johnson needs to relaunch and survive.While sacking members of his team might be necessary to try to move on, by punishing subordinates for behaving as many believe he did, Johnson will do little to show that he has changed.And this brings us to the crux of the matter. The PM can reshuffle his team, and throw up chaff about a Whitehall drinking culture. MPs can seek assurances, and make whatever calculations they choose about who should replace Johnson, or how the party can still win the next election.But the issue is that the PM broke the rules – apparently often and with little care – and many are now convinced that he lied about it. He denied that there were parties in No10, and when evidence to the contrary emerged, told Parliament he was “angered” to learn of them. And we know now that he attended at least one party. His protests that he believed it was a “work event” – a distinction irrelevant in Covid laws anyway – are undermined by new reports that he waved away warnings before the party, calling its organiser “my loyal Labrador”.There are political factors Conservative MPs will need to consider. What authority does the PM have now if he needs to introduce new restrictions to deal with a different variant? How can the Scottish Tories go into the next election with their leader and 27 Conservative Members of the Scottish Parliament calling for the PM to go? How can Johnson make any election promises when most voters have concluded that he has lied to them?And can he show voters that he has changed? Some Tory MPs want to give him the benefit of the doubt, but many agree with the senior Government figure who said to me, “we know he can’t change because even now he cannot see what the problem is. He just complains about how unfair it all is.”But most important is the reputation of the Conservative Party on the fundaments of trust, truth and decency. With their philosophical understanding of the role played by community in buttressing and checking both market and state, the Tories more than others must respect the importance of fairness and reciprocity. If they choose not to live by these principles, they will be dismissed easily and deservedly as the selfish party, people who do not care about others.Right now, the fury of the public is directed at Johnson alone, not his party and not his Government. But opinion can shift rapidly. The question facing Tory MPs is: can the Prime Minister change, or do they need to change the prime minister?More from NewsBoris Johnson grilled by Sue Gray over Downing Street parties as Tory anger boils overCriminals motivated by misogyny should spend longer in jail, says former justice secretaryDowning Street advisers could face sack as Boris Johnson battles to stay in No10Young woman died of cardiac arrest after falling from bucking broncoChinese spy’s meddling in British politics is ‘tip of the iceberg’, says Iain Duncan SmithThe Queen may never meet Lilibet as Prince Harry refuses to return to UK amid security rowMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"copy french fetish municipal government peril","story":"The advantage of naming a ministry “the Department for Levelling Up” is that no-one quite knows what it means. It sounds so abstract and dull that we’ll barely notice what is going on when it publishes its white paper this month. But this, in short, is what to expect: more local government – even though, when asked in referendums whether we want elected mayors, regional assemblies and so on, we invariably say “no thanks”.  In a speech last July the Prime Minister called for more metro mayors, covering rural shires as well as large cities local bigwigs whose job would be “to get on a plane and go to the big trade and property fairs and hustle for their hometown”. Rather than have local politicians talking about gyratory systems and children’s swings, it seems he prefers them cavorting with Silicon Valley techies and Chinese developers, opening their chequebooks – or rather the taxpayers’ – to bribe them to set up shop in Handforth, or wherever.            It isn’t hard to see where this will lead: not to Bill Gates jetting into rural Cheshire to set up a new Microsoft hub but to a bigger state, puffed-up councillors with vast expense accounts, and more people on the public payroll. The PM may complain that Britain is over-centralised, but is that such a bad thing? Consider the alternative - a country like France, with its ‘strong’ local government, often run by extremist politicians of the left or right – and 5.5 million fonctionnaires. It is home to a staggering 34 965 mayors and 509,000 elected local representatives, amounting to some 1pc of the adult population. Shrinking the size of the state will always prove an uphill battle with so many on the public payroll.What we really need to attract jobs and investment can quite adequately be set in Westminster: low taxes, easy regulations, the ability to hire global talent and an absence of tariff and non-tariff trade barriers. It helps to have decent infrastructure, too, though business doesn’t hinge on the speed of Inter City trains quite as much as officials are apt to believe. For all the hype surrounding France’s fabled TGV routes, their construction 40 years ago failed to spread prosperity to the regions or achieve the expected ‘levelling up’ .Nor have the councils who have embraced ‘entrepreneurship’ exactly been a success: Nottingham lost £34 million setting up its own energy company, while Croydon Council went bust after its commercial property investments went badly wrong. More local government? We would be better off with rather less.More from NewsBoris Johnson grilled by Sue Gray over Downing Street parties as Tory anger boils overCriminals motivated by misogyny should spend longer in jail, says former justice secretaryDowning Street advisers could face sack as Boris Johnson battles to stay in No10Young woman died of cardiac arrest after falling from bucking broncoCan the Prime Minister change, or do the Tories need to change prime minister?Chinese spy’s meddling in British politics is ‘tip of the iceberg’, says Iain Duncan SmithMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"standing ovation addicts really applauding","story":"The concluding words of the drama are spoken, the last note sounds in the auditorium – and while it still echoes, the audience is on its feet, applauding. It generally starts in the stalls, with people popping up like observant meerkats. Then, either from shared enthusiasm or because they now can’t see the performers taking their bows, everyone else follows, save for a few die-hard grumpies.Once a rare and spontaneous gesture of acknowledgment for a remarkable performance, the standing ovation has become the default expression of approval – so much so that seated applause can be taken as indifference or even as an insult. As long ago as 1989, Dustin Hoffman was distinctly miffed when his performance as Shylock in Sir Peter Hall’s production of the Merchant of Venice failed to bring the West End audience to its feet.While the ovation traces its origins to ancient times, when it was a consolation prize for B+ military types who didn’t quite merit a Roman triumph, the obligatory theatrical standing ovation has its origins in the US, where applause inflation has been the subject of innumerable pained articles by fastidious critics who prefer a finer gradation of enthusiasm.Back in 2012, the New York Times’s then chief theatre critic, Ben Brantley, observed that, “The SO … has become a reflexive social gesture, like shaking hands with the host at the end of a party.” On the other side of the Atlantic, the Cannes Film Festival has acquired an unenviable reputation for interminable ovations.If a standing ovation were an unforced expression of gratitude for an uplifting performance, there would be no case against it. But the suspicion grows that it is more about egotism than altruism. The late conductor Bernard Haitink condemned with unusual vehemence the “idiots” who bellowed their approval of a concert performance before the final note had died away.The effects on live performance of Covid restrictions have been painful. But as we resume our seats in the auditorium, we should remember Haitink’s scathing view of performative adulation. Applaud until our hands hurt, by all means, but stand up for nothing less than the performance of a lifetime (or a train that leaves in the next ten minutes).By accident, I recently bought a packet of Cotton Candy grapes. They were strikingly nasty, tasting – as their name suggests – of little but sugar. It turns out that these bloated sugar-bombs are not a faddish supermarket one-off, but the harbinger of a new generation of fruit and veg, bred for a modern aesthetic that prefers the bland and decorative to the plain and tasty.The infantilisation of modern palates is a phenomenon lamented by nutritionists, but vigorously promoted by the same supermarkets that peddle virtuous platitudes about healthy eating. Of the five basic tastes – salty, sour, umami, bitter and sweet – it is the last that is ubiquitous in the food stores where most of us shop, lurking even in “savoury” foods.Aside from the dire health consequences of the sickly hegemony, the erosion of our ability to appreciate a wider range of flavours is a formidable cultural loss. It is as though we were restricted to an aural diet of bubblegum pop, when what we need is the pungent operatic complexity of Roquefort, anchovies – and proper onions that make you weep as you slice them.More from NewsBoris Johnson grilled by Sue Gray over Downing Street parties as Tory anger boils overCriminals motivated by misogyny should spend longer in jail, says former justice secretaryDowning Street advisers could face sack as Boris Johnson battles to stay in No10Young woman died of cardiac arrest after falling from bucking broncoCan the Prime Minister change, or do the Tories need to change prime minister?Chinese spy’s meddling in British politics is ‘tip of the iceberg’, says Iain Duncan SmithMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"treasure hunter strikes gold discovery 700 year old henry iii","story":"A detectorist has uncovered just the eighth known example of England’s “first gold coinage”, with the piece expected to sell at auction for nearly half a million pounds.The Henry III coin, minted in 1257, owes its value both to its rarity and the unique portrait of the monarch on its obverse side.The coin carries a pre-sale estimate of £400,000 but past examples have sold for more than £500,000. It is the first of its kind found in more than 260 years.It was found by an anonymous treasure hunter on his first detecting trip in a decade, near Hemyock, Devon.The finder put it on Facebook, not knowing its true value before it was spotted by an expert.Gregory Edmund, of the auctioneer Spink, told The  he spotted the post and “immediately told the finder to take it down because I said you\u0027re going to be inundated with every man and his dog to try trying to buy this off you for a fraction of what it\u0027s worth”.Mr Edmund and the detectorist took the coin to be assessed by the British Museum, which confirmed its significance. As it is only a single coin and not part of a larger find, it was not covered by the Treasurers Act, meaning the finder was entitled to keep it.The coin has since been offered up to academics for study, including a non-invasive X-ray fluorescence test that confirmed its gold content. It will now go up for auction on January 23.The coin was the first gold coin minted in England since before the Norman Conquest. However, it proved deeply unpopular and of little wider use.Henry III, who ordered the coins to be minted, had originally been saving gold for a campaign to place his son on the throne of the Kingdom of Sicily.However, the growing threat of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, the last Welsh Prince of Wales, led Henry to instead use his personal treasure to fund an expensive military campaign across Offa’s Dyke.Its use by the King to pay his many bills and creditors may explain why this example ended up in Devon.Prof David Carpenter, a leading medievalist at King’s College London, has traced the coin to John de Hidon, the lord of Hemyock Manor. It may have fallen from the pocket of de Hidon himself, or one of his labourers, said the professor.While the coin allowed Henry III to successfully wage war against Llewelyn, it proved deeply unpopular, both with goldsmiths in London and with the wider population.The flood of coins into the economy caused the value of gold to sink, despite the coin itself having a fixed value.It was also worth around two weeks of the average worker’s wage, a sum that was likely too large to be practical.The portrait of Henry III on the coin’s obverse was “radically new” according to Prof Carpenter. Rather than simply showing the head of the king, it depicted him “sitting elegantly on his throne” with his sceptre and orb.While unlikely to have been understood by his subjects, it was an attempt by Henry III to model himself on his patron saint, Edward the Confessor.The coin also shows cross-hatched ground before his feet, which may hint at the Cosmati floor he had constructed at Westminster Abbey a decade later. “This provides us with the tantalising prospect that this coin is Henry III’s vision for Westminster Abbey,” said Prof Carpenter.Of the other seven known coins, four are in museums, including one in the British Museum, with one on display from a private collection and three not visible to the public.More from NewsBoris Johnson grilled by Sue Gray over Downing Street parties as Tory anger boils overCriminals motivated by misogyny should spend longer in jail, says former justice secretaryDowning Street advisers could face sack as Boris Johnson battles to stay in No10Young woman died of cardiac arrest after falling from bucking broncoCan the Prime Minister change, or do the Tories need to change prime minister?Chinese spy’s meddling in British politics is ‘tip of the iceberg’, says Iain Duncan SmithMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"john bercow says hes been","story":"John Bercow says hes been found guilty of bullying but blasts kangaroo courtReports suggest the former Speaker was found guilty of  counts of bullying by a Parliamentary watchdog - but he revealed he is appealing the process saying ‘to call it a kangaroo court is unfair to kangaroos’John Bercow claimed ‘to call it a kangaroo court is unfair to kangaroos’ Image: VICKIE FLORES EPA-EFE REX ShutterstockByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  Jan | commentsEx-Speaker John Bercow today revealed he has been found guilty of bullying by Parliament’s watchdog - but dismissed the inquiry as a “kangaroo court”.The Labour member said he is currently appealing against a “protracted, amateurish and unjust process” after multiple claims he bullied staff.Lord Lisvane, who was Clerk of the House under his reign, handed a dossier of allegations to Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards Kathryn Stone in January . It is understood it alleged both he and former colleagues were bullied and humiliated, including using inappropriate language.The Mirror understands Lord Lisvane told friends he resigned early because of the toll it took on his health. He told friends Mr Bercow used four-letter expletives and told Lord Lisvane he was no good, he was useless.According to the Sunday Times, Ms Stone upheld  out of  bullying complaints brought by Lord Lisvane and private secretaries Kate Emms and Angus Sinclair.  She rejected separate complaints by former Black Rod David Leakey, it is reported.But Mr Bercow, whose bid to join the House of Lords was blocked in  by Boris Johnson, complained: To call it a kangaroo court is unfair to kangaroos.”According to the Sunday Times, an appeals  could deliver its verdict in the next fortnight. The Speaker - who has maintained “I categorically deny that I have ever bullied anyone, anywhere at any time” - said he was wrongly alleged to have thrown a mobile phone on two occasions nearly  years ago. “In both cases, the people said to have been present at the time were interviewed and they refuted the allegation. This inconvenient fact was brushed aside in favour of two aposwitnessesapos who were not present but who claimed that they had been told of the incidents.  He added: One investigator interviewed  witnesses, none of whom claimed to have seen any behaviour by me but the investigator was very focused on what the mood of the office was  or  years ago. “This should be a study of particulars and specics and incidents, not an exercise in Pinteresque atmospherics. Lord Lisvane said: “I have signed in blood that I can make no comment until the independent  has pronounced.The former Speaker announced in June  that he was joining theLabourParty, branding the Tories “reactionary, populist, nationalistic and sometimes even xenophobic”.As a teenager Mr Bercow called for “assisted repatriation” of immigrants as part of a manesto for the Tories’ hard-right Monday Club. He later dismissed those views as “bone-headed”. He told the Sunday Times: Another complainant claims I made a racially and sexually discriminatory remark, which I would not dream of doing. For more than two decades I have championed gender, racial and sexual equality.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Boris JohnsonJohn BercowLabour PartyHouse of LordsTeenagersBullyingFitnessPoliticsKangaroos\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Sir Keir was grilled over the photo by the BBC after the Daily Mail put it on its front page.He insisted there was “absolutely no comparison” between the photo, taken in April , and Downing Street’s “industrial” scale partying dating back to May . Sir Keir said: “I was in a constituency office days before the election, we were very busy, we were working, at some time some food turned up.  “We stopped, we had our food and then we carried on working. That is not a breach of the rules, it’s not a party and it’s no comparison to the Prime Minister.” At the time fo the photo England was in Step  of its lockdown roadmap - which banned indoor socialising with people not in your support bubble. Yet Sir Keir insisted: It was perfectly lawful to meet for work, which is what we were doing. “The party that was put to the Prime Minister on Wednesday happened because an invitation was sent to  people saying aposletaposs have some socially distant drinks in the garden and bring your own boozeapos. “There is simply no comparison.  BBC host Sophie Raworth quoted government guidance which said meetings in-person should be avoided where possible, and “there should not be any sharing of food and drink by staff who do not share a household.” The latter part of that guidance was for “staff canteens and restaurants” in which staff were eating, rather than prohibiting food completely.She asked Sir Keir “why is that any dferent ” from a photo of Boris Johnson and aides having wine and cheese in the No garden, which the PM also claimed was a work meeting.The wine and cheese gathering was on  May . Sir Keir’s photo was taken in April . Lockdown rules existed at both times though at dferent levels of severity. Sir Keir said: “If you’re trying to persuade anyone that stopping to have some food when you’re in the office all day working is a breach of the rules, it’s just not going to wash. “It shows just how far the Conservatives are sinking that they’re trying to pretend there’s some sort of comparison between this and the industrial scale partying the Prime Minister has been up to.” Asked where he draws the line, the Labour leader replied: “The line is drawn in the rules - and the Prime Minister broke the rules”. During the interview, Sir Keir reiterated that Boris Johnson must resign in the national interest as he has lost all authority in the country. When asked about Plan B measures, the Labour leader insisted it is important they are lted because the medical science says they should be lted and not because the Prime Minister is in a real mess.

Rather than accept any responsibility for the scandal engulfing Downing Street, he is instead likely to throw a bunch of civil service flunkies under the bus, who could now face the axe. But it comes as the Mirror can reveal Mr Johnson attended a leaving do for his defence adviser in the run-up to Christmas  and gave a speech. And fresh doubts were raised on the PM’s claim he did not know in advance about the No garden bash on May  of that year after Sunday Times columnist Dominic Lawson claimed at least two people had warned him the email invite to staff made it clear it was a party and it should have been stopped. If true, it blows his half-hearted apology for ­Partygate last week out of the water and means he faces claims he breached the ministerial code by misleading the Commons. To add further pressure on Mr Johnson, his we Carrie was photographed breaking Covid social distancing rules in September .  The PM will hide behind claims he is to crack down on the “culture” at No in his bid to deflect any blame. Those who could be singled out for blame inclde his PM’s principal private secretary Martin Reynolds – who sent the May  party invite – his deputy Stewart ­Glassborow and chief of staff Dan Rosenfeld. But Mr Lawson’s claims suggest Mr Johnson knew more about the parties than he let on. The well-connected columnist said: “Last week I spoke to a former Downing Street official who said at least two people had told the PM, after seeing the emailed ­invitation from Martin Reynolds that this was ‘a party’ and should be immediately cancelled. “I was told that Johnson’s dismissive response was to say they were ‘overreacting’ and to praise Reynolds as ‘my loyal Labrador’. I then asked someone who has known the PM for decades what could have made him take such an approach . “His immediate answer was: ‘It’s because deep down he obviously thought the regulations were ridiculous, so why should he observe them ’”  No insisted: “It is untrue that the Prime Minister was warned about the event in advance. “As he said earlier this week he believed implicitly that this was a work event.” We can reveal Mr Johnson gave a speech at an event to mark defence adviser Captain Steve Higham’s Downing Street departure before Christmas in . It is understood the PM was “there for a few minutes to thank him for his service” as a “small number of No staff briefly said goodbye”. The MoD declined to comment. Our revelation could give senior civil servant Sue Gray more material to consider as part of her probe into the Downing Street parties. Tory chairman Oliver Dowden signalled civil servants would take the rap for the rule breaking parties.He said: “The PM is ­determined to make sure that this can’t be allowed to happen and that we address the underlying culture in Downing Street. There were failings, we should have done better.” The Mirror told on Saturday how Mr Johnson attended some “wine time” Friday events at No.What do you think  Have your say in the comments below.

No Prime Minister is able to survive for long in high office when they trigger scorn in every home, workplace, cafe and pub. A mate of mine, a retired welder in a red wall seat, sent a reworking of a joke about a dead man at the Pearly Gates and was informed by St Peter the hands on heavenly lie clocks ticked only when fibs were heard. The pointers on those of Mother Theresa, Abraham Lincoln and Nelson Mandela had never moved. “Where’s Boris Johnson’s clock ” inquired the man. “We’re using it as a ceiling fan,” replied St Peter. Sacricing the jobs of Downing Street staff to save his own skin will not work for Johnson. It feels like when nothe is booted out of No  by Tory MPs worried about their futures. Nor is he able to cower in a fridge again as the glass door on the front of No ’s wine-time Friday cooler symbolises the charlatan having hidden in plain sight for too long.  Suitcases of booze smuggled into Downing Street, drunken shenanigans on the eve of the Duke of Edinburgh’s funeral and an unprecedented apology to Buckingham Palace have a last days of Rome vibe to them. Labour leads of up to % in the polls are encouraging the opposition to go for the jugular, Keir Starmer justiably accusing the PM of breaking the law and lying. With jilted insider Dominic Cummings orchestrating much of the onslaught, there’s an irony in Johnson as co-author of his own downfall. Labour is aware it should target the Tories as much as Johnson himself when as rising star Wes Streeting acknowledged, the opposition’s best bet’s a mortally wounded PM limping on or the Conservatives will claim they have changed under Rishi Sunak or Liz Truss.What do you think  Have your say in the comments below.From coronavirus to Brexit, our daily politics newsletter is there to guide you these turbulent times.

They successfully played the trick in Government when John Major succeeded Margaret Thatcher, Theresa May followed David Cameron then Johnson came after May. I never bought the Johnson appeal but I understood why many voters did. Brexit, his main pitch, was another lie and anyway even many who wanted to quit the European Union these days avoid talking about the mess. Whatever magic Johnson displayed is gone and isn’t ing. The steady drip of awful rule-breaking, civil servant Sue Gray’s party report, April’s tax rises and soaring energy bills and May’s local elections all threaten fresh blows for a deflated egotist who cut a beaten figure on the ropes at Prime Minister’s Questions. Lting England’s Covid restrictions will earn little credit when he’s lost credibility. Johnson’s political obituaries are being written. Only the publication date is to be decided.

The days of the elderly being threatened with prison sentences and bailfs knocking on doors are over.  Time now to discuss and debate new ways of funding, supporting and selling great British content. Shadow Culture Secretary Lucy Powell said: “The cat is out of the bag. The Prime Minister thinks those reporting on his rule breaking should pay consequences, whilst he gets off free. The Prime Minister and the Culture Secretary seem hell-bent on attacking this great British institution because they don’t like its journalism.” Lib Dem MP Jamie Stone added: “This latest Tory attack on the BBC threatens to destroy a service which is respected around the world for its high quality content. “Freezing the license fee represents a stealth cut of almost £billion that will put services, including local radio stations and childrenaposs programming, at risk. “What’s worse, there is no clarity about the future and threadbare funding will only further chip away at our cherished national broadcaster. “The Government must stop this reckless ideological crusade and back off our BBC.” The licence fee is set by the Government, which announced in  that it would rise in line with inflation for five years from April . The current cost of £-a-year is likely to remain for the next two years, according to reports. But with inflation running at .%, it means Auntie would have to slash staff or programming to deal with the real-terms funding cut. If the licence fee rose with inflation, the cost would be £. After two years at the same rate, it would have hit £.  “aposThere will be a lot of anguished noises about how it will hit popular programmes, but they can learn to cut waste like any other business,” an ally of Ms Dorries told the Mail on Sunday. “This will be the last BBC licence fee negotiation ever. “Work will start next week on a mid-term review to replace the Charter with a new funding formula. Itaposs over for the BBC as they know it.” A BBC source said: “There has been similar speculation before. “There are very good reasons for investing in what the BBC can do for the British public, and the creative industries and the UK around the world. “Anything less than inflation would put unacceptable pressure on the BBC finances after years of cuts.” A Culture Department source said licence fee discussions were ongoing, and claimed Ms Dorries “recognised pressure on peopleaposs wallets”.Read More They added: “The licence fee is an important bill for people on low incomes pensioners and one the Government can directly control.” The Tories have been heavily criticised for betraying over-s who received free TV licences. The party pledged at the  election to maintain the benefit for the rest of that Parliament, which was due to run for five years. But the BBC had already been handed responsibility for funding the concession from summer , under a deal agreed in .

Stephen, who is now living in the house, decided to document the incredible renovation for his Youtube channel @Three Eagles Recordings. Stephen told the ECHO: Iaposve been a builder for around  years now and when I first saw it I was looking online. I didnapost have any intention of going to auction but when I saw the building and the guide price of £-, I thought to myself aposwhat the hell is that apos  I thought Iaposve got to have a look at least, so I arranged to go and have a look, and I could see the potential in it because of the amount of space in the building. In my head I could see straight away the potential to cut the building in two and have a little shop as well as a house, so sort of kill two birds with one stone and then I could eventually set up a business as well. It had a lot of things going for it. I could see the bigger picture.  When he first got the keys to the property, Stephen said the building was in a pretty poor condition and the backyard was like a jungle. Stephen said: I didnapost get a structural report done before I went to auction either which was a big risk but there wasnapost enough time. By the time the estate agents organised a block viewing where everyone turns up, there was about a week before the actual auction.  Iaposve never done it before and finding someone to come and do the report and everything, I just didnapost have enough time so I just had to take a gamble on it. The worst case scenario when I did get the structural report done is he could have told me to knock the building down because it was that bad. But luckily he said aposyouaposre going to have to knock the front of the building downapos and rebuild it as that was about to fall down, so thataposs what I did in the end. Stephen did the majority of the work on the renovation himself in his spare time alongside his full-time job as a joiner. He paid a structural specialist company to do the work on the front of the building, which had to be completely rebuilt. In the last  months of the project Stephen signicantly reduced his hours at work to get the renovation completed.  He said: I did as much of the work as possible myself to keep the cost down. When I took the roof off and the front wall was down that was about two years into it because the first couple of years was just me clearing the place out, saving up more money and planning what I was going to do that was from  to  - the summer. Then when I took the roof off and I saw the bare shell and how poor the state of everything was, there was a point where I was like aposwhat the hell am I doing apos I was thinking this is going to take forever. I had to learn how to be positive put it that way.  On the ground floor of the building, Stephen, who writes and produces his own music in his spare time, plans to run an independent record label and artist residency where other musicians and DJs can come to meet each other and record their music. In the longer term, he hopes to make use of the ground floor bedrooms as part of the artist residency, where musicians can come and stay. Stephen said: I did have a vision for it. Even though it was a shop itaposs obviously been a flat above it, so it kind of had a bit of a layout that I could see in my head.It just came together really. It took a bit of time and I was spending a lot of time getting ideas on apps like Pinterest and Instagram.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON YouTubeAppsproperty newsHousing Units\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts from our Property Market newsletterSubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Brian Gerson says his we Kellymarie Gerson and their four kids have been forced to deal with the unliveable conditions at the two-bedroom property in South East London which they compare to being like crabs in a barrel. The dad has become increasingly worried about his familyaposs health. He claims that the majority of his family have developed respiratory issues because of the thick damp that has plagued the property, which is under Optivo Housing Association.He further claims the conditions are so poor that his family are forced to pick pieces of their wet ceiling out of their food because of the paint crumbling, the Daily Star reports.  Brian also said their living situation has caused him to move out and live with his mum. The dad told the Daily Star: It has been over  years my we has had to deal with it - she first moved in with her firstborn daughter in . The mould has also brought problems such as things being ruined [such as] clothes, toys, furniture and keepsakes, so they have to be thrown away. The ceiling also flakes off bits of paint that end up everywhere from in the bath, to falling into your food while cooking.  He said his weaposs eldest child was diagnosed with asthma within the first two years of moving in and that their other childaposs health is also poor. Brian added: Her firstborn son was born premature and had to be incubated for the first two months of his le and ended up having subglottic stenosis [an issue with a childaposs airways just below their vocal cords]. This is classed as a disability since he has trouble regulating his breathing while running and playing - it has been made worse by the mould. The dad said: The pandemic also has taken its toll on the family seeing as itaposs like crabs in a barrel [with] nowhere to escape to.  With the eldest being fteen years of age, you can imagine how it [must be for her] to share a room with her younger siblings that are nine and three years old. He says that the most recent medical evidence submitted to the housing association by his we has been disregarded. Brian claims: Optivo have done the bare minimum to try and solve anything. It needs more than just a mould wash. They have also painted over the mould rather than treating it properly [and] have misplaced records of complaints and jobs that they have done in the property.  They seem to be trying to do everything possible to keep her and the kids in that property because they know that they would have a hard time getting someone to take it. They need to be named and shamed for treating them like this and I can [only] imagine how many other households have been affected by the same housing association. Optivo said in a statement: We were made aware of mould and damp in one of our homes in Brockley on  November , when reported by our resident, Ms. Gerson. We carried out an inspection on  December . We found low-level mould in rooms including the kitchen, bathroom and living space. As a result of the inspection, we’ll be attending the home on  January to complete a mould wash treatment of affected areas. This treatment is designed to kill and inhibit the growth of mould, fungi and mildew. We’ve also agreed a date of  February to redecorate the treated areas, which is the first date Ms Gerson is available.  We’ll also install a fan on  January to increase ventilation and help to stop mould growth. If Ms Gerson is looking to find a new home, she’ll need to discuss this with her local authority, who are responsible for the allocation of homes. Our Lettings Team are here to support with this process, but the decision to accept the move remains with the local authority. A member of our housing team will make contact with Ms Gerson next week to discuss options available to her. We have a record of one complaint, raised by Ms. Gerson on  November . We worked to resolve this and responded on  November  with an action plan. The complaint has since been closed due to receiving no further response from Ms. Gerson. We’ve no record of any further or misplaced complaints. We’re sorryMs. Gerson feels we’ve not met her expectations, and we’re working with her to further address the issues she’s raised.

Council officials have even headed out to find her with concerns for her safety, Birmingham Live reports.But ‘Betty Bypass’ never travels far and stays at her favourite spot in the shadow of Nick’s Sandwich Bar, a food van on the A between Rubery and Bromsgrove, near Junction  of the M. It’s been around  years since she first appeared at the roadside with her ghost-like features and nose peeling from her age.  Food van owner Nick Husband, , from Rubery, has grown attached to the strange figure over the years. He said: aposBetty Bypassapos gets a lot of attention around these parts and is seen in all sorts of places from the road with her pram. Sheaposs been around for about  years and hopefully with me for a long time to come as Betty is like family.  But the beginnings of this eerie tale start with practical joker Nick, who bought aposBettyapos the mannequin from the PDSA charity shop in Rubery High Street so he could pose her in dferent positions with a pram next to the food van. I get someone asking me every day about Betty, chuckled Nick. Some think sheaposs real, many take their photos with her and others worry about her being homeless and want to help her. A few years ago, a council officer came down saying it was on the agenda to discuss her at the next meeting as councillors had raised concerns about aposthe ladyapos. The Mirroraposs newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at noon and every evening. Never miss a moment by signing up to our newsletter here.  I said, aposgo and take this drink over to herapos and he couldnapost believe it when he realised she was a mannequin. aposOh no!apos he said aposthe report is all done for a council discussion now!apos I took the pram away for a while and people kept asking me aposWhereaposs the baby gone apos, we just told them itaposs grown up and gone to school. Nick, who sponsors Cofton Athletic Football Club and donates food to the homeless in Birmingham city centre regularly, also poses aposBettyapos up for special occasions, such as with Champagne for the New Year.  As soon as I saw Betty in the charity shop, I knew I wanted her, added Nick. She cost me £ but itaposs the best £ I ever spent. Nickaposs colleague and best friend Sue OaposLeary, , who used to run tearoom Polly Put The Kettle On in Rubery, said Betty provides a lot of entertainment for the pair and their regulars, who include staff from across the emergency services. Nick is a practical joker and has come up with all sorts of things around Betty, added Sue.  Heaposs had taxi drivers buying burgers here and told them sheaposs been waiting hours for a cab, just to see what happens when they go over. Betty has just become a familiar face to our regulars. We get a lot of police officers, ambulance staff and carers visiting us here as they are on the road all day. No celebrities yet although we have had royalty go past when Prince Charles and Camilla were in the area. They didnapost stop but I wonderthey spotted Betty too. A local tree surgeon for the area has also joined in the fun by adding toy monkeys high up in the trees near Betty for visitors to spot too.

When single mum-of-three Carly Breslin was made redundant from her job of  years as she went into labour with twins, she thought that thing couldnapost get any worse.But seven months later as she cared for her five children her family had to be rehoused in a hotel when her flat flooded following heavy rain, leaving them homeless. What she could salvage she stored in a dferent part of the property away from the water damage, along with her kidsapos Christmas presents.But as the family waited to be rehoused from the two rooms of their hotel, their old flat caught fire on Christmas Eve, destroying the little they had left along with the presents.When reliving her ordeal, the -year-old said: I canapost tell you how stressed Iaposve been - too much has happened that I canapost begin to make sense of it all, itaposs just been terrible.Carly and her kids aged , seven, three and newborn lived on the top floor of a new build in Islington north London until the extreme weather turned their lives upside down. The former art director for Toni and Guy, said: In July, we had the flash floods and there must have been a lot of rain which was just building up on the roof. It started off trickling down one of the light fittings and it took about three weeks for it to be pouring out of everywhere. We were told by surveyors that it was unsafe to live there anymore, so the council put us in a hotel and at first I was like aposoh my god, I canapost live like that, I have babies to look afterapos and at that time I thought even a night would be too much. But weaposve been there for six months now.  While waiting to be rehoused, Carly and her five children have been living in two rooms at the hotel in Angel, just a mile away from their family home. Her mum Tracie, who chose to set up a heartfelt GoFundMe page to help her daughter face the financial burden, said: As you can imagine, living in hotel rooms with a -year-old, seven-year-old, a three-year-old, and seven-month-old twins has been very challenging. With the hope of keeping the festive spirit alive in the run-up to Christmas, Carly was looking forward to spending the day with her family. However, come Christmas Eve morning at around  am a fire broke out and ripped through what was left of the family home.  As Carly recalled: It was around  am on Christmas morning when I woke up to lots of missed calls from two of my old neighbours who told me the flat was on fire and I just couldnapost believe it. Everyone had been evacuated but we just couldnapost work out what had caught alight. From the flooding, there was mould growing on what was left of the furniture, so we had put everything we couldaposve saved in boxes in the kitchen and the living room, where it was safe, but thataposs where the fire happened. Because my kids still believe in Santa, I decided to hide their presents in the flat because I wanted them to be surprised and have a nice day. The presents had been ruined by the fire, and of the ones we managed to save, they smelt of smoke and were covered in black soot. My little girl said that aposFather Christmas had gone down lots of chimneysapos because she could smell the smoke, so I went with that story because I didnapost want to worry them.  Carly explained that she decided to try and make the best out of the worst situation but is worried about how she might come across. She said: I was so overwhelmed at what had happened and itaposs so upsetting to see all your stuff ruined. Any other day wouldaposve been easier for me to handle, but it was Christmas and all I wanted was for them to have a nice day after going through so much upset, so making it special was quite important for me. Iaposve tried to keep things away from them as much as possible and they did end up really enjoying the day, despite what happened. I had to go away to wipe my tears and come back pretending I was okay. I donapost want to be seen as some sort of charity case but we did lose everything and my mum set up the fundraising page to help us rebuild the things we lost. The family is still unsure what caused the fire and is waiting for an investigation to take place.Writing on the GoFundMe page, Tracie said: Carly was devasted when she saw the damage to everything she owned,it wasn’t burnt or melted it had smoke damage.Many have suggested to set this page up which at first we didn’t want to do butwe could at least try and get a little bit of help it would go a long way for Carly and the children. They have been through so much this year they deserve a little help. So, I am asking youyou could help restore my daughteraposs broken heart. We are all so grateful for all your support at this unbearable time. All your messages have meant so much and have filled our hearts!

Sarah Casson, , had dreams of passing down her bridal gown to her children, or to wear it for her th anniversary of being wed to husband Kevin. But Sarah says she was shocked to tears when she opened the dry cleaneraposs box for the first time since they tied the knot  years ago, Birmingham Live reports.She opened the lid to find her beautul and bespoke Swarovski crystal-encrusted silk bodice had turned a stale shade of yellow. Sarah, from Sutton Coldfield in the West Midlands, said the dress is very sentimental to me and sheaposd hoped to pass it on to her daughtersshe hadnapost had two boys. The dress isnapost something her daughter-in-laws would wear, so she planned to flog it and get something you [I] always wanted. The telecommunications client partner told Birmingham Live: Weaposre moving house so I thought Iaposll get it down from on top of the wardrobe and maybe I could sell it.  The dress is very sentimental to me. When I got married I thought I might have a daughter one day I can pass it on to or change it into a christening gown for a grandchild. But Iaposve got two sons and itaposs not something their partners would wear so my husband said why not sell it and use the money to get something youaposve always wanted. But that was why I had the preserving treatment. You pay to have it treated in a special way and wrapped in acid-free paper so in the years to come, it looks as good as new and you can pass it on. I havenapost looked at it once all these years. I thoughtI open the box, it could ruin the preservation on it.  But I opened it before Christmas and I burst into tears. The net still looks white but the bodice was yellow. Three years after their marriage in , Sarah took the pricey £, gown to a dry cleaners. Sarah recalled forking between £ to £ for the preservation treatment, but says she has lost the receipt in the many years since. When I saw the dress, I took it straight back to the dry cleaners, said Sarah. They told me that because it had been treated all that time ago, there was nothing they could do.  It wasnapost like I paid a couple of pounds to have it cleaned, I paid hundreds of pounds to preserve it. Whataposs so frustrating is Iaposve still got the veil I wore on my wedding day that I never got cleaned which is still brilliant white. My original plan was to maybe re-wear the dresswe renewed our vows for our th anniversary. Iaposm quite into my fitness so I could have worn it again, but now I donapost have that option because who wants to wear a yellow wedding dress  The dress is still in its original box, which is still in good condition, she says. A spokesperson for the dry cleaners in question told BirminghamLive: There were no identying tags on the dress to confirm it was us that did the preservation  years ago.  We package all of our wedding dresses in acid-free tissue and in an acid-free box to ensure that this doesnapost affect the colour of it, but it does require to be kept in a reasonable, stable temperature. It canapost be kept in the loft or anywhere with damp or severe changes in temperature as that can affect the preservation. When this dress was ed to us, it did not have acid-free tissue wrapped around it in the same way we package our wedding dresses and the box did look as though it had been knocked about a bit, with damp patches and water marks over it. They added: [The discolouration] will be down to the way it has been stored.

The mum-of-two was convinced she was going to be a victim of revenge porn and believed someone had set up cameras in her house.Sarah, from Wythenshawe, would take apart all of her electrical devices because she was terried someone was going to upload an indecent video of her to Netflix. On another occasion, Sarah phoned her dad and told him to go into her loft as she was convinced she could hear people talking. Sarah also phoned the police on several occasions as she thought she could hear people whispering at the side of her house. She said: I knew they thought I was crazy. Sarah was referred to a psychiatrist and social worker and was eventually diagnosed with bipolar disorder three years ago.She has since set up a blog called Sarah OaposRourke Bipolar and Me and aims to challenge some of the stigma surrounding the condition. Sarah said: I always felt dferent but this became more apparent when I was around eight-years-old. I found building relationships dficult because I could see and feel that people were dferent to me. But as I got a little older I excused this by acknowledging my parents had separated and this may have something to do with why I felt the way I did. I was overwhelmed with sadness and loneliness and thinking about it now it is really unfortunate to feel those things at that age and it upsets me that I felt that way. Sarah recalls her teenage years consisted of smoking and drinking and at the age of , claims she was sexually exploited. She attended college and worked ious jobs, eventually landing her dream job as a special needs teaching assistant. But her manic episodes and depression continued to spiral out of control, meaning she had to leave her job to focus on her health. She said: I had been doing things that in my normal mindset I wouldnapost do. Iaposd take big risks and date men that I knew I shouldnapost. One day I was really upset and the next day you couldnapost shut me up. I was all over the place. Following her bipolar diagnosis, Sarah was taken off antidepressants and prescribed antipsychotic medication for the first time. She said: Now I have ups and downs but they are not as bad as they were. When I talk about the depression I had before I was suicidal. I still can’t really plan anything because I don’t know how I am going to feel when I wake up. Sarah says her diagnosis has inspired her to channel all the negative things that happened to her and begin a new chapter. She said: The blog is something I can do at my own pace but is informative and can help other people. The lack of understanding about bipolar even with my own friends and family has been terrible. Sarah hopes to be able to use the blog to show people what itaposs like to live with bipolar day-to-day and raise awareness of the signs and symptoms of the condition. She said: I do wish I had been diagnosed sooner. I went to see the GP purely by chance. She added: I am putting my story out there to make people think about the way they are. It might even make some people seek help for their own behaviour.

It came just a fortnight after the Sunday People exclusively revealed Her Majesty would reluctantly strip her son of his prized roleshe did not resign. However Andrew, , did not bite the bullet – and will now have to write grovelling letters to his former ­regiments, it is understood. A senior defence source said: “The Prince was tearful when told the news even though he had expected it. He feels that he has let so many people down, not least his mother, during her Platinum Jubilee year.”  Our source said Andrew’s ousting had been greeted by a huge sigh of relief from armed forces top brass, who described him as “a bloody embarrassment”. The move came after a US judge ruled a civil case in New York against Andrew by his sex accuser Virginia Giuffre can go ahead. Andrew strenously denies any wrongdoing. Our insider said of the royal’s ­dramatic demotion: “He had hoped that he might get some sort of stay of execution and be allowed to clear his name before his titles were removed. “There are a number of people in the royal household who are utterly convinced that he is innocent. “But the clamour for Andrew’s scalp meant that a quick and brutal decision needed to be made.” The move, announced in a shock Palace statement on Thursday, left Andrew exiled from official royal le and facing le as a private citizen.  He was also told he will no longer be able to use the title of His Royal Highness in any official capacity. The move came after years of damaging speculation arising from Ms Giuffre’s claim she was forced to have sex with the duke three times when she was , including once in London. Andrew’s plight worsened when his former friend Ghislaine Maxwell, , was found guilty of offences relating to her work as fixer for the late billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, another Andrew associate. One senior defence source said: “Andrew is a victim of very poor decision-making. There is no way he could continue as the honorary head of distinguished military regiments. “His departure has been greeted with a huge sigh of relief. He had become a bloody embarrassment.  “He could not be present at parades, visit units or welcome troops home from operations because the story would always be about sex scandals and not about the regiments.” The duke, who had a -year active career in the Royal Navy and served as a helicopter pilot in the  Falklands war, held the honorary rank of Colonel of the Grenadier Guards. He was also Colonel-in-chief of the  th Royal Lancers, the Royal Irish Regiment, the Yorkshire Regiment, the Small Arms School Corps, and Royal Colonel of the Royal Highland Fusiliers. Plus he was Honorary Air Commodore of RAF Lossiemouth and Commodore-in-Chief of the Fleet Air Arm. Our source said Andrew is to write to each of the regiments expressing his sorrow at having to leave. “He fully maintains his innocence, but wants to apologise for the ­dficulties caused by what has happened,” the insider added. The Duke has also lost a number of overseas honorary military titles.  He was Colonel-in-Chief of the Queen’s York Rangers , the Royal Highland Fusiliers of Canada, the Princess Louise Fusiliersand Colonel-in-Chief of the Royal New Zealand Army Logistic Regiment. The defence source continued: “The big question now is who is going to fill these roles. “They all need to be filled by senior royals which means Prince Charles, who is extremely busy, Princess Anne who already has  military titles, Prince Edward or Prince William. “Honorary titles are hugely important. The role of Captain General of the Royal Marines was held by Prince Philip for  years. He knew the Royal Marines intimately. “When he handed that role over to Prince Harry his parting words were apparently ‘don’t mess it up’ because it meant so much to him.” But the Queen was reluctantly forced to strip Harry, , of the role because he chose to step down from royal duties when he moved to America with we Meghan. Today Andrew and ex-we Sarah Ferguson, , emerged in public together for the first time since he lost his honorary titles. The couple, who orced in  but remain close, looked sombre as Andrew drove them from his Royal Lodge home in Windsor Great Park. There have also been calls for Andrew to be stripped of his Duke of York title. Andrew took the name, traditionally granted to the monarch’s second son, on his marriage to Sarah in . She is still the Duchess of York. Andrew, whose helicopter acted as a decoy for Argentinian cruise missiles during the Falklands war, will also keep his Royal Navy rank of vice-admiral.

As the sexual abuse lawsuit against the prince develops, Buckingham Palace has issued a statement that says he will lose his remaining patronages and military titles, and he will no longer use His Royal Highness. Initially, in  after that car crash Newsnight interview with Emily Maitlis, Prince Andrewaposs duties were suspended for the foreseeable future, but now the palace has decided to remove his titles altogether, as Hull Live reports. But thanks to a law passed by King George V in , known as Letters Patent, Prince Andrew, like Prince Harry, is entitled to use the style aposHis Royal Highnessapos, unless The Queen officially revokes it - which hasnapost yet happened.For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newslettershere. Dr Prescott said: That Prince Andrew will neverto public le is implicit in the palace’s statement, as all patronages and military positions will revert back to the Queen. Given the Queen’s age, she will likely redistribute them to other members of the royal family. This decision is similar to the one reached with Prince Harry and the Duchess of Sussex in , when they stepped back from their roles as senior royals. Then, the Queen announced that her grandson and his we would no longer use the HRH title. Andrew is now in the same position, though for quite dferent reasons. Formally, all three retain the HRH title, but will not use it in official capacity.  The dficulty for the Queen is that both Prince Harry and Prince Andrew are entitled to retain the title under Letters Patent issued by George V in  - this is a legal document that effectively expresses the wishes of the monarch. King George V wanted a aposslimmed down monarchyapos, so issued a new law - Letters Patent. This limited the number of royal relatives that could use the title of Prince or Princess. This means that only the children and grandchildren of the monarch through the male line are automatically given the title, plus the first son of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales.  Dr Prescott continued: It would take a further Letters Patent for a HRH title to be removed from someone. In  this happened with Diana, Princess of Wales, following her orce with Prince Charles. This was enormously controversial at the time, but it shows that it is possible for someone to formally lose their HRH title. Still, Andrew has not lost everything. He retains the title of aposprinceapos from birth and remains the Duke of York, which is a peerage. Under the law, both titles and peerages are forms of intangible property . A general principle of law is that property cannot simply be seized from someone without prior legal authorisation. He also remains in the line of succession for the throne.  Looking to the future, when Andrew dies, the dukedom will die with him, as he leaves no male heir. Traditionally, the peerage would go to the second eldest son of the monarch . Andrew also retains the position of Councillor of State. Should the Queen be unable to fulfil her formal legal duties due to illness, Councillors of State can fulfil those duties on her behalf. This is provided for by the Regency Acts  to , which specy that the first four in the line of succession of full age , are appointed as Councillors. That currently means Prince Charles, Prince William, Prince Harry and Prince Andrew. Two are expected to act together, whichrequired, would be Prince Charles and Prince William. Again, for this to change, an act of parliament would be required.There are other problems with the Regency Acts, making reform more likely in the near future, especially when Prince Charles becomes King. This would create the opportunity to more thoroughly address the position of both Prince Harry and Prince Andrew.The dukedom and Andrew’s position as a Councillor of State mean that the separation of Prince Andrew from royal le is not entirely complete, but it is as far as the Queen can go for now. The rest is up to Parliament.Do you have a story to share  Weaposd love to hear all about it.

In this apartment, the Duke of York had a bed piled high with stuffed animals and toys, Page claims. He said: “It had about  or  stuffed toys positioned on the bed and basically there was a card the inspector showed us in a drawer and it was a picture of these bears all in situ. “The reason for the laminated picture wasthose bears weren’t put back in the right order by the maids, he would shout and scream.” One royal writer was introduced to the strange collection at Buckingham Palace in .  Elizabeth Day said of the bizarre meeting: It seemed rather strange that a grown man should be so amused by a stuffed toy.” The new show - Ghislaine, Prince Andrew and the Paedophile - is being aired on ITV on Tuesday at pm. In the programme, ITV says Singh unravels the story of how an entitled daughter of a billionaire sank into shame and disgrace through her friendship with paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. It will also explore how Prince Andrew, the Queenaposs second son, is now embroiled in the scandal as he faces his own possible civil court case brought by Virginia Giuffre Andrew has strenuously denied the allegations made by Ms Giuffre against him.  Page also recalled suspecting that Andrew and pimp Ghislaine were lovers because she would come and go from his quarters at will.Page, who is not without scandal himself after being jailed for a £million fraud scam in , said Ghislaine and Andrewaposs other female friends rarely signed in, The Sun Online reports.Again, speaking with Singh, Page said: “From the way she was allowed to enter and exit the palace at will, we suspected that she may have had an intimate relationship with Prince Andrew.”  He continued: “She kept coming in and out, in and out.” It comes after reports claimed Prince Andrew was tearful when the Queen told him she was stripping him of his honorary military titles. The Duke of York was said to be utterly devastated by his mother’s bombshell decision. The move came after a US judge ruled a civil case in New York against Andrew by his sex accuser Ms Giuffre can go ahead. Andrew strenuously denies any wrongdoing. The princeaposs lawyers want to quiz Ms Giuffreaposs psychologist to seehis accuser is suffering from  memories of meeting him.  It was quickly ridiculed by legal experts who described it as a “typical tactic” used in historic sexual abuse cases, and one Ghislaine Maxwell used at her trial. But Andrew’s lawyers are determined to grill Ms Giuffre’s therapist Dr Judith Lightfoot on the “theory of  memories” as well as matters discussed during their sessions, notes taken and any prescriptions given. The lawyers state that the royal “contends that [Ms Giuffre] may suffer from  memories, as evidenced by the fact that her claims regarding her time with Epstein, and the circumstances under which [Prince Andrew] allegedly assaulted her, have repeatedly changed over the years”.Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Prince Andrew, Duke of YorkITVBuckingham PalaceDocumentariesRoyal FamilyToysGhislaine MaxwellJeffrey Epstein\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

It comes after his petition to self-fund his personal protection was \"dismissed\", his lawyers claimPrince Harry has offered to pay for his own security while in the UK, according to his lawyersBySophie Wingate, PARyan FaheyNews Reporter:,  Jan | commentsPrince Harryaposs offer to pay for his own police protection while in the UK was dismissed by the Home Office, his lawyers claim.The Duke of Sussex has threatened to pursue a judicial review against a decision made by the Home Officethe Government does not provide continued security while he and his family are in the country.In a statement, the duke also made clear he is happy to pay for officers - an offer which has been dismissed, according to a Mail on Sunday investigation.In a statement from the Princeaposs lawyers, he insists on the self-funded protection so his family does not impose on the British taxpayer. He first offered to pay for his own security detail in January  at Sandringham. But this current legal action, which began in September last year, stems from his July  visit to the UK for the unveiling of a statue of his late mum, Princess Diana.While the prince was not provided security on this occasion, he was protected just months earlier when he visited to attend the funeral of his granddad, Prince Philip.  In a statement from Harryaposs lawyers, he claims the lack of continuity means the prince and his family are unable tohome. And his simple goal is to ensure the safety of his kids so they can know his home country.The statement adds: The UK will always be Prince Harry ’s home and a country he wants his we and children to be safe in.With the lack of police protection, comes too great a personal risk. The prince also hopes his petition for the review - and after pleading with the Home Office for security - will resolve this situation.  The statement also gives further detail of the nature of Harryaposs inherited security risk, which he carries for le. He remains sixth in line to the throne, served two tours of combat duty in Afghanistan, and in recent years his family has been subjected to well-documented neo-Nazi and extremist threats, it says. While his role within the institution has changed, his profile as a member of the Royal Family has not. Nor has the threat to him and his family.  Through his lawyers, the prince also pointed to other high-profile figures with an inherent threat risk who receive free police protection after leaving public office. Responding to the news of Harryaposs case, a Government spokesperson said: “The UK Government’s protective security system is rigorous and proportionate. It is our long-standing policy not to provide detailed information on those arrangements. To do so could compromise their integrity and affect iniduals’ security. “It would also not be appropriate to comment on the detail of any legal proceedings.”  A judicial review is a type of court case in which a claimant challenges the lawfulness of a decision made by a public body or government department, such as the Home Office, according to the Judiciary UK website. A judge reviews the way in which a decision has been made. The court is not really concerned with the conclusions of that process and whether they were right or wrong, as long as the right procedures have been followed. The court will not re-make the decision. If the claimant wins, the decision can be declared unlawful, or quashed. That will usually mean the decision has to be taken again. While the public body could reach the same decision again, it may follow a proper procedure that leads to a dferent decision result.

Megan and Archie have not ed to the UK since the couple walked away from royal le in , while Lilibet has yet to set foot in the country where her dad was born. Lawyers acting for the Duke of Sussex say they will seek a judicial reviewcontinued security is not provided when he and his family visit. In a statement his legal team said Harryaposs security was compromised last summer when he unveiled a statue of his mother, Princess Diana, at Kensington Palace. It said that Harry - who inherited a security threat at birth - is unable toto his home with his family, saying they have been subjected to well-documented neo-Nazi and extremist threats. Without police protection, lawyers said, bringing Meghan and the children over comes at too great a personal risk. The Duke has ed to the UK twice in the last two years - for the statue unveiling in July last year and Prince Philipaposs funeral three months earlier - but Meghan and the children have stayed in the US both times. Harry is arguing his private protection team in the US does not have adequate jurisdiction abroad or access to UK intelligence information which is needed keep the Sussex family safe.  The UK will always be Prince Harryaposs home and a country he wants his we and children to be safe in, the statement said. The Duke has filed a claim for a judicial review against a Home Office decision not to allow him to personally pay for police protection while in the UK. His representatives said British taxpayers will not have to foot the bill, but said a private security team cannot replicate the protection needed.  It added that he had first offered to pay for police protection for himself and his family in January , but the offer was not accepted. During last summeraposs visit to London, Harryaposs car was chased by photographers - an incident that has made him anxious about his safety. A source told the Mail on Sunday: aposHarryaposs argument in a nutshell is: aposYou got the law wrong.apos He feels the decision to remove his security was wrong. Pre-action protocol was sent by Harryaposs lawyers to the Home Office a couple of months ago. This is essentially a precursor to a judicial review. If the case goes forward it could lead to a legal battle in the High Court between Government ministers and the Duke.  The statement in full Prince Harry inherited a security risk at birth, for le. He remains sixth in line to the throne, served two tours of combat duty in Afghanistan, and in recent years his family has been subjected to well-documented neo-Nazi and extremist threats. While his role within the institution has changed, his profile as a member of the royal family has not. Nor has the threat to him and his family.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex personally fund a private security team for their family, yet that security cannot replicate the necessary police protection needed whilst in the UK. In the absence of such protection, Prince Harry and his family are unable toto his home.The duke first offered to pay personally for UK police protection for himself and his family in January of  at Sandringham. That offer was dismissed. He remains willing to cover the cost of security, as not to impose on the British taxpayer. As is widely known, others who have left public office and have an inherent threat risk receive police protection at no cost to them. The goal for Prince Harry has been simple - to ensure the safety of himself and his family while in the UK so his children can know his home country.  During his last visit to the UK in July  - to unveil a statue in honour of his late mother - his security was compromised due to the absence of police protection, whilst leaving a charity event. After another attempt at negotiations was also rejected, he sought a judicial review in September  to challenge the decision-making behind the security procedures, in the hopes that this could be re-evaluated for the obvious and necessary protection required. The UK will always be Prince Harryaposs home and a country he wants his we and children to be safe in. With the lack of police protection, comes too great a personal risk. Prince Harry hopes that his petition - after close to two years of pleas for security in the UK - will resolve this situation. It is due to a leak in a UK tabloid, with surreptitious timing, we feel it necessary to release a statement setting the facts straight.

The Duke of Sussex’s unprecedented move of threatening to sue the government is both breathtaking and utterly baffling. Those in royal circles have almost universally questioned the play at hand, not only in its nature but equally in execution. True enough, with his background in the military and his position in one of the most famous families in the world – and celebrity lestyle – Prince Harry and his family are arguably high profile targets.  But to suggest he is at a greater risk at home than abroad, where he has chosen to base himself, surely holds very little weight. Indeed the manner of this row seems even more bizarre that it is still being argued two years on from being granted his wish to up and leave his royal role, on the understanding that you can’t have everything you want. This is all before even considering the effect on the Queen, who we are told has been made aware of her grandson’s latest bright idea just as she emerges from one of her most tumultuous periods of recent years. She faced her first Christmas without her beloved husband before wielding the axe on her son Prince Andrew’s royal career.What do you think  Have your say in our comments below... The decision to banish him into the wilderness, arguably a couple of years behind schedule, would not have come easy no matter the depths of his fall from grace. Now, just three weeks away from the beginning of her Platinum Jubilee year, Her Majesty is facing down another petulant member of her family for reasons she would be forgiven for assuming had been sorted. Keep up to date with all the latest news from the Queen, Charles, William, Kate, Harry, Meghan, George, Charlotte, Louis, Archie and the rest of the family. Weaposll send the best Royal news directly to your inbox so you never have to miss a thing.to our newsletter here. At every turn the Queen has handled Harry’s behaviour with good grace, wishing him well and extending a loving sentiment that he and his family would always be much loved members of her own. With the season of goodwill to all now behind us, one may wonder how much is left.

Three main symptoms of coronavirus are listed by the NHS as a high temperature, a new, continuous cough and a loss or change to your sense of smell and taste.But scientists behind the ZOE Covid symptom app claim others testing positive for Omicron are now reporting symptoms more like a common cold. Scientists took health reports from contributors reporting positive cases in the ZOE COVID Study app in December  as Omicron became dominant They then compared them with data from early October when Delta was the dominant iant. The Liverpool Echo reports Dr Claire Steves found the top five symptoms in both periods were: Runny nose Headache Fatigue Sneezing Sore throatThe analysis found no clear dference in the symptom profile of Delta and Omicron, with only % of people experiencing the classic three symptoms of fever, cough, or loss of sense of smell or taste. The typical symptoms of a cough, loss of taste and smell and fever, were further down on the list. Other symptoms in order included:Persistent cough Hoarse voice Other Shivers Fever Dizzy Brain fog Altered smell Eye sorenessUnusual muscle pains Skipped meals Loss of smell Chest pains Swollen glands Feeling downLoss of smell and taste become much less common. It was in the top  symptoms earlier in , and now itaposs ranking at , with only one in five people experiencing it. Dr Steves said cold-like symptoms remain the top symptoms in people with covid and classic symptoms such as a cough are much less prevalent. She added: Most reported symptoms are really very much like a cold, especially in people who have been vaccinated. If you are feeling at all under the weather please make sure you get a test. If the symptoms are mild, why should I worry about Omicron Omicron can still hospitalise and cause serious illness and can spread much quicker, scientists say, as well as having damaging effects on the economy due to high numbers of people needing to self-isolate. According to ZOE research, findings show exactly what you can do to strengthen your immune system — like eating a healthy - and to help protect yourself against coronavirus and other harmful invaders. In detail, the study found that people who ate a high-quality diet, rich in plant-based foods, were  per cent less likely to get Covid- and  per cent less likely to get severe illness requiring treatment in the hospital.Additionally, being fully vaccinated has been found to be the best way to protect people from severe disease and hospitalisation as well as mask wearing in crowded places.

This week it was announced that the Queen had revoked his honorary military titles and can no longer use the title His Royal Highness. It comes after a US judged threw out his latest attempt to have a civil case brought by Virginia Giuffre thrown out. Ms Giuffre, now , claims that she was forced to have sex with the Duke three times when she was a apossex slaveapos of Andrewaposs paedophile pal Jeffrey Epstein as a teenager. The Duke of York vehemently denies the allegations. In recent weeks his legal team have tried numerous times to get the case thrown out, or to discredit Ms Giuffre, who they have claimed is seeking another payday at his expense.  Ms Giuffreaposs legal representative said his client is determined to face the royal in court after judge Lewis Kaplan said her civil case can proceed. The mum-of-three is seeking undisclosed damages from Andrew, who she was pictured with in an infamous photograph believed to have been taken in , when she was . It means Andrew could be compelled to answer questions about her claims in a civil court in the autumn. Here we look at some of the attempts the Duke and his team have made to prevent the court showdown from happening. . Claiming Virginia Giuffre may have  memoriesAs the Sunday Mirror reports today, Andrew’s lawyers want to quiz Ms Giuffre’s psychologist to seehis accuser is ­suffering from “ memories” of meeting HIM.The extraordinary move emerged in legal documents filed late on Friday in the Duke of York’s looming civil court battle with Ms Giuffre. But he claims he doesn’t remember meeting her – despite the infamous photo of him with his arm around her. It was quickly ridiculed by legal experts who described it as a “typical tactic” used in historic sexual abuse cases, and one Ghislaine Maxwell used at her trial.  But Andrew’s lawyers are determined to grill Ms Giuffre’s therapist Dr Judith Lightfoot on the “theory of  memories” as well as matters discussed during their sessions, notes taken and any prescriptions given. The lawyers state that the royal “contends that [Ms Giuffre] may suffer from  memories, as evidenced by the fact that her claims regarding her time with Epstein, and the circumstances under which [Prince Andrew] allegedly assaulted her, have repeatedly changed over the years”. The move bizarrely links to the Duke of York’s stance in his  car crash Newsnight interview where he claimed to have “no recollection” of meeting Ms Giuffre.. Attempting to rely on secret deal made with paedophile Jeffrey Epstein One avenue Andrewaposs legal team used to try and get the case thrown out was a , settlement made between Ms Giuffre and his former pal Epstein. In a  deal which was unsealed earlier this year, the financier and child trafficker agreed to pay Ms Giuffre after she accused him of sexual abuse. One key clause in the deal suggested that Ms Giuffre would be barred from taking action against any other parties linked to Epstein.  This, the Dukeaposs lawyers argued, would have included Andrew himself. The settlement included an agreement to remise, release, acquit, satisfy and forever discharge the said second parties and any other person or entity who could have been included as a potential defendant … from all, and all manner of, action and actions of Virginia , including state or federal, cause and causes of action”. But Judge Kaplan was having none of it. Epstein, he said, was only out to protect himself, he ruled, and this aspect of the agreement did not prevent Ms Giuffre from pursuing a civil claim against Andrew. Judge Kaplan said that settlement was too ambiguous to protect the royal. . Arguing Ms Giuffre could not sue as she lived in Australia Another technicality which Andrewaposs team hoped could prevent the case continuing was the fact that Ms Giuffre no longer lives in the US. This, lawyers claimed, meant that she could not legally take action through a US court.  The Dukeaposs lawyer Andrew B Brettler, called for the case to be halted at the end of last month. He wrote: “Recently discovered evidence suggests that the court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over this action because plaintf Virginia L Giuffre cannot satisfy the elements of ersity jurisdiction. “Notwithstanding that, in her complaint Ms Giuffre alleges she is a citizen of the state of Colorado the evidence demonstrates that she is actually domiciled in Australia, where she has lived for all but two of the past  years.” Again, this legal argument did not get very far. . aposHidingapos to prevent lawsuit being served on himBack when the civil case was launched, Andrew was accused of hiding to avoid the lawsuit being served on him.Security personnel repeatedly stopped officials trying to hand the Duke of York the documents at the Royal Lodge in August, it was claimed. Ms Giuffreaposs lawyers said the papers had been handed to a Met Police officer at the Royal Lodge in Windsor on August . But they claimed the agent was told police told them they were not able to accept served court papers, or let anyone serve them on the property. It led to Ms Giuffreaposs lawyers seeking intervention from Judge Kaplan, claiming Prince Andrew was playing game of hide and seek behind palace walls.  . Claiming not have met Ms GiuffreDuring his car-crash BBC Panorama interview back in , Andrew claimed he had no recollection of ever meeting Ms Giuffre.Rubbishing her allegations that she had been forced into having sex with him, Andrew said: I have no recollection of ever meeting this lady. None, whatsoever. He was pressed by interviewer Emily Maitlis, who asked him: You donapost remember meeting her  The Duke replied: No. Years earlier a photo had emerged of Andrew with his arms around Ms Giuffre with Ghislaine Maxwell in the background. However his circle have long suggested it is a fake - alleging that his fingers were not chubby enough to be his in the image. A palace source said Andrew has “absolutely no recollection” of the photo being taken and “seriously doubts” it is genuine. “Look at his fingers,” they said. “The duke has chubby fingers, they don’t look right, nor does the height of the duke and the girl. His legal team have asked to have the original photo so they can carry out their own investigation. They seriously doubt its veracity. The duke is adamant and has been consistent since  that he does not recall ever meeting Miss Roberts, let alone the photo being taken.” “Many close to the duke, who know him well, believe this is a witch-hunt based on absolutely no evidence.” . Pizza Express alibi and claims he could not sweat  Two of the claims in Andrewaposs  Panorama interview that drew the most attention were his claim that he was at a Pizza Express restaurant on one of the nights he is claimed to have had sex with Ms Giuffre - and his claim he cannot sweat. Quizzed about Ms Giuffreaposs claim that the prince sweated heavily on the night in , Andrew claimed to have a medical condition that meant he could not sweat. In legal documents related to the civil case, Ms Giuffreaposs lawyers David Boies and Sigrid McCawley called on the Duke to hand over all documents concerning your alleged medical condition of anhidrosis, hypohidrosis, or your inability to sweat. His lawyers refused, however, on the grounds that it is harassing and seeks confidential and private information and documents that are irrelevant, immaterial and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. Similarly the Duke has not presented any evidence proving he was at Pizza Express on March ,  - the night Ms Giuffre claims he partied in a West End nightclub before having sex with her. His lawyers responded: “Defendant is unable to comply with Request No.  because no such documents exist in his possession, custody or control. A diligent search and a reasonable inquiry have been made in an effort to comply with this demand.”Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Prince Andrew, Duke of YorkRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Research by the University of Chester also found milk from Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda and Morrisons, kept unopened in a fridge set at C, remained safe to drink days after its use-by date. Now, in a victory for the environment and common sense, Morrisons says use-by dates on its milk cartons are to become a thing of the past. At the end of the month, the ­supermarket will instead be printing best-before dates on dairy products and encouraging people to do a “snf test”.  It comes as figures revealed that milk is the third most wasted food and drink item in the UK, with more than half a million tons of dairy chucked every year, most of that in the home. Nearly % of us are still confused by best-before and use-by dates. As supermarket foods carry wildly dferent information on how long they will last – some by as much as five months for the same items – it is not dficult to see why. Take a look through your kitchen cupboards and you will find “once-opened” instructions on similar items that are inconsistent and unclear as to whether they are recommendations on food safety or quality. The use-by date is about safety and the most important thing to remember. Foods can be eatenup until the use-by date but not after. Best before refers to the quality and taste. The food is most likely safe to eat after this date but may not be at its best in terms of flavour and texture. You can’t beat looking, smelling and tasting for a reliable indicator of how fresh the food is. But it would be even better for ­supermarkets and manufacturers to come up with a standard labelling system that was clear, consistent and easy to understand – to stop any more perfectly edible food ending up in the bin.

Residents say the nine blocks look half-built and the windows protrude with numbers which are written in paint outside fats.And after more than four years on from the Grenfell fire in London, occupants have yet to see any replacement cladding.The blocks are can be seen from all over Salford, Manchester, but residents say the real nightmare lies inside their walls.. Lynne Broughton has lived in Thorn Court for  years. and only in the last few years she has wanted to leave.Itaposs cold, no matter how much you put the heating on itaposs freezing. I have to put blankets around my legs. I was dreading this Christmas. We have get through another winter, she told Manchester Evening News. After living in fear for years following Grenfell, the type of flammable cladding which caused the lethal inferno was finally removed from the apartment blocks in Salford in September .  The residents may no longer be living in fear of fire - but now theyaposre living in fear of the cold and the meter. This is because the buildingaposs heating system depends on the cladding to retain heat. Without it, draughts whip through the flats, which have around  residents, at a time when the cost of energy is rocketing. Before, when Iaposd switch the heating on, in half-an-hour it would be as warm as toast, Lynne said. Now, she says as soon as she walks into her flat apositaposs like being outsideapos, even though she always puts the heating on. Lynneaposs bought thick curtains, keeps her blinds down, and has put bubble wrap below her windows to try and stop the draught. But the cold isnapost the only issue caused by the cladding being removed. Many of the residents have water coming in through their exposed windows too. Ours is p***ing with rain and itaposs freezing, Lynne said of her flat. Iaposd say the majority of the block, Iaposd say itaposs the cold and the draughts and the water, she said.  If there was plenty of houses I think I would have moved out. Itaposs two years down now. Weaposre still in the cold. Whoaposs to say weaposll get the cladding later this year  They should have never have done what they did. If you donapost live in these blocks you donapost know what itaposs like. They donapost give a s**t, weaposre the poor people. Residents had previously been told that the cladding would be replaced by . Pendleton Together has now said that works are set to be complete by  - a whole two years behind schedule. Not everyone can afford the extra money thataposs needed to heat their homes. The Manchester Evening News spoke to one single mum-of-three, who doesnapost want to be named, who says she hasnapost turned her heating on for aposwell over a yearapos. She said: I donapost put the heating on at all. I sit in blankets and make the kids wrap up. I canapost afford it.  She has a newborn baby, a three-year-old and a five-year-old and wants to get out - to a flat with more than two bedrooms - and to somewhere she can afford to heat. Iaposm a single parent, where am I going to get the money to go private  she said. Instead, she survives day-by-day by spending as little time in her flat as possible. She leaves the house at am in the morning and makes her way to the warmth of her mumaposs house and doesnapostuntil itaposs time to take her children to bed. Rachel, who lives at the top of Thorn Court, says she doesnapost use her living room anymore, and has to watch TV in bed. Itaposs cold like outside. You spend most of your time in your bedroom because itaposs the warmest place, but Iaposd like to sit in the living room and chill out. It used to be dead warm but now itaposs freezing cold. You just have to put blankets on and keep the curtains shut and stuff like that, she said. Hundreds of residents across the nine blocks of flats are taking legal action against Pendleton Together, the Private Finance Initiative contractor which manages the council properties. They are claiming the properties are aposunfit for human habitationapos - mostly down to the cold. Martin Eithne and Martin Crowson are two of them. The retired couple live in Holm Court and chair the blockaposs residents association. They say that they were paying £ a week in electricity bills when the cladding was on. Now, they say theyaposre paying £.  Itaposs down to them to pay us back, Eithne said. Martin says that the biggest issue people are facing in his block is that the electric is aposcosting a fortuneapos. If you put your heating on it costs a fortune, around £ a day extra, he said. Thereaposs people that stay in bed earlier and get out of bed later because of the cladding. They canapost put the heat on because they canapost afford they canapost afford to put the heating on. Pendleton Together is giving the residents £ every two months during the winter. But everyone the M.E.N. spoke to said it was not enough. Robert Vaudrey lives in Holm Court with his we Pamela and their four-year-old daughter April. We moved in with the baby, it was our first home together, he said. The biggest problem is the heating. Since the cladding got removed, weaposre putting in £ a week.  He says the aposgesture amountsapos of money heaposs been given arenapost enough - and aposdonapost even cover a monthaposs worthapos. The payments arenapost even touching the sides, he said. Weaposve got a littlaposun. Keeping a four-year-old dressed, trying to explain that itaposs cold, itaposs just ridiculous. The heating costs so much that Pamela had the idea of covering the thermostat up with a flannel. Itaposs so the computer thinks itaposs warmer than it is. Weaposve set it to  degrees, once it goes below it takes a daft amount of money from us, Robert said. The heating may be a winter issue - but it affects the family during the summer months as well. It costs an awful lots of money, money we save up for during the summer. We have to save up. During the summer weaposve got no money to spend, Robert said. Matthew Condrad, the director of Tenant Claim, says that aposall nine of the flats have got the same issuesapos. He claims there are around  people living in the Pendleton flats - and  of them have gone to him for legal help. He said: The buildings are fitted with NIBE heating system which operates at a low temperature and relies upon the cladding to retain heat. Removal of the cladding has therefore caused excess cold which has been exacerbated by draughts around windows and ventilation ducts. The windows do not open properly and constitute a hazard. Some have also fallen out. Matthew has put forward some test cases from the Pendleton flats - andsuccessful - others will follow. But he admits that itaposs a process that could take years. And he believes that evenhe wins the case, Pendleton Together will appeal, as aposthereaposs a lot of money at stakeapos. The cladding may even be replaced by the time the cases enter the courtroom. Lynne from Thorn Court is certainly sceptical. She fears that as she accepted the apostokenapos amount of money from Pendleton Together her case would fail. She also points out, thatthe case ends up taking five years to settle, lots of the elderly claimants aposwill have carked it by A spokesperson from Pendleton Together said: Pendleton Together understands that our residents have concerns during the programme of fire safety works and we are working with them to offer support or to direct them towards services that can offer further help. As part of this support Pendleton Together Operating Limitedis providing fairly calculated winter energy payments that mitigate the dference in electricity consumption. This will mean that no resident is left out of pocket due to this dference. that timeapos. We have received reports of water ingress in some of our properties and we have responded to these. All known issues have been or are being addressed, however residents with any new concerns should contact us immediately or book a repair via our website. In relation to the timeframe for replacement of cladding, within days of the tragedy at Grenfell, Pendleton Together and Salford City Council committed to removing all cladding and insulation on our nine blocks and replacing them with safe alternatives. Unfortunately, due to well documented issues around clarity of regulation and ability to secure funding, that affects landlords nationwide, the work has taken longer than anticipated. All of the cladding has now been removed and necessary preparatory works are taking place prior to the reinstatement of cladding which is expected to start on some of our blocks in the next few months. The programme of fire safety works, which includes the replacement of cladding, the installation of sprinklers and heat detectors and other internal mitigation works is set to complete in . We are very sorry for the inconvenience and disruption that our residents are feeling.

Temperatures will plunge below zero before Brits see any of the white stuff - which forecasters say will last some regions of the isles on Friday, January .Forecasters see the mercury plunging to lows of -C over the next seven days with the chill remaining in the low single-digits every night and reaching just over the C mark in daylight hours. WXChart meteorologists predict snow will be first seen in Scotland before moving South to northern England, according to The Sun Online. East Anglia is predicted to be hit with wintry showers early on January , before parts of the country between Aberdeen and Hampshire will then see snow on Sunday January .The arctic chill follows the trend of recent days after the Met Office warned of -C conditions amid blanketings of thick icy fog on Friday.During the day, temperatures will be milder hours this week will see milder temperatures, reaching as high as C in the southwest while generally staying around the  or C mark.  But as night approaches the cold will take hold with bone-shaking chills of -C seen in Wales on the coldest night of the week, which looks set to be the early hours of Tuesday morning. The Met Office has also predicted snow for the first half of February. Their long-range forecast reads: Into February outbreaks of rain and stronger winds are likely at times across the far north, whereas settled conditions are likely to persist in the south.  Temperatures are looking to be slightly above average, particularly in the north however some colder interludes remain likely, bringing a risk of occasional snow, most likely over northern hills. Five-day forecast Tonight: Most areas dry with long clear periods and fog patches. Cloudier and windier in the far north with some rain at times. Colder than last night with widespread frost. Monday: A chilly start then most areas fine, dry and bright with plenty of sunshine once early fog patches clear. Cloudier in the very far north with rain at times.

Met Officer forecasters see the mercury plunging to lows of -C over the next seven days with the chill remaining in the low single-digits every night and reaching just over the C mark in daylight hours. The freezing conditions will lead the way for snowfall, which looks set to blast some regions of the isles on Friday, January . WXCharter meteorologists say snow will be first seen in Scotland before moving south to northern England, according to the Sun Online.East Anglia is predicted to be hit with wintry showers early on January , before parts of the country between Aberdeen and Hampshire will then see snow on Sunday January .  The looming arctic chill follows the trend of recent days after the Met Office warned of -C conditions amid blanketings of thick icy fog on Friday. Daylight hours this week will see milder temperatures, reaching as high as C in the southwest while generally staying around the  or C mark. But as night approaches the cold will take hold with bone-shaking chills of -C seen in Wales on the coldest night of the week, which looks set to be the early hours of Tuesday morning.  Birmingham and London look set for lows of C on that freezing morning as Swindon plunges to freezing point. Temperatures in the east of England will struggle to stay over the zero mark, with C conditions likely. This cold front will be seen all the way up the east coast, hitting York and Newcastle upon Tyne. Today, Brits in Scotland and Northern Ireland will be able to bask in some winter sun as conditions stay generally dry across the UK, but with some chance of rain in the far south of England and central UK this afternoon.  The cold snap will arrive tonight with noticeably chillier conditions that will lead to widespread frost by tomorrow morning. Monday will start cold, but be generally dry with the chance of rain in the very far north.Last Friday, the Met Office urged everyone to get the hot water bottles at the ready as itaposs set to be a cold and frosty night amid reports of brutally cold -C night ahead.Despite temperatures plummeting, Brits shouldnapost expect any snow yet. MET OFFICE OUTLOOK Today: Sunny spells today, best of the sunshine across Scotland and Northern Ireland. Dry for many but some early showery rain in the far south and a little rain at times for northern England this morning and central UK this afternoon. Tonight: Most areas dry with long clear periods and fog patches. Cloudier and windier in the far north with some rain at times. Colder than last night with widespread frost.

But with so many dferent brands to choose from, sometimes itaposs impossible to know which type to go for in the supermarket. Luckily, a reporter for Wales Online has done the heavy lting for the rest of us, sitting down to a proper tea tasting test to determine the best brand.

First sitting down with a mug of Paned Gymreig, Lewis noted its rich taste and golden brown flavour. Despite a fairly satisfying taste test, he admitted it didnapost blow me away, and gave it a respectable .  rating. Next Lewis sat down with a slightly more expensive brand, Twinings Everyday. But, despite the fact it could be described as premium, Lewis was underwhelmed by the taste of the cuppa and decided some of the cheaper brands were much tastier. Bearing in mind price versus taste, Lewis gave it an unimpressive rating of  . Next up was PG Tips, a well known and moderately priced teabag that is a firm favourite in many households. He noted the lovely smell that greeted him as he opened the box of teabags, and said the taste lived up to the aroma.

Explaining his reasoning, Lewis said: It was one of my least favourite drinks due to the uniquely robust flavour that was not to my preference. He did admit, however, that the cup of Yorkshire Tea looked more appealing than most others he tested. Cuppa number five was a blend of Tesco Original, which came in at a bargain price - and Lewis reckoned he got more than enough for his money. Describing the cuppa as incredibly light and rich, he said it was another brew he could sit and drink all day. In what could be a surprising verdict for many, he gave the Tesco cuppa a rating of . . Finally, Lewis poured himself a cup of Tetley tea, another firm UK favourite that has been on the shelves since . Describing Tetley as his previous go-to choice for a brew, he realised on this taste test that it didnapost offer the same quality of flavour heaposd had from the PG Tips and Tesco options. Still, he offered it a respectable . . After sitting down with each cuppa, Lewis was adamant that Tesco Original was his favourite cuppa - closely followed by PG Tips.

She shared the blunder on Mumsnet where users shared stories of their own Image: Getty Images iStockphotoByPaige HollandShowbiz Audience Writer:,  Jan | commentsThereaposs no such thing as a perfect parent. With one hundred and one tasks to tackle, itaposs inevitable that there are slip-ups along the way - as one mum found out. A woman was left in hysterics after she made the honest mistake of giving her son the wrong packed lunch.The woman took to Mumsnet to share the hilarious blunder, where she explained she was supposed to give her son pasta salad for his packed lunch.But it was when he asked why sheaposd given him funny mashed potato instead, she realised her mistake. Taking to the parenting site, she wrote: I told DS [darling son] he had pasta salad for lunch, she said. This evening he asked why we’d given him aposfunny mashed potatoapos instead. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. Turns out the pasta salad was still in the fridge and he’d been eating a tub full of fat I’d saved for the birds. Has anyone sent their child to school with anything worse or are we officially the worst parents on Mumsnet  she concluded her post. One person said: No, but this made me laugh out loud after a busy day! How much of it did he eat ! Ahahahahahaha!!!! Oh dear, said another. A third laughed: Iaposm surprised you didnapost get a confused call from the school receptionist!! Someone  said: Crying with laughter here - you definitely win the award for the worst packed lunch ever. Others shared funny stories of their own. We sent our son to school with a tub of margarine once, said one woman. Another added: My brother once opened his lunchbox at school to find therein a banana that was past its best covered in biscuit crumbs. Brother was only very little at the time so a banana and a few biscuits might havebeen an adequate lunch as a one-off. But the biscuits didn’t survive the journey being swung about by a -year-old, so a crumb-coated banana was lunch that day. A third then said: I had a bit of a rep for sending my kids to school with sandwiches made from mouldy bread.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

They say that your name influences the sort of person you will become, which is why itaposs so important to take your time whittling down your list before picking one for your own child. But before you make your choice, a school reception worker has shared her brutal opinion on what your kidsapos names really mean - and she didnapost hold back.Manda Dee, who is best known as @theschoolofficelady on TikTok, has posted a series of videos on the names she likes and dislikes.First up for the boys was Liam - but it also applies to any boy with an aposL name.apos Your child cries... cries a lot and those tears arenapost real, she said. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. Boys called Jack got off lightly as she called them incredibly hyperactive and crazy. Hayden is running someoneaposs le. I donapost knowit is the teacheraposs or yours - youaposve gotta tone it down, youaposve gotta stop spoiling that child. Then she roasts the name, Rex. You thought it was it was like a dogsapos name so you thought he was going to be happy-go-lucky, she started. Heaposs overly opinionated and he inserts his comments when they arenapost necessary. Tone it down. Next up was Xavier, as she said: I donapost knowheaposs not listening or he just canapost hear me. Xander was also met with criticism. I donapost know how to say this, she said. You thought Xander was going to be a girl. He wasnapost... he was another boy. She said boys named Emmitt never listen to their mums, Jadens try to kiss girls in the years above and those named Elijah donapost take part in group work because theyaposre too busy talking to their teachers about the show Dr Phil and basketball. Isaac or any less common bible names like Cain, Abel and Caleb,a first-grade classes Legos are missing, theyaposre probably in his pockets, she said. And finally we have Daniel. Daniel left his coat in the playground again and probably one of his shoes. Then it was time for her to judge the girls names. Girls called Lexi are sneaky, so sneaky, while Paisley is super cute... from far away. But sheaposs a hot mess. Olivia youaposre a sweetheart now, but youaposre gonna be a b***h once you get to high school, she said. Penelope is so cute but sheaposs left her bear at the resort again and youaposve got to drive back four hours and get it. She is so forgetful. Sheaposs the Daniel of girls. But she didnapost stop there. Hazel, Ruth, Evelyn, Lilith, basically all of the old, old lady names, you need to stop correcting me child and your mum needs a nice glass of wine and a long walk in the sunshine. She added: Any name that implies innocence - Heaven, Angel, Purity, Charity - your child is the opposite, your child is the devil. But what does she think about Sophies and Sophias  Manda said theyaposre often the cutest, nicest, smartest girls until they get into trouble, they stab their friends in the back and throw everyone under the bus. Charlotte. Be sure to check Charlotteaposs backpack before she gets to class today because itaposs likely thereaposs a dead bird in there that she found on the way to school, Manda declared. Ava is definitely the Isaiah of the girl names. Sheaposs so cute but sheaposs such a liar. Manda explained that Amanda will spill their sisteraposs nail polish on the classroom rug and will blame it on another kid. Isabella refuses to wear her sneakers to gym, instead she wants to wear her Ana and Elsa sparkly jelly flats.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

Following what she calls a strict military regime – which saw her take daily am visits to the gym and embark on km walks, working out for two-and-a-half hours a day – the mum-of-one managed to shed six stone in nine months.Despite being in better physical shape than before she had children, Alex says her meals are now bigger than what they were before – but packed with nutritious ingredients. She found out she was pregnant at the end of  and says midway through her pregnancy she began to eat unhealthily, causing her to pile on the pounds. “I really stacked on the weight – I was working long hours as a dental nurse and would eat McDonaldaposs at least once a day,” Alex, a former dental nurse, said.  I was starting early I’d usually get hash brown, egg and bacon muffin and hot chocolate for breakfast. And then for lunch I’d order a Quarter Pounder or Big Mac meal, a chocolate sundae and extra chicken nuggets with mayo. My mental health throughout most of my pregnancy was fine, however I did struggle towards the end realising how much weight I had gained and not recognising myself.” Alex welcomed her daughter in May  – but found herself feeling uncomfortable with her body. She said: I didnapost want to go out anywhere to show her off, I just wanted to hide away. I felt guilty Iaposd given birth to a beautul baby girl but I was so embarrassed about how I looked so never wanted my picture taken with her. I constantly heard was aposyour body will never be the sameapos and aposyou will always have a mum tum, learn to love itapos.  I didnapost want to be like that, so I used it as motivation. Alex decided that enough was enough and began to get in shape by hitting the gym and overhauling her diet. She said: I worked my a** off at the gym going at am every morning and going for km walks every day. At first I was really strict on my diet. I probably went too hard and developed somewhat of an eating disorder.  Iaposve now worked out a healthy relationship with food and exercise. Before I was only eating three small meals a day. Now I have larger meals and snacks. I donapost really count macros, or calories. I just try to eat mainly whole foods, regularly. I eat three main meals a day and have a snack in the morning which may be a protein bar, protein shake or a bit of fruit. In the afternoon I snack on a yoghurt but I try to listen to my body. I no longer turn down opportunities to eat out, and enjoy treats without guilt.  Alongside her healthy diet, Alex decided to ditch cardio and HIIT workouts in favour of weight training in a bid to gain lean muscle. She has currently shed six stone – and is healthier than ever. Her impressive weight loss has even let Alex change careers, swapping dental nursing for the glamourous le of an OnlyFans model.  She said: I saw it as a good source of income being a single mum having my daughter majority of the time. Now I can spend my days with Alora, and still make a good income. Alex shared a video documenting her weight loss to her , TikTok followers, who showered the mum-of-one with praise. One TikTok user said: This is what hard work and discipline looks like queens! Good job mumma. A second follower added: I literally gasped, this is amazing. Such an amazing transformation. Well done,” said another fan. One inspired viewer commented: Youaposre doing amazing Alex, itaposs empowering watching you.” While someone  said: Yes mama. You look awesome. Speaking about how her journey may inspire others, Alex added: I really want to show other mums what you can achieve when you set goals and are determined enough to achieve them. I also want people to know that itaposs important not to neglect self-care just because youaposre a mother – youaposre allowed to treat yourself and do things just for yourself.

Recent propaganda from the secretive state featured a suspiciously burrito-like dish called a “wheat wrap”, allegedly invented in  by Kim Jong-il – the current leaderaposs father and predecessor. Kim Jong-un was also said to take a “meticulous interest” in the foodstuff, whose popularity was reportedly “booming” in Pyongyang. But now a civil rights group representing Latin Americans has blasted the oppressive regime for the boast, warning “don’t mess with our burritos”. The League of United Latin American Citizens , the largest and oldest Latino civil rights group in the US, said there had been an “explosive reaction” ranging from Texas to Calornia.  “Kim Jong-un is feeding into a delusionhe thinks North Korea can wake up one morning and appropriate our Latino cultural identity,” said LULAC boss Domingo Garcia. “The fact is Mexicans have been building and eating real burritos for hundreds of years.” He continued: “The origin of burritos is steeped deep in our history back to the days of the tamal in the Aztec civilisation.  “The women would place pieces of dried meat inside a moist ball of cornmeal and wrap it in a cornhusk. “In time, the cornmeal masa was replaced by a corn or flour tortilla, which evolved into the modern-day burrito. “You might call it the first take-out food of the Americas.”Mr Garcia rounded off by saying North Korean burritos were no match for the real thing.“Imitation is the best form of flattery,” he said. “But thereaposs no way that a street vendor in Pyongyang who has never even seen a tortilla comal is going to be able to compete with Abuelitaaposs [granny’s] best, made-from-scratch, piping hot burritos. “They look pretty skimpy from the television footage, and real burritos are bursting with all the meat, rice, beans and avocado packed into them. “North Korean and Mexicano burritos aren’t even in the same class.  “Sorry Kim Jong-un, you don’t get a free pass on this one.” The outburst comes after the Kim regime broadcast propaganda showing North Koreans devouring wheat wraps at a stand outside the Kumsong Food Factory in Pyongyang. The broadcast also showed a mural of Kim Jong-il grinning in a kitchen where the burrito-like wraps were being prepared. However there are some dferences between the North Korean dish and its Tex-Mex cousin.  For example, the Pyongyang version seems to contain some kind of doner meat, with what appears to be a mix of cabbage and carrot. Kim Jong-il advised that they are best accompanied by mineral water in the summer and hot tea in the winter, according to North Korea’s Rodong Sinmun newspaper.  The original, meanwhile, typically contains beef, chicken or pork alongside rice, beans and other ingredients. The exact provenance of the modern burrito is unclear, however the word burrito appears in an  Mexican dictionary, where it is described as a foodstuff.

But they remain a vital part of our phone network.“If Ofcom decides to remove the veto of local authorities, then we must do all we can to strengthen their criteria for retaining the public call boxes.“Scottish Borders Council already has a very effective set of criteria that they have applied locally, and I think these should be adopted by Ofcom nationally.“I have made these points very clear in my consultation response.”Leader of Scottish Borders Council, Cllr Mark Rowley, said: \"Rural phone boxes still have a role whilst some areas - like the box  yards from my home in a remote Berwickshire village remain mobile not-spots and are close to recreational routes..remove“Storm Arwen showed just how fragile our communications are. The odd analogue phone still worked when mobile masts were out of power, fibre broadband was dead and power cut all telephony.“Ofcom now has a great opportunity here to ensure that all rural communities that need it get a community connectivity hub with an updated phone box with a reserve power supply which could be a leline in remote areas and for those travelling through them.“Scottish Borders Council has always made a robust case to retain such vital infrastructure, we now ask that it be updated to be able to respond to the challenges our infrastructure clearly faces and I welcome support of our MPs to help make that case to Ofcom.”"},{"url":null,"title":"20mph-limits-borders-council-vehicle-clocked-58mph-data-suggests","story":"A COUNCIL vehicle was clocked travelling at mph in a mph zone in the Borders, figures obtained via a Freedom of Informationrequest suggest.Last month, elected members backed plans to make the limits – which had been introduced as part of trial – permanent across the region.According to the data released by the local authority, between November - a total of  council vehicles fitted with trackers broke the mph speed restrictions.Responding to the figures, a Scottish Borders Councilspokesperson said that there were “some discrepancies” where vehicles were logged in mph zones when actually on mph roads.:Class A drugs seized following police operation in HawickThe spokesperson said: “The council expects everyone to abide by the speed limits in place on our local roads.

That aside, it was a strong year for the driver.Argyll rally fans are looking forward to a full  season, Covid permitting, in conjunction with Dunfermline Car Club and the new main title sponsors Burnside Piling.CAPTIONS:Jamie Miller and Ian McCulloch in their Citroen CR MAX.

It#s estimated that  million plant pots and seed trays are sold every year and the majority are sent to landfill or are incinerated.But there are non-plastic alternatives such as biodegradable pots made using materials like coir, wood chips, bamboo and rice husks.A growing number of garden centres and nurseries use biodegradable pots, but it#s worth checking out their sustainability policies.You can also make your own pots using newspaper or toilet roll tubes.And now is a good time to make your own supplies of biodegradable pots so you have stock for the planting season in a couple of months.If you#ve got a supply of old newspapers to hand, simply roll a cm-wide strip of newspaper tightly around a glass tumbler, leaving cm beyond the bottom of the glass.Fold the excess paper across the bottom, then press the glass down to flatten the pot#s base.There is no need to fix your paper pot with tape, just slide it off the glass.When ready to plant, just fill with compost.Taking good care of existing plastic is a good way to ensure you don#t have to keep buying it – so reuse any plant pots you have again and again for new seedlings, cuttings and plants.If you look after your propagator trays and lids, repairing themthey crack, they will last for several seasons.You can also reuse compost bags to store compost or turn leaves into leaf mould.The added bonus of recycling or reusing items in the garden is that it also reduces cost – as does growing from seed rather than buying established plants.Even in winter, you can grow something from seed, you just need a seed tray and a window ledge, or small cold frame or greenhouse – whatever space and budgets allow.For anyone growing their own vegetables, January is great for sowing onions.If you sow onions then, it saves the expense of buying onion sets – small bulbs – later, and you can have a much larger crop of onions in the summer.Onions seeds do not have a long shelf-le, so it#s best to buy new seeds each year.Seeds will germinate between C and C, one or two weeks after sowing.When large enough to handle, transplant to inidual small pots and keep in a bright, frost-free place until April when they can be planted outside.Varieties to try include: Setton – high yield, yellow skinned and good storage potential Red Baron – a late maturing red onion with globe shaped bulbs and strong taste and Hybound – an early iety with bronze-brown skins which is excellent for long-term storage.January is often the coldest month in the garden but there are still some things you can be doing to keep busy.As the Royal Horticultural Society says, January might be the middle of winter but, as the days en, the garden starts to grow.It is a great time to plan for the coming gardening year and to order seeds and plants.Enjoy the fresh air on dry sunny days, and check your winter protection, stakes, ties and supports are still working after any severe weather.Also, put out food for birds and leave some garden areas uncut, a little longer, to provide shelter for wildle in your garden.Top three jobs this month: clean pots and greenhouses ready for spring, dig over empty or unused plots, and prune apple and pear trees."},{"url":null,"title":"from our files january 7 2022","story":"Machrihanish and Islay topped the highest gusts of wind recorded in the west of Scotland on Tuesday.Throughout the early

demonstrations, visitors will be able to sample oysters at a specially-created oyster bar and a range of other foods.Speed cameras could be installed on Argyll roads in a bid to cut down on speed-related accidents.Argyll and Bute Council#s roads director Alistair Gow told councillors that use of both fixed and portable cameras to detect speeding had increased dramatically in the last few years.They had been pioneered by the former Strathclyde Regional Council which had paid for their purchase and installation with the police meeting the running costs.From the limited information available, an average drop of  per cent in injury accidents was being achieved where they were being used in the UK.#A substantial proportion of injury accidents within Argyll and Bute are speed related and in view of the above statistics, remote speed enforcement could substantially reduce the occurrence of accidents of this nature,# he said.#There are other types of equipment available which are not intended to operate as enforcement tools, but instead to convey a visual message to speeding motorists. This equipment has the advantage of raising driver awareness of the technology available, without the need to proceed with enforcement.#Councillors agreed that officials should investigate the ious forms of remote speed detection equipment, in consultation with Strathclyde Police and the Scottish Office, as trunk roads authority, and report back.FIFTY YEARS AGOThe New Year in Campbeltown was celebrated quietly at the weekend.Apart from a few breathalyser tests, police said the town was remarkably quiet. There were no incidents of breach of the peace, assaults and so on.All was peaceful on Islay too.No public houses or hotel bars were open to the public on New Year#s Day, which undoubtedly helped to keep everything quiet.There was one New Year#s Day incident. A van belonging to the Redfusion television company struck a wall on Low Askomill. Nobody was hurt.The breathalyser appears to have retained its purpose.All the burgh#s taxis were kept going non-stop over the Christmas and New Year period and operators reported heavy bookings.The West Coast coaches were also well used by people who sensibly left the car at home.Shops were kept busy during the few festive days and licensed grocers sold big amounts of the #cratur# and other alcoholic drinks.Christmas and New Year Day babies expected at Craigard Maternity Hospital failed to arrive and the staff had a quiet time of it.A large crowd of people of all denominations and from all over the country converged on Carradale House, home of the authoress Mrs Naomi Mitchison, to take part in the New Year celebrations.This was the rd time that Mrs Mitchison had played host to a large number of guests at Carradale.Politicians, government workers, farmers and fishermen all mingled together, danced, sung and sampled an excellent buffet.Many Carradale villagers were also present.Addressing the guests, Mrs Mitchison talked about the effects of the Common Market and fishermen.

We do not believe the water is coming from our network, as we do not have any infrastructure in the affected area.“We have tested samples of the water, which indicate that it is not from a treated drinking water supply and may be ground water.”An East Lothian Council spokesperson said: “We are aware of water run-off from the development site and are working with the developer to resolve this issue.“The site was closed for the holiday period but we will arrange for one of our officers to attend.”It has been claimed that the road under the rail bridge on the Flooding under the rail bridge on the B road into Musselburgh is breaking up due to flooding A Persimmon spokesperson said: “Additional measures are in place to deal with the water run-off.“The situation will be closely monitored by the local team.”Mr Grier has also received an email from the council saying it owns and maintains the drains gullys on the B and has identied an issue with its infrastructure at the railway bridge, “likely due to excess volume and silt build-up as a result.” The council is planning to undertake repairs at the “soonest possible time”.The email added: “However, this location requires a considerable amount of planning because the road will have to be shut and this in general means a three-month lead-in period to noty everyone – mainly for the bus operators since they will have to work out new timetables to facilitate a ersion route.

Some years, the harvest had been better than others, and some trees gave their fruit easier than others. He’d learnt not to expect a good harvest, but hope for one, after caring for the trees in all the ways he’d learnt.But he knew what the problem was. The trees were old. He had pruned them and cared for them in all the ways he knew, but now was the time to plant new treeshe was to enjoy an abundant harvest in future years.But where to plant  He walked about his garden trying to decide the best location.He was a very lucky man, it was an extensive garden and his le’s joy. He knew what was needed, the type of soil, the position so there was enough sunlight, sheltered so the spring buds would be protected from the chill winds. Then he realised the perfect place to create his new orchard: close by the wall at the far end of the garden.He wanted to plant from seeds, and he used the technique his grandfather had taught him so many years ago. So he set to work, first preparing the soil, and then he began planting.The trees would grow up together and help each other to flourish, he thought.Years went by and his new trees did indeed grow. Passers-by would often see him standing admiring their progress.But there were some unkind whisperers in the village, who said mocking things about the old man and his new apple trees.“Does he not realise he will be dead before those trees bear fruit  What a foolish man to waste his time and energy on something he will never enjoy himself. If he had children it might make sense, but he doesn’t.”The unkind whispers of course reached the old man’s ears. But it didn’t stop him standing by the new trees and admiring them, and helping them in the ways he knew, to grow healthily. As each year went by, the new trees got bigger and stronger, but the old man got weaker.Then one spring, he was unable to venture into his garden to admire their blossom. People noticed his absence and they wondered about him.Soon the news was out: he was very ill. One of his neighbours came to see him.They had been le-long friends and every autumn the old man had shared his apples with her, giving her a large basket of them to share with her big family.It was sadly their last meeting, for the old man passed away before the beginning of summer. When autumn arrived, the apple trees he’d planted bore their first fruit. It all seemed so sadly ironic.But then one day during the autumn, the neighbour’s grandchildren came running into her house, looking excited.“Gran, gran, look!” they called out, holding a handful of ripe, juicy-looking apples.“They were lying in your garden, on the grass over there, can we eat them ”She went to look. The old man had planted the new apple trees close to the low-lying wall where they had always had their conversations.It was the place where they had made and maintained their friendship, always talking and catching up.It was at this wall that he would hand over the basket of apples every autumn.Now the apple trees he’d planted had grown tall, and some of the branches arched above her lawn. The trees seemed to be offering her apples.She realised now why he’d planted the seeds there.Then she noticed that some of the trees were growing by the old man’s other wall, which bordered the main road.The old man used to leave a basket of apples by his gate for the children as they were walking to school. Now the trees arched over the grassy verge next to the pavement, displaying their fruit.They were just out of reach, butthe children were inventive and cooperated with each other, they could find ways to pick them.She reached up and picked a ripe-looking apple, just the way he’d taught her all those years ago when they’d first become friends. She looked at it and smiled.She looked over the wall to the place he used to stand when they had their conversations. She would never see him standing there again, she thought, never have those conversations again.But then she looked at the apple she had picked and smiled. Her sadness lted and she looked at the trees.“You’re still here,” she said quietly to the rustling branches, “and you’re still sharing your apples with everyone.”"},{"url":null,"title":"jack-up-vessel-offshore-wind-farm-now-visible-off-east-lothian-coast","story":"The vessel, installed on behalf of Inch Cape Offshore Limited and operated by

an island with Snoozlewhoosh, Jude also picked a triceratops, a stegosaurus and a t-rex.”Mr Brown added: “They were both very excited when we discussed that Snoozlewhoosh comes to le when children fall asleep and that Snoozlewhoosh takes them on amazing journeys in the magical world of dreams.”He was advised to trademark Snoozlewhoosh by a friend in the publishing industry, who said the character sounded like something Roald Dahl might have created.Mr Brown said: “Hearing this made me smile and I began to believe I could write and create a book for each grandchild at the very

These shting states, somehow able to exist simultaneously within the heart-walls of new and seasoned parents, are tracked by the Scottish writer and academic throughout her debut memoir, Bubbles.In the book, Bissell, a Glasgow native, explores shting identities, womanhood, history and current events as she charts her own journey through pregnancy, new motherhood and re-finding her moorings during the Covid- outbreak.Born in September , Bissell’s daughter was  months old when the world was plunged into fear and confusion by the spreading virus. Le in lockdown as a working mother – family support cut off, access to streets and parks rationed – saw Bissell and her husband make do, like so many others across the globe. Despite the distancing and isolation, new and familiar webs of connection unfurled and tightened during the shared, but not equitable, experience.After four months of isolation in Glasgow, Bissell was reunited with her parents in their beach-bordering garden in Dunoon, and the encounter is touchingly described in her book. On that same summer day in , I was birthing my first child, a daughter, born into this new, ever-shting world of lockdowns, social distancing and mask-wearing.Reading Bubbles brought back memories, moments that had already buried themselves under the sleepless nights, tandem tears, grubby hand-grasps and ripples of laughter that punctuate new parenthood. So much has been lost during the last two years, not least loved ones, but also opportunities, experiences and small pieces of ourselves. It perhaps seems little compared with the enormity of what others lost, but there is also space to mourn for the newborn mothers who had no-one to turn to during those first days, when moods didn’t lt and babies never slept. For the infants who didn’t meet their families for fear of infection, for the parents that couldn’t be comforted with a touch, or for those who birthed alone because hospitals were understaffed and overstretched.I was lucky the world began to open up just days before my baby was born. I was able to be held by my own mother as I laboured at home after months of being apart, before giving birth in water with my partner by my side at the newly re-opened midwe-led unit in Paisley. I could share my daughter with family and friends, and I was thankful for the slower pace of le in those early days.It was not an easy time for Bissell, who contracted Covid in December , although she acknowledges she too is one of the “lucky ones”. She reflects on how much harder it might have been, had she given birth during the pandemic, to have experienced “the loss of what this time should have been”. No visits from family, no baby classes, no friendships with others who are in exactly the same brand new boat.Bissell takes comfort in small pleasures – watering plants, sharing coffee with her husband – but she also feels “a deep and primal dread”. Her daughter’s world has shrunk to just the three of them, the toddler still happy and curious but the mother concerned about keeping her safe despite the threat of the virus, environmental collapse, civil unrest and violence against people of colour and women that lies outside their family bubble.Throughout the book, the author looks back at how her own mother was mothered, and how she went on to mother Bissell and her sister. How will her daughter feel when she reads these words  She hopes she knows that “becoming a mother is one of the most signicant facts of my le”.Memories of her own close family and her childhood are woven through the text, the lines demarcating past and present overlapping. Bissell and her husband live in the house she grew up in, so they brought their daughter home to the place she felt safe in as a child, echoes of her former selves in every nook and rickety floorboard.Bissell’s mother takes pains to remake a doll’s house that she gave her daughters when they were children. During the second phase of lockdown, she cleans and redecorates, waiting for the time when she can hire an electrician to wire up the lights that illuminate the little house she will pass on to her beloved, and very much missed, granddaughter.The streets of Glasgow provide constancy and reassurance as they shape-sht through the seasons, and while she feels she is “living a simulation of a le”, Bissell renders her home city, although at some points paused and waiting, in vibrant colour.My daughter is now the same age as Bissell’s was in March , when lockdown began. I cannot imagine having to contain the wilds of toddlerhood within four walls. Bissells daughter has spent more than half of her short le in isolation, when the bubbles she so loved to blow were replaced by one unseen, in which only she and her parents could exist. But now, as the edges of those memories start to fade, Bissell reminds herself of the “gt” of being able to share that time with her daughter.“We have done our best, but it is hard to feel it is good enough,\" she writes. Bubbles conveys the weight of parenting during the pandemic, but this is also a book about unswerving love, family, legacy, place and hope. A celebration and excavation of the state of motherhood, it is an unflinching account of one woman passing through some of le’s greatest transitions against the surreal backdrop of a global health crisis."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-no-matter-might-say-devo-max-just-isnt-going-happen","story":"If unionists had taken up Alex Salmond’s offer to place a third option on the  ballot , it would have won, but it is much less popular or credible now, as the Tories have opened our eyes to the reality of Westminster “sovereignty”.Westminster has acceded to Ireland’s right of self-determination with Labour neutral on Irish unication, while denying to Scotland the  year-old tradition of its sovereignty .

Well, devo max certainly wasnt included on the SNP manesto last May, when the party of independence won what Mr Macwhirter admits was a \"landslide victory\". And I can honestly say, hand on heart, that whenever Ive been out campaigning, I have never once met a voter who talked to me about devo max, and they are the people who really count.However, I have met voters who are disillusioned, angry, and want to kick themselves for swallowing Gordon Browns Vow and voting No in , resulting in Scotland being hauled out of the EU against our wishes and being stuck with treacherous Boris Johnson and his terrible Tories whom we never voted for and I detect a growing determination from the voters that they wont be taken for a ride again by politicians in thrall to Westminster, coupled with a growing realisation that only independence will deliver Scotlands future into Scotlands hands.Ruth Marr, Stirling.STURGEON NEEDS JOHNSON IN OFFICENICOLA Sturgeon calls for Boris Johnsons resignation after his Downing Street lockdown party last May. But really  Whatever she publicly states, she surely very much prefers him in situ Ms Sturgeon has long since struggled, using rational economic arguments, to persuade Scots that UK break-up would be beneficial. While many regard as risible the argument that disliking the Prime Minister du jour justies ending a -plus-year-old Union, anti-Boris sentiment seems pretty much all Ms Sturgeon has right now – the last thing she wants is him replaced by a less controversial figure.Martin Redfern, Melrose.EDUCATION PROBLEMS GO WAY BACKNEIL Mackay’s interview with Mr Neil McLennan made for a very interesting Big Read last Sunday .I believe most teachers currently practising in Scottish schools would applaud the last few paragraphs. These offered a vivid picture of the burdens carried by classroom teachers – particularly meaningless paperwork, the slogans and “corporate speak” which are often used to impose and enforce ill-considered, centralised innovations while disguising their frequent failures and their destructive waste of precious teaching and learning time.However, as a fairly modern commentator on Scottish education, Mr McLennan seems to have missed the point that it “was ever thus”. He made only a few selective references to past changes in Scottish education: the raising of the school leaving age in , the end of corporal punishment and Curriculum for Excellence. If, however, he delved more thoroughly into the last  years of centrally imposed changes – not least the Primary Memorandumand the horrendous Millennium chaos of Higher Still – he would surely see that our current dficulties of low educational morale are profound precisely because they have developed over such a long time.It will take very brave, honest, and determined collaboration from educationalists and politicians to define these problems, confront them and implement educational solutions. And, in my opinion, nobody has volunteered so far.Most teachers have their own particular concerns and Mr McLennan is entitled to his – although his conflation of what he calls “nationalism”, history lessons and attainment was beyond my understanding. As far as I know, the story of the st Highland Division in  at St Valery en Caux is presented by all historians as an example of ordinary soldiers’ nobility and courage in the midst of lethal chaos in  Glasgow University publicly apologised for its links to the slave trade and set up a reparative justice scheme with £ million.These examples certainly do not make the case for suggesting history teachers promote Scottish “exceptionalism” or for denying our children’s right to know all their nation’s history – good and bad. Providing an objective timeline of events would surely support understanding of time and place in other areas of the curriculum. However, whether Mr McLennan likes it or not, that timeline will include Wallace, Glencoe, Darien, Fletcher of Saltoun, Culloden and the aftermath, the Clearances and more modern events which might well arouse further anger. Editing such history, as I think he acknowledges in terms of Japan, won’t stop young people reacting to injustice and corruption or demanding change.Indeed, as he acknowledges that there could indeed be more lessons on Scottish history, Mr McLennan will need to investigate other reasons for our young people’s enthusiasm for Scottish independence. It could be, for instance, quite simply, current, rather than past, events. This is the Greta Thunberg generation who will make their own dramatic history as they tackle climate change, massive human migrations, environmental destruction, pandemic emergencies and the collapse of bioersity. Any review of educational policies and attainment needs to take account of what to offer them in terms of learning to cope with all of that.As pupils of the s and s my generation of teachers worked in Scottish schools from the s and survived many stormy changes. I can understand many of Mr McLennan’s frustrations, which are probably shared by most current teachers. I just think it is a shame his argument was dominated and confused by his references to his version of “nationalism”. Unlike Mr McLennan, I support independence for Scotland, but  improving educational attainment for every child is a separate issue.Frances McKie, Evanton.LODGE IS DOING A BORISI REFER to last week’s report about my efforts to secure a fair settlement for my community from the Masonic Grand Lodge of Scotland.The quote from Mr Semple, the Grand Secretary, about having no objection in principle, but hands being tied by issues of governance, is risible. The “laws” of GLS have no statutory basis and are purely self-devised and applied. To maintain that there is no measure of discretion available is simply another example of disingenuousness. It is in effect saying that our rules, which we made up, are preventing us from doing the right and honourable thing. They might have as well used the classic excuse that “a big boy did it and ran away”.They are in effect doing a “Boris” just brass it out and maintain that there is nothing to see here, and rely on flimsy excuses, which can then be repeated ad nauseum. End result is that they get away with “daylight robbery”, but can still sleep easily.Much has been said recently about the Masonic movement wanting to change its image, and here was a perfect opportunity to let actions speak louder than words. I genuinely have no hidden agenda. My concern was purely to attract inward investment to help prevent the recognised issue of rural depopulation. Instead GLS has walked off with the money, but is “sympathetic” to our plight.I would confirm that as Mr Semple stated, I do not represent anyone from the former Lodge Blackadder. Indeed the support of those lodge members was withdrawn only recently, after they had each been contacted by GLS staff.I can only hope that grass-root membership of GLS express their views about the disgraceful behaviour of their Grand leadership.Gerry McCann, Greenlaw, Berwickshire.WE NEED DEPENDABLE POWER STATIONSTHE UK Government needs to prioritise people’s needs for warm homes, affordable fuel and jobs over doubtful claims about the future of the planet . In any event, our climate change policy is pointless while the Chinese, Indians and others massively increase their burning of fossil fuels.Because we cannot store large amounts of electricity, we need real power stations, which are available whether the wind blows or not. In the short run, we will need to start building new gas-fired power stations.

It’s , of course.The film cuts to a woman athlete running, pursued by helmeted police. By contrast, she is in colour. She’s also wielding a large sledgehammer – she pirouettes and hurls it at the screen which explodes and everything goes to black. Up comes text and a deep male voice intones: “On January , Apple Computer will introduce Macintosh and you’ll see why  won’t be like .”It is one of the most famous advertisements in history, screened just once on national television for  million Americans watching that year’s Super Bowl. It announced the arrival of the machine which would change history, not just of the industry but our relationship with technology. The Macintosh – the Apple Mac – launched two days later, and brought personal computing to the masses.Child’s playIT was so easy to operate that a child could do it. “The big dference with the Mac was that a complete novice – indeed children – -year-olds, five-year-olds who had never seen a computer before – seemed to instantly and intuitively lunge for the mouse,” Dag Spicer, senior curator at the Computer History Museum in Palo Alto, Calornia, summed up.Before the Mac, computers were controlled in a language called DOS by obscure typed-in commands like “copy a: autoexec.bat c: windows”, the letters clicking onscreen in white or green on a black background. The industry was largely controlled by IBM – “Big Blue” – with its , IBM PC XT. At the cheap end there was the Commodore  gaming machine,batting a white, square ball off a digital wall can be considered a game.The -second launch ad was made by Ridley Scottand the symbolism, the subliminal message, was that the athlete – -year-old Anya Major – represented Apple, and Big Brother was the then-dominant IBM. But it nearly didn’t get shown. The Apple board was initially unwilling to fund the , spot in the showpiece football game and the company’s co-founders, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, had considered funding it themselves.Wozniak put it this way: “They didn’t like Steve’s [Jobs] personality. Steve would have a vision and they would fight it – they would have a dferent vision of their own. They just got tired of Steve calling them idiots.”Eventually, the “idiots” backed down and the ad ran.Scott the lotRIDLEY Scott was then the most famous and expensive hired hand making commercials. He would later become a director of blockbuster films including Alien and Blade Runner but he learned his skills in advertising.For the Apple shoot he demanded an actress capable of running up to a huge computer screen, turning and throwing the hammer convincingly at the screen. Most of the actresses at the casting call, in London’s Hyde Park, couldn’t do it. Indeed, one nearly felled a pedestrian with the hammer. But Major, who was a discus thrower as well as a model, won the role because she could.The shoot, on the outskirts of London, took three days and the drones, the grim marching men, were local skinheads paid  a day.They were trouble and on the third day they took to fighting and throwing rocks at each other, which didn’t phase Scott. He had what he needed. Two days after the Super Bowl ad the Mac was launched by Jobs to a packed audience in the De Anza College auditorium in Cupertino, still the home of Apple.Looking at footage now it’s almost like a revivalist meeting, with cheering crowds, people frantically waving arms, gasps, and minutes of applause as the boxy computer is pulled out of a bag by Steve Jobs, who powers it up.After the swelling music and a few images on the screen, a deep, computer-generated voice comes in: “Hello, I’m Macintosh. It sure is great to get out of that bag. Unaccustomed as I am to public speaking, I’d like to share with you a maxim I thought of the first time I met an IBM mainframe: never trust a computer you can’t lt.”The audience is frenziedly clapping and cheering. “Obviously, I can talk, but right now I’d like to sit back and listen. So, it is with considerable pride that I introduce a man who’s been like a father to me ... Steve Jobs.”Opening the GatesIN the packed audience, near the back of the hall, Bill Gates and a gaggle of Microsoft employees are sitting. They have the message. A year later, in , Microsoft launches the first version of Windows, having licensed some aspects of the interface from Apple.Three years later, with Windows soaring, Jobs and Apple filed a lawsuit claiming that the look and feel of their software had been copied. The action failed and, since then, graphical interfaces, pioneered by Apple, have become the standard for computers in homes and offices around the world.Jobs had brought in John Sculley from PepsiCo as chief executive and he was convinced to put around  million behind the launch of the Mac. It was a fateful mistake.Tensions between him and Jobs were evident so much so that the man who, with Wozniak, had started the company in his parents’ garage, joined the small team developing the revolutionary computer, almost as a side project to the main business of the company, which was then the more conventional machines.Jobs wasn’t just a visionary about computers. He realised that software, and particularly desktop publishing software, would be crucial to success. Adobe’s PostScript Page Description Language, which delivered a unorm computer publishing language and fonts, came with the Mac.A year after the hysterical launch in Cupertino, in January , Aldus’s Pagemaker debuted on the Mac, along with Mac Publisher and Ready, Set, Go. Jobs’s engineers had also been working on a laser printer and just weeks later the LaserWriter was introduced. Apple had almost single-handedly created the desktop publishing market. The Mac became the favoured machine of graphics departments, marketing isions, schools, small businesses, and book and newspaper publishers.The cult of JobsSTEVE Jobs’s relationship with Sculley was in meltdown, however, and in September  he left, having cashed in stock options of .m. He set up his own computer company, NeXT, which was not the success he imagined. But he did hit the gold seam and become a billionaire by investing in the struggling George Lucas start-up, Pixar Animation Studios, which became stratospherically successful with the film Toy Story.More than a decade later, in December , Jobs ed to the company he formed when he sold NeXT to Apple for m and, after the worst quarter results in its history, became first interim CEO and, shortly after, the permanent boss.The UNIX-based operating system he developed at NeXT laid the groundwork for the OS X operating system, which Apple continues to develop. The PowerBook, the iMac, the MacBook Air and clutch of computers followed and, in , the product which would take Apple to the top of the corporate ladder and become by far the richest company on the planet, the iPhone. Jobs died of pancreatic cancer in .Without him and the talking lb computer with the nine-inch screen he pulled out of the sack onstage almost  years ago, there would have been none of that."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com     \u003cpicture","title":"green-scotland-cop26-climate-investigation-full","story":"Our subscribers will get exclusive access as we look to answer the pressing questions in Scotlands climate crisis fight.As the COP conference looms on the horizon, we will leave no stone unturned in a bid to stimulate discussion and debate on this crucial topic.Find out more about our exclusive £ for two months offer here. From the hundreds of sites and big-name companies that broke environmental rules, to the most polluted streets in Scotland, readers can expect ground-breaking exclusives, in-depth analysis, and interactive content – as well as regular live videos, giving you the chance to speak directly with the award-winning reporters behind the stories.Here, you can find every article published in the week-long investigation so far - with this piece being updated daily with new exclusive stories.To make sure you do not miss out on the high-quality insight, join us today by taking out a subscription for just £ for two months here.More than  industrial sites across Scotland have been officially damned as “unsatisfactory” on pollution, according to data from the Scottish Environment Protection Agencyseen by The Ferret.Sepa assessed the environmental performance of two big oil companies, ExxonMobil and Ineos, as “very poor” in .

It is grievously unjust.”The speaker of  years admitted he was “a Marmite figure” but appeared to suggest that there had been hostility towards him because of his reforms to parliamentary procedure and attempts to modernise the Commons.The commissioner’s office has been contacted for comment.In a statement published by the Sunday Times, Lord Lisvane accused Mr Bercow of breaking a strict confidentiality requirement by choosing to speak out about the probe before the findings had been made public.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Dr Jaffa is essentially a spokesman and an apologist for the salmon farming industry.#It#s no coincidence that wild salmon stocks have collapsed in all areas of the northern hemisphere where open net salmon farming has developed.#Peter Cunningham, biologist with the Wester Ross Fisheries Trust, said: #It is the salmon farming industry#s inability to manage parasitic sea lice that is the major threat to wild salmon. It is a natural parasite but they multiply and become much higher in number on open cage salmon farms.#Sampling by the WRFT in the spring of  supports contention that cumulative levels of infective sea lice were again much too high between Skye and the mainland of Scotland to protect migrating post-smolt salmon within these waters in the next spring.#Salmon populations in rivers Applecross, Ling, Sheil, Glenmore, Glen Beag, Arnisdale, Broadford, Sligachan and many others around Skye are particularly vulnerable.#  "},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/258343311_483851062940065_6761478433370174788_n.jpg","title":"skyes mavis sails first tall ship at","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine, as part of the Greenock to Leith voyage last year.

So much of what we learn in terms of socialisation and relationships does not happen in a classroom but across all the other day to day activities and interactions that take place.“It is a huge issue. Our young people have lost a lot in terms of their formal education but for me, they have also lost a massive amount in terms of the other areas of development that their education brings.”Portree High School pupil Luke Eveling, who has published a book about facing mental health challenges as a teenager on Skye, believes the pandemic had taken a toll on his age-group.He said: #Lockdown and the pandemic more widely definitely had an effect on young people in school. A lot of my friends are finding it hard to cope with exams and more broadly the pandemic simultaneously. This has influenced how well they are doing at school.#I have a few friends who have turned to serious drug abuse as a way of coping with the combined pressure, and others have stopped going to school completely.”In April , Luke bravely shared his own challenges through his book ‘A Series of Essays About Mental Health’.Within the book, Luke, who lives in Broadford, wrote frankly about a wide range of issues including heartbreak, peer pressure, drug abuse, and suicide. at the time, Luke talked about being diagnosed with Asperger’s and coping with isolation during the pandemic.While last year Luke spoke warmly about the “overwhelming support” he had received from family, friends and the wider community after opening up about his own circumstances, he believed more support services should be made available to help other young people.He added: #There are some, but there just isn’t enough for everyone. Things like having a school counsellor sound good but just don’t seem to reach everyone who needs help.#Councillor Finlayson added: “We know the importance of mental health # people are nervous about the pandemic and have not been able to socialise as before. We already have and will continue to have a situation where some young people will really struggle to get back to being with their peers and to sustaining positive relationships.“Parents are rightly concerned. Their children are in a totally unique situation given the global scope of the pandemic and the impact it has had and will continue to have on how education is delivered.“Supporting all aspects of education in its widest form needs to be a priority for all levels of government from the UK Government to Scottish Government to local government.“We all need to realise that the young people who have been in schools for the last two years have been disadvantaged in many dferent ways.“We need to take account of this going forward in terms of additional resources and possibly a catch-up curriculum and perhaps even more importantly, support for all aspects of young people’s health and wellbeing including mental health.”Assessing the lay of the land in schools across the region, Councillor Finlayson said: “Within Highland we will be continuing to follow the rules and mitigation measures that were in place previously and have come from the Scottish Government # all these things masks in classrooms, social distancing, ventilation in classrooms, limiting contact with other year groups and classes as much as possible will continue. What the rest of the country will be expected to do.“Better ventilation is being encouraged in schools # but we must consider the time of year and the fact that some of the schools within the Highland Council are pretty antiquated and not in the greatest condition.“I am keen that schools should make decisions that suit their own circumstances # because each school is dferent.#"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/annie-johnston-with-John-Lorne-Campbell.jpg","title":"tobar and dualchais a visit to canna south uist and barra in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineI have drawn on an intermittent diary kept at the time, to help with my present memories of the occasions., was by any standard a memorable experience.Campbell, a leading Gaelic scholar already well known internationally, had from the s carried out ground-breaking fieldwork recording Gaelic oral tradition in the Hebrides and in Gaelic Nova Scotia.

Strangford Lough is a vital stopping off point as thousands comes to feed on its shores at low tide. Itrsquos an annual audio and visual spectacle that wildfowl expert Kerry Mackie never misses.As the woodlands burst into colour, songwriter Brigid OrsquoNeill draws inspiration before performing a secret gig at a small converted church on the shores of the lough.On a farm to the south tip of the lough, RSPB ranger Mark McCormick looks for endangered species like the yellowhammer. He explains how his work has helped him overcome PTSD which he suffered after witnessing a terrorist attack on Westminster Bridge in London.Around boats are being removed from the water and repaired, in Portaferry former ferry captain -year-old John Murray is getting his boat, the St Brendan, on to the quay for the winter, with the help of four generations of the Murray family.In the second episode, as winter approaches Hugh Thurgate is moving livestock between islands and Katy Bell from Ulster Wildle checks barn owl boxes at Mount Stewart. Bad weather is coming and preparations need to be made.As winter storms howl, Kenny Smyth makes sure the boats in his boatyard are secure, before retreating to his shed to work on Laragh, his beautul wooden River yacht. Working on the boat reminds Kenny of his father who established the yard after the war.Rough winter weather also gives Heidi McIlvenny a chance to search for shark egg cases, known by some as mermaidsrsquo purses. Strangford Lough provides habitat for sharks and rays and Heidirsquos work provides important research.At her farm near Greyabbey Kerry Angus looks forward to lambing and reflects how the care she provides for her flock is consistent with providing meat for the farm shop. Close by, Kerry Mackie is setting up traps for tagging oyster catchers.At Port Loughan farm, Katy is installing barn owl nesting boxes before the spring nesting season. Itrsquos been a long winter, but installing the boxes is a real sign that spring is on its way.In the third episode spring has sprung and there is new wildle arriving at the lough. As boat owners prepare for summer, Kieron Black says an emotional goodbye to Pavane, the boat owned by his late father, Brian Black, the environmental broadcaster and journalist who died in a tragic accident in Strangford harbour in .The fourth and final episode is set in summer, a busy season as humans and birds flock to the lough to enjoy its un-spoilt beauty and unique habitats.At Slievemoyle farm Mark McCormick from the RSPB is camping out for a dawn chorus survey. He is hoping he will hear the distinctive call of the endangered yellowhammer.Summers on Strangford lough mean long evenings stretching into glorious sunsets. In Portaferry four generations of the Murray family take the St Brendan out for an evening of fishing.Summer is regatta season on the Lough and a big moment for Kenny Smyth and his River class yacht. Itrsquos  years since the Rivers were built, and Kenny is hoping to wrestle a race trophy from his brother, Graham.Away from the buzz of summer activities, Katy Bell is hoping to find healthy barn owl chicks. Wet and extremely hot weather has meant most of the sites have failed this year, but a new site may have some healthy chicks.Out on the lough Kerry Mackie is counting greylag geese. Itrsquos important to monitor the populations as they can cause problems for farmers. Carrying out the counts reminds him of his deep family connections to the lough and a letime of memories.Kieron Black is also out snorkelling, remembering his father Brian.

Newcastle did not make things easy for the visitors and constantly remained a threat in attack with the experienced Neil Corr causing problems all afternoon.Celticrsquos Conaill Kerr had his headed goal chalked off after he was adjudged to have fouled custodian Canavan by referee Peter Kelly.Kerr was determined not to be deterred by this and went on a surging run in the next passage of play, dancing around the Newcastle defence to unleash a shot that just whisked wide of the post.This seemed to wake up the Seasiders, who forced Celtic to retreat into their own half largely in thanks to the midfield display of Peter Brannigan.Newcastle nearly had their momentum derailed when lsquokeeper Canavan misplaced a pass to the feet of Gibney, although the Celtic strikerrsquos snapshot landed safely back into the arms of the grateful number one.As the hosts went back on the attack, Richard McInerney combined well with Shane Kearney before the Newcastle number rsquos inviting cross into the box was punched to safety by Celtic lsquokeeper Nathan Curran.The following ten minutes of play consisted of both teams battling for possession in the middle of the park, where man of the match Corey McCartan was notably winning the lionrsquos share for his Celtic side.The Hoops almost doubled their lead when Jordan McCoubrey fired a cross into the Newcastle box where team-mate Gibney managed to poke his head in front of Canavan to round the lsquokeeper.However, with the angle at goal not in his favour, the Celtic number nine saw his effort sail across the line and eventually out for a throw-in. This signalled the last notable passage of play before the half-time interval.Celtic began the restart positively with the ball quickly making its way back to lsquokeeper Curran, who sent a cross field pass to the feet of Stephen Galbraith.The Hoopsrsquo midfielder played a cute first time pass to Gibney, who sumptuously back-heeled to team-mate McCoubrey for a shot on goal that resulted in a corner.Newcastle decided to fight fire with fire and went on the attack. In what was possibly another sign that it wasnrsquot to be their day, the hosts had appeals for a penalty waved off after Brannigan was met with a tackle that sent him to the floor inside the box.The Seasiders enjoyed a purple patch where they hit the visitors with wave after wave of attacks, although they couldnrsquot find the vital touch to put the ball in the net.Celtic lsquokeeper Curran was forced to clear his lines on multiple occasions, and to his credit, The Hoopsrsquo number one remained sharp and focused throughout the  minutes.Peter OrsquoHare and skipper Louis Brunsdon were pulling the strings for Newcastle, but their final ball was just off the mark in what was becoming an increasingly frustrating afternoon for the home side.As the playing conditions began to become increasingly worse, there was a bright light in Celtic youngster Eoin Kelly, who made an impactful appearance off the bench and slowly began to swing the momentum in favour of his side ndash largely also in thanks to team-mate McCartan overturning possession in midfield.Another Celtic substitute, Sean McMahon, forced Newcastle lsquokeeper Canavan to produce the save of the match after his left footed effort was erted outside the post by a spectacular acrobatic e.The resultant corner was met with a similarly impressive save from Canavan, who stopped a point blank flick on header from Kelly.Newcastlersquos purple patch had well and truly ended and this was signied further when Celtic doubled their lead through skipper Michael Rice.After a long ball into the box looped over the Seasidersrsquo defence, the ball rolled invitingly out for Rice to toe poke beyond the impressive Canavan with  minutes left on the clock.The home outfit were not one to give up and went in search of the goal that would set up a nervous last few moments for their opponents.Corr almost awarded his side this opportunity when the ball landed at the veteranrsquos feet with only Curran to beat.However, the stubborn Celtic custodian refused to be bettered and spread his six foot frame as wide as he could to narrow the target and deny the certain goal.Moments later, Celticrsquos Peter Casey was clattered in the middle of the park but referee Kelly waved on the advantage which turned out to be an important call.Megahey gathered the loose ball on the right hand side of the pitch, before squaring a pass to Gibney, who struck a curling effort into the top right corner of the net to round off the scoring.Resilient to the end, Newcastle launched one last attack in search of a consolation goal.Despite the ball hitting the Celtic post in the midst of a goalmouth scramble, Newcastle captain Brunsdon couldnrsquot supply the required rebound and the referee blew his whistle for the final time.After the contest, man of the match Corey McCartan gave his thoughts on his sidersquos performance and winning start to the year.ldquoAll of the boys worked hard, especially coming back from a few weeks off after Christmas, he said.ldquoIt was a hard game and everyone was still stf, so I think it was physically tough for both teams and the weather definitely didnrsquot help.ldquoNewcastle surprised me because of how sharp they were and how high of a level their fitness was, but we got the job done and are now focused on the next game.Newcastle: F Canavan, C Scott, S Kelly, D Allister, J Maginn, P Brannigan, P OrsquoHare, L Brunsdon , R McInerney, N Corr, S Kearney.Subs: D Rooney, C McMahon, C Morrison.Celtic Bhoys: N Curran, S Megahey, R Quinn, B Connolly, M Rice , C McCartan, S Galbraith, P Casey, J Gibney, J McCoubrey, C Kerr.Subs: R Fitzpatrick, E Kelly, S McMahon.Referee: Peter Kelly..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12_January2022_IrishStreet.jpg","title":"Downpatrick regeneration ‘offers some light’ for year  ","story":"A LOCAL politician has warned that  could be a dficult year for the economy.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran says he fears there could be job losses in the retail sector and has called on Newry, Mourne and Down Council to do all it can to provide support.He said the council should consult with the business community and also consider some form of rate relief.He said the economic situation had been exacerbated by the pandemic and urged the public to adhere to Covid regulations.ldquoThe virus has no respect for age or gender. We must abide by the rules in order we can bring the pandemic to an end as quickly as possible. There is no other way and we have to remain as safe as possible, he remarked.ldquoI fully appreciate the damage which the pandemic has done to the local economy and I fear that there could be job losses in .ldquoThe business community in Downpatrick and surrounding towns and villages needs help. Many business are struggling and will continue to struggle unless they are given support.ldquoNewry, Mourne and Down Council has a big role to play and should be doing all it can.ldquoThe council must examine all means at its disposal and also seek funding from the Stormont Executive. There is no time to waste and no stone should left unturned.Cllr Curran said one bright spot was the plans for the regeneration of Downpatrick.He looked forward to the completion of a pound, scheme to upgrade Church Street and called for the implementation of the much larger scheme for the redevelopment of the former police station site in Irish Street.ldquoWhile things may appear bleak, the regeneration of Downpatrick offers some light, he said.ldquoWe must also look at ways of providing support for our other towns and villages, including Ardglass where there are plans to carry out major improvements to the harbour.Cllr Curran added: ldquoWe are going through a period such as which we have have never experienced before.

Coastguards around the country are marking the th anniversary of the service dedicated to saving lives at sea. To mark the milestone,  throwlines - part of the standard lesaving kit - will be cast by coastguards around the country as a symbol of the services dedication“We have got a lot safer and our rescue capabilityand we are into technical rescue now.“We rely a lot more on technology as far as our communications are concerned, and the new technologies, as far as drones to assist in search and rescue and other unmanned vehicles , will be key moving forward.”Adding that volunteers and staff remain the most important element of the Coastguard, Mr Wright said: “We couldn’t do what we do without the volunteers who give up their time    days a year. Without that workforce we wouldn’t be able to undertake the search and rescue that we do.”Maritime minister Robert Courts said: “Congratulations HM Coastguard on their -year anniversary. I am immensely proud and humbled by the continued dedication and professionalism from the staff and volunteers which ensures everyone’s safety on our shores and around our coast.A Coastguard helicopter assists with an operation over Ballintoy“HM Coastguard is the backbone of our maritime sector and the nation is indebted to its incredible workforce which continues to deliver an exceptional service.”Claire Hughes, Coastguard director, said: “When you look at how we started and where we are now, it’s easy to celebrate the innovation and development that can be seen throughout the service.“And yet we are far more proud of the people, the volunteers and the staff who, throughout two centuries, have continued to strive to keep people safe at the coast and out at sea.“We always have and always will respond to those in distress.“While this milestone is an opportunity for us to look back with pride on what we’ve achieved, we have always looked to the future, and I’m proud that we continue to look for ways in which to improve and save lives.“I’m proud of the commitment, the dedication and selfless sacrice, and I’m proud of how the service has developed and continues to do so.”A Coastguard spokeswoman said innovation continues within the service, including a £ million upgrade to its national radio network and the introduction of electric vehicles to reduce its carbon footprint.She said: “With technology ever evolving, the service will continue to strive to be at the forefront of innovation to carry out its le-saving work.“The service continues to adapt to changes – in the last few years providing mutual aid and support during events and incidents to other emergency partners.“During the pandemic, coastguards supported the NHS, attended the G and COP in , and are called in to support during national emergencies including flooding or supplying water to stranded drivers.”Robert CourtsNHSCOP  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularAt least this newspaper puts the blame for the Troubles where it rightly lies — on the terroristsIN PICTURES: Service to remember Teebane victims  years onHenry McDonald: Boris Johnson gives a boost to Irish nationalists and Scots separatistsDate announced for funeral service for murdered primary school teacher Ashling MurphyTeebane anniversary: eight men slaughtered on way home from workMost PopularThe best soup makers : easy-to-use machines from Morphy Richards, Drew and Cole and Soup ChefBest home treadmills UK: stay fit and safe with an at-home treadmill from NordicTrack, JTX, DecathlonBest JD Sports Cyber Monday deals : up to % off, with deals on trainers, Gazelles, menswear, womenswearBest phone cases for iPhone  : which case provides best protection - reviews of Mous, Casely, Aspinal                        This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-gsNilK sc-bXTejn cGeDpV iufVtK\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperCoronavirusMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.Although his Unionist Party gained two seats in the -seat parliament, the campaign ided it into two factions. His ‘hardline’ opponents attacked him for failing to stand up to pressure from the Labour government at Westminster for ‘civil rights’ reforms. Two months later he resigned. Under pressure from Westminster, the reforms went ahead.As we approach the May  election, unionism again stands at a crossroads. Within the past year, both main unionist parties have replaced their leaders. They face immense challenges. Like O’Neill, they are squeezed between the expectations of their electorate and the demands of a national government pursuing broader priorities. Although they favour devolution, they cannot credibly argue that the  Agreement has delivered good stable governance. The Assembly has operated for only  of its  years, its ministers do not trust each other, and many voters question its value.The Assembly fails the most basic test for any democracy: there is no effective opposition. Simply by winning enough seats, the five largest parties carve up the spoils. DUP and Sinn Féin ministers stand accused of financial scandal, most obviously over the RHI affair, but the two dominant parties ‘oversee’ their own conduct through the Assembly committee system.Despite the lack of opposition, the Executive is highly unstable. Sinn Féin have shown that Semtex and Armalites are no longer needed to bring down Stormont: merely by threatening to withdraw, they wield a permanent veto over all policy decisions.If as the polls suggest they become the largest party after the election, they will select the First Minister. They would present this as another milestone in unionism’s retreat. Although first and deputy ministers have the same powers, both main unionist parties will likely use the threat of this outcome to persuade voters to vote for them.In this challenging context, unionism has to choose between two broad paths: to keep muddling on with a system which is clearly broken, or to grip the problem resolutely, demand changes in the Agreement, and make Stormont work well for most voters, irrespective of their community background.There are obvious advantages for the British and Irish governments and the Executive parties in doing nothing: nobody will be blamed and no sinecures will be lost. In time, however, events will likely force the pace of reform. It may soon suit Sinn Féin to collapse the Executive again or the election results may call into question the whole sectarian apparatus of community designation, cross-community voting and mandatory coalition.The Agreement requires key decisions in the Assembly — including the selection of first ministers — to be taken on a cross-community basis. This may have seemed sensible in , when it was widely accepted that the republican insurgency was best managed as a conflict between two national identity communitiesin a deeply ided society. But it is no longer appropriate.The electorate has evolved beyond these binary designations. In , % of respondents to the Le and Times Survey described themselves as ‘unionist’, % ‘nationalist’ and % ‘neither’. In , the corresponding figures were %, % and %. With a “neither” plurality, the argument goes, shouldn’t we have a ‘neither’ first minister The coming election might bring matters to a head. If most MLAs designate as ‘other’, rather than unionist or nationalist — mirroring their constituents — they would have a strong case for changing the rules. Otherwise the system would privilege single-community parties over those who prioritise reconciliation, which the Agreement ostentatiously encourages.The main ‘neither’ party — Alliance — is already committed to replacing community designation with a system of weighted majorities for defined votes and to forming coalitions voluntarily by negotiation after each election. So is the TUV, commonly misrepresented as the most ‘hardline’ unionist party. The leaders of the other two unionist parties have also indicated that they want eventually to move to a system of voluntary coalitions with an effective opposition. The strongest resistance comes from Sinn Féin, which claims that the proposed change would lead to its exclusion from government. It clearly doesn’t have much confidence in its ability to attract a coalition partner.Unionists might not immediately benefit: initially, such a reform would probably increase the influence of Alliance as a potential partner for parties from both traditions, as in Belfast City Council. But there is a broader pro-Union argument to be made: that the de-tribalisation of politics is an essential step in constructing the sort of inclusive Northern Ireland which will deliver lasting good government for most people here for the foreseeable future.Although a serious review of the Strand One institutions may be some time coming, unionists should prepare themselves to initiate it when the time is ripe, know what they want, and have a strategy for getting it. They should commit themselves to a Union based on equal citizenship and respect for ersity, in contrast to the ethnic singularity of Irish nationalism.Their message to the electorate should be that having celebrated its centenary, Northern Ireland has grown beyond the tribal politics of the nineteenth-century.Three more points. Firstly, as a signatory to the European Convention on Human Rights, the UK government recognises that everyone in the UK has the right to fair and consistent arrangements for law enforcement, free from political interference. This right was degraded for everyone in Northern Ireland by the concessions which Tony Blair gave the IRA during secret ‘peace process’ negotiations between  and .Such flagrant defiance of the essential principles of ethical government must not be permitted in future. The leaders of unionism must insist on equal citizenship within a consistent legal framework. Everyone in Northern Ireland has the right to be treated as full and equal citizens of the UK. This vital principle is degraded when the British government undermines the rule of law, treats Northern Ireland like a colony, fails to protect its borders or dilutes its constitutional status.Secondly, an immediate and challenging priority is to reverse the damage being done by the Northern Ireland Protocol, rashly and unnecessarily conceded by the UK government as the price of Brexit for the rest of the nation. Whatever their designation, Northern Ireland consumers are already having to pay higher prices for a more limited range of goods.The EU’s punitive control regime is impeding free trade between Britain and Northern Ireland, deliberately erting Northern Ireland’s trading relationships away from Britain, and subjecting Northern Ireland to a swathe of EU regulations over which its people have no say. In signing up for the Protocol, the British government has shockingly acknowledged that it has “subjugated” the Act of Union  — the constitutional basis for the Union – in response to wholly unreasonable demands from the EU.Finally, an overarching task for the leaders of unionism must be at every opportunity to challenge the  narratives of Irish nationalism: the illusion that the partition of Ireland was an historic injustice and the myth that from  to  unionists were uniquely sectarian in their treatment of their nationalist neighbours.Effective leaders must not just manage political problems but also celebrate the qualities of their people. One of the current priorities for Unionist leaders is to restore the reputation of a largely honourable community wickedly slandered.• Dr William Beattie Smith is a former civil servant and author of ‘The British State and the Northern Ireland Crisis -,’ published by the US Institute of Peace• Taken from ‘The Idea of the Union: Great Britain and Northern Ireland’ edited by John Wilson Foster  William Beattie Smith.

So it is an important element of our city le.”He added: “I know we have had some dficulties in the past with the Saint Patrick’s Day celebrations, but there is evidence that more groups are looking to become involved in this event.

It was a part of the annual events: the Rugby Schools Cup final was on Saint Patrick’s Day, some of the Irish regiments recognised it, indeed the Orange Order at one time recognised Saint Patrick’s Day.“So it is something I think we need to recover, and we need to encourage full participation in the Saint Patrick’s Day celebration. These developments in the council’s Cultural Strategy do provide for more outreach work, and for more development work. They provide for more longer term planning, and they will reap rich rewards, and create a truly inclusive celebration from which the city can benefit.”The council’s ten-year cultural strategy, “A City Imagining” outlines a new approach in delivering St. Patrick’s Day events from  onwards with a three-stage process being used to assess applications to deliver pilot projects this year.A council report recommends the commissioning of Beat Carnival and The Duncairn, to deliver pilot projects in March  with funding of £, and £, respectively.

There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThey set off along Highwalls Road in dry humid conditions to the Dinas Powys golf course, where a number of golfers were out enjoying the peace and quiet of the early morning before a short climb led them to the One o’Clock gate. Here the leader paused to explain that small leaved lime trees can be found in the adjacent wood, which denotes ancient woodland and also that this particular species of tree has never been found further southwest than Monmouth.Entering Park Wood the path between bare trees and over fallen autumnal leaves led them slightly uphill beside Beauville Wood for a circumnavigation of the pretty woodland to a site overlooking Michaelston. Once a pathway on the north eastern side of the wood led up to a summerhouse belonging to Cwrt yr Ala from where they would have enjoyed lovely views over their vast estate land.Exiting through a gateway there was a chance to examine a piece of rock containing crinoids which are marine animals and ancient fossils that predate dinosaurs by  million years and they are classed as plants not animals.A descent on a slippery and rocky track led them to a viewpoint complete with a wooden seat overlooking Cwrt yr Ala House away in the valley. Robert Rous owned Cwrt yr Ala in  and made many improvements to it and it remained within the family until the death of Georgina Anne Rous in . It then passed to Frances William George Gore, a nephew of the last male heir who preferred to remain in London, so he rented out the house to the renowned Cardf brewer W. H. Brain.Prior to  Mr Gore had tried to sell Cwrt yr Ala and the estate lands to Dr Iorwerth Cyfeiliog Peatewho was looking for a suitable place for the newly proposed Welsh Folk Museum to be sited. In fact Peate was later offered land at St Fagans by the Earl of Plymouth for free as the site and became its first curator from  to . During World War Two he was temporarily dismissed for being a pacist and a conscientious objector, but soon reinstated..removeRecent heavy rainfall had made the normal descent via the bridleway a bit like a slalom so instead they followed tracks through the lower part of the wood to join a farm track at the top end of the steep-sided and wooded Cwm George.A rough farm track brought them to the stone bridge over the fast flowing Cadoxton River and out onto Cwrt-yr-Ala Road for the short journey into Michaelston-le-Pit where they made their way to St Michael and All Angels, to view the ‘sporting side’ of the churchyard where the Brain and Merrett families are buried before partaking of refreshments.William Henry Brainwas an English first-class cricketer and footballer who was noted for being the only man to perform the ‘wicket keeper’s hat trick’ of three dismissals off consecutive deliveries and also John Patrick Brain, a Welsh cricketer and wicketkeeper. Sir Herbert Henry Merrett who owned Cwrt yr Ala was a footballer and referee and chaired both Cardf City Football Club and was president of the Glamorgan County Cricket Club despite being a busy industrialist and Chairman of Powell Dyffryn Ltd. Another gravestone celebrated the Reverend Henry Holmes Stewart, a Scottish clergyman who was a member of the Wanderers team that won the FA Cup in  which was the same year he was ordained as a priest.Then making their way through riverside meadows and across a wooden footbridge, the surrounding trees were bearing pretty yellow catkins as they climbed uphill, then down to re-cross the river into the muddy Millfields and make their way back across the golf course to their start.You can follow the group’s exploits at www.penarthramblers.wordpress or Facebook article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

And to just keep vaccinating people and thinking of doing it again to protect the population is, in my view, now a waste of time.”He argued instead for a “highly-focused approach” to vaccinate vulnerable people.Dr Dix said that even when the booster campaign was announced, he was “critical” of boosting everybody as he is not convinced “it was needed or is needed” for younger people.You should definitely vaccinate people, but you shouldnt revaccinate and revaccinate to protect them.Former chair of the Vaccine Taskforce Dr Clive Dix says NHS staff should absolutely not be mandated to get Covid boosters.@TomSwarbrick | #SwarbrickOnSunday pic nOpSRarCe— LBCJanuary , He added: “I think the thinking of the time was very much to stop infection and transmission where clearly these vaccines don’t do that.“We’ve seen that because we’ve seen these huge, huge levels of infection but what theydo do, and it’s absolutely clear, they stop people getting seriously ill and dying. % of the people who get seriously and dying are the vulnerable and the elderly, so they’re the ones we should focus on.”He said the Government should be “very focused” on how to educate themselves for the “future vaccination programme” next winter, arguing there should be a study to understand the status of the public’s immunity.“So, by next winter, we can really have a policy of vaccination that’s educated, using the right vaccines at the right time for the right people.”.push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Tory chairman says  usigns are encouraging u for ending Covid rules this month article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Daisy Dog AcademyFriday, th January , : pm  \"       \"  Yvonne MyersDogs’ physiology is not that far removed from our own, their brains are very similar with the two obvious exceptions, we have a much larger frontal lobe area of the brain than dogs which is where we process logical thought and they have a much larger olfactory bulb,  times bigger in fact where they process scent. When our dogs get stressed like us their sympathetic nervous system kicks in and that activates what we call the four Fs, standing for fight, flight, fool around or faint. This is a stress reaction, not dissimilar to our own. We have all heard of the fight or flight response.When a dog is on lead and they have lost the option for flight, this can mean a dog starts displaying what appears to be aggressive behaviour which is in fact all based on fear and stress. They are trying to be big and scary to scare away whatever it is that is scaring them. When we continue to move our dog towards the scary thing, we can damage our dog’s confidence in us as being there for them. This fight response is really their only option as they have no way of escaping.When a dog has a ‘reaction’ to an off-lead dog approaching them and making them feel scared the stress hormone Cortisol is released into their bloodstream along with Adrenaline and noradrenaline, so a huge cocktail of chemicals is released! It can take up to eight hours for the Cortisol to leave the dogs blood stream. That means in one walka dog is made to feel unsafe by an off-lead dog three or four times that is a huge amount for the body to deal with and they will take a long time to recover, the whole day in fact.That can mean that taking the dog out again on the same day will only result in more stress and distress for your dog which is not beneficial to their mental or emotional state. This is very dficult as an owner as you only want to take your dog out and let them have some time out enjoying the environment. If you have a happy go lucky dog that is allowed off lead, that is fantastic for you but, allowing your off-lead dog to approach an on-lead dog that is frightened is not only irresponsible as a dog owner, but it is rude. I have been with clients with dogs on lead in a park and had off lead dogs approaching and, in some cases, harassing the on-lead dog. Their owner has no control over that dog, and they either have made no effort to call them back even when asked to or they have advised me that the dog has no recall. You do not have exclusive rights to spaces to walk your dog. All dogs have the right to have a peaceful and relaxing walk without being approached with unwanted attention. As an owner of a dog that is fearful, they are doing their best to give their dog the best le possible, they are minding their own business with their dog on lead. As a dog owner you have a responsibility under the Dangerous Dog Act to be always in control of your dog in a public space, that is the law. This meansyou are unable to recall your dog or stop your dog from approaching on lead dogs then you should not allow them off lead until you have trained a solid recall. With so many dogs that were bought during lock down we have more and more dogs that are concerned and have higher levels of stress through no fault of their own. They were brought into a world where their socialisation was massively limited, and this has caused them to be more fearful. These dogs need our support, help and understanding. If you areof a dog that is finding the world stressful, be your dogs voice! If your dog has had a stressful interaction do not continue your walk, instead take them home and use their brain through training and using their nose, this will help to calm them and lower their blood pressure and reduce their heart rate. Continuing the walk may be counterproductive for your dog and your emotional state.Do not suffer alone, seek help from a professionalneeded. There are many highly qualied dog trainers who can offer you support and fantastic advice to make your le and your dogs as stress free as possible, but ensure you check their credentials as the dog training world is not regulated and anyone can call themselves a trainer. As the client it is your right to ask about their qualications, never be shy to check, you are doing it for your dog as well as for you.  \"       \"  ]]Most PopularLoughguile security alert still ongoing...NewsFactory worker loses licence for three year...NewsTeebane massacre th anniversary memorial service pictures...NewsMen met up to ‘sort out dferences’, court is told...NewsWitnesses sought after traffic collision...NewsMost Popular                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleYour Northern IrelandRecommendedMore from Northern Ireland WorldAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessArchiveSubscribeEventsPlace your AdReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-gsNilK sc-bXTejn cGeDpV iufVtK\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    News\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationEnvironmentPeopleRead ThisFootball\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      FootballIrish League FootballSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCarsFamilyRetroOpinionYour NI\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Your NI​Antrim and NewtownabbeyArmagh Banbridge and CraigavonBelfastCauseway Coast and GlensLondonderry Derry City and StrabaneLisburn and CastlereaghMid and East AntrimMid UlsterFermanagh and OmaghNewry Mourne and DownArds and North DownMust ReadContact usAdvertise My BusinessFollow us      "},{"url":null,"title":" rare breed farming families to meet as popular utv series returns ","story":"Man ran off at car park with stolen goods in shopping trolley   Dashcam footage sought of Larne hit-and-runNewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationPeopleEnvironmentRead ThisFootballIrish League FootballSportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCars FamilyYour NIRetroOpinionAdvertise My BusinessNewsPeopleLibby Clarke, a mum-of-two from the Mageralin area, rears award-winning beef Shorthorn and Charolais with her daughter Lucy.
