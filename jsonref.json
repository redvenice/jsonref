There is even a 38-stop route des fromages through the region, with road signs featuring cheese wheels directing drivers to 38 dairies and farm producers that make some of the country’s finest cheeses. Among the area’s most recognised contributions to French fromage are its blue cheeses of these, probably the best known to people in the UK is Saint Agur. This rich, tangy cheese is made in Beauzac, located beside the Loire in the Haute-Loire department, south-central France. It’s a “pretty, medieval village”, says Saint Agur’s fromagerie director Ludovic d’Eysmond, who describes a picturesque scene, where a church and ramparts “create a beautiful square in the centre of the village”. All of its milk comes from within 45 miles of the village, largely from farms in nearby hamlets, nestled on the side of the dormant volcanoes that are characteristic of the area’s terrain. Milk is provided by Montbéliarde cows, a breed prized among French cheesemakers because the protein levels of their milk produce higher yields of cheese than milk from other cows. They graze outside every other day, weather permitting. The heritage of Auvergne’s blue cheese dates back to the mid-1850s, when a local cheesemaker noticed the tastiness of the blue mould that would sometimes appear on his cheese curds. After experimenting, he realised that if he injected the mould, it would cause veining throughout the cheese. All of the area’s cheeses have characteristics that make them stand out inidually. Saint Agur is prized for the way it balances tangy notes with creamy, almost mushroom-like richness, whereas others are known for flavours that range from grassy notes that are almost woodlandy, through to borderline spiciness in some of the more powerfully moulded offerings. But one thing many of Auvergne’s better cheeses have in common is that they are ripened in some form of underground caves Saint Agur, for instance, spends 10 weeks in Beauzac caves. The rocks that create those special flavour-maturing conditions are largely volcanic, created by the dormant giants now covered in pasture that the cows graze upon.

Another area where fungi, particularly moulds, are important is in the production of popular foods. Soy sauce, fermented meats and cheeses are just some of the foods that owe their existence to mould. But it is in cheese, especially blue cheese, that mould plays its most recognised and, arguably, delicious role. The origins of blue cheese are vague, but the story goes that, in the seventh century, a shepherd in the southern French village of Roquefort (literally meaning “strong rock”) left his lunch of bread and sheep’s cheese in a cave when distracted by a local girl he saw in the distance. Many months later, the same shepherd apparently stumbled on his abandoned meal only to find it contaminated with Penicillium roqueforti, a mould that grew within the cave’s soil. It is not clear why the shepherd decided to consume his rediscovered meal, but since then Penicillium roqueforti has become a mould typically used in many blue cheese varieties, especially Saint Agur. The origins of blue cheese may be a myth, but the science of how Penicillium roqueforti is responsible for the flavour of Saint Agur and all other blue cheeses is just as fascinating as any legend. What is mould? As with other fungi, mould is found in natural environments that are damp and rich in nutrients (forest soil, wood and, of course, caves). Moulds are decomposers, which means they break down organic materials that other species, such as invertebrates, struggle to digest. In doing so, they release into the soil soluble nutrients that plants and trees use to grow. Unlike plants, mould does not reproduce through seeds but rather spores, the dusty stuff that appears on top of mould, which floats through the air when released and begins to germinate when the microscopic particles land in hospitable environments. The spores then produce interwoven, thread-like structures known as hyphae, which become what are called mycelium when massed together. Mycelia are considered single organisms, but they can stretch underground for considerable distances. In fact, recent research has shown that the mycelia of some fungi form symbiotic relationships with plant and tree roots, resulting in underground networks where the host plants can exchange nutrients, water and information. These networks are called mycorrhizae and are often likened to the internet and have been called the “wood wide web”. Their existence is forcing the scientific world to rethink their understanding of plants more generally. Penicillium roqueforti is part of the same genus (Penicillium) as the key mould species used in many modern antibiotics. First identified by the Scottish bacteriologist Sir Alexander Fleming as a potential agent in the fight against infection in 1928, it took another 10 years for a team of scientists at the University of Oxford to develop the world’s first antibiotic compounds from moulds such as Penicillium chrysogenum (sometimes known as Penicillium notatum) and Penicillium rubens. The mould itself does not kill bacteria but produces penicillin as a natural product, which attacks the cell walls of a wide range of bacteria. So what does this have to do with cheese?To create blue cheese, there are a variety of methods used by cheesemakers for different cheese types. Some still rely on mother nature and simply age their cheese in clement environments where the mould will naturally infect the wheels. Saint Agur, for instance, matures for 10 weeks in caves to allow for the mould to grow and give Saint Agur its unique taste and texture. Most manufactures, however, introduce powdered Penicillium roqueforti cultures to the cheese milk before the milk is coagulated and the curd is separated from the whey. Once the cheese has been moulded into shape, it is left to mature. It is at this point, in the early stages of the maturing process, that stainless steel rods are forced into the cheese to permit exchange between oxygen from the air and carbon dioxide produced by the mould in the cheese’s interior. This encourages the growth of mould and gives rise to the characteristic blue-green veins that run through this type of cheese. It is the presence of the mould and the enzymes it produces that are responsible for the colour, flavour and texture of the cheese. The mould raises the acidity (pH level) of the cheese, which changes its texture and flavour, while also breaking down proteins in the cheese to give it a softer, creamier consistency. The moulds also have a strong lipolytic action that breaks down fats, producing fatty acids, known as ketones, that give the cheese its rich flavour and powerful aroma. So next time you reach for some Saint Agur, remember that the mould has put a lot of work into making it the ideal companion for your crackers.

The only time that figure has ever been marginally higher was just before the global financial crash in 2008. Those who have managed to hoick themselves on to the ladder think they’re the winners in a fiendish game of skill and chance. Compared with tenants, who pour their wages indefinitely down the drain of the rentier economy, mortgage-holders do seem well blessed. Yet the scale of debt puts mortgage-holders in a state of indentured servitude which, if we could only stop blinking at our own good fortune for a second, we might object to. The ideal citizen for the age is the one who bought their house in January 1958, paid off their mortgage decades ago, and is now sitting on millions. This is why we’re all supposed to rail against boomers (though technically people in this position, now in their 80s, are part of the “silent generation” that preceded boomers), but you can bet that they’re spending all that hard-earned leisure worrying about their children and grandchildren. The world we’re accelerating into is working for landlords and for banks. Or to put that more simply, for capital alone. Of course there are solutions to all of this – there are answers that worked in the past, otherwise we’d all be paying rent to the Duke of Westminster – and answers for people with a supply-side fetish (build more social homes). There are answers that solve other economic and environmental crises (bonds for energy-neutral homes, cooperatively owned housing) and answers that might sound radically, dangerously redistributive, if you’re an overlord in 1691 (the land value tax). It is not beyond our collective wit to make secure, affordable, decent quality housing accessible to all, but our political culture is putting up one last defence against thinking seriously about change. If politicians can inflate what is essentially a rather plodding, earthbound struggle between capital and labour into a clash between generations, and keep that balloon in the air long enough, they might just distract us from the possibility of any practical solution. But pitting one age group against another has a hard limit, a point at which this deadlock simply offends one’s natural sense of justice. The aftermath of the pandemic may be that boundary. Throughout 2020, pointing out what vast sacrifices the young were making for the old tended to be an anti-lockdown position. Since the alternative to lockdown was mass death, it just wasn’t a very fruitful line of inquiry. Yet we’re now at the stage of reconfiguring previous norms, and we’re still having debates about housing and so much more as if the under-35s were irrelevant. We talk about the return to the office as if the debate is simply about balancing the interests of the worker who’d prefer to be at home against those of the chief exec of Pret a Manger. Our new word for whatever compromise may emerge is the “agile” workplace, which sounds great. Middle-aged people love agility: it reminds us of the 90s. But there’s no obvious consideration here of what the office represents to those at the start of their careers. It’s not just a commute and a frothy coffee. It’s where you learn and progress and build your skills, hard and soft, and get away from your crappy flat where you’re working on an ironing board. Meanwhile, the vaccination passport debate unfolds as a matter of civil liberties – can the state compel you to take a vaccine, with the reward of everyday freedoms? This doesn’t acknowledge the generation that has yet to be even offered a vaccine. Housing, work and health all seem like disparate issues, but once a generation is etched out of one of these spheres, they can be steadily erased from others. When you’re no longer considered a stakeholder, you’re a nuisance. The young have become the pigeons of the public realm, only remarked upon for their poor mental health or when they leave litter in a park. As a discourse, it’s untenable and ridiculous: but it’s only from a position of middle-age that I can admire its absurdity. If I were in my 20s, I’d be about ready for a revolution.

However, the travel industry was disappointed with the lack of clarity on whether holidays will be allowed from 17 May, the date by which the government said it was aiming to restart international travel. The government will bring in a “traffic light” system to allow travel to some lower-risk countries. Travel to and from “green” countries will be allowed with no quarantine requirement, although coronavirus tests will still be mandatory before and after travel. Johnson did not provide any details on which countries would probably be “green” or whether any holidays would be allowed from 17 May. Addressing the likelihood of international travel in a press briefing on Monday evening, Johnson said: “We are hopeful that we can get going from 17 May, but I do not wish to give hostages to fortune or to underestimate the difficulties we are seeing in some of the destination countries.” Heathrow airport’s chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, said it was “disappointing that the opportunity has been missed”. He said: “A clearer timeline for the return to international travel is needed.” Mark Tanzer, the chief executive of the Association of British Travel Agents, welcomed the government’s plans to bring in a traffic light system, but said the requirement for testing for green destinations would put off would-be travellers. “A priority for the industry is a more stable system which avoids the situation of last summer, where travel to many destinations was quickly turned on and off,” Tanzer said. “Destinations should not be suddenly closed off unless variants of concern dictate that this must happen.” The Prospect trade union, which represents aviation professionals, said the industry needed certainty. “Aviation needs months to plan for restart, allowing passengers to book, and skills to be supported in areas like air traffic control,” said Mike Clancy, Prospect’s general secretary. “We needed certainty and a promise of additional support, but instead we have more delay and vague allusions to something in the future.” Lobby groups representing airlines and airports also raised concerns over the continued need for testing before travel to “green” countries. Other parts of the economy will be given the go-ahead to restart, with up to 402,000 non-essential shops, 7,000 gyms and leisure centres and 21,000 personal care premises eligible to be open from 12 April, according to Altus Group, a property adviser. “That first pint back in the beer garden is going to be a special moment,” said Emma McClarkin, the BBPA’s chief executive. But the group had “deep concerns” over government proposals to introduce vaccine passports and possibly ask landlords to bar those without evidence of a vaccine or a test. Johnson said there was no plan to introduce the Covid-19 certificates at the pub door even after 17 May, when punters could be allowed back inside English pubs. Bans on taking payment at the bar were “completely unfair and illogical”, given that cafés did not face the same restriction, added McClarkin."},{"url":null,"title":"cities emptied by covid perfect for modern flaneur baudelaire","story":"But even in a ghost city, it’s possible to think and walk like a flâneur. Rainer Hanshe has translated several of Baudelaire’s books into English – including Belgium Stripped Bare, about the French author’s visit to Brussels just before it was struck by a cholera epidemic. He notes: “The flâneur is a figure who, while immersed in the urban throng, is simultaneously separate from it. If more empty than not, our streets are still to some degree populated, and we can engage in the form of communion that Baudelaire referred to as a mysterious intoxication.” This involves trying to get inside the heads of others – an act of ecstatic empathy that “peoples” the solitary walker’s imagination. It’s a radical idea that envisions the mind as a sponge or, perhaps, a social media channel. Baudelaire’s most memorable phrase for the flâneur was “a kaleidoscope gifted with consciousness”. Some of his ideas need updating. The flâneur might be “a prince enjoying his incognito wherever he goes”, but what about the princesses? Prof Janet Wolff of the University of Manchester has written of the “invisible flâneuse”, of “respectable” women’s absence from public arenas in modern cities. In her 2016 book Flâneuse: Women Walk the City (Penguin, £8.99), Lauren Elkin calls for women to take to the streets, following the example of radically reflective female walkers from Virginia Woolf and Jean Rhys to Rebecca Solnit. The German philosopher Walter Benjamin expanded Baudelaire’s ideas about the flâneur, adding to the myth of Paris as the archetypal modern metropolis. Some of TS Eliot’s poetic evocations of London sprang from his readings of Baudelaire. But one can roam and ruminate equally in Cardiff, Dundee, Liverpool or Belfast. As urban consumer culture spreads, in the shape of delivery vans, Deliveroo bikes, “artisan” coffee shops and the like, you can arguably be a flâneur (there’s also a verb, flâner, to stroll) in towns, villages and countryside. But to do so requires discipline. Here are 10 Baudelairean suggestions for exploring the ghost city. In his poem Le Soleil, Baudelaire writes of “Stumbling on words as on cobblestones”. To say we should treat the city as a text sounds pretentious, but not if we think about street names, tree species and the colours of the brickwork, and unearth forgotten plaques and historic sites. The plaque for Tyburn gallows at Marble Arch is close to a heavily trafficked spot, but few stop to study it. Even famous monuments can be looked at from new angles. Baudelaire wrote about marble statues as if they were sentient. What emotions do they stir in you? Who might have been here before you? For some translators, “idler” is the best equivalent of flâneur. Ambling is best enjoyed slowly, daydreaming. “A dandy does nothing,” Baudelaire wrote. The pandemic-struck city, with its permanent Sunday-state, is ideal for leisurely meandering. Use it while it lasts. Noctambulism is a magical pursuit, as we swap sleep and ordinary dreams (or those garish ones we’ve all been having during lockdowns) for the dreamscape of the city. Artificial light, the absence of others, prowling foxes and the mystery of shadows recast familiar places as strange and special. To see the everyday anew is the ultimate goal of flânerie. If there’s one thing that kills the art of flânerie, it’s the smartphone even worse are apps that count steps. Why look down when you can look up and about? If you want a soundtrack to walk to, visit the University of Birmingham’s Baudelaire Song Project and pick a slow-tempo chanson. The grand iron-and-glass arcades of Paris inspired Walter Benjamin, who was fascinated by the well-stocked magasins, the “temples” of capitalism. Window-shopping has not been banned, and you can still read the signage, promises, buildings, fashions. We are witnessing the gradual abandoning of the arcades Benjamin would have been spellbound. Even Liverpool One, opened in 2008, suddenly seems old and semi-redundant. Cafes shut? Pubs shuttered? There are always benches and steps, parks and plazas, as well as doorways to loiter in. There’s no shame in sitting. In his dazzlingly erudite book, The Walker: On Finding and Losing Yourself in the Modern City (Verso), Matthew Beaumont makes a convincing argument that convalescence – the state between health and illness – is the perfect mode for discovery as it makes us raw and sensitive but also disconnected. If you’re recovering from coronavirus, you may actually be convalescing. As Covid-19 recedes, our cities are convalescing, too. Philosopher Guy Debord, who described walking as a dérive (drift), was influenced by the surrealists, who used chance and games to develop new ideas and perspectives. One of Debord’s friends walked through a region of Germany following a map of London. Why not walk around an empty Manchester using a cut-up map reassembled at random? In his 1989 book Panegyric, Debord recounts wandering around Europe’s great cities trying different alcoholic drinks, including pints of mixed (half-mild, half-bitter) in England. How about a hip flask of absinthe in Aberdeen? In 1955, Debord developed the idea of psychogeography, which was later taken up by Iain Sinclair, Will Self and others. The Paris of Baudelaire and Benjamin is long gone. A flâneur today has to reckon with traffic, overtourism, selfies “in Sartre’s favourite cafe” and soulless spaces like La Défense. The emptying of our cities, and their reinvention post-pandemic has every chance of being an improvement on the hyperinflated housing, glass-and-steel phallocentricity, pseudo-public piazzas and rank consumerism of the late-20th-century metropolis. Perhaps we are ambling into a brighter future? Stockton-on-Tees’ projected giant green space, which will replace high street shops and provide residents with a wonderful patch of rus in urbe when it opens in 2025, harks back to the Victorian era of city parks. Baudelaire writes of Paris’s chiffoniers or ragpickers, marginalised proto-recyclers of the city that ignores and shuns them. Benjamin developed this into the idea of poet-as-ragpicker. The ragpicking flâneur can construct his mental collage from the messy, chaotic, ugly, dirty discarded things found around the city. Dustbins and gutters can tell us more than museums. Keyworkers – including refuse collectors – see more of the “real” city than most. UK cities have some of the most extensive and storied post-industrial landscapes in the world, and most are to be found far from honeypots and theme-park “historic centres”. Baudelaire was not the first – or the last – wandering philosopher-writer. He took key ideas from Edgar Allan Poe, and authors as varied as Charles Dickens, Marcel Proust, George Sand (cross-dressing to penetrate male-dominated milieux), James Joyce, Jorge Luis Borges, Franz Hessel, Ralph Ellison and Edmund White have contributed to the tradition. The flâneur appears in paintings by many artists, including Degas and Manet (while Edward Hopper painted like one), and can be seen ghosting through the work of film-makers such as Agnès Varda and Patrick Keiller. Much of the best travel writing benefits from a quizzing gaze, intellectual restlessness and a degree of distance – see Caryl Phillips’ The European Tribe. The empty city is waiting to be filled with new words."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/766bd31fcc0f559cf2b2d10640e6b32efb3fe551/0_223_4285_2572/master/4285.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=ffd80cacc9b42ec0aa566fc93ad97b9f","title":"vladimir putin passes law that may keep him in office until 2036","story":"The Russian president signed the legislation on Monday, ending a year-long process to “reset” his presidential terms by rewriting the constitution through a referendum-like process that his critics have called a crude power grab. Putin has been Russia’s most powerful politician since he assumed the presidency in 2000, after the resignation of his predecessor, Boris Yeltsin. If he remains in power until 2036, his tenure will surpass even that of Joseph Stalin, who ruled the Soviet Union for 29 years, making Putin the longest-serving Moscow leader since the Russian empire. Officially, the new law limits Russian citizens to two presidential terms in their lifetime, outlawing the kind of shuffling between the presidency and the role of prime minister that Putin employed earlier in his career. But the law specifically does not count terms served until it entered into force, meaning that Putin’s past four terms (including the current term) do not count and he can still serve two more. Russians say that he has “zeroed out” his terms. Analysts have said the law may not indicate that Putin wants to remain president, but simply wants to avoid being a lame duck and provoking a power struggle during his last term in office. However, Putin has made a habit of remaining in power at every moment he could have bowed out and anointed a successor. Some believe he has not found a way to transfer power and ensure that he and his family would remain safe in his retirement. The new law also gives him and former president Dmitry Medvedev lifetime immunity from prosecution. After serving his first two terms in office, Putin assumed the post of prime minister in 2008 due to term limits but nonetheless remained the country’s de facto leader. He returned to the presidency in 2012, provoking protests among his critics on the left and right that were put down harshly. Presidential terms have also been lengthened to six years. Putin’s current term will expire in 2024."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f844842ad831225372df7e8841f2422af91f6454/94_0_1050_630/master/1050.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=7d6934abd8bdece72a52cd20a1ef29c6","title":"coronavirus live news indian states call for people under 45 to be eligible for vaccine cases rising in japan","story":"Read more here: Why cities emptied by Covid are perfect for modern flâneurs News channels showed voters wearing masks as officials carried out temperature checks and tried to maintain physical distancing in lines. Modi on Twitter requested people, particularly young voters, “vote in record numbers,” as the polls opened in Assam, West Bengal, Kerala and Tamil Nadu states and the federally administered territory of Puducherry. Associated Press note that the vote comes as as coronavirus cases in India are rising faster than anywhere else in the world. The results will not be declared until 2 May. The latest surge in infections is worse than the last year’s peak. India now has a seven-day rolling average of more than 73,000 cases per day and has reported 12.7 million virus cases since the pandemic began, the highest after the United States and Brazil. The government has intensified its vaccination drive in recent weeks, but despite restrictions on exporting doses, the shots have been slow to reach India’s nearly 1.4 billion people. Experts say the surge is blamed in part on growing disregard for social distancing and mask-wearing in public spaces. While on the campaign trail, politicians have been criticised for often showing little regard for social distancing and attending mammoth gatherings with tens of thousands of maskless people.Though most Australian states have allowed quarantine-free visits from New Zealanders for months, New Zealand has continued with enforced isolation for arrivals from its neighbour, citing concern about small Covid-19 outbreaks. The move to allow cross-border travel is one of the first such agreements since the pandemic prompted countries to block foreign arrivals to stop the virus spreading. Professor Sir Mark Walport, a former chief scientific adviser to the Government, said “very good progress” was being made on the roadmap out of lockdown, but that a third wave was possible if the brakes are taken off completely. It comes after a paper from experts at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine suggested that lifting restrictions in the next stage of the road map “may lead to a small surge of cases and deaths”. And their modelling suggested that stage four in June, when restrictions are expected to be lifted completely, could “lead to a larger surge of cases and deaths comparable to that seen during the first wave”. “I don’t expect we will have a resurgence of the same scale that we saw in January. So then there needs to be some very serious questions asked. If we do see a rise in cases, if we do start to see hospital occupancy go up a little bit, are we going to put in controls or is it something that we’re just going to try to manage with local testing and so forth? “I think that’s the question the Government are going to potentially have to answer as we get towards the summer.” He also compared the situation of the UK with that in France, saying “we’ve only got to look across the Channel and see that France currently has over 39,000 new cases a day, so the virus is still very much around and if we take all the brakes off, then it’s quite clear that there is a very substantial risk of a further wave of infection.”“It will be in deployment around the third week of April in the NHS and we will get more volume in May as well,” he told the show. “And of course more volume of Pfizer and OxfordAstraZeneca and we have got other vaccines. We have got the Janssen - Johnson and Johnson - vaccine coming through as well. “So I am confident that we will be able to meet our target of mid-April offering the vaccine to all over-50s and then end of July offering the vaccine to all adults.”Reuters report that Michigan on Monday reported a record number of daily coronavirus cases. The state reported 11,082 cases, bringing the total to 779,974, surpassing its previous peak of 10,140 on 20 November. Daily deaths increased by 23 to 17,282. Local media report that there is hope that expanding vaccines will result in better numbers next month. “We have to keep an eye on these numbers, we know that and we’re watching them very closely. But again with all the metrics working together we believe at this point we can continue on a vaccine strategy while maintaining all of the limitations that we have in place,” said Michigan Department of Health and Human Services director, Elizabeth Hertel. Senior public health physician Natasha Bagdasarian told Fox 2 Detroit that the state is encountering its third wave and it’s similar to what happened in November and December. They hope the bats will help in predicting the dynamics of a coronavirus outbreak by analysing factors such as climate, temperature and ease of spread. He said a Government paper published yesterday permits shops and pubs to ask whether someone has been vaccinated as a condition of entry. “The Government just need to clear this up because they’re creating confusion,” he told Sky News. “I do think it is discriminatory to say to somebody here in Leicester that you cannot go into Next or H\u0026ampM unless you produce your vaccination status on an app, unless you produce that digital ID card. “I don’t think that is fair. Now if ministers are saying, that is not what the policy is then they have to explain why does the policy document they produced last night permit that scenario?”, he asked, according to a report from PA.  “So, there’s a lot of confusion out there. I just want ministers to be honest and straight with us and tell us exactly what their policy proposals are.” Earlier this morning, vaccine deployment minister Nadhim Zahawi told Sky News: “Domestically … there will be absolutely no issue around pubs or restaurants requiring any form of certification” during the next stages of easing lockdown in England.Read more here: Hindustan Times – Starting today, night curfew in Delhi from 10pm to 5am amid rising Covid casesThis morning, however, Dr Mike Tildesley has been on the radio saying that there could be some arguments for lifting restrictions in the roadmap sooner. Tildesley is a professor of infectious disease modelling at the University of Warwick and a member of the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Modelling group (SPI-M) of the UK’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE).  He told LBC: “I was really pleasantly surprised that when schools open we have managed to keep things in check, so I think... if these numbers keep going down over the next few weeks there certainly is an argument to say ‘well actually we’re doing really well with the road map, it could be sped up.’ “I would say I would want to be a little bit cautious over the next few weeks as we get beyond this April relaxation to monitor that just to be really sure that cases are continuing to go down.” PA also quote him as saying: “Now I will say that if things keep going down at the rate that they are then there certainly is an argument for speeding up the process, but we do know that the later relaxations, particularly the May one when people can stay in each other’s homes for the first time for a long period of time, we might expect that could cause a... quite significant rise in mixing and potentially a rise infections which is why this monitoring is really needed.”Step two of the English roadmap will see shops and pub gardens reopen next week, while the reopening of indoor hospitality venues in step three is slated for 17 May. “Domestically, the step two, which we’re coming up to, and step three, there will be absolutely no issue around pubs or restaurants requiring any form of certification,” Reuters report Zahawi saying. “But it’s only responsible as we see how this virus behaves, as we see how other countries are utilising technology to make sure that they keep the virus under control, then we should look at the same thing.” Zahawi said the issue of vaccine certification throws up “difficult questions”. In another media appearance on a busy morning for the minister, he said that parliament would vote on the issue before any type of vaccine passport would be enforced. Authorities had pledged to administer at least 4 million first doses of the vaccine by end-March, but could only vaccinate 670,000 after the European Union blocked AstraZeneca vaccine exports to Australia in the wake of the drugmaker’s failure to meet its shipment pledge to the bloc. “We were scheduled to have received over 3 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine from overseas by now, which have not arrived in Australia because of the problems with shipments that we’ve seen happening here and in other parts of the world,” acting chief medical officer Michael Kidd told Sky News. Australia began vaccinations much later than some other countries due to low case numbers, recording just under 29,400 Covis-19 cases and 909 deaths since the pandemic began. But the AstraZeneca dose delay leaves it struggling to step up the pace of its vaccination drive. The majority of Australia’s near 26 million population will be administered the AstraZeneca vaccine, with 50 million doses set to be produced locally from the end of March. About 2.5 million doses have been locally produced so far with thousands of doses already cleared testing and distributed to the vaccination sites. The Pharmacy Guild of Australia, tasked to help with the rollout of the nationwide inoculation programme from May said on Tuesday that slow domestic vaccine approvals and logistics issues will now push deliveries to June. Pharmacy Guild president Trent Twomey told Reuters he also blamed the slow rollout on a lack of co-ordination between the Australian national government and states, with the latter complaining about slower-than-expected distribution and a lack of certainty on vaccine supplies.At the end of 2020, there was a strong hope that high levels of vaccination would see humanity finally gain the upper hand over Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. In an ideal scenario, the virus would then be contained at very low levels without further societal disruption or significant numbers of deaths. But since then, new “variants of concern” have emerged and spread worldwide, putting current pandemic control efforts, including vaccination, at risk of being derailed. Put simply, the game has changed, and a successful global rollout of current vaccines by itself is no longer a guarantee of victory. No one is truly safe from Covid-19 until everyone is safe. We are in a race against time to get global transmission rates low enough to prevent the emergence and spread of new variants. The danger is that variants will arise that can overcome the immunity conferred by vaccinations or prior infection. What’s more, many countries lack the capacity to track emerging variants via genomic surveillance. This means the situation may be even more serious than it appears. As members of the Lancet Covid-19 Commission Taskforce on Public Health, we call for urgent action in response to the new variants. These new variants mean we cannot rely on the vaccines alone to provide protection but must maintain strong public health measures to reduce the risk from these variants. At the same time, we need to accelerate the vaccine program in all countries in an equitable way.

Photograph: iStockThis weekend will mark a momentous occasion in the history of Trinity College Dublin. For the first time in its 429-year history, Ireland’s oldest university will elect a female leader. The appointment of a new, female provost reflects a welcome trend in higher education leadership, with four of the last seven presidential appointments in Irish colleges being women.The appointment of Prof Kerstin Mey as president of the University of Limerick last summer was welcomed but also served to highlight the complete absence of female university presidents up to that point. In some ways the glass ceiling had finally been broken, but it remained to be seen if this was a watershed moment. After waiting so long, 2021 may come to be seen as the year when everything changed, with the appointments of Prof Maggie Cusack as the president of the country’s second technological university and Prof Eeva Leinonen as the next president of Maynooth University preceding the Trinity provostial election.International evidence shows that women often do not put themselves forward for senior roles due to a lack of confidence in the environment to judge them fairly, rather than due to a lack of self-confidence. Being able to see senior female academics leading their university has the potential to change this narrative significantly. Yet appointing senior female leaders will not change culture on its own. These women need to be supported to bring about systemic change, and the Higher Education Authority (HEA) is committed to supporting them in this regard.Lack of ersity in senior decision-making positions within higher education can only lead to a situation where many of our brightest and most talented students do not have role models at the highest levels. Developments such as the Senior Academic Leadership Initiative (SALI) and the appointment of female presidents are importantly increasing the visibility of female leaders in higher education. The SALI will create 45 new senior academic leadership posts in higher education institutions (HEIs) across Ireland by 2022, simultaneously increasing the number of women involved in decision-making processes and addressing issues of significant under-representation of women in certain disciplines. The response from HEIs has been overwhelmingly positive to the initiative and the pool of highly talented candidates who have applied for the 20 posts already funded has been impressive.Latest figures published by the HEA show that women account for 26 per cent of professors in Irish universities. While this is an increase from the 19 per cent reported in 2016, there is still a long way to go to reach gender balance at senior levels. Currently, we see an annual increase of about 1 per cent in the proportion of senior female leaders, and the SALI is predicted to contribute an extra 4 per cent increase on top of that by 2023.While the number of female staff in senior leadership positions grabs the headlines, advancing gender equality is about changing institutional and departmental cultures. The Athena Swan charter has helped drive policies in this area and achieving an award is now a requirement for colleges to remain eligible to receive public research funding. Since the HEA review of gender equality in higher education in 2016, much progress has been made nationally. HEIs must now ensure gender balance across all decision-making groups and all publicly funded HEIs must have gender-equality action plans in place.Women face a number of barriers to progression because of numerous factors within HEIs, conscious and unconscious, cultural and structural, which are not experienced to the same degree by their male colleagues. In recent years, HEIs have taken important steps to address this, such as: reviewing their recruitment and promotion policies ensuring that gender-neutral language is used in all material and resources relating to recruitment and promotion delivering equality and ersity training for all staff members acting as interview panellists or conducting performance reviews ensuring a minimum of 40 per cent of each gender on interview and selection panels and advertising their equality and flexible working policies.HarassmentHowever, gaps still remain. For instance, from an equality perspective, we also know that harassment can seriously affect the careers of young female academics. More work needs to be done to tackle this issue and the HEA, at the request of Minister for Further and Higher Education Simon Harris, has recently established an expert advisory group focused on ending sexual violence and harassment in higher education.Gender inequality has never been more apparent than in the last year, when we have seen female staff disproportionately affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. For instance, the research time lost due to the necessity to move to an online mode of teaching delivery, combined with the increased burden of caring responsibilities (which disproportionately fall on female staff), has the potential to further delay career progression for female academic staff. Internationally, evidence has emerged that, since the start of the Covid-19 restrictions, women researchers are submitting fewer academic papers than men.In 2016, the HEA expert group outlined the following vision for Irish higher education: “By investing in gender equality, Irish higher education institutions will maximise their pursuit of excellence and successfully meet the many social, economic and cultural challenges of the future.” This statement takes on renewed significance in the context of the current crisis and it is crucial that gender-equality initiatives are continued and that any national or institutional strategies or policies in response to Covid-19 are gender-proofed.

A significant proportion (29 per cent) said they did not believe they would be in the profession in 10 years’ time.However, if pay discrimination were to be fully resolved, 74 per cent believed they would still be in the profession in a decade.TUI president Martin Marjoram said that although progress had been made in tackling pay inequality, there was still an €80,000 loss in career earnings, with the largest differences in salary in the early years of employment.Digital ideSeparately, the gulf in access among pupils to digital devices will be a key issue of debate at the annual congress of the Irish National Teachers’ Organisation.The union’s president, Mary Magner, will warn delegates on Tuesday that Irish primary schools are lagging behind our EU neighbours in investing in digital technology to support teaching and learning.She will highlight countries including Austria, Switzerland and Norway, where about 95 per cent of students have a personal laptop to use for their homework.“Too many times during this crisis when our schools were forced to close, did it become apparent that too many families did not have adequate access to digital technology in their homes,” she will tell delegates.“As we look forward to the rollout of the renewed curriculum later in this decade, the digital agenda must be at the heart of 21st-century Irish primary education.”Minister for Education Norma Foley has announced the development of a new €200 million digital strategy for schools between now and 2027.It aims to embed digital technology in teaching, learning and assessment and will take into account the “challenges that have arisen” in recent times.She has asked anyone with an interest in the area to take part in a new consultation process to help build a “robust and exciting” strategy.Although access to the Covid-19 vaccine is expected to dominate the annual conference of the Association of Secondary Teachers Ireland (ASTI), there will be a focus on debates about the Leaving Cert as well as on other issues that could have significant industrial relations implications such as pensions and pay for student teachers.The highest priority motion for the ASTI conference calls for depth of treatment and range of subject knowledge to be included in the design template of all future Leaving Certificate specifications, including those currently under development.The ASTI will also hear calls for a return to the pre-2004 public service pension scheme for all teachers, which would include the right to retire at 60.Third-level fundingSeparately, Minister for Higher Education Simon Harris is expected to tell TUI delegates that the issue of the future funding of further and third-level education will be dealt with by the current administration.He will say that, while investment levels have increased, “it is not where it needs to be”.He is expected to tell delegates the Government will act on the findings of a new report on future funding in the next few months.It is understood he will tell teachers he wants to see a number of rapid Covid-19 testing pilots across the third-level sector as another weapon in the armoury to allow for greater on-site attendance in the next academic year.He is also expected to give a commitment to a programme of investment in new technological universities, including expansion of campuses in Waterford.It is understood he recently received a report from the Higher Education Authority regarding the merger of Athlone IT and Limerick IT, which will be considered in the days ahead.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4529617.1617656053!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"teachers push to be moved up covid 19 vaccine queue faces resistance","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA queue at the HSE vaccination centre in the Aviva Stadium at the weekend. Photograph: Alan BetsonThe Government is resisting pressure to move teachers up its vaccination schedule in the face of moves by unions this week to back ballots for strike action.All three teacher unions look set to debate emergency motions at their annual conferences on Wednesday seeking ballots on industrial action within weeks unless their members are given higher priority for vaccination.Any industrial action will not affect the planned reopening of schools on April 12th, according to the unions.However, it could disrupt the current academic year at primary level or the new school year in September at secondary level.The row follows the Government’s decision last week to introduce an age-based system for vaccinating the population instead of one that prioritises front-line professions.The unions say there is widespread anger and frustration over the “downgrading” of the teaching profession on the vaccination list.Unions, as well as representative bodies for gardaí, want the Government to introduce a parallel process which would see those in front-line roles receive their vaccines in separate streams at mass centres. This would run side by side with the system in place for the general public.The Irish National Teachers’Organisation (INTO) is pushing for potential industrial action in May or June. Secondary teachers’ unions are reluctant to disrupt the Leaving Cert and say any action would likely be early in the new academic year.However, Government and health service sources believe such a move would result in pressure for similar arrangements for tens of thousands of retail and transport workers, among others.Medical adviceA Government spokesman said on Monday the latest vaccination sequencing is “based on medical advice to protect the most medically vulnerable in society”.“The evidence has shown age is by far the biggest factor in serious illness, hospitalisation and mortality due to Covid-19,” the spokesman said.“Many essential workers have played an important part since the start of the pandemic. The National Immunisation Advisory Committee has explained the rationale to various stakeholders, and based on the medical advice this is the safest and swiftest way to roll the vaccine programme out.”Senior Government sources indicated on Monday that a reversal on the new vaccine priority list was not likely. Several sources said the new list was the “fastest and fairest way” to roll out the vaccines, and had been recommended by public health experts.Senior coalition sources said many essential workers had worked throughout the pandemic and argued other groups could make claims for early vaccination if it bowed to teachers’ demands.One source said there was “no sense in Government that anyone wants to do a U-turn on this”.A spokesman for Minister for Education Norma Foley – who is due to address the INTO on Tuesday – said it remained her position that the vaccination programme should be guided by public health experts.Her spokesman also confirmed that the secretary general of her department attended a senior officials’ meeting on March 24th, which heard that changes to the vaccine allocation strategy were being considered by the advisory committee.Ms Foley was then made aware of this, but her spokesman said she only “became aware of the output of that process when the Minister for Health brought a memo to Cabinet” last week.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Move follows scientific expert group\u0026rsquos conclusion that \u0026lsquothe fuel qualifies as sustainable\u0026rsquo under green investmentsAs the Swedish environmental activist turns 18, what next for her \u0026lsquowe children\u0026rsquo message?Demand for wood is three times higher than the country\u0026rsquos potential sustainable supply"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: Celtic Mist, donated by the Haughey family, now serving as a research vessel for conservation body"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4529419.1617640253!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"runners collect 174 bags of roadside rubbish in pandemic clean up","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLitter found during a clean-up by members of St Coca’s Athletic Club in Kilcock, Co Kildare.Indiscriminate littering along roadsides has increased during the pandemic, with little indication the Government is willing to tackle the problem, according to a running coach who organised a clean-up in his area while complying with Covid restrictions.“The amount of littering and illegal dumping really got out of hand. We set up a cleaning team of 15 club members and, with the help of local councillor Paul Ward, we arranged a skip from Kildare County Council.“During the current lockdown the amount of littering is up again, so we are setting up a similar action from April 10th. We have another team of volunteers set up and hopefully we will get it done in one day,” Baten added. The club will do a combined clean up with Kilcock Tidy Towns and expand the cleaning over a larger area – they have been removing any large bags dumped in the area on an on-going basis.Originally from Holland, Baten met his wife Marie, who is from Leixlip, in Indonesia in 1997 and they moved to Kilcock in 2005. While he loves the area, the extent of ongoing littering is an issue he finds hard to reconcile. “I don’t know what the problem is. It seems to be very Irish. I can’t understand people throwing items out of cars, and not thinking about it,” he said.Currently studying supply chain management at Dundalk IT, he recently did a presentation “on the three Rs of sustainability reduce, reuse and recycle”. When delivering it, he said he departed from the brief a little “I spoke from the heart about this very Irish problem.”With evidence of bags of rubbish being dumped in the area, CCTV was temporarily put in place but Baten understood the cameras were removed because of GDPR concerns. He believed, however, that the action suggested authorities “do not see it as a crime”.Labour Party Senator Mark Wall has put forward legislation in the Seanad aimed at providing a legal basis for CCTV to be used.The Department of the Environment said last month it is aware of an increase in the number of reports of illegal dumping and pointed to more than €10 million in supports it allocated to local authorities to help tackle the issue last year.It said the Circular Economy Bill is to be used to provide the legal basis for the use of CCTV and other technologies to detect and prosecute illegal dumping in a way that is GDPR compliant.Government approval will be sought to prepare the general scheme of the Bill “shortly”, it added. “We will then be prioritising the remaining drafting processes to allow for enactment in the second half of 2021.”"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 vaccine tracker what s available in the republic of ireland and what else is coming","story":"It has been almost a year since the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in the Republic of Ireland. Since then, over 200,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,000 people have died.Globally, over 100 million people have been diagnosed and over 2.5\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.NEWS AND UPDATES: - How many have been vaccinated here?Scientists have been racing to develop a vaccine that would bring an end to the pandemic, and there are now 64 different vaccines in clinical development, with another 173 in preclinical development, according to the World Health Organisation.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspis also in talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva. 268,586 had received their second dose.Some 188,988 of these vaccines had gone to people in long term residential care facilities, while 337,724 had gone to frontline healthcare workers and 354,829 had gone to people over the age of 70. Some\u0026nbsp42,004 people in Cohort 4 - those\u0026nbspaged between 16 and 69 at very high risk of severe Covid-19 disease - received a dose.\u0026nbspGlobally, over 600 million doses of a Covid-19 vaccine have been administered.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 5.4 million doses by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc. While talks continue on how to increase production, the company has now committed to a total of 40 million doses for the EU in the first quarter of 2021.While the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab, resulting in a significant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.On March 11th Norwegian health authorities said three health workers in Norway who had recently received the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine were being treated in hospital for bleeding, blood clots and a low count of blood platelets.Norway halted the rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine, following a similar move by Denmark. Iceland later followed suit.On Thursday, March 18th, the EMA announced it had found\u0026nbspno causal link between the vaccine and blood-clotting events and use of the vaccine\u0026nbspresumed on Saturday March 20th in Ireland.How many will Ireland get? 190,000 doses in February and a further 95,000 in early March - supply after this is not confirmed.Storage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and expects to have its first results by April 2021. On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?In December the HSE published the provisional order in which people in Ireland will be vaccinated against Covid-19. After over-65s in care homes and frontline health workers, people aged 70 and older and other healthcare workers are next in line to receive the vaccine.\u0026nbspPeople aged 16-69 with very high risk conditions will then be\u0026nbspthe fourth cohort to be vaccinated.On March 30th, the Cabinet agreed to change the National Vaccination Programme to an age-based system, once those aged 70 years and older, people considered vulnerable and those with underlying conditions are immunised. The original programme involved 15 cohorts of people based on age and profession, with key workers prioritised.The vaccination of people aged over 85 began on Monday, February 15th. Those in the 70-84 age bracket began to receive their first dose on March 8th, alongside people aged 16-69 with very high risk conditions.The HSE has said everyone over the age of 70 should have received their second dose by mid-May.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4529026.1617625694!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"special needs assistants need to be vaccinated against covid 19 as soon as possible says union","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Forsa union which represents Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) is unhappy that the vaccine rollout plan has been changed to one based primarily on age rather than occupation. Photograph: iStockThe union representing Special Needs Assistants (SNAs), Forsa, has called on Government to ensure its members are vaccinated as soon as possible.The union is unhappy that the vaccine rollout plan has been changed to one based primarily on age rather than occupation.Andy Pike, head of the union’s education ision, told RTÉ news on Monday: “Many of them will be working alongside healthcare staff, for instance in our special schools, where the nurses, physiotherapists and occupational therapists have all been vaccinated under the HSE rollout yet the SNAs working alongside them day to day will not be vaccinated.“That’s just not a sustainable situation where you vaccinate half your workforce but the other half you just ignore.”Meanwhile, talks to defuse a Government row on mandatory quarantine will this week consider an expanded role for quarantining at home and how vaccinations might be used to reduce periods of isolation after travel from certain countries.Senior Government sources said talks between officials would take place this week – most likely Tuesday or Wednesday – in an effort to find a compromise after moves to add several EU member states and the US to the list of countries eligible for mandatory hotel quarantine caused a serious political row last week.The expansion of the list is aimed at minimising the risk of coronavirus “variants of concern” spreading from countries, some of which have strong travel links to the Republic.Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly is understood to be committed to proceeding, notwithstanding opposition from other Government Ministers, most notably Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney.“His view on this is not going to change,” said a well-placed source of Mr Donnelly’s stance. The leaking of the extended list of countries caused a significant row last week, viewed by some as an attempt to “bounce” the rest of Government into accepting its expansion.There was significant diplomatic fallout arising from the leak, with one Government source saying it caused “consternation” in European capitals, while another said there was “real annoyance” over how the story had played out.The issue has raised complex questions for the Government. Linking vaccination to inidual freedoms may be resisted by some European capitals, while hotel capacity, the criteria for inclusion of countries on the list, the review period for same, an “exit strategy” from the policy and the legal position regarding travel in the EU need to be addressed. Sources said countries that had put extensive hotel quarantine regimes in place had been forced to cap arrivals.Government will also monitor the prospect of an early constitutional challenge to the quarantine system, arising from the case of two women who refused to enter mandatory hotel quarantine following their return from a trip to Dubai.Government sources said on Sunday there will be consultation with Brussels as well, as fears grow in Europe over variants of concern, which are spreading in France and elsewhere.Some in Government are concerned about the public health and political consequences of inaction. “It’s very dangerous for politicians to think they know more about the virus than medical experts and to effectively over-rule them,” observed a source.Separately, the HSE has told hospitals they can provide surplus vaccines in exceptional circumstances to people who do not have conditions that could leave them at risk of severe illness or death as a result of Covid-19.It told senior hospital staff in a letter last Wednesday that vaccination of anyone beyond group 7 – people aged 16-64 who had an underlying condition that puts them at high risk of severe outcomes – was not appropriate.However, in exceptional circumstances and “as a last resort”, small amounts of vaccines could be administered to people outside the categories of those being medically vulnerable and at very high and high risk of severe illness or death.It said “this should be done in a transparent, equitable and fair manner”.Meanwhile, gardaí and teachers have urged the Government to introduce a separate Covid-19 vaccination programme to run in parallel with the new age-based system for the general public.The general secretary of the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors (AGSI) Antoinette Cunningham said on Sunday that her organisation was proposing that, in mass vaccination centres such as City West in Dublin, there could be separate streams that would provide vaccines side-by-side to both those in high-risk and front-line occupations such as gardaí and teachers, as well as to the general public based on their age.Meanwhile, John Boyle, the general secretary of the primary teachers’ trade union, INTO, said a twin-track approach proposed by gardaí could easily be rolled out.He suggested that given the scale of vaccination seen recently, gardaí and teachers could be vaccinated within a matter of a few days if the will was there. He said schools had been promised in February that teachers would be in the first 30 per cent of the population to be vaccinated."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4529604.1617655810!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"contractors on major road projects sought 850m over agreed prices","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe public works contract awards deals on the basis of the lowest price submitted. Photograph: iStockContractors working on major road projects sought more than €850 million over agreed tender prices, new figures show.Data released to The  relates to 15 road projects with a tender price of more than €40 million, between 2008 and 2018. Ultimately, just under €270 million was paid above the tender price, with the bill for all the projects coming in at €2.02 billion.Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII), which manages major State transport projects, said that although payments were above tender prices, the combined total paid out for the roads projects came in under budget.Full budgets for each project include contingency and other sums on top of the tender price. Inidual project budgets are commercially sensitive, but TII said the combined construction budgets for the 15 projects was €2.3 billion, meaning they came in 11 per cent below target. However, sources across the infrastructure sector said the variation between tender sums, payments and sums sought was the product of a fraught process rooted in the type of contract governing the majority of projects. The public works contract awards deals on the basis of the lowest price submitted. Peter Walsh, the chief executive of TII, said: “The contract is given to the lowest tendered price, so the contractors have to take an optimistic view as to how the project will proceed,” adding that bidders “can’t expect” to win a contract otherwise. “You will never outturn at the tendered price, because it is the most optimistic view of how things might occur.”Cost disputesConstruction sources say the process is characterised by adversarial cost disputes, leading to lengthy arbitration and expensive legal proceedings. As the State prepares to spend more than €100 billion as part of Project Ireland 2040, Mr Walsh warned the public works contract wouldn’t work for so-called “mega-projects”.“This type of public works contract would not be appropriate for mega-projects like the link,” he said. Two other types of contract – a New Engineering Contract (NEC) and a so-called “Fidic” contract – would be more appropriate, he said. TII has used these contracts on a trial basis, and the approval process to allow them be considered as an option for infrastructure projects is under consideration, having been supported by the Office of Government Procurement.A spokesman for the Construction Industry Federation said the current contract places “all risk for any eventuality on the contractor”, and that it has sought “more collaborative contract modes” such as the NEC. “Unfortunately the public sector is constrained by legislation to select the lowest cost bidder in a tender process in the vast majority of contracts. The system rewards the lowest bidder, not necessarily the optimum bid.”A spokeswoman for the Department of Public Expenditure said most projects were delivered on time and on budget, but “more needs to be done to continue to strengthen and improve processes and frameworks to ensure value for money”. The department said it was strengthening frameworks to support public bodies delivering major projects.15 road projects: €2.02 billionThe data released to The  details 15 roads projects with a total spend of €2.02 billion. This is more than the tender prices agreed, which came to €1.75 billion, but less than the €2.6 billion that was submitted in claims by the contractors. The average difference between the tender price and that paid out was 15 per cent. The most expensive project in the data released was the €245 million CashelMitchelstown project, which came in slightly below tender price. Other projects were significantly above the agreed tender, such as the Kilbeggan-Moate-Athlone road, which came in at €145 million compared to the €113 million tender and the AthloneBallinasloe road, which was €100.1 million compared to €79.1 million at tender. A project between Kinnegad and Kilbeggan tendered at €108.8 million, and cost €137 million. The first phase of the Carlow Bypass was tendered at €74.9 million and cost €105.4 million. The Waterford to Knocktopher Phase 2 project was €136 million, compared to €108 million agreed at tender. CullahillCashel was tendered at €165 million, but cost €204 million. CastletownNenagh cost €170 million compared to a tender agreed at €141.8 million while NenaghLimerick was €209.5 million, and tendered at €175 million. The Tralee Bypass tendered at €30.1 million, but cost €35.2 million the Gort-Crusheen bypass cost €95 million compared to a tender of €80.1 million. The N52 Tullamore bypass came in at €41.2 million, slightly ahead of its tender price of €39.6 million. Kilcullen to Carlow (Phase 3) cost €111.3 million compared to a tender of €107 million. Carlow to Knocktopher (phase 4) was among the most expensive projects at €222.5 million, but only marginally ahead of its tender price of €217.2 million. The Mitchelstown-Fermoy project, at €62.9 million was similarly marginally ahead of tender, which was €61.6 million.

This involved an outdoor work activity which took place between two separate families, according to the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) which monitors case numbers in the Republic.There were 21 outbreaks on construction sites with 124 cases, and 20 outbreaks associated with sporting activities and fitness in which there were 131 cases.The HPSC data, provided in response to a query from The , was based on “locations which are primarily associated with outdoor activities, ie outdoor sports and construction sites, or outbreaks that specifically mention in comments that an outdoor location or activity was involved”. The HSPC said, however, that it “cannot determine where transmission occurred”. In addition 20 per cent of all cases in the State result from community transmission where the source of the infection is not known. The relatively low numbers of cases resulting from outdoor transmission in the Republic is mirrored in international studies. A study of 1,245 cases in China found only three people were infected outdoors and they were in conversation without masks. According to a review by the University of California of five global studies of transmission, the chances of getting Covid-19 in an indoor setting is 19 times greater than outdoors. At the University of Canterbury, Prof Mike Weed studied 27,000 Covid-19 cases based on 6,000 different pieces of data. One study was of 7,500 cases in China and Japan before lockdown in both of those countries. The number of cases associated with outdoor transmission was “so small to be insignificant”, he discovered.Risk managementProf Weed said outdoor gatherings are safe if accompanied by proper risk management. For example, crowds could be allowed at sporting events if rules are observed around congregating in indoor venues beforehand. “Our conclusion is that in many sectors, and for many sizes and formats, it should be possible to put appropriate evidence-based mitigations in place to deliver outdoor events and activities in a way that does not escalate the risk from sporadic transmission to cluster outbreak,” he said. Ed Lavelle, a professor of biochemistry at Trinity College Dublin, said the findings were “really great news and back up a lot of the evidence from the United States” which showed that outside activities are inherently safe.He added that the big issue was not the outdoor activity, but what happened either side of it.“We have not had the numbers until now for what is safe and what is not safe and how you can control it. It’s been hearsay to this point,” he said. “Having coffee shops outside would be very safe. For me, the key thing is what happens after the outdoor activity.” Assistant professor at University College Dublin’s school of architecture Prof Orla Hegarty said it is difficult for the HPSC to measure outdoor transmission as construction and sport can be both outdoor and indoor. She said outdoor risk is low “if people keep physical distance, avoid close conversation and take great care that shared transport and shared toilets are very well ventilated – and that they stay a very short time and wear masks in them. “During Spanish flu people were advised to talk side by side, rather than face to face, and this is borne out by how viral particles have been measured moving in the air when people breath and speak.“The risk of infection is low outdoors because unless you are up close to someone infected, most of the virus will likely be blown away and diluted in the breeze, like cigarette smoke.”The Government is allowing outdoor sports activities from April 26th including the opening of pitches, golf courses and tennis courts. Outdoor visitor attractions such as zoos and heritage sites can reopen and some outdoor retail will recommence from May 5th. Grants will average at about €4,000 for each premises and can cover expenses incurred since last April.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"world view brazil s health and democracy are both on the brink","story":"Brazil\u0027s Covid-19 case numbers and deaths have hit staggering new highs in the past month: over 60,000 died in March alone.

Local residents said they had become attached to it.The CDFW spokesman said: Physically and mentally, the bear just didn’t seem quite right, walking oddly, dull and not responsive like a normal bear should be.It was taken to a laboratory where veterinarians could observe the animal.They found it had intermittent head tremors and a tilted head, indicating neurological abnormalities.The bear was also only one quarter of the weight of an average black bear of its age.It was eventually euthanised and a post-mortem examination was carried out.Scientists found encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain usually caused by a virus. the fourth such recent case in the area.Dr Brandon Munk, a  CDFW vet, said: At this point, we don’t know what causes the encephalitis so we don’t know what, if any, health risks these bears might pose to other animals.Young black bears with the condition were previously identified in neighbouring Nevada.The Nevada Department of Wildlife said there had been a growing number of encounters in the forested Tahoe Basin area, between humans and bears displaying neurological abnormalities.Vets and biologists from the two states\u0027 wildlife agencies met this month to assess the problem.They have discovered five new viruses while examining the affected bears, but don\u0027t know if any of those was responsible.California\u0027s black bear population has tripled over the last four decades, and is now up to 40,000.Bears have become less inhibited around people, and wandering into gardens and homes looking for food has become more common.Their proximity to humans has also raised fears of a virus jumping species.However, Jamie Sherman, a University of California veterinarian, told the Sacramento Bee newspaper: “The viruses that they detected in these bears were not ones particularly known to affect humans.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"ivf clinics exploiting women raising prices pandemic","story":"Women who feel the pandemic has robbed them of their chance to have children are being exploited by IVF clinics charging “eye-watering” prices, the head of Britain’s fertility watchdog has warned.Sally Cheshire, former chairman of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) urged ministers to give the regulator stronger powers to protect those seeking to start a family from false claims. Mrs Cheshire, who has just stood down as chairman, after 15 years at the HFEA, said that repeated lockdowns meant many of those seeking to find a partner, and start a family, felt they had “lost a year of their lives”.In an interview with The , she said too many clinics were trading on the desperation of those struggling with fertility, promoting unproven techniques and exaggerating statistics about effectiveness. Mrs Cheshire urged the Government to overhaul legislation that is now 30 years old - predating the commercial market in fertility - by giving the watchdog the power to set prices, and to fine clinics who make false claims. “This would mean there wasn\u0027t exploitation for self-funded patients going to private clinics and that prices don\u0027t all reach the eye-watering levels that we have seen,” she said.Some centres are charging as much as £20,000 per cycle, warned the HFEA chief, who said she would set a limit of around £5,000. And she said too many clinics were still making claims - in particular about costly and unproven “add-on treatments” - which could not be justified. “They need to think really carefully about what they\u0027re offering, particularly when the success rates are still lower than we would expect. It\u0027s a false promise,” she said. Latest HFEA figures show the number of women freezing their eggs has risen almost ten-fold since 2010. The official statistics, which show almost 2,000 freezing cycles in 2018, predate the pandemic, but clinics have said inquiries tripled at some centres last year compared with 2019.“Lots of people feel like they’ve lost their chance lost a year of their lives, women who are who are older who are coming up to the cut-off age for fertility treatment, the couples or women who had planned to have treatment this year and haven\u0027t been able to, and those who feel that their chances has come and gone, because they are now over the age for NHS funding.”“I think this has had a devastating impact, with people who see their dreams of having a family disappear,” she said. While clinics were only forced to close completely for the first month of lockdown, some NHS services were closed for longer as staff were erted to deal with Covid, she said. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommends that women who are struggling to conceive naturally should be funded for three cycles of IVF, if they are below the age of 40, with one for those aged 40 to 42. But just 12 per cent of areas provide this. The legislation behind the creation of the HFEA 30 years ago assumed that the sector was state-funded, but NHS rationing means the vast majority of fertility treatment is privately funded now, she said. “We need to have some curbs on that commercial competitive environment, given two-thirds of fertility patients fund their own treatment,” she said. But Mrs Cheshire said she would like her successor to be given more powers than she has had, in setting the rates charged by the private sector, and putting protection of patients at the heart of its role. “We don’t have powers such as economic sanctions, we don’t have powers over patient funding, and we would want to see regulatory powers which allow us to support care which is ethical and effective, as well as safe about quality of care, which isn’t mentioned at all in the original act,” she said. In the short-term, the regulator will use existing powers to “we try and stamp out as much exploitation as we can,” she said. In May, new guidance from the Competition and Markets Authority and the Advertising Standards Authority will set out rules instructing clinics not to make false unsubstantiated claims, or “unrealistically low headline prices” which gloss over the true costs. Mrs Cheshire said she is particularly concerned about the need to address the use of social media to target those vulnerable to exaggerated claims. “Social media has had a huge impact in targeting certain groups of women - so women of a certain age get targeted with ads about egg freezing for example,” she said. “Looking at challenges for the future, there is something about protecting vulnerable patients, in a competitive and commercial environment,” she said. The HFEA has cautioned against the use of “add-on” treatments which promise to boost standard fertility treatment, such as endometrial glue and scratches the most common. Their research found that two in three patients undergoing fertility treatment will pay for some such treatment, despite a lack of evidence to support them. Mrs Cheshire said: “I think all clinicians have a duty to be honest with their patients about the safety or potential harms and the effectiveness of those treatments. “We do know that when patients are vulnerable, particularly when you\u0027re older, or when you feel like your might be your last chance your time is running out, it can be very easy for you to accept whatever is discussed with you, or offered to you.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"regulators decision astrazeneca jab safety could come within","story":"Britain’s health regulator is considering the impact of the OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine on younger people and could come to a decision within days about whether to change its guidance, Channel Four News reported yesterday.Government insiders told The  on Monday night that they were not expecting the regulator to put age restrictions on the use of the AstraZeneca jab, while stressing that the regulator was independent.Ministers have repeatedly talked about the safety of the AstraZeneca jab in recent weeks, including in high profile press conferences, in moves designed to reassure the public.Last week, the German government announced it would stop general use of the AstraZeneca vaccine for people aged under 60 amid concerns over blood clots, with Canada doing the same for the under-55s.At the time, Downing Street moved quickly to make clear the UK Government’s continued belief that the vaccine was safe and indicated no change in approach was expected.A government spokesman said yesterday: “The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine is safe, effective and has already saved thousands of lives in this country.As the UK’s independent regulator has said, when people are called forward, they should get the jab.“Over 37 million jabs overall have already been administered and we are on track to offer jabs to all over 50s by 15 April and all adults by the end of July.”It was unclear last night whether the MHRA was expected to make an announcement in the coming days or if it was simply conducting routine checks as more data comes in.The regulator has previously said it constantly monitors new data about the vaccines it has approved for use.

But its assumptions are far more cautious than the wealth of real-world data available for examination. Its scientists reckoned on AstraZeneca jabs cutting infections by just 31 per cent but evidence from Britain’s current programme suggests that just one dose is enough to reduce the risk by two thirds. However, the brief display of optimism is tempered by Cabinet Office modelling, which suggests an average of 2.7 million doses will be administered weekly in England until the end of July, with the latest slowdown in deliveries meaning a dip from the 3.2 million which had been planned for.The key document says: “It is highly likely that there will be a further resurgence in hospitalisations and deaths after the later steps of the roadmap. The scale, shape, and timing of any resurgence remain highly uncertain.”“In most scenarios modelled, any peak is smaller than the wave seen in Jan 2021, however, scenarios with little transmission reduction after step four, or with pessimistic but plausible vaccine efficacy assumptions, can result in resurgences in hospitalisations of a similar scale to Jan 2021.” And yet, overall, the most notable message is one of “considerable uncertainty”.Sage’s scientists could be forgiven if they are feeling bruised by previous scenario modelling. Data presented by the Government\u0027s chief advisers to justify a second national lockdown last autumn was soon shown to be wrong, and based on incorrect assumptions.  By the time data suggesting that daily deaths would reach 4,000 was presented at a Downing Street press conference, the modelling was so outdated that it over-estimated the existing mortality levels by a factor of four. In fact, daily deaths peaked at around 1,200 in January.  As Britain weighs up how best to return to any form of normality, Sage’s modelling will be scrutinised closely. But the success of Britain’s vaccine programme – and the surprise this has given the Government’s scientific modellers – is one reminder that their assumptions have tended to lean towards the bleak.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"spare us hypocrisy woke multinationals","story":"Perhaps I’m not the best person to sound off about boycotting Coca-Cola since I hardly drink it. I mean, if you put dirty coins in Coca-Cola they come out shiny – so just imagine what that does to your insides. But in the US, Coca-Cola, along with Delta Air Lines, is now in the front line of the culture wars. Donald Trump has urged Republicans to boycott them, due to their opposition to Republican-led reforms to the electoral system in Georgia.The main thrust of the reforms is that voters would need photo ID or a utility bill to back a request for an absentee vote, instead of the present system where the signature on the application for the vote is checked against that on the returned ballot. This reform, however, is being treated by Democrats as, to use President Biden’s analogy, a return to Jim Crow laws, which enforced racial segregation. Now James Quincey, Coca-Cola’s British chief executive, declares that the changes are “unacceptable”.It’s yet another example of corporate ethical activism, whereby companies get terrifically worked up about issues that have really got nothing to do with them. It’s part of corporate overreach generally. In Ireland, during the referendum on gay marriage, Google and Facebook let it be known that they were very pro-change. Then there was Disney, making a stand against transphobia by, in an entirely pointless gesture, sacking the actress Gina Carano from The Mandalorian after she appeared to send up trans pronouns. This is the same Disney that filmed part of their live-action version of Mulan in Xinjiang province, where the Uyghurs are in mass detention.I’d love to boycott Disney but I haven’t watched one since Beauty and the Beast, the last decent film it made.Where global capitalism does have an ethical duty, it is to pay taxes in the countries where they operate, reflecting the profits they make there. But on this, Google et al are not terribly forthcoming either. My impression is that they positively go out of their way to avoid paying what normal people would consider a fair rate and use their corporate clout with the US government to argue their case.They also have a responsibility to see that their supply chains are clean, viz, that the companies contributing to their product aren’t involved in iffy practices in developing countries or underpaying their workers.You might even assume that big corporations would consider the ethics of investing in countries that violate human rights. And yet Coca-Cola’s Curt Ferguson, head of its Far East operations, recently declared that its biggest market in the future would be China, where it already employs thousands of people.The difference, of course, is that taking a stand on China really would affect the bottom line. Ethics and global capitalism… they’re a funny mix, aren’t they?Yesterday, in Scotland people headed back to the hairdressers looking like so many Rapunzels.

One in fivewould see their budgets slashed. The analysis looked at the state of town hall budgets once dedicated cash for anti-HIV drug PrEP was taken into account. The vital medicine is available through local authority public health services for the first time this year so it cannot be compared to previous years. Town halls get ring-fenced cash for public health measures such sexual health, substance abuse and stop smoking services. They have also now been tasked with battling the virus, including testing and outbreak planning. Public health budgets have been boosted by £million since last year, but the uplt is less than half thatonce PrEP funding is stripped out, the analysis found. Some  local authorities , including areas like Wakefield and Doncaster, will see a cut to per capita spending this year. Two fths of these areas have Covid case rates higher than the national average. And  councilswill experience a freeze in per capita funding. Of these, Barnsley, North Lincolnshire, Bradford, Sheffield, Blackburn and Darwen and Leicester all have case rates over double the national average.

And he gave an update on progress towards introducing vaccine passports and unlocking overseas travel this year. International travel, aside from a few exceptions, remains illegal until at least May . But the PM announced that when it reopens, it will be on a “traffic lights” basis, with people allowed tofrom “green” rated countries without any kind of quarantine or isolation. However, the government advised weary Brits to hold off on booking summer holidays for the time being. The Government also published an update on Covid certicate plans, with trials of negative test certicates due to start at sport and comedy events later this month. Boris Johnson said the lockdown changes in England were fully justied but urged the public not to be complacent. The Prime Minister told a Downing Street press briefing: We think that these changes are fully justied by the data, which shows that we are meeting our four tests for easing the lockdown. But - and you know Iaposm going to say this - we canapost be complacent. We can see the waves of sickness afflicting other countries and weaposve seen how this story goes. We still donapost know how strong the vaccine shield will be when cases begin to rise, as Iaposm afraid they will, and thataposs why weaposre saying please get your vaccine or your second dose when the turn comes. And please use the free NHS tests evenyou donapost feel ill. The PM said he did not think, based on the current data, that there would be any deviation from his road map out of lockdown - despite worrying data being published by SAGE earlier today, which suggested a delay could be possible.  Mr Johnson said: We set out our road map and weaposre sticking with it. And I want to stress that we see nothing in the present data that makes us think that we will have to deviate from that road map. But it is by being cautious, by monitoring the data at every stage and by following the rules - remembering hand, face, space, fresh air - that we hope together to make this road map to freedom irreversible. Hereaposs a roundup of all the things youaposll be able to do from next Monday - and all the updates on the reviews on foreign travel and vaccine passports. What will reopen and when From April , the following will reopen:Non-essential retail Outdoor hospitality - including pub beer gardens Personal care premises such as hairdressers and nail salons Public buildings, including libraries and community centres Indoor leisure facilities such as gymsMost outdoor attractions, including zoos, theme parks, and drive-in cinemas Self-contained accommodation such as campsites and holiday lets, where indoor facilities are not shared with other householdsAdditionally, parent and child groups of up to  peoplecan restart indoors. The number of care home visitors will also increase to two per resident. And all children will be able to attend any indoor childrenaposs activity, including sport - though soft play facilities will remain closed until step . Will I still have to order a apossubstantial mealapos to get a drink in a beer garden  No. Hospitality venues will be able to open for outdoor service, with no requirement for a substantial meal to be served alongside alcohol, and no curfew. But the requirement to eat and drink while seated will remain - including when ordering. And social contact rules will continue to apply, with outdoor gatherings still limited to  people or  households. Will the rules on weddings and funerals change  Weddings, outdoor receptions, and commemorative events including wakes will now be able to take place with up to  attendees. The limit on attendees at a funeral will remain at . International travel How will the traffic light system work  Travellers arriving from countries rated green will not be required to isolate - although pre-departure and post-arrival tests will still be needed. For those classed as amber or red, the restrictions will remain as they are, with arrivals required to isolate or enter quarantine. Countries will be rated green when the government judges the risk to be lower, based for instance on vaccinations, infection rates, the prevalence of iants of concern, and their genomic sequencing capacity . Which countries will be green  The Taskforce says it is still too early to predict which countries would be on which list and they continue to advise against booking summer holidays abroad. They said: These decisions will be driven by the data and evidence nearer the time, which we cannot predict now. And countries wonapost necessarily stay in the category theyaposre first assigned. The Taskforce said countries will move between the red, amber and green lists depending on the data.

Boris Johnson had been admitted to St Thomas’ Hospital, nine days after being diagnosed with the deadly and, compared to now, little-understood disease. Before leaving the then--year-old is thought to have rung his senior aides, and given an order that might have been written into history books - his deputy, Dominic Raab, would assume his dutieshe was incapacitated.The No spin machine swung into action, telling journalists the PM was in “good spirits”, had a “comfortable night”, and was even sent a ministerial red box. But  hours later he was in intensive care - his box sent across the Thames to his hospital, but never touched. Insiders now say the Prime Minister was in a worse state than many thought - and his deterioration was shocking in its speed. “On the Friday he was someone who was just unwell,” one told the Mirror. “From the Sunday and Monday he was someone who was very obviously needing severe hospital treatment. It happened very, very fast and I think everybody was in shock. “From the moment we got the call that the PM was   to go on a ventilator, everyone knew the seriousness of what was going on. “There was a genuine fear that he could die.” Another senior government insider at the time said the PM “was coughing and spluttering” through meetings and “he didn’t sound okay”. But they were still shocked by his admission to hospital. “In the week he had it I don’t think anyone sat there thinking he could die, that it could really escalate,” they said. “When he went into ICU that was a dark time for a lot of people. I don’t think anyone was really expecting it. “It was still relatively early in the cycle. It was this period of still trying to work out exactly how deadly and transmissible it was and trying to learn from it. “If it had happened six months later, people would have been a lot more nervous. But there was still this sense that it was the Prime Minister, he couldn’t possibly die.” Critics say this sense of British exceptionalism dogged Boris Johnson’s disastrous early approach to the pandemic - and cost thousands of lives. It took until March  for him to chair his first COBRA meeting after missing five previous ones and spending weekends at Chequers and Chevening.  On March  he boasted “I shook hands with everybody” at a hospital with Covid patients, on the same day SAGE advised an end to handshakes.The Cheltenham Festival was allowed to go ahead on March , followed by a Liverpool match against Atletico on March .As late as March , government figures were making comments about “herd immunity”. And even after a U-turn, it took a week between urging people to stop non-essential contact on March  and ordering full lockdown on March . These deadly blunders will no doubt be examined at a public inquiry, when andthe government eventually allows one. But late on that Sunday night, and in the days that followed, the politics of the pandemic briefly fell away as the Prime Minister fought for his le. And despite daily deaths topping  at that point, for some government staff working -hour days and steeped in data, here was suddenly a case that felt real. “It’s really easy to see things as statistics,” said one insider. “And then suddenly someone you work with really closely is in hospital and might die - it really brought it home and made it real. That is not to say we weren’t taking it seriously before, but it gave it emotional resonance.” They found the Tory leader’s decline “shocking and incredibly scary”. With few known treatments, “it felt like his le was in the hands of the fates. “Right nowyou have got Covid, the hospital know much more about it and the doctors are much better equipped to deal with it. “There was almost a sense ofhe goes on a ventilator - it’s   - it’s going to be a case of just waiting and seeinghe pulls through.” By the height of the second wave, more than , Brits would be on mechanical ventilation at a time. But Mr Johnson was lucky, and needed only oxygen. He spent only a week in hospital and was discharged to recover at Chequers - a fate not enjoyed by more than , who have died in the UK to date. But when each day was touch-and-go, his status as an incapacitated Prime Minister weighed heavily on No’s mind. Sir Mark Sedwill, then the Cabinet Secretary, has said there was a ‘Plan B’ forthe PM had died, with his deputy Dominic Raab assuming the top role.  Continuity of government of course is one of the key principles of anyoneaposs constitution,” he told Sky News last year. “And so we did make sure we had in place the measures necessary.” Aides and even MPs, however, wondered how long that plan might holdthe worst happens.While it’s claimed the “quad” of top ministers - Dominic Raab, Rishi Sunak, Michael Gove and Matt Hancock - were conspicuously behind the PM, one government advisor said there was a “whispering game” among some more junior MPs about what might happen next.Another said: “That Monday night it did feel very real. People were concerned about what it would mean - the impact this could have on the country. “There might be a succession but how long would that holdthere was a leadership contest  “This isn’t ancient Rome where you can anoint a leader to get through a crisis. The Tory party would probably quite quickly demand a leadership contest.” Yet there was no planning for a funeral, they said - at least not among political staff. “We were dealing with the immediate situation”, they said. They said the most striking thing about that period was the sheer lack of people in No - normally a hive of activity. They branded it a “ghost ship”, with another insider saying: “It felt eerie. “You know in horror movies where people start to drop off and you look around and that person has gone  It was like that. People kept dropping like flies.” "},{"url":null,"title":"what expect after lockdown june","story":"NewsWhat to expect after lockdown on June  - from Covid passports to twice-weekly testingEnglands coronavirus lockdown is due to end as early as June  though some restrictions or guidance could remain in place and some popular holiday destinations could remain off-limitsmirrorShareCommentsByChris KitchingSenior News Reporter:,  APR Updated:,  APR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video boris-johnson-confirms-next-stage-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:lJlMfT,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : #

What do you think of the Governmentaposs lockdown exit strategy  Join the conversation in the comments section below. Non-essential shops, pub beer gardens, hairdressers, gyms, zoos and libraries are among the places that will reopen next week. Step , which will allow indoor mixing of up to six people or two households and relax outdoor socialising rules, is due to go ahead on May  The fourth and final step, as early as June , will see all legal limits on mixing removed and the reopening of the last sectors to remain closed, such as nightclubs. The ban on large events will be lted. Asked what the future will look like after June , Mr Johnson told a Downing Street press conference: “I think a great deal depends on the continuing success of the vaccine rollout and us continuing to satisfy the four tests. “If things continue to go well, I do think for many people in many ways, le will begin to get back to at least some semblance of normality.”Here is a look at what le could be like once the lockdown ends.Covid passports  The Prime Minister favours a Covid passport scheme, or Covid status certication as he prefers to call it, despite a backlash from certain industries and backbench MPs. The details of this are still being hammered out as Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove reviews how and where to apply such a scheme, should it be approved by MPs. The Prime Minister said the Government is still “some way off finalising any plans” for so-called vaccine passports. According to an eight-page Downing Street paper, those who have tested positive for Covid- within the past  days would qualy for access to a venue or event requiring Covid certication. It said certication could be demonstrated by an up-to-date vaccine status, a negative lateral flow or PCR test taken at a test site on the same day or the day before their admission to a venue, or by proof of natural immunity.  The latest findings stressed that public transport and essential shops and services would never require Covid status certication, but it could play a role in allowing people toto theatres, nightclubs, and mass events such as festivals or sports fixtures. Reports have suggested that the review has not ruled out the possibility of introducing the scheme for pubs and restaurants by summeraposs end. Requiring customers to prove their status could “lay a role in reducing social distancing requirements in other settings which people tend to visit more frequently” such as pubs or restaurants, the Downing Street paper said. Trial events, including the FA Cup final at Wembley, the World Snooker Championship, nightclub events, and cinema screenings, will take place up until mid-May.

Mr Johnson stressed that a domestic certication scheme would not be introduced before either the April  easing of lockdown or the planned measures for May  which would see pubs and restaurants serving customers indoors. He said there were “ethical and practical issues” to sort out, and you have to be very careful how you handle this and don’t start a system that is discriminatory. Asked whether children will be required to have vaccine passports should they be implemented, Mr Johnson said: “We’re a way off implementing or enacting anything of the kind for anybody, let alone children. “I’ve spelt out the ways in which we might think of doing that but it’s not for steps two or three in any event.” More than  MPs, including  Conservatives, have signed a pledge to oppose the “isive and discriminatory use of Covid status certication”, suggesting the move could face defeat in the Commons. Mr Johnson said of a potential vote by MPs: “First of all we need to work out exactly what the proposal might be, but certainlythere is something to put to Parliament I have no doubt that we will be doing that. Twice-weekly testing Everyone in England is to be offered free, twice-weekly coronavirus tests as ministers prepare for the next stage of easing lockdown restrictions.The lateral flow tests – which can provide results in around  minutes – will be available from Friday, regardless of whether people have symptoms. People will be able to obtain a test through a home ordering service, workplace or school testing programme, or by collecting one at a local test site. The Prime Minister said the scheme would help stop fresh outbreaks, enabling the authorities to identy and control new iants of the disease. But critics have raised concerns about  positives forcing people to unnecessarily self-isolate. The Prime Minister said a future involving continuous Covid- testing would not be “too onerous”. He said he regularly uses quick-result tests before visiting somewhere to check whether he has coronavirus as he urged the public in England to take up the offer of free tests. Social distancing A study into whether social distancing guidance will continue after June , when all restrictions are due to be scrapped, is dependent on the findings of Michael Gove ’s vaccine passport review, the document added.A vaccine passport scheme could allow venues such as pubs and restaurants to dump the social distancing requirement. Chief scientic adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said he expected regular hand washing and the recommendation for people to stay home from workthey feel ill to become baselines of social distancing in the future. Englandaposs chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty, asked about when hugging and other interactions could resume, said current coronavirus rates were still too high. The number of people who actually have the virus at the moment is about one in  so we really want to get those rates down further before we start to feel that society as a whole has a low level of Covid, he said. Modelling released today by SAGE shortly before Boris Johnsonaposs lockdown announcement suggested that some measures will be required to keep infection down even with the vaccine rollout. They believe some restrictions such as social distancing may have to be maintained until this time next year. Face masksFace covering are currently mandatory in places such as supermarkets and on public transport.Some experts have predicted they may be required through the rest of the year and into  in many closed spaces. Passengers will be asked to wear face masks on Ryanair flights potentially until , the airline’s boss, Michael OaposLeary, said last month. Foreign holidays  A traffic light system for international travel will be brought in to allow foreign travel, although it remains too early to declare whether trips abroad can freely continue after May , according to the global travel taskforce. Travel to green list nations require no quarantine onto the UK, although tests will still be required. It means some high-risk destinations will continue to be off-limits. It could be some time before Britons are allowed to visit relatives or friends living in aposred listapos countries. Britons will also have to comply with any local restrictions or requirements at their destination. Mr Johnson said he was hopeful international travel could resume next month but he did not want to make “hostages of fortune”. Vaccine boosters The Government has vowed to offer every adult in the UK a coronavirus vaccine by the end of July. First and second doses are being administered  weeks apart. And experts have said it is likely that people will require a regular booster jab in the future. Professor Whitty said it is “vital” that people take up the offer of a second vaccine dose to increase their level of protection against Covid- Mr Johnson added on Monday: “The crucial thing is for everyone to get out and get their vaccination when you’re asked to come forward and get your second dose when you are asked to come forward. Third wave   Experts have warned that the UK could be hit by a third wave of Covid later this year, though the timing is anyoneaposs guess. Some have predicted it could happen this summer, while others have said it could be in the autumn or winter.Sage papers warn there could be a late summer surge after restrictions are eased, and it could be almost as bad as that seen in late January when hospitals were nearly overwhelmed.The papers cast doubt on the timeline for steps  and  on the road map. As he said the lockdown changes in England were “fully justied” but urged the public not to be complacent, Mr Johnson said: “We can see the waves of sickness afflicting other countries and we’ve seen how this story goes. “We still don’t know how strong the vaccine shield will be when cases begin to rise, as I’m afraid they will, and that’s why we’re saying please get your vaccine or your second dose when the turn comes. “And please use the free NHS tests evenyou don’t feel ill.” Is this the last lockdown  "},{"url":null,"title":"your questions april 12 lockdown","story":"NewsYour questions about April  lockdown changes - including work, pubs and familyOn April  non-essential shops can reopen, along with hairdressers and beauty salons.

So what comes next  We look at vaccine passports, summer holidays and other landmarks on the roadmap out of lockdown. What will change with step  of the lockdown roadmap  The Government has confirmed all changes pencilled in for April  will go ahead. Non-essential shops can reopen, along with hairdressers and beauty salons. Pubs and restaurants can serve customers outdoors. Gyms can reopen, as can zoos, theme parks, libraries and museums. Holidays in England will be allowed – but only in self-catered accommodation. Indoor social mixing between dferent households is still banned until May  at the earliest. But scientists yesterday cast doubt that the next stages of easing – on May  and June  – will go ahead as planned. Should I still work from home  If you can work from home then you should, despite the aposstay at homeapos order lting on  March. Use of public transport is allowed for any reason but people are advised to minimise how often they take the bus or the underground. The work from home guidance is only expected to change from June  at the earliest – with many employers not planning to have staff back for months more.  Can I go to the pub yet  It will be another few days before punters canto beer gardens for a long-awaited pint with hospitality venues also be able to serve takeaway drinks from April . However limits around social contact will remain in place, so you have to abide by the rule of six or apostwo householdapos limits. Indoor areas of pubs, restaurants and cafes will not be allowed to open until Step  of the roadmap, from May  at the earliest. Drinkers may have to show proof of vaccination or a negative test.  What about hugging my Grandma  Even though you can meet outdoors, government scientists are still warning people not to hug those not in their household or bubble. You should maintain two-metre social distancing where possible, or one metre with mitigations. This rule is only due to be reviewed ahead of May , when many more Brits will have had a first dose of the vaccine. Even then, you should think twice about putting vulnerable loved ones at risk.  Can I visit relatives in a care home  Care home residents in England will be allowed two regular visitors indoors from  April. Currently people in care homes can have just one face-to-face visitor, but as part of the next step of lockdown easing it will be extended to two. They will be able to hold hands - but visitors must be tested and wear PPE. Visitors will also be able to bring babies and young children with them, meaning some residents could meet grandchildren for the first time as community infection rates drop and the vaccine rollout continues.  Can I book my summer holiday  Foreign travel is currently illegal under lockdown rules, except in limited circumstances such as for work or to attend a funeral, with ministers reviewing how it can resume from May  at the earliest. But staycations in England are allowed from April  - as long as you stay in self-contained accommodation with your own household. Holidays with other households in England will not be allowed until at least May . You canapost travel to stay overnight with friends and family before that date.  Will I have to take regular Covid testing  All adults in England are going to be offered free, twice-weekly tests – and ministers say they will be key to the continued easing of lockdown. The lateral flow tests - which can provide results in around  minutes - will be available from Friday, regardless of whether people have symptoms. Anybody in England will be able to order a test kit to their home, pick one up at a local site or through a workplace or school programme. But there are some concerns over  positives which could suggest the disease is making a comeback.  Will le finally go back to normal on June   Boris Johnson suggested le will begin to get back to “some semblance” of normality from step  of the roadmap but this will rely on twice-weekly Covid testing, vaccine passports, the jabs roll-out and new iants that may arrive from abroad.Scientists yesterday cast doubt on whether Covid rules can be fully relaxed on June , warning that some restrictions such as social distancing may have to be maintained until this time next year.  Vaccine passportsWhat are vaccine passports  The certicates would prove whether you have had a jab, a negative Covid test or a recent antibody test to prove immunity from the virus. The idea is to provide reassurance that you are less likely to spread the virus. The NHS is looking at digital options for proof of Covid status, such as an app on your phone, and the existing NHS app could be used. Paper certicates are also being considered to make sure people without smartphones are not excluded.  Will it be used for foreign holidays  Vaccine passports were originally considered for this reason, as some countries may require travellers to prove they have had the jab. The Government wanted to develop some sort of proof of vaccine status so British holidaymakers wouldn’t miss out. Travellers are already required to get Covid tests before going abroad and many countries will ask for proof of a negative result, so the certicate could help with this.  What about at football matches and big events  The idea will be trialled as part of pilots for managing theof crowds to big events. Initial pilots starting this month on events like the FA Cup semi final and the World Snooker Championships will focus on pre-arrival tests. But later pilots will include data on vaccination and immunity, the Government says. Officials think the idea could factor into allowing more spectators at concerts, theatre shows and sports matches, as well as allowing social distancing rules to be relaxed. Will I need it in the pub  Pubs and restaurants are not expected to ask for Covid certicates when they start reopening for outdoor hospitality next week. But the Government hasn’t ruled it out. The review says the Government cannot ban businesses for asking customers to provide proof of their Covid status - as long as they comply with equalities rules. What about shops and public transport  Shops, public transport and other essential services will never ask for vaccine passports to ensure fair access for all, the Government says. Ministers are worried about excluding people for vital services so the review is clear that “some settingswhere Covid-status certication should never be required”. Do other countries use them  Ministers have been looking at the “Green Pass” used in Israel, which allows fully vaccinated citizens to go to hotels, gyms and theatres. Denmark has developed a “Coronapas” to use domestically to allow people to access services such as hairdressers, restaurants and cinemas.  Will MPs get a vote on it  Yes. The Government says interim findings will be presented to Parliament later this month to ensure the plan is properly scrutinised. The Prime Minister could face a revolt from MPs over the plan as  Tories have expressed concern. Labour and the Liberal Democrats are also worried about the idea. Why are people concerned  There are ethical concerns that the plan could lay the groundwork for making people show their ID at all times - a move which has traditionally been resisted. There are issues about privacy and security of people’s sensitive health data. Fears have also been raised about possible discrimination against people who cannot get the jab for medical reasons or younger people still waiting their turn. Foreign travelWill international travel resume as planned  Boris Johnson sounded pretty cautions on foreign travel yesterday as cases continue to soar across Europe, prompting fears of new iants arriving in the UK. The PM said he was “hopeful” of getting going after May  but does not “wish to give hostages to fortune”. Leaving the UK without an essential reason – such as work or a family bereavement - is currently illegal.  Can I book a holiday abroad  For the moment, the Government is advising people not to book summer holidays abroad until the picture is clearer. The global travel taskforce, chaired by Transport Secretary Grant Shapps will publish details of the new traffic light system later this week. An official review published yesterday said ministers still hoped people would be able to take a summer holiday abroad this year but warned it was “still too soon to know what is possible” - and that foreign travel could be delayed beyond the middle of May. What will the traffic light system be based on  Once the ban on non-essential travel is lted, the Government is planning a traffic light system determining which countries Brits can visit this summer and under what conditions. It will be based on a range of factors - including the proportion of a given countryaposs population that has been vaccinated, rates of infection, emerging new iants and the countryaposs access to reliable scientic data and genomic sequencing.  What will I have to do to travel to a “green list” country  Quarantine for ing Brits will only be dropped for countries on the green list although they will still have to pay for pre-departure and post-arrival tests. These are likely to be aposgold standardapos PCR tests rather than cheaper lateral flow ones, adding hundreds of pounds to the cost of a family holiday. The document said it was too early to say which countries would be on the green list although ministers expect a limited number at the start.  And what about “amber list” ones  Travellers from amber list countries where there is a medium risk including from iants will be required to have a pre-departure test, then quarantine on arrival for up to ten days. They will have to take a PCR test on days two and eight with the option of a test on the fth to be released,negative, from quarantine.  What will be requiredI travel to a “red listapos country  British, Irish and third-country nationals with residence rights - including long-term visa holders - face hotel quarantine of up to  daysthey arrive from red list countries at a cost of £, per person, with tests on days two and eight. Direct flights could still be restricted from countries on this list - which currently number almost .

But perhaps the worst of all is catfishing, something mum-of-two Samantha Thorne knows all too well. The -year-old has suffered dating disaster after dating disaster online, and she was catfished  times in a year. Samantha joined the app after her second orce and was initially optimistic after matching with hunky blokes. But she quickly realised she was a magnet for aposcatfishersapos - men whose profiles did not match their full or true self. The beautician had a drink with a man whose photos were so fake she didnapost realise sheaposd actually already dated him in the past. She also came across a potential suitor who was using a male modelaposs photos on his profile, and a bloke who asked her on a date in order to swap her - at a swingers club. A year of dating disasters somewhat put her off the app for a while until she tried again last year and met her now partner David Tyson, . Happy in love, she found her old aposdating diaryapos and has turned it into a book.  Samantha, from Dartford, Kent, said: I decided Iaposd give it a go - I was looking seriously because I wanted to find someone to settle down with. When I first started, I trusted everyone would be who they said they were - but the more people I spoke to, the more I learned people are not always who they say they are. It was a strange time in my le - it was fun at times, but you definitely need a thick skin. But Iaposve got my happy ending now with my new man - so I wonapost be using dating websites again!  Samanthaaposs bizarre year of internet dating began after her second marriage came to an end. She went on around two dates per week throughout  using the dating websites. The mum to son Owen, now , and daughter Daisy, now , was aposcatfishedapos more than  times in a year. She said one of her most memorable truth-bending experiences was meeting up with an undercover swinger. After a really good first date for drinks in a local pub, where he appeared normal, kind and interesting, she was excited for their second date.  But things took a bizarre turn when he suggested they attend an adultaposs sex club for aposswingersapos to swap partners with other members. Samantha said: When he said there was somewhere he wanted to take me, I envisioned a nice restaurant - but he told me he aposwanted to get other people involvedapos. I thought it was a joke at first because heaposd never even hinted -thataposs your interest itaposs the kind of thing you should mention on your profile! I was pretty disappointed because we got on so well at first. Samanthaaposs second online dating disaster happened just a couple of months later when she began chatting with a man who claimed to be a rich model. After speaking every day for more than a week, she was convinced he was genuine and they were planning to meet for drinks.  But a suspicious friend had some questions and began some behind-the-scenes detective work. Reverse image searches revealed the so-called modelaposs photos had been stolen from an American online modelling portfolio. Samantha had no idea who sheaposd been speaking to for a week. She said: I had been sucked in - but it became clear his story was fake after we began digging. He sensed Iaposd figured it out and blocked me straight away - so I have no idea who I was speaking to for a week of my le! But Samantha said her most unusual date was meeting up with someone who looked so dferent to his profile that she didnapost realise sheaposd already dated him in the past.  Samantha said his pictures obscured his appearance so much - using clever angles and good lighting - that he looked much slimmer and younger than in reality. She said: I walked into the bar to meet him and as soon as I saw him, even with his back to me, I knew Iaposd met him for a date about seven years earlier. I was adamant weaposd met before - but when I pointed it out, he argued against me and accused me of lying! She sat through the date awkwardly, waiting to leave - exactly the same way as she had done seven years earlier. She said: There had been no initial attraction or chemistry back then, and there still wasnapost the second time round.

Prof Neil Ferguson said risk appeared to be age related, as calls are mounted for the jab to be limited for younger people. A total of  brain clot cases were found in .million patients - the equivalent of one in every , people or . per cent. Prof Ferguson, who has had the Oxford jab, told the Today programme: In terms of the data at the moment, there is increasing evidence that there is a rare risk associated, particularly with the AstraZeneca vaccine but it may be associated at a lower level with other vaccines, of these unusual blood clots with low platelet counts. It appears that risk is age related, it may possible be - but the data is weaker on this - related to sex. And so the older you are, the less the risk is and also the higher the risk is of Covid so the risk-benefit equation really points very much towards being vaccinated.Have you had the vaccine yet  Let us know in the commentsI think it becomes slightly more complicated when you get to younger age groups where the risk-benefit equation is more complicated. Prof Ferguson said the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agencyand the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationwere considering this matter very urgently but added: No vaccine, no medicine is risk free - it is always about a balancing equation against risk. The MHRA is looking into whether people below the age of  should not be given the AstraZeneca jab, Channel  News reports. If it goes ahead with such a restriction, it would be the first of its kind in the UK and could considerably slow the final stages of the roll out. According to a report on Channel  News on Monday: Two senior sources have told this programme that while the data is still unclear, there are growing arguments to justy offering younger people - below the age of  at the very least - a dferent vaccine.  The MHRA said later on Monday that no decision had been taken. The health regulator previously said the benefits of the vaccine in the prevention of Covid- far outweighed any possible risk of blood clots and that people should continue to get their vaccine when invited to do so. Our thorough and detailed review is ongoing into reports of very rare and specic types of blood clots with low platelets following the Covid- Vaccine AstraZeneca, Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency Chief Executive June Raine said. No decision has yet been made on any regulatory action. Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi confirmed this morning that the government would change or restrict use of the AstraZeneca vaccineit is advised to by the UK’s independent regulator. The top Tory told BBC Radio ’s Today programme thatthe evidence changes, “we will implement anything they tell us otherwise”.

Another traveller, a retired IT worker, claims airline staff refused to let him and six others board the plane to Alicante due to “arbitrary rules made up on behalf of another country”.The angry Brit, named only as Alec, told the Olive Press he checked the UK Governmentaposs latest guidance, which stated that his buying a property on the Costa Blanca was one of the reasonable excuses for travel to Spain under Covid lockdown rules.Have you had a similar experience  Email webnews@mirror  But he said he was turned away at the gate on Monday because he and the others did not have a post-Brexit TIE card, a new biometric card issued to British residents in Spain since July last year. Alec claims Ryanair staff got it wrong and he should have been allowed to fly. The UK Governmentaposs exemptions for international travel from England include flying to carry out activities related to buying, selling, letting or renting a residential property. In such a scenario, travellers are advised to show evidence such as proof of a contract, a letter or appointment details from estate agent, or a relevant contract or letters detailing sales.

He claims airline staff were unable to provide any evidence to back up their decision to bar the group from travelling, and were not willing to discuss the matter any further. Alec and Mr Carey claimed a woman with Italian citizenship was travelling back to her family also living in Spain, but she was also denied boarding, leaving her in tears.Mr Carey, a property owner in Spain who was travelling to see his sons, aged six and eight, for Easter Monday, claims Ryanair staff were rude and abrupt and the situation was a total disgrace, the Olive Press reported. He showed proof that his TIE card application has been accepted, but was turned away after he mistakenly showed an out-of-date Covid test. He said he looked through his bag for a valid one, but when he ed to the gate he was told it was shut and he could not board. Mr Carey, an accountant, was sent back to security where he allegedly had to wait an hour for a Ryanair employee to escort him through to landside. He claimed: They seemed to be on a mission with everyone. It was a total disgrace. The treatment of people by Ryanair at Manchester was deplorable. Mr Carey claimed a married couple was also turned away from the flight. He was forced to book a fight from Heathrow, via Madrid. A passenger said: Given that so many Brits are having to be flown back at the airlineaposs expense, I wonderthis was merely a cost-cutting exercise for Ryanair.  Flight FR left Manchester Airport just after am on Monday and arrived in Alicante about two hours and  minutes later, according to online flight trackers. The Mirror has contacted Ryanair for comment. Last week, Britons were refused entry to Spain at Alicanteaposs airport and sent back to the UK by border staff who were overzealous, it was reported. It comes amid confusion over travel rules during the Covid pandemic and following Brexit. It is illegal to travel abroad from the UK for holidays, but there is a handful of “reasonable excuses”, including work, education and the buying of property.

Iceland’s managing director Richard Walker wants online sales taxed in an overhaul of “outdated and ­Victorian” business rates. Bricks and mortar shops are believed to pay more in corporation tax and national insurance payments for staff than online giants. Shops also have the added costs of running a premises. Mr Walker said: “I think we need a digital sales tax and I say that with a business with a really strong online ­business. You need to completely change business rates as they are. “But there also has to be some form of rebalancing with online because ­otherwise we will be killing off the high street as it is.” His call comes after Iceland was criticised for keeping hold of business rates relief for the past financial year, despite continuing to trade as an essential retailer through ­lockdown periods. At the onset of the pandemic, the Chancellor announced a business rates holiday for retailers for the year but more than £billion in relief was handed back by some supermarkets who saw higher customer demand. Mr Walker said Iceland was right to take the relief at the time but was not taking extended tax relief announced by Government in February. “We absolutely believe that we have come to the right ­decision,” he added. “You look at some of the companies who paid it back, like Asda and Sainsbury’s – they then announced thousands of job cuts after. Having that relief meant we could preserve jobs, that’s what it was given to the sector to do. And actually, we’ve since been able to create jobs. “So now, we felt that further support was not needed so won’t take the extension.”  The Mirror’s Shop for Britain campaign is urging the nation to support ­struggling retailers when non-essential retail can reopen on Monday. Retailers have lost £billion of sales and thousands of shops have closed in the pandemic. A Mirror poll found  per cent of those quizzed are worried about the future of their local shops and other ­businesses. But the Deltapoll survey revealed just  per cent of people plan to visit stores in the first week of their reopening – but that rises to  per cent in the first month. But  per cent said they did not envisage ever going back to the shops. Shop owners have this week told shoppers: “Use us or lose us.” Traditional retailers pay far more in business rates than online-only rivals. According to think-tank TaxWatch’s study last year, five of the biggest tech companies operating in the UK ­generated profits estimated at £.bn from British customers in . Yet they paid only £million in taxes on these profits in the UK – an effective tax rate of just . per cent.In February high street chiefs joined forces with supermarket bosses to call for Chancellor Rishi Sunak to overhaul the tax system to put digital retail giants such as Amazon on a “level playing field”.Tesco went even further in calling for a  per cent online sales tax.

And he also gave an update on the introduction of vaccine passports and travelling abroad for later this year. Professor Chris Whitty warned that the country will face signicant problems with Covid for the foreseeable future as society is unlocked further from April . Step , which will allow indoor mixing of up to six people or two households and relax outdoor socialising rules, is due to go ahead on May . The fourth and final step, from June , will see all legal limits on mixing removed and the reopening of the last sectors to remain closed, such as nightclubs. The ban on large events will be lted. While some businesses are rejoicing at being told they will re-open next week many indoor venues will stay shut until at least the third step of the roadmap Cinemas, theatres, concert halls and adventure playgrounds are among those who will have to hold their breath with May  earmarked as the next possible date they might once again welcome punters. What wonapost be reopening next week after beer gardens, shops, gyms and hairdressers given go-ahead  -Cinemas Cinemas, as well as other indoor entertainment, will be able to open as part of the third phase of the roadmap. This is still expected to be no earlier than May , but depends on the Covid situation changing.  Drive-in cinemas will be able to open earlier, and can begin screening movies to an outdoor audience from Monday. -Theatres and concert halls Also set to re-open in mid-May are theatres and concert halls. But final numbers for maximum capacity limits at these indoor events has not yet been confirmed once venues reopen. -Museums and galleries Indoor venues will not re-open next week and May  remains the target date set by the government. This includes museums and galleries. Outdoor museums, however, are set to open up to the public. The government has previously said that tests must be met on the Covid picture before moving into the next stage and so these dates remain conditional. All of the below will not re-open next week -Adventure playgrounds and bowling alleys -Amusement arcades, adult gaming centres, bingo halls and casinos -Skating rinks -Entertainment venues such as escape rooms and laser quest -Play areas, including soft play centres and inflatable parks -Model villages "},{"url":null,"title":"life wont able return normal","story":"NewsLe wont be able toto normal on June , government scientists warnSenior SAGE advisors have said that despite the success of the mass vaccination project it isnt good enough to see all restrictions ltedmirrorShareCommentsByWilliam WalkerNews Reporter:,  APR NewsBoris Johnson has confirmed the relaxation of measures from Monday \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

They said they are aposreasonably confidentapos that Covid will become manageable by that point. In papers released by SAGE the expert group was said to be confident that easing lockdown restrictions would not heap pressure on the NHS, eventhere is a rise in infections, due to the success of the jab rollout. “Any resurgence in hospital admissions and deaths following Step  of the Roadmap alone is highly unlikely to put unsustainable pressure on the NHS,” SAGE said in the minutes of a March  meeting, published on Monday.  But the advisory  is not as optimistic about the later stages of the roadmap. In a stark warning the papers claimed it is aposhighly likely that there will be a further resurgence in hospitalisations and deaths.apos SAGE cited work compiled by the Scientic Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling , which looked at models made by Imperial College London, Warwick University and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. SPI-M said that a new peak could occur in summer or autumn, and that its timing and size would depend on how people behave after restrictions end. “It is highly likely that there will be a further resurgence in hospitalisations and deaths after the later steps of the Roadmap,” SPI-M said.

Her mood was worsened by chronic pain caused by fibromyalgia, which also made her want to comfort eat. Natalie, from Moulton, Northamptonshire, kept eating until her weight hit  stone - when she realised she had to make a change. The stay-at-home mum started following a low-carb Keto diet and exercising lightly, but still struggled with sugar cravings.Do you have a view on this story  Email webnews@mirror or let us know in the comments below.It was then that Natalia discovered her magic tool - a vanilla-scented aposweight lossapos stick which tricks the brain.

Now in the third lockdown, Natalie has shed three stone and dropped five dress sizes to a slinky size six. She said: Iaposm as thin as I was at  years old now and I feel amazing. During the first lockdown, I was really ill with my fibromyalgia and went through existing everyday and not wanting to live.  I just hated myself. I used to binge terribly on sugary foods in the height of what I now know was fibromyalgia. I would devour a full box of chocolates or a big bag of crisps by myself, because it was so hard for me to stop. When I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia, it was a lightbulb moment for me and thataposs when I decided I wanted to look after myself. I started to look into biohacking and saw someone write a piece on a product that tricks your brain into thinking itaposs had sugar, called KillaVanilla. Itaposs worked fantastically for me. I just have to snf the nasal stick for two minutes and it stops me from binging on chocolate and sweet things.  Iaposve been to rock bottom and have come out the other side and I want to inspire others with my story. My weight has always yo-yoed so through the years Iaposve lost weight through dieting but then I would just go back to my old habits again. I was in a sugar binge all day - it wasnapost always chocolate but also bread, pasta and rice because they also contain small amounts of sugar. I was in a horrible cycle of loathing myself everyday because I would try and be good with what I ate but then Iaposd end up binging after pm.

Landowners are taking advantage of the “astronomical” demand for domestic holidays this summer with hundreds of temporary sites expected to open around the UK. A relaxation in the law allows pop-up sites to open for  days without planning permission this year, up from  in a normal year. Dan Yates, managing director of camping booking  Pitchup, said the extension of permitted development rights, announced by the Government in November, has boosted the sector during the pandemic. Many of the pop-ups are away from tourist hotspots and some distance from the coast. He said: “The camping market is the one market able to respond to this unprecedented growth demand we are expecting this year. “The types of locations are really fascinating and not the sort we’ve seen before – race courses and county showgrounds for example. Many shire counties have had to cancel county shows and this has been a great way to recoup some of those losses. “There are lots of farms.

In fact, on Saturday, Dundee probably should#ve found a way past Zander Clark at Dens Park.From Paul McMullan#s thunderous strike from distance crashing off the bar, to Danny Mullen#s disallowed goal early in the second half and, most of all, Clark#s penalty save from Charlie Adam with  minutes to go.Dundee had their opportunities.Saints limited them to efforts from distance in the first period but the second half saw the hosts really assert their authority.Unable to even force extra time felt like a harsh outcome for McPake#s men but the Dee gaffer was happy with the spirit shown, regardless.“I thought my players were excellent to a man and gave everything for the football club,# he said.“They left nothing out there and are very unlucky not to be in the next round of the cup.“It’s disappointing in that respect, because we wanted to go through, but credit to Callum and St Johnstone they are in the hat for the next round.“I’m proud of my players.“I don’t think we were unlucky. I won’t use that.“I think we were the better team. We had to capitalise when we were on top and we didn’t.“You can put that down to good defending – they have shown that all season and you have to give them credit.“As much as we were the team on top and chasing the game, they held strong.“We missed the penalty but I think that’s down to a good save. He gets a hand to it and he keeps it.“Charlie strikes the ball very well whenever he strikes it.“McMullan had a shot that hits the bar and I can’t really remember them troubling us other than the goal.”He continued: “It sounds like sour grapes when I say the better team lost it but I am here to give my honest views about what I saw out there and I will stand by that.“I will watch it back but I don’t think I will change my views. I have before but I don’t think I will this time.“I am very proud of my players, the way they handled going behind against a Premiership team who have won a cup and going for a European place.“I have been asked all week: #Is it about seeing where you#re at ##No, it was about progressing in the cup and we are bitterly disappointed we’ve not.”Of course, the assumption is Dundee will use such a strong performance against Premiership opposition to kick on with their push for promotion to the top table.Securing a play-off berth, preferably second spot, is crucial for a club set up for top-flight football.For McPake, though, as much as the focus turns to two huge second-tier tussles with Ayr United tomorrow and Morton at the weekend, his mind is still haunted by what could#ve been.It#s a huge week for the club but he insists their cup exit does sting as he dissected Mullen#s disallowed goal.The striker, who stabbed home inside the box after Saints keeper Clark spilled Jordan Marshall#s cross, was adjudged offside by the far side linesman.McPake was booked by referee Craig Napier for his protestations and continued to contest the call post-match.“I’ve seen it from three dferent angles and I’ve not changed my mind,# he argued.“He has guessed, in my opinion. Credit to himhe’s got it right – what a callhe has.“How he can see that, from the three angles I’ve seen, Danny is offside – I’m not sure.“Initially they gave the free-kick for a foul on the goalkeeper and quickly changed their mind to offside.“I’m told it’s a dferent signal with the flag when someone is offside to when it’s a foul.“Maybe my booking was right – you can get booked for anything nowadays.“You show any sort of emotion and the linesman was quick to tell the referee to come and caution the coach.“I’m not surethat’s right but that’s part of football now and I need to learn that and maybe not show emotion, which would make football worse, in my opinion.“It’s not why we lost the football game, we lost because St Johnstone scored and we couldn’t.“In my opinion, we scored a perfectly good goal.“We missed a penalty – it was a good save from Zander Clark, Charlie was unlucky.“At a time when you’re on top, it is really crucial you get a goal and, in my opinion, we got a perfectly good goal chopped off.“If it is an honest mistake, I can accept, but what I can’t accept is people guessing.“There are people in there, late on in their careers wanting a cup run, there are young coaches on our bench and on Callum’s bench so it shouldn’t be down to people just guessing.“You have to be % right. Listen, it might show he is right but, from seeing it in real time, it’s a guess.#At times this season McPake has cut a defeated figure, desperate almost, but it#s good to hear him sounding fired up.Hopefully, that transmits to his team and they use the disappointment of a cup exit as fuel to get back to mixing it with the big boys on a regular basis.I certainly won#t be betting against them.JIM SPENCE: Mark Ogren is planning a golf course # but a shared stadium for Dundee United and Dundee would be a real hole in one\" title\"#JIM SPENCE: Mark Ogren is planning a golf course # but a shared stadium for Dundee United and Dundee would be a real hole in one# # The Courier\" src\"https:www.thecourier fp opinion jim-spence  jim-spence-mark-ogren-golf-shared-stadium-dundee-united-dundee embed # secretmmOIBTFzm\" data-secret\"mmOIBTFzm\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/syndicatenews/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/11/20010666_37021484-e1606041413768-940x564.jpg ","title":"dundee fc liam fontaine scottish premiership ayr united","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remLiam Fontaine has urged his Dundee team-mates to put in the #hard graft# as they look to gain promotion to the Premiership.The Dark Blues travel to Ayr tomorrow night and welcome Morton to Dens Park on Saturday in what is a huge week for the club#s Championship campaign.Centre-half Fontaine has called it #the business end of the season# as they head into the final six games before the play-offs.With Hearts running away with the title, the Dee are aiming for second spot to give themselves the best chance of beating top-flight opposition in the post-season.Despite the - defeat, Fontaine insists Dundee can take heart from their Scottish Cup performance at home to St Johnstone on Saturday.He believes it shows they can compete with top-tier opposition on their day as they look to end the season strong.“When we’ve played against Premiership teams, even when we played Hibs earlier in the season , I think we’ve given them good games,# the -year-old said.“We’ve got to do the hard graft in the league we’re in at the moment.“We’ve got to put performances in like that week in, week out and be consistent.“We keep saying it but we have to keep our performances up there each game so we’ll recover now for a big game tomorrow.“The motivation is always there to get to the top league, whatever country you play in.“We’re in a good position at the moment, we’ve just got to win our games and, hopefully, we can secure a play-off spot and push on from there.”Currently sitting in third spot in the second-tier standings, three points behind Raith Rovers, Fontaine knows the importance of the Dee#s run-in.He believes they have enough quality in the squad to achieve their goals and is happy to have linked up at Dens Park # looking to secure a third Championship promotion of his career.The former Hibs and Ross County man continued: “It’s the business end of the season, we’re in a good position and,we can perform consistently like that and bring that work-rate and creativity, we’ll be well placed.“When I was out of contract I had a few options but I wanted to go somewhere that, one, it was a good club, two, there was a squad being built there and, three, the manager.“We’ve got a good squad here, young players with good energy and I think from Saturday you can see they can cause anyone problems.“St Johnstone are a very, very good team at keeping people out and, yeah, we didn’t score on Saturday but the chances were there and on another day we score goals and progress.”As for their cup exit at the hands of Callum Davidson#s Perth men, thanks to a goal from Guy Melamed, Fontaine felt a little hard done by.The Dark Blues competed well with the top-six, Betfred Cup-winning Saints, particularly in the second half.Danny Mullen saw a goal chalked off for offside, though there was some confusion with some believing it was ruled out for a foul on away goalkeeper Zander Clark.Clark then gave away a penalty as he clattered Mullen inside the area. However, the Saints stopper made amends, stooping low to this left to deny Charlie Adam from  yards.Fontaine believes on another day those moments would have gone Dundee#s way in a match they dominated.“I thought it was a good cup tie and we left everything out there,# he added.“On another day we progress. We created quite a few chances andthe penalty goes in or the goal is given that was chalked off we’re in the next round.“Apart from that, it was a positive performance from our point of view.“Penalty stops happen and the goalie made a good save.“It’s more the time it took before the goal was chalked off.“There wasn’t really a certain decision. It’s disappointing but we didn’t let it effect us.“We kept going and went for it and, like I said, on another day we at least go to extra time.”JIM SPENCE: Mark Ogren is planning a golf course # but a shared stadium for Dundee United and Dundee would be a real hole in one\" title\"#JIM SPENCE: Mark Ogren is planning a golf course # but a shared stadium for Dundee United and Dundee would be a real hole in one# # The Courier\" src\"https:www.thecourier fp opinion jim-spence  jim-spence-mark-ogren-golf-shared-stadium-dundee-united-dundee embed # secretnxoLndFQk\" data-secret\"nxoLndFQk\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/04/2.45816672-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/04/2.45816672-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/04/2.45816672-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/04/2.45816672-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"gym worker in dundee sees poetry work popularity soar during lockdown","story":"A city gym worker who has spent lockdown fine tuning her poetry writing has been earning rave reviews for her works over the past  months.

shows and the benefit it has brought.“This all started really early in the first lockdown when I was painting the salon in my old togs one night,” he said.“It was something to keep me busy because so I thought do a few songs and it all just went from there.“The response has been amazing.”Grateful fans have sent donations to fund vital pieces of equipment for Tayside hospitals with the £, total.“The amount of cards and messages we have had from people saying how much it has helped them get through this is just fantastic,” added Danny.“I think that’s a major positive of this whole situation.“People have been making connections with each other, evenit’s just online, and realising just how important it is to talk about things which may be getting to you.“If you’ve got a niggle in your knee, you are quick enough to go to the doctor and get it checked because you know it might get worse.“We need people to get their mental wellness checked out just as quickly and I think people are realising more how important it is.”He added: “It will be full on for us now we are back but I’m not doing the hours I did the last time lockdown was lted.“We were starting at five in the morning and going on into the night, but I just can’t do that again.“The clients are there, they are coming back to us and they have said they are willing to wait.”“We’ll keep singing, but just on the first Saturday of every month and I hope folk will still enjoy that.”Danny’s lockdown performances also included one from the Angus town’s Webster Theatre.It was organised by Angus Alive to give Danny the full stage to perform on # albeit without an audience – a few months into lockdown.The Mowatts enjoyed a similarly enthusiastic worldwide response to their music – paused by a dramatic heart attack scare for Alan.He took unwell during a July performance, but the -year-old sang on after a quick break and a glass of water.A trip to hospital revealed he had suffered a heart attack and Alan underwent a triple bypass.He and Val were back at the microphone before the end of the year and have continued to keep their Facebook audience entertained since then.Newsletter Get top stories

I#m mind blown. We opened on Wednesday for the first time, then Thursday and opened on Saturday and Sunday at the weekend.#It was crazy. On Wednesday and Thursday we were mainly focused on bread, and at the weekend we decided to launch the cinnamon buns # we thought it would make a nice weekend treat.#I don#t think I expected them to be that popular. I was in the bakery working away and focused on that. Someone came in as we opened and said #Do you realised you have a queue right the way down the road #. There was blocks and blocks of people queuing.#I was totally amazed by the support. Opening the business we want it to be popular and successful and the support really acknowledged that and showed me it was everything I had wanted it to be. The response has been incredible and has been beyond what I expected.#Selling out each day before lunchtime, Pete#s business, which has been part-funded by a successful community Crowdfunder, has proven extremely popular and says the support from those living locally has been #incredible#.With queues of at least  people deep at the weekend, Pete said while it has been great to see so many people coming along, it has been #nerve-wracking# in trying to keep up with demand.#Each day I#ve been in at .am. On the Wednesday I didn#t sit down until .pm. All of the work which we#ve put in up to this point and since opening, when you see it being so positively received and so popular, it just makes it all worth it,# said Pete.#I made as much as I physically could. Every day we opened up at am and we were sold out by around .am or noon. There#s so many people who are really happy that we#re open and we#ve had massive support from the French community in Aberdeen who are excited about an artisan bread maker opening in the city. There#s some people who have followed my journey from my days from working at vegan cafe, Foodstory, who have been looking forward to it, too.#Because I was inside and so focused on what I was doing I had no idea what was happening outside. I couldn#t believe it when the customers were telling us the queues were right down the road. It was amazing, but a little nerve-wracking!#With cinnamon buns in hot demand and selling out within the hour, and some days within half an hour, Pete is determined to bring this sweet treat back to the bakery this week and will focus on baking as much as he can in advance to ensure all of his customers can get his hands on one this weekend.#The sourdough we#ve been making has been really popular and selling really well. I#ve been making focaccia which I#ve topped with a seasoning dust which I get from a producer called Tubby Toms and there#s one which is a vegan baking dust which tastes like Frazzles crispy bacon crisps, a garlic and herb one and a Cajun spiced seasoning.#We#re still trying to figure out what our maximum capacity is. I made around  cinnamon buns on Saturday and they were gone within about  minutes. On Sunday I made maybe around , and they were gone within an hour.#We use a lot of spelt and get it from a farm just outside Aberdeen and we#ve got a flour mill in the bakery so we make our own flour fresh. We had a spelt loaf with brown sugar and it was super popular. All of our products are vegan at the moment.#My we Sarah was helping out at the weekend and I had a guy who used to work at Foodstory helping front of house on Wednesday and Thursday.#Apologetic to customers who didn#t manage to get their hands on some of Pete#s in-demand baked goods at the weekend, the entrepreneur urges those who really want a bite of the action to visit the bakery early to avoid disappointment.He added: #We#re still trying to find out what is going to work best for us and the customers in terms of opening times. I did feel really sorry for the customers who didn#t manage to get a hold of anything.#On Saturday Sarah had to go outside and shout down the queue that the cinnamon buns had sold out. Even after that people were still queuing right down the road waiting.#Some people had queued for ages and we had people coming down around noon to get some products and we had to tell them we#d sold out.#We#re going to try and be more streamlined and efficient. I think I#d rather have everything ready to go when we open, rather than still adding to the counter as we opened. We were going to try and figure out what was most popular, but to be honest everything was popular. I think we#ll focus on the same stuff again this week and make sure we have as much as we can.#New Aberdeen bakery smashes crowdfunding target in two days as it prepares to open doors next month\"

break.Currently, the majority of primary-aged children have ed to learning facilities, however, their more senior peers are expected to alsoon a full-time basis.The address will be streamed live through Scottish Government social media accounts, as well as being broadcast live on the BBC.The update is scheduled for noon.Secondary pupils are expected to be permitted toto the classroom from April  on a full-time basis following a period of phased learning.Pupils will have to maintain #strict two-metre physical distancing# with schools urged to consider how they can strengthen mitigation measures such as ventilation and the use of outdoor learning.Attendance in schools will include teaching and non-teaching staff who, in the judgement of the local authority and schools, are required to attend in person.The Scottish Government say this could include student teachers undertaking placement practice, and possibly Higher Education Institutiontutors observing their practice.The Stay at Home guidance was lted last Friday and replaced with advice to Stay Local, with more parts of the economy opening from yesterday.Further easing of restrictions are anticipated in the coming weeks,

they plan to support Aberdeen following the news the city may lose its last department store.Last week the north-east was rocked by the news John Lewis plans to close its store in Aberdeen – the only remaining department store in the north of Scotland.The retailer’s plans to close its branch on George Street provoked a huge public backlash, with more than , people signing petitions and hundreds more writing letters asking the chain to reconsider.A taskforce, including local authority chiefs and business leaders, was set up in a bid to convince John Lewis to rethink its decision.The closure of the store could lead to the loss of around  jobs – the latest in a long line of blows for the local economy.City leaders fear a #domino effect# where the loss of the store has an impact on other businesses in Aberdeen and the north-east, prompting calls for government support.The council#s administration has written to the leader of each main political party urging them to support the campaign.We asked the leaders what they will do to support the citythey form the next Scottish Government following May#s election.Here is what they said.#Throughout the pandemic, our retail sector has taken a massive hit and this is reflected by the unfortunate and incredibly sad decision that John Lewis took to close its doors in Aberdeen # a decision I hope it is willing to reconsider.#As we recover from the pandemic and out of lockdown, businesses need to be at the heart of that and a re-elected SNP Government would stand ready to work with the Aberdeen taskforce and all parties in the city to ensure Aberdeen City Centre is vibrant and attractive.“The SNP in government have already backed business in the city with more than £m of support during the pandemic.#Re-electing an SNP Government will ensure Aberdeen City receives a raft of measures to regenerate the area, including access to the £m City Centre Recovery Fund and the £m town centre fund, as well as £m set aside in this year#s budget specically to help support and create jobs in Aberdeen City and Aberdeenshire.#An SNP government stands ready to support Aberdeen, to revitalise the city centre, and to support investment where it is needed.##I’d like to thank everybody involved with the taskforce for working together to try and keep John Lewis in Aberdeen.#News of the planned closure was greeted with dismay

the UK#s most northern outlet and the only one in Scotland outside the central belt.It follows the closure of Debenhams, which has closed its stores in both Aberdeen and Inverness.The announcement sparked outrage from shoppers and members of the public in the north-east, with thousands of people aiming to convince the retail giant to reconsider.Two petitions have been set up, with a combined total of more than , people signing in support of the campaign.Many also added comments sharing why they want the partnership to stay in the Granite City.Chris Cusack described the store as #an important fixture in the city centre, and an essential part of its retail economy#, while Alison Murray claimed the region would be #bereft#the closure goes ahead.Dawn Allen said: #We desperately need to preserve the jobs and it is a three-hour drive to the next nearest store. Aberdeenshire needs John Lewis, not just the city itself.#And Karen Young added: #I worked in John Lewis for years and it was the best store in town. I think this will be a terrible loss to Aberdeen and it breaks my heart that those amazing staff will no longer do the jobs they live and are committed to.#A taskforce, including council chiefs and business leaders, held talks earlier this week with senior management at John Lewis.The campaign to save the store has also been backed by candidates standing in Aberdeen Central in the upcoming Scottish Parliament election.Scottish Labour candidate Barry Black, who set up one of the petitions calling for the closure decision to be reversed, said: #There is a mixture of anger and huge disappointment at the decision. This is the last department store in Aberdeen.#People do have confidence in the future of Aberdeen city centre but they see John Lewis as a huge part of that future. It#s the anchor of that side of the city centre, and there are a lot of retailers in George Street who have grave concerns because of the people it draws to that part of town.#This is much bigger than Aberdeen city. To the public in Aberdeenshire, Moray, the Highlands and even Orkney and Shetland, it#s their local department store.#Douglas Lumsden, the Scottish Conservative candidate, said: #I haven#t seen a public response like this for a long time. It just shows what this means to so many people, and it#s so important to the whole region.#If it does go it will be a devastating loss to the whole city.#Kevin Stewart of the SNP and: “I know from my mailbag and inbox that Aberdonians want John Lewis to stay in our city and I do hope that the John Lewis board will recognise this strength of feeling and agree to maintain a presence in our city.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/04/2.58820550-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/04/2.58820550-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/04/2.58820550-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/04/2.58820550-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"teuchters have arrived oban golfer sticks to roots as he arrives for masters","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remOban golfer Robert MacIntrye announced his arrival at The Masters representing #teuchters# all over the globe.The Scot, who is due to tee off the prestigious tournament later this week, shared his arrival with adoring followers on Twitter as the song The Gunna Sound Ceilidh Band is blasted out, performed by the song#s namesake.MacIntrye captioned his arrival as #Teuchters have arrived# and it has gone down a storm with his followers, including teuchters on the other side of the pond.mdash Robert MacIntyreApril , One said: #Haha, brilliant.#Haggis neeps n tatties at the Champions dinner next year!!

It shows new reported cases and deaths in the last day, as well as the total cases in each area since the pandemic began.After a second wave over winter, most areas of the country are starting to see figures fall again.The proportion of people who test positive every day was trending downward since December.The chart below shows local positivity rates. This is now a key metric that is considered when putting each area into tiers. The colour scales refer to the potential levels recommended by the World Health Organisation.Another key metric is the rate of cases per , people. The chart below shows the seven day rate in each local authority. Similar to the chart above, this chart is also colour coded by the potential levels as recommended by the WHO.In the early stages of the pandemic, cases were more concentrated in older generations. In the last few months this has shted towards cases being more prevalent in younger people – however, cases are declining in the more vulnerable age groups as the vaccine rollout progresses.As the number of daily new cases reduces, the cumulative totals for the health board areas become less important. The heatmap below shows the number of new cases by health board area.The chart below shows the daily number of deaths after a positive test as well as the cases where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certicate.The heatmap below shows the age demographics of the people who have lost their lives to the virus.The chart below shows a daily snapshot of the number of people in hospital and ICU with Covid-.

Scottish Cup third round away defeat of League One Dumbarton.It was to be a bitter sweet introduction to the starting XI as Ramsay, who had shone throughout, limped off the pitch midway through the second half.However, it was later confirmed Pittodrie Youth Academy graduate Ramsay had suffered from cramp and will be available for consideration for Saturday’s trip to St Johnstone.Although against lower league, part-time opposition, Ramsay made his entrance into the Aberdeen starting line-up in a high pressure environment.There was the pressure of players having to impress newly-appointed manager Stephen Glass, who was watching the action remotely on television as he is undergoing a -day quarantine having flown in from the United States on the eve of the tie.The tie also had to be finished on the day with penaltiesrequired, and the goal-shy Dons had netted just once in  games.Television chiefs were clearly sensing a potential upset with the tie selected for live broadcast by the BBC in an early kick-off.Yet Ramsay thrived both defensively and on the attack,  powering down the right flank, beating players and delivering dangerous crosses.Sheerin said: “Calvin can be really pleased with his first full debut as he did well.“He loves getting on the ball and  getting crosses across.“Calvin did that really well in the first half against Dumbarton especially as he had plenty of crosses into the box.“It was a game that suited him in terms of getting on the front foot and getting forward, which he really likes to do.”mdash Aberdeen FCApril , Ramsay signed a contract extension in January tying him to Pittodrie until summer .The teen, who made his debut off the bench in injury time during the recent - loss at Dundee United, was signed by the Dons at just nine years old from the AFC pre-Academy and has risen through the youth ranks.He was a pivotal part of the U squad that was level on points with Rangers at the top of the Club Academy Scotland League when Scottish football stopped in March  due to Covid-.That Aberdeen U side had also secured an SFA Youth Cup final against Kilmarnock at Hampden, but that was also cancelled due to the pandemic.Although primarily a right-back, Ramsay also played right-midfield for the Us.Until the age of , Ramsay was a highly-rated central midfielder, but was moved to right-back for one game during a youth tournament in Holland against Cha.He impressed so much in that role against the Stamford Bridge youth side, he remained at right-back.Sheerin said: ”Although Calvin loves going forward, maybe defensively at times he needs to tighten up.#All young players do and they need to learn the game, but he is a confident lad.”As reserve team coach, Sheerin has a keen understanding and knowledge of the emerging young talent at the club.Teenage midfielder Ethan Ross was also given the opportunity to impress when starting against Dumbarton and, like Ramsay, he grabbed it.It was only the -year-old’s second first-team start.His only previous start was - draw with Hibs on October , .In Sheerin#s first match in interim charge, the recent loss to Dundee United, he handed defender Jack MacKenzie a starting debut.Just days after that debut, the -year-old signed a contract extension tying him to the club until summer .MacKenzie was unavailable for selection against Dumbarton as he was cup-tied, having played in the tournament earlier this season while on loan at Forfar.Finnish U international Miko Virtanen also recently signed a one-year contract extension until next summer.Sheerin said: “Hopefully they all have bright futures.“Jack also made his debut against Dundee United and he was excellent, other than the goal. At a young age, you need mistakes to learn from.“Jack is a bright boy and I am sure he will learn from that.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"bob tees up for american dream","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

If you have a sporting collection, no matter what size or sport, please do get in touch.#It is hoped the project will also support Scotland’s sporting collections to be better understood and help identy the role sport plays in wider issues around health and wellbeing.The research is being conducted by archive specialists Turnstone Consultancy.Research lead Kat Petersen added: #Sporting heritage might be tidily boxed up in an archive or accumulating in a cupboard in your office or clubhouse.

Not before time.I was supportive of the mitigation plan, using nets and catch pits, as the simplest and least expensive approach. It was certainly worth a try, but it is abundantly clear now # with reputedly £ million spent # that it is not working.The , tonnes or more poised to come down on the road may well be an underestimate, and recent closures of the OMR, despite the new bund, doesn’t say very much for the efficacy of the protection. So we need an alternative, and we need it soon, not  years away.Talk of #alternative traffic corridors# is just a distraction.There may well be a case for a bridge-and-tunnel approach. Such has been successful in Norway and # notably # both in Iceland and Faroe Islands, which have much smaller resource bases than Norway. But these would be long-term schemes, each requiring the completion of several major interlinked crossings, for the like of which Scotland’s roads authority has hitherto shown neither interest nor aptitude.The problem at the Rest is a local one which requires a local solution. It’s only a mile or so of road which is at issue there.The alternatives, realistically, boil down to three:Overhead protection might well be required over quite a long distance, as it’s not just the bit at the catch pits which is threatened. The slopes of the Cobbler have experienced slides too. Since the hillside ies it might not be possible to use standard prefabricated modules, and in any case installation work would close the A for some time.A tunnel through to Butterbridge could be driven quite quickly # particularlythe Norwegians did it # but the approach in upper Glen Croe would require protection just like the OMR. Sir William Lithgow’s proposal mentions this, but construction would also almost certainly close the OMR, leaving no ersion for that period.The construction of a new alignment up the south west side of the glen, however, either on or roughly parallel to the existing forestry road, would avoid interference with through traffic.Both the gradient and the transverse slope would be substantially similar to those of the existing A, though thewould be marginally greater, which is probably why the north east side was chosen when the #new# A was built.The core of the case for the third option, however, is that the south west side of the glen has experienced far less erosion, both historically and in recent years, than the north east one.Stand at the upper viewpoint, or better still a little way along the Lochgoilhead road, and look around. The slopes of Ben Luibhean on which the A runs show far more watercourses and gullies than any of the others in the vicinity.This indicates a lot more rainfall impacting that slope, probably by the prevailing weather being funnelled on to it through the pass at the top of Glen More. And that weather is becoming worse.There have been no major slips over the forestry road in recent years, despite a spate of them on the opposite slope. It may just be the trees. I don’t think so, but in any case the trees are there, while it would take some years for tree cover to established above the A.Going back a lot further in time, the pattern is the same. The burn in the floor of upper Glen Croe has been pushed, over the centuries, by slip debris coming down from the north east slope, and the depth of that debris can easily be seen in the gullies recently carved in it behind the new bund.There is also a fair number of impressively-sized boulders on the lower slopes on that side, which at some point rolled down the hillside. Some of these came from the Cobbler, and although most are below the road a few are not. There is nothing to say that more will not arrive.A further point is that while the lower slopes on each side of the upper glen are similar, those on the south west side ease off towards the top, while those on the NE slope do not.It is on these upper slopes that the small slips develop which can pick up more and more water and debris on their way down, hence the fan shape of the typical slip. There is, in other words, a lot less potential for the initiation of slips on the south west side.I think that this all points to the need for a serious look at the forestry road, and I fail to understand why the investigations a few years ago dismissed it as a viable alternative.It’s the existing A which isn’t viable. And why any of these solutions would take  years to complete also beats me. Local objections  There is only one house in upper Glen Croe, and in the rest of Argyll I have yet to meet anyone who doesn’t want a permanent solution.My suspicion is that the biggest dficulty is that Transport Scotland can’t yet find a way to explain how £ million could be spent to such little effect. I might, of course, be wrong in all this, but I wait to be convinced of it.Arthur Blue, ArdrishaigSir,Since the temporary repairs to the Rest are clearly getting nowhere and costing money into the bargain, I would like to suggest a radical solution to the problem, and that is to build a viaduct right down the centre of the valley, based on the design of the MillauFor those not familiar with this structure, it is well worth an internet search. I believe this is still the world#s tallest bridge and is a really beautul structure.Seen from a distance, the white deck and piers look quite unreal # moreBefore anyone asks where that sum of money is to be found, I would point out that Boris Johnson#s proposed tunnel to Northern Ireland may cost between £ billion and £ billion # nobody knows because it hasn#t been designed yet. Nevertheless, Alister Jack is extremely enthusiastic about the proposal, so clearly money is not a problem.Not only would this new viaduct solve the problem once and for all, I suspect that, like the Millau Viaduct, it would become a much-photographed tourist attraction.John McCall, LochgilpheadSir,In last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser, Councillor Alastair Redman criticises the SNP for setting aside £, of its own money to campaign for an independent Scotland.Not surprisingly, he fails to enlighten us as to the costs of  the Tory party#s #Union Unit# set up by the Prime Minister at the taxpayers# expense.David Hay, MinardSir,Due to the speed with which the NHS is carrying out its vaccination programme, there is hope that we can soon all get out again andto normal.We still, however, face huge challenges. The economy has suffered. The NHS faces a big backlog of cancelled operations. Our young people have a lot of schooling to catch up on. We don’t have much time left to stop our climate changing before it is too late.Here in Argyll the Scottish Government must rise to the challenge of building a permanent solution at the Rest and Be Thankful.These must be our priorities. We can’t afford to spend the next few years arguing over independence. That’s an unnecessary distraction.We need a needle-sharp focus on the recovery without the distraction of another isive referendum.Put recovery first.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal wardMr Reid is the Argyll and Bute LibDem candidate for May#s Scottish parliamentary election"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor march 12 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The vaccination process carried out with great economy and efficiency # and entirely painlessly so that we really will have to stop calling it #the jag#.The real bonus was the warmth and good humour from everyone involved that made the whole process welcoming, so that you left with a smile on your face. Only after the event do you realise what a tremendous team effort it was from everyone involved and all of them deserve our thanks.I hope very much that the Mid Argyll area makes a near  per cent response to the vaccination invitation, because that is what this effort deserves and will demonstrate to those involved the very real, genuine appreciation we have for their work during the pandemic.Norman Rea, Kintallen, TayvallichSir,The rank hypocrisy of the Scottish Tories knows no bounds.While they are frothing at the mouth that the first minister should resign over allegedly misleading the Scottish Parliament, at the same time Prime Minister Johnson was proven to have deliberately misled the Westminster parliament.Standing up in the House of Commons, Mr Johnson stated that all Covid-related contracts were #on the record#.This was three days after the High Court ruled the government had acted unlawfully by failing to publish hundreds of such contracts, which somehow seemed to find their way to those with Tory party connections.Two weeks prior to this, the Health Minister Matt Hancock was found guilty of illegal activity by the High Court, refusing to resign or even apologise when the extent of illegal awarding of PPE contracts was revealed.Last year Tory Home Secretary Priti Patel was found guilty of breaching the ministerial code by being a bully and shouting and swearing at civil servant employees in the Home Office, recently reaching a £, settlement with the former Home Office Permanent Secretary.Compare and contrast that with north of the border, where the Tory party has demanded the resignation of the first minister even before the outcome of the enquiries into the handling of the Alex Salmond case by the Scottish Government has been published.Not a cheep from them demanding an apology, let alone a resignation, for the flagrant abuses by their Westminster colleagues. What hypocrites.Alex Orr, EdinburghSir,This Mother’s Day, school feeding charity Mary’s Meals would like to pay tribute to incredible women around the world.From the mums in the UK whose food has nourished us throughout our childhoods, including those who volunteer and fundraise for Mary’s Meals, to the women who cook and serve our daily meals for children in some of the world’s poorest countries, we celebrate them all.Mary’s Meals feeds more than . million hungry children in  countries every school day.That’s why I am asking your readers to send a Mary’s Meals gt card to the special women in their lives this Mother’s Day.

Thanks to the amazing commitment of some truly dedicated people working in the NHS and in social care, lives have been saved and people have been cared for. Stroke teams up and down the country have in many areas managed to continue to offer specialist care and treatment to patients throughout the pandemic. We cannot thank them enough.But the fallout from Covid- is going to pose challenges for everyone in health and social care. Our Recoveries at Risk report last autumn highlighted the real le impact of the pandemic on people recovering from a stroke.Emerging evidence of links between Covid- and stroke means that now, more than ever, a renewed national focus on stroke is needed in Scotland.Health officials have been working during the pandemic to review evidence and define what #a progressive stroke service for Scotland# should look like.This will include improved stroke care bundle figures, improved stroke prevention measures, a national thrombectomy service and stroke-specic, person-centred rehabilitation.The charity is pleased that people affected by stroke will be included in the development of this work.A draft paper will be with the Scottish Government in the next few weeks. Whatever the outcome of May’s election, the Stroke Association in Scotland expects the next government to push this work on, and for a new, improved, progressive stroke service to be implemented.Colin Oliver, public affairs officer, the Stroke Association in Scotland"},{"url":null,"title":"argylls abigail releases debut single","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Keith also co-wrote and produced the single at his studio on the Isle of Lewis.Abigail said: #The single is about encouraging women to follow their passions and carve out a le that they can enjoy and be proud of.#The music video that we created doesn’t have me in it, I wanted it to showcase powerful women who are following their dreams in whatever field their passions and talents lie.#The ambition behind the single is for it to be inspiring and help others to find the courage and drive to fight for their goals, no matter what those are.#I have always recorded with my band Heron Valley, who are a traditional folk band, so recording something for myself has been really dferent. Firstly, due to the obvious genre dferences but also because I’ve always had the support of five other people to make key choices, so it’s been a big change making decisions by myself on how I want the music to sound.#I have really enjoyed the process and the musical independence recording the single has given me.#Originally from rural Argyll, Abigail grew up with music very much at the heart of her family learning fiddle from a young age, also being taught guitar and vocal stylings at home with her father. She joined Heron Valley in its infancy while also studying at Royal Conservatoire of Scotland Junior School.As well as touring extensively with Heron Valley, Abigail went on to graduate from The Royal Conservatoire of Scotland where she studied Scots Song and classical violin. Her unique music style and honest song writing make Abigail an exciting prospect for the Scottish music scene and Lady a much-anticipated release.Lady will be available to download and stream from Friday March ."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column march 12 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

As many examples as possible will then also be published in the Campbeltown Courier, Argyllshire Advertiser and Oban Times newspapers.The artwork, which must be created specically for this showcase, can be on any surface # as long as it can be photographed and submitted # but it is limited to one image per person. It is not a competition and none of artwork will be judged.Gigha-based youth work facilitator Kenny Wilson, one of the project#s organisers, explained: #As youth workers, we kept hearing the same phrases from young people, phrases like #My bedroom has become my classroom# and #I feel like the walls are closing in on me#. Young people were asking questions like #Where can we go # Nowhere. #Who we can meet # No-one. #What are we allowed to do # During lockdown, very little at all.#The idea is to give artistic young people something to do that#s not prescribed by the Curriculum for Excellence [Scotland#s education framework] or by the government to give them the freedom to choose what they want to do, to design whatever they want to design.#The reward will be seeing their artwork published online and in the newspapers. The purpose of the whole thing is to increase the wellbeing of young people, to give them a boost # it#s as simple as that.#He added: #It could well be that something catches the eye of someone in the wider artistic community and they could be put in touch with the young creator of the piece in question # but that would have to be arranged through the youth workers, subject to careful child protection measures, and with parents# consent.#Kenny explained that safeguarding is an essential part of all that youth workers do and, as such, the organisers have created a GDPR statement which reads: #We will ensure that all personal data that we collect will only be held until all the images have been showcased, and will be processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner and only collected for the legitimate purposes of the showcase, and will never be passed on to any other organisation or third party without your explicit permission.#Those who would like to register an interest in taking part, can email ayelovetomake@gmail providing their first name and location. They are not required to submit their surname, full address or age, as long as they are within the  to  age range.When the project officially launches on Friday March , they can then send photographs of their artwork to the same email address so it can be uploaded to the project#s Instagram account, where it will be made visible to the public after the Sunday April  closing date.Kenny added: #If you are a young person with a desire to create, then go for it!#"},{"url":null,"title":"heathers treks renaissance ruins and ancient rock art","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

She has travelled and trekked throughout the world, walked across Scotland numerous times, climbed many of its peaks and now lives in Argyll amongst the scenery she loves.Lovely Kilmartin Glen is host to many wonderful historic sites and ancient monuments.Overlooking its northern reaches the renaissance remains of Master John Carswell’s Carnasserie Castle stand proud, its ruins eerily dramatic despite now being more home to crow than human.There are many ways in which to explore the area. This circular takes you through time from Carnasserie Castle in the east to the prehistoric rock art at Ormaig in the west, before wending southwards on the path used in bygone days to reach Old Poltalloch. Then, turning east, you come to Lady’s Seat, which offers lovely views down the glen, a brief respite before turning northwards toto the castle’s realm. Glimpses over to Loch Craignish and down Kilmartin Glen give one time to ponder the geology of the area swept by the glaciers of the last ice age.At the car park you will see a small path exiting the NE corner by the information boards. Turn left and head up the track towards the castle. You initially come to a turning left, you will take this shortly. Meanwhile the castle lies just ahead, through a gate and up a steep path to your left. Currently you can but admire its grandeur from the outside, either from here or the next section of the walk .Return to the track and take the turn on your right SW up through the trees and to a gate. Ahead you will cross the field for m, with the castle to your right, before re-joining the farm track. Follow it to a T-junction .Turn right and continue up the field and through a gate. A young forestry plantation lies to your left, pretty and convoluted little hills and glens to your right. Effectively the valley floor is the line of a dyke with the lumps, bumps and ides a mixture of limestone, igneous rock intrusions, sandstones, gritstones, conglomerates and folding doing much to create the complex NE SW flow seen in the shape of the hills and lochs all carved out by glaciers.Follow the track over the col past a gnarly old plantation on a knoll. The route descends for km towards Loch Craignish before veering sharply right to cross the Eas Mor burn at its western end. Note the main track you come on to. For those wishing to miss the path to Old Poltalloch you will need toto this point and keep following it south east to join up with the rest of the route.Cross the bridge over the Eas Mor. Ignore the small path to your right with a barrier and continue for m look out for the new track signposted up to the prehistoric rock art of Ormaig. After ascending m you will see the little paths to your right leading to the stones, a good place to pause and wonder at those who carved them.Return to the track below and south over the Eas Mor. At the sharp left-hand bend turn immediately right towards the sea. After just m, opposite a ruined croft, an easily missed path slips down to a wall. As soon as you are on it, it is obvious and now wends its way southwards towards Old Poltalloch through the ‘Big Wood’.The path is boggy in places with the odd fallen tree. After .km it reaches a forestry road turn left and follow this for m to a sharp left-hand bend. The path goes straight ahead at the bottom of the bend just below a turning point, again it is not obvious until you are on it. Continue to follow this all the way until you reach the road at Old Poltalloch, passing farmstead ruins and the old walled garden on your right. The house itself has now been renovated.Turn left. The track, which also leads to a jetty below, climbs upwards for nearly km before reaching the col leading to Kilmartin Glen. Ignore the two tracks you pass on your left .Descend for m and take the grassy forestry track to your right. After m a path leads upwards on your right to Lady’s Seat, a worthy detour for a grand view over the glen.Return to the track and turn right to descend to the main track below . Cross straight over, through a gate to the right of some sheep pens. Passing a track from your right after mzigzag down through the woods to a gate. The track does a sharp -degree turn right and, a little after, turn left to follow the tracks back to Carnasserie and your earlier outward route.Please note: Historic and Environment Scotland properties and sites remain closed due to Covid the castle can only be viewed from the outside at this time.

Had we and her doctors been aware of the symptoms, Marjie might be alive today. If diagnosed at the earliest stage, nine in  women will survive. But two thirds of women are diagnosed late, when the cancer is harder to treat.This March, for Oian Cancer Awareness Month, I’m writing to ask your readers to take just two minutes of their time to learn the symptoms and spread the word to their families and friends.The main symptoms of oian cancer are: persistent bloating, feeling full or having dficulty eating, tummy pain, and needing to wee more often or more urgently.If you believe in a future where every woman diagnosed with oian cancer has the best chance of survival, please show your support and visit www.targetoiancancer.org.uk MarchSarah Greene, Target Oian Cancer PatronSir,We welcome the latest announcement from the Scottish Government that communal worship can potentially resume from March  with the possibility of up to  people in attendance, assuming physical distancing of two metres can be in place.Christians are Easter people we live with hope in all circumstances, and the church will be providing guidance to congregations to help them ensure that buildings are re-opened in a safe and responsible manner.While some congregations will adopt a cautious approach regarding the reopening of our buildings # and others won#t have the practical means to do so # everyone will be very glad at this news and will already be looking forward to how most appropriately to celebrate Easter .In whatever we do, we#ll be remembering that the God who raised Jesus from the grave has been faithful to us throughout the whole of this last year.Rt Rev Dr Martin Fair, Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of ScotlandSir,The first Citizens’ Assembly of Scotland has submitted its final report to the Scottish Parliament, with its  powerful democratic recommendations aimed at improving the wellbeing of Scotland#s people and governance.I personally would have loved to be a participant in this new democratic exercise, meeting and sharing with, speaking and listening to, a wide range of our people, many very unlike me and with very dferent perspectives, opinions and lived experience.To be informed by a range of expert, evidence-based perspectives, to explore and discuss implications and reservations, and to move towards a rough consensus on a range of key questions that will affect ourselves, our children and grandchildren, and that will shape the future of our country – that’s the exemplar of the active, responsible citizen of st century Scotland.There#s a climate assembly also currently working towards its conclusions, and I await its recommendations with interest and anticipation.Recommendation six of the first assembly is: #That in order to ensure that citizens can make informed decisions in relation to rebuilding their communities the Scottish government and parliament should: establish community-based citizens# assemblies to assess what is happening in our communities , identy gaps and recommend actions, including through digital technology, that can bring people together and make our communities more inclusive.#We have a Scottish election coming up in May, and I hope to see a good turnout as a good majority of Scotland’s electorate, from age  upwards, make sure to vote in this most critical exercise of our moment of power and responsibility.Subsequently, I hope to very soon look forward to a renewed interest in local democracy, as an Argyll and Bute Citizens# Assembly debates and decide the shape of Argyll and Bute#s future for the coming decisive decade.Perhaps that future will include enhanced interest and participation in some version of our current powerless and voiceless community councils.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"longing for a rest","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

This is mainly due to massive insecticide use and habitat loss caused by intensication of agriculture.Up to  per cent of flowering plants and  per cent of commercial crops require insects for pollination, with honeybees and hoverflies most often doing the job.But with declining numbers of these species, farmers may employ hives of bees to prevent crop yields falling.Wild honeybees forage within three miles of their nest, and onthey perform the #waggle dance# that advertises the location of productive foraging sites to other bees. Also, odours from scented flowers picked up inside the nest while unloading pollen act as cues to guide nest-mates to specic flowers.Now scientists have articially imprinted bees with flower odours in an attempt to improve crop yields*.In trying to establish long-term memory for flower odours, the scientists offered bees in three separate groups of hives alternative odours:  sucrose solution scented with synthetic sunflower odours,  sucrose solution scented with jasmine odours,  sucrose solution alone. They then relocated the hives to a sunflower plantation and compared the foraging activities of bees exposed to the three solutions.First, scientists decoded waggle dances to identy sunflower-specic dances. Using this information, they observed bees from hives fed with sunflower odours performing sunflower dances one hour after hive relocation.Contrastingly, the control bees fed jasmine odours took - hours and control sucrose-fed bees took  hours to perform sunflower dances.This resulted in the sunflower odour-imprinted bees performing signicantly more sunflower-specic waggle dances during the first day of relocation, peaking at  per cent increase over control hives preferentially visiting sunflowers and bringing in more sunflower pollen loads than the control bees.The scientists then measured the all-important crop yields in five plots containing dferent sunflower hybrid plants pollinated by sunflower odour-imprinted compared to control bees.Seed yields in all five plots were highest when pollinated by sunflower odour-fed bees, with increased production up to  per cent above control bees.They conclude that providing bees pre-programmed to forage on specic crops could circumvent wild pollinator shortages and signicantly increase crop yields.*Current Biology , -.

Especially when option one, the Glen Croe route, was the chosen option from the A Trunk Road Study # summary report published by Jacobs in .Surely, after nine years of consulting, the Scottish Government and Transport Scotland can choose the best solution rather than going through a y and expensive consultation process.Based on this, our members would like the permanent solution fast tracked, which is well within the Scottish Government’s power and we would ask for this to be seriously considered.Our other comments and feedback to last week’s announcement are as follows:The timber road route should be upgraded as a short-term solution this summer and not in the suggested  months.Argyll businesses have faced the issues of landslides for many years. However, the situation has worsened over the past year and in our opinion it has now become a national emergency and requires immediate action.The , tons of unstable material could swamp any further mitigation measures put in place on the A and Old Military Roadand make the roads impassable. This could easily happen when we next have an extended period of rainfall.Savings in further mitigation work could go towards upgrading the forestry road.The long-term solution should be selected from the  The A Trunk Road Study and based on the delivery of the most sustainable outcome.Any well-developed permanent solution needs to be open  without fear of being buried under tons of rock and mud, and will have less environmental impact than the landslides, catchpits, netting and OMR bund we are currently experiencing.Our understanding of costs and timescales from similar schemes in Norway show a tunnel could be built in three years at a cost of £-m, and not the £-m stated by Transport Scotland.Members of The RABT Campaign group represent a cross section of business sectors and we would welcome the chance to meet with your officials to discuss how we might help cut through the y timescales and fast-track decision making.John Gurr  Sir,I heard that there was work going on in Lochgilphead town centre, and that some people were complaining, about mess and upheaval. No change there then!When I observed the work, I was so surprised at the dference this will make to the town and to the moaners I say #you cannot make an omelette without breaking eggs#.When I spoke to them, the workforce were polite and commented that they were looking forward to the end result.For too long now Lochgilphead has been the Cinderella of Argyll and Bute now it seems she will go to the Ball.From a very satisfied resident.Name and address suppliedSir,Just ahead of WWF’S Earth Hour last year, the country was put into lockdown due to the Covid- pandemic. As we look ahead to this year’s event on Saturday March  at .pm, many of us are reflecting on the future, as we emerge from the latest, and hopefully last #stay at home# period.With that in mind, we are asking people to use Earth Hour by helping us to create the #Great Scottish Canvas#.

While saving in some areas of expenditure, it has incurred extra costs in tackling the pandemic and faces an uncertain funding future while the national economy tries to recover. The drive to save money in services where bringing in a little more through, for example, parking fees and fines, is understandable up to a point.But when the economy is on le support after a pandemic, surely the relatively paltry sums to be made are not worth the potential damage to Inveraray#s recovery, as seems to be the view of locals Perhaps councillors could look at this a little dferently. If they are determined to push this through for control traffic purposes, why not donate the proceeds, which would be a by-product of well-behaved traffic, to the town  The pier fund could certainly use it. Both the community council and Inspire Inveraray would no doubt welcome the cash and find many uses for public benefit.Just a thought.Congratulations to Cameron on his award. This is a huge achievement among a group of young people who each work hard for others.It is also  a great achievement for MacLeod Construction to be shortlisted for a national award.

However, on further reading, this was yet another unsurprising disappointment. The preferred corridor through Glen Croe is still to be announced and there is still no timetable for completion.Landslips at the Rest and be Thankful have frequently seen much of Argyll isolated from central Scotland, or journeys delayed by endless roadworks or convoys along the old military road. Most of these problems have occurred during the SNP’s  years in government and the continued failure to provide a permanent solution is yet more proof of how little the SNP cares about or understand the needs of people and businesses outside the central belt.It was clear long ago that patchwork schemes were not a solution but, rather than provide a new corridor which would have resulted in major capital expenditure, tens of millions of pounds have instead been wasted on years of ineffective schemes which nature evades in next to no time.In the meantime, the SNP has had no dficulty finding money to prop up central belt vanity projects like the Edinburgh trams.Mike Russell, SNP MSP for Argyll and Bute, has been far more concerned with Indyref and Brexit than the day to day concerns of his constituents and has done nothing to ensure that providing a reliable road connection to Argyll is a top priority for Michael Matheson, the Cabinet Secretary for Transport.The Holyrood elections on May  are an ideal opportunity for the residents and business owners in Argyll, whose daily lives are affected by such an unreliable road, to voice their dissatisfaction and vote for anyone other than the SNP or the Greens who oppose any road building on principle.A dferent government might not guarantee a speedy resolution, but after  years of failed sticking-plaster attempts to patch up the existing road, it certainly couldn’t be worse.Donald McCallum, Strathaven.Sir,Across the Kintyre and the Islands ward I continue to receive complaints about the rather shoddy condition of road signage.In some cases the signs are faded and covered in dirt and in many other cases they are falling to pieces.One example of this is the road signs above the footpath outside Port Ellen Primary School on Islay and sadly there are many other examples. In my opinion in the future Argyll and Bute Council must be more diligent in maintaining our signs.Road signs help to regulate traffic, provide crucial visual guidance and give drivers important previews, especially during night-time conditions.Councillor Alastair RedmanSir,I write further to correspondence on Lochgilphead#s expensive new pavements.When they are finally finished, could somebody seethey have a bucket or two of tarry stones left over that could be chucked into the tank trap that passes for a roundabout, next to the Tesco garage David Hay, MinardSir,I have immense pleasure in communicating to your readers our new address following our successful relocation of our main office premises.Our email, website and telephone numbers remain the same as before.Email: info@abcab.org.uk and phone  .We have had no break in service and continue to provide advice and support to clients across Argyll and Bute, with our advisers all working from home under current government guidance.We are also available to provide advice to those who find themselves in a vulnerable position and require face-to-face advice by appointment in our Helensburgh and Lochgilphead offices.We commence our second volunteer adviser training programme next month and look forward to welcoming our new trainees.Jen Broadhurst, Bureau Manager, Argyll and Bute Citizens Advice BureauSir,Following the Scottish Government#s pay offer of four per cent across the board for all NHS workers, Unite will ballot its members on the offer over the next few weeks.Unite represents workers in every pay band across the entire NHS structure and recognises that while this offer will put money into the pockets of our members, any monthly pay uplt will y considerably between iniduals. For this reason Unite will be putting this offer to our members without recommendation.The offer includes an opportunity to revisit any settlement including an intention by the Scottish Government to allocate additional funding through Barnett Consequentials. Unite will demand that any additional payment made to the Scottish Government by Westminster through this formula, is passed on to our members.Workers across the NHS have been described as #heroic# in what has been an exceptionally challenging year. Now is the time to reward those workers with the pay uplt they deserve, not just for their work during the Covid pandemic, but also for the pay cuts they have endured through years of austerity.For Unite, other pay potential remains on the table in the form of additional Barnett Consequentials and we will pursue any additional pay that is intended for our members through further negotiation with any future Scottish Government.James O’Connell, Unite regional officer for Scotland.Sir,I work for a TV company called Five Mile Films and we are making a new documentary series this year for Channel .We are looking for people to apply to take part who are wanting to live a simpler le.

appears to be a surreptitious recording of the meeting between Hamzah and General Yousef Huneiti, the military chief of staff, who came to the princersquos palace on Saturday to inform him that he was being placed under a form of house arrest.In the recording, the army chief says the prince is being punished because of meetings he had with iniduals who ldquostarted talking more than they should.The

If you have a sporting collection, no matter what size or sport, please do get in touch.#It is hoped the project will also support Scotland#s sporting collections to be better understood and help to identy the role sport plays in wider issues around health and wellbeing.The research is being conducted by archive specialists Turnstone Consultancy.Research lead Kat Petersen added: #Sporting heritage might be tidily boxed up in an archive or accumulating in a cupboard in your office or clubhouse. However it is being stored or displayed,you have any records or objects relating to sports in Scotland we would love to hear from you.#If anyone is aware of any sporting collections which may be of interest, or at risk in some way, an online survey is available for completion.

While he was gutting and cleaning a large cod at sea, something fell onto the deck.When the deck was cleared and washed down, Mr Colville examined his find# the honeycomb from a bee#s hive!How on earth it ever managed to find its way to the murky depths and into a cod#s stomach we will never discover.It is just #one of those things#.Councillors call for removal of #eyesore#Campbeltown councillors are up in arms about a #rusting eyesore# which is lying on the shores of Campbeltown Loch.The ex-Admiralty tug Empire Ace ran aground at Southend nearly two years ago and was towed to the loch, where it was beached. It has lain at the Rocky Burn area ever since.The vessel caused a row between the Town Council and the firm who owned it, George Hood and Company of Helensburgh.At a meeting last September, it was suggested that the firm be charged dues.Councillor Harry Moffat was quoted as saying: #If people are allowed to dump boats in the loch, I can go and dump a car and nobody can do anything about it.#The council discussed the question of taking legal action against the firm. A considerable number of people have since remarked on the unsightliness of the vessel, which has started to rust.Fishermen ing from the grounds were using the Empire Ace as a mooring stage while they cleaned and washed their catches.But a spokesman for the Helensburgh firm said that it had sold the vessel some months ago. The spokesman refused to reveal the identity of the buyers, but after inquiries, we ascertained that it was purchased by McFadyen’s, the local contracting firm.A spokesman for Archibald McFadyen and Sons said that the Empire Ace was purchased by the firm about two weeks ago.He added that breaking up work was to start on the vessel #within the next few days#.Tobacco firm expands furtherThe well-known Campbeltown firm of Richard Daniels Ltd, tobacco wholesalers and distributors, has opened a depot in Peebles, to meet an increased demand from customers on the east coast.The firm, whose custom stretches from Aberdeen to Middlesborough in England, has just been awarded a #very large# contract from a brewing firm to supply its retail outlet # public houses.Askedthe Peebles opening would create redundancies locally, Mr James Daniels told the Courier that staff in Campbeltown would be unaffected.#It is merely a new phase being added to the business,# he said.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOCastlehill Church Sunday SchoolThe children of the Kinloch Church Sunday School had a highly enjoyable social evening on Friday last. After the customary tea, brief addresses of a helpful nature were given by Rev N Mackenzie, Mr Drysdale , Mr Dick, Mr M’Dougall, Mrs M’Kerrow and the chairman, Rev CVA MacEachran.Among the singers were Misses M’Naughton, M’Cloy, Black and Burnfield, and among the reciters Misses M’Naughton, Macdonald, and Gilchrist, and John M’Lachlan and Don Gilchrist.The two most juvenile performers were amongst the best # Nancy Noal and Norman Keith.A sketch carrying a good moral was cleverly presented as well as a duet in character by J Black and Babette Burnfield. During the evening, Mrs Keith, Gowanlea, presented about  certicates from the Church of Scotland for perfect attendance throughout the year, and  for regular attendance.The musical programme reflected much credit upon Miss Finlay and Mr Hogg who trained the children and upon Miss Rae who was accompanist."},{"url":null,"title":"letters march 19 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I care about mankind in general and the plight of its citizens, particularly where there is a prevalence of political ineptitude affecting their lives.To reiterate, the EU purchasing system regarding vaccines was and still is chaotic, with the bureaucratic executive in Brussels initially lashing out, and currently certain members within the group are endeavouring to purchase supplies of vaccines for their citizens.In addition, we now have a ban by some countries of vaccine exports from EU manufacturers to non-EU countries. An action which has angered the World Health Organization and upset Australia and other countries.Regarding the comment that the vaccine success is an illusion, perhaps the perusal of some scientic pronouncements in relation to the efficacy would be appropriate.To accuse me of crowing is not only resented but additionally hurtful. I have an extended family in France.My daughter is married to a now retired French army captain and she is an environmental scientist and director of a laboratory in the IRD , a French public research institution. While her mother-in-law has had her first vaccination and in the last week so has her husband, she does not know when she will get an appointment.Currently, in certain areas of France, the virus is very active and part of her remit involves travel to some of these hot-spots when working from home is not practicable. A situation which is very concerning to me.I also do not know when I will be permitted to see them, either in France or in Scotland.Crowing, indeed, I think not.Amidst the miscellany of economic disaster claims awaiting an independent Scotland thrown up by Michael McGeachy in last week#s Courier, I am gratied that Mr McGeachy does, at the very least, accept that Scotland has no debt at the point of independence. This is progress.Unfortunately, Mr McGeachy then goes on to hold up Scotland#s putative deficit as an ace card in the unionist case to #prove# that Scotland is an economic basket-case surviving on English largesse. In reality, it demonstrates the opposite.Scotland#s #deficit#, created within the UK, with our overall budget set by another government # that#s  per cent of Scotland#s revenues and  per cent of our spending # is a damning indictment of Westminster#s reckless economic vandalism. It is the cost of Westminster Tory rule and the union#s failure.Indeed,being part of the UK was such an advantage, Scotland would have a stronger economy than our northern independent competitors.That they are all considerably more successful, with fewer economic resources than Scotland, makes the case for Scotland to have control of all the sovereign economic levers required to succeed in the global economy.Mr McGeachy concludes with the familiar splenetic, #you had your referendum# in . In this time we have had three Prime Ministers, two Westminster elections and one Holyrood election, not forgetting England#s Brexit imposed upon Scotland.Democracy is not pick and mix, Mr McGeachy. The #Better Together# parties can huff and puff about #taking back control# to London, but Scotland is not their possession.We still live in a free country andScots vote this May for an SNP government focused on Scottish priorities, including the right to ensure that Scotland#s future is Scotland#s choice, not Boris Johnson#s, democracy, as we saw with the election of President Biden, will prevail.The fact that the SNP has produced a new digital strategy document will come as little consolation to residents of the Highlands and Islands, who would struggle to download it eventhey wanted to.The SNP has left the Highlands and Islands in the digital dark ages.The  SNP manesto committed to deliver superfast broadbandto every home and business by . This has comprehensively failed, with ministers refusing to discuss completion dates. A December  report logged an average download speed of .Mbps in Glen Shiel. That is  times slower than Scotland’s fastest street.The pandemic has exposed the glaring digital ide that exists between rural and urban parts of Scotland.Scottish Liberal Democrats want our remote and rural communities to be great places to live, work and study.That#s why we are setting out new proposals to put power in the hands of local community managers and prioritise investment in catch-up zones to ensure that everyone has access to the digital services they need to prosper.Cancer continues to claim lives regardless of the pandemic.As resources within the NHS are stretched to their limits, charities like Target Oian Cancer need your help more than ever before. Please help us raise awareness and raise funds. Whilst we are all fighting coronavirus, Target Oian Cancer is putting the needs of women with oian cancer before all .In , my mother, the actress Marjie Lawrence, was diagnosed with oian cancer just three weeks before she died.Had we and her doctors been aware of the symptoms, Marjie might be alive today. If diagnosed at the earliest stage, nine in  women will survive. But two thirds of women are diagnosed late, when the cancer is harder to treat.This March, for Oian Cancer Awareness Month, I#m writing to ask your readers to take just two minutes of their time to learn the symptoms and spread the word to their families and friends.The main symptoms of oian cancer are: persistent bloating, feeling full or having dficulty eating, tummy pain, and needing to wee more often or more urgently.If you believe in a future where every woman diagnosed with oian cancer has the best chance of survival, please show your support and visit www.targetoiancancer.org.uk March"},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week march 19 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

A cashier short changes a customer…I could go on.Danish philosopher Soren Kierkegaard remained a Christian all his le, but was very critical of the church in his day for its double standards.As we approach Easter, I think of how the crowds who welcomed Jesus into Jerusalem, pulling branches off the trees to wave, shouting #Hosanna# so enthusiastically, were largely the same crowds calling for his blood only days later when they called #Crucy#.

The first time that a second ballot was required, all with an amazing  per cent support of the community members who voted and the many organisations and iniduals who gave their time, effort and financial support to achieve this unprecedented result.#TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGOWee Toon workers# nightmareThe Campbeltown area is one of the hardest places in Scotland to find a job.Analysts at Durham University using government figures have calculated that there are . people chasing every job vacancy in the Campbeltown Travel to Work Area.The figures for the three months up to January were . people chasing each vacancy.The February figures put Campbeltown and surrounding area at the top of the league table in Scotland for numbers of unemployed per vacancy.Islay and Mid Argyll were seventh in the table with . people chasing each job while Oban was st with ..Bottom of the table, the easiest place to find work, was the Aberdeen area.Since Durham University prepared its figures, Campbeltown has suffered two major jobs losses.Mull of Kintyre Seafood is expected to close next month with the loss of  jobs and last month Campbeltown Shipyard laid off  men, about one-third of its workforce.FIFTY YEARS AGOFishermen backed to the hiltCampbeltown Town Council is to urge the government to take #every possible step# to protect Scottish fishermen#s interestsBritain enters the Common Market.A resolution submitted by Mr AIB Stewart, secretary of the Clyde Fishermen#s Association, was unanimously accepted at a meeting of the council and representatives from the fishing industry.Fishermen stand to lose the protection of a -mile fishing limitthe country joins the Common Market.Mr Stewart said, with a trace of witty sarcasm: #Of course, inwe could fish in the Mediterranean.#He then referred to the large quantity of herring which was bought in Scotland by other countries, whose once huge fishings have finished.#They have over-fished their own grounds. Three-quarters of the herring landed in Britain are caught between the Clyde and the Minches,# he revealed.If the limit was abolished, Mr Stewart went on, foreigners would not send carrier boats, but ships to catch fish.He concluded by wondering what would happen to communities like Campbeltown, Carradale and Tarbert and places all around.Mr William McAffer, of Tarbert, said his main fear was unemployment.#If we lose the limit, we will lose our identity,# he said.And Councillor Henry Moffat warned: #We#re going to finish up with plenty of empty boats and more men on the dole. People#s livelihood is at stake now.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOThe Poor RollA considerable number of applications for poor relief were disposed of, and the roll of outdoor poor was revised, several alterations in the payments made to iniduals being sanctioned.Bailie Campbell, in connection with the usage where by children in receipt of Parish Council assistance are struck off the roll on attaining the age of  years, suggested that the rule should not be rigidly enforced, but that allowances should be continued as long as children remained in school.Such a concession might be a help to bright pupils, and in the case of others it would keep them off the streets and out of harm till such time as they secured employment.Mr M#Arthur thought it was a waste of time keeping children in school after .Pupils of exceptional educational promise might be helped on the recommendations of responsible authorities, but as for the others the best service that could be done them would be to assist in securing employment for them, and particularly with regard to girls, getting them into domestic service.Temperance reportRev Mr MacLeod, as convenor of the Temperance Committee, submitted his annual report on temperance.He said it had been hoped that the report this year would be of exceptional interest, but the No-Licence Poll taken last November showed that they had still a long way to go before they reached the goal of their desires.There was little cause for elation in the present situation, but still there was no reason to be discouraged.The failure of the efforts on behalf of No-Licence last November was due to the apathy of Christian men and women and to their indference to the terrible effects of the drink traffic.They congratulated their Arran brethren on the magnicent fight they had put up and the splendid result achieved.Shiskine had been the prime factor in the struggle, and there great things had been done but in the north end good work had also been achieved, against odds.Mr MacLeod emphasised the need for no slackening of effort in bringing home to the minds and consciences of the people their duty in relation to the drink traffic, and advised especially the education of the young with regard to this matter.There was plenty of room for increased effort in these directions in all congregations of the Presbytery.Mr MacLeod was thanked for his report."},{"url":null,"title":"happy lockdown birthday march 26 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +viaYOURTWITTERNAMEHERE\" title\"Tweet this\"TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Especially when option one, the Glen Croe route, was the chosen option from the A Trunk Road Study # summary report published by Jacobs, issued in .Surely, after nine years of consulting, the Scottish Government and Transport Scotland can choose the best solution rather than going through a y and expensive consultation process.Based on this, our members would like the permanent solution fast tracked, which is well within the Scottish Government’s power and we would ask for this to be seriously considered.Our other comments and feedback to last week’s announcement are as follows:The timber road route should be upgraded as a short-term solution this summer and not in the suggested  months.Argyll businesses have faced the issues of landslides for many years. However, the situation has worsened over the past year and in our opinion it has now become a national emergency and requires immediate action.The , tonnes of unstable material could swamp any further mitigation measures put in place on the A and Old Military Roadand make the roads impassable. This could easily happen when we next have an extended period of rainfall.Savings in further mitigation work could go towards upgrading the forestry road.The long-term solution should be selected from the  The A Trunk Road Study and based on the delivery of the most sustainable outcome.Any well-developed permanent solution needs to be open  without fear of being buried under tons of rock and mud, and will have less environmental impact than the landslides, catchpits, netting and OMR bund we are currently experiencing.Our understanding of costs and timescales from similar schemes in Norway show a tunnel could be built in three years at a cost of £-m, and not the £-m confirmed by Transport Scotland.Members of The RABT Campaign group represent a cross section of business sectors and we would welcome the chance to meet with your officials to discuss how we might help cut through the y timescales and fast track decision making.In the s and s boys were often recruited from the town and district by shipping companies.

With Tommy#s family#s kind permission, the Courier shares his story again.Campbeltown#s Tommy Kelly could have no idea he was playing before a future football icon when invited to England for professional trials in .Tommy, something of a football legend in his native Kintyre after a prominent role with Campbeltown Pupils, was known as #Iron Man# for his fearsome playing style and boundless energy.After shining in the local leagues, he was invited to Hartlepool United, a club starting season   in English football#s fourth tier, and managed by Brian Clough # all thanks to an unlikely talent spotter.Tommy said: #As far as I know it was a tanker driver working down here who told Hartlepool about me.#The next thing I had a letter through the door inviting me to a trial.#Clough ran the rule over Tommy, who played mostly as an outside right, who was then in his early s and starting out on an eventual -year career in Campbeltown with the gas board.The young Clough, in his first management job after a prolic career was cut short by injury, greeted Tommy by saying: #I hope the heather#s not growing out of your ears.#Tommy said: #That threw me a bit. I wondered who this arrogant young manager was.#I can still see him now. Although he was just starting out in management, he had total respect among the players. All you heard was #boss, boss, boss# when they addressed him.#Tommy played at outside right against a local side and scored two goals. Clough was so impressed he wanted the #Iron Man# back down for two more trial matches, and Tommy, having loved the atmosphere, was keen to .He said: #The crowd at the Victoria Ground was brilliant and it was a great feeling scoring two goals.#However, the second trip did not turn out quite as planned.Tommy laughed: #Hartlepool paid expenses for my trips but it was hardly enough to get me to Peninver.#I ed and brought the late Mike McGougan, a classy winger for the Pupils, down with me. I phoned Mr Clough beforehand and he was ok with it.#So when we arrived, I met Clough and introduced him to Mike.#Clough said: #Why don#t you bring the whole f****** pipe band down ##We were a bit shocked and Mike got annoyed and spoke back to him. He never played while we were down there.#I spent three weeks at Hartlepool between the two trips, but Clough would only sign me as an amateur. He and his assistant Peter Taylor, who was an absolute gentleman, were on a tight budget.#By that time, I had a family to think about, so it just didn#t work out. I told him it was professional or nothing.#I was just a hard player with a great engine, and the odd goal in me. I felt like I could play for  minutes instead of .#I am not sure I would have made it, but I gave it a try, and can say I played alongside John McGovern, a future two-time European Cup winner.

It is no surprise he and Taylor brought Nottingham Forest the English title and two European Cup wins.#I met the best manager the England team never had.#Tommy continued to play for Campbeltown Pupils and was even presented with a gold watch in  for his contribution to the club.Thomas Calderwood Kelly  # ."},{"url":null,"title":"hats off to kintyre larder staff","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

People were also forced to gather in evacuation shelters, making it harder to physically distance.A collection being carried out by A#Chleit, Clachan and Gigha churches will be sent to the WDP committee which has projects in Vanuatu to help with the aftermath of the most recent disasters.Everybody who participated in the service was given a bookmark to remind them of the country and its people.TARBERT:Organisers of Tarbert Seafood Festival have cancelled this year#s festival in light of ongoing Covid- restrictions around mass gatherings.The  festival was due to have been held over two days from July .While this news will likely disappoint the hundreds of people who flock to Tarbert for this popular, family-friendly weekend, the news is not all bad as organisers are confident this year#s Tarbert Music Festival will go ahead as planned from September  to .John Hardie of Tarbert Enterprise Company said: #While the recent announcement from the Scottish Government on the roadmap out of lockdown, together with the fantastic work being done by the NHS with its vaccine roll-out is encouraging, unfortunately it wasn#t enough to allow us to hold this year#s seafood festival safely.#Evenwe are in tier zero, as is hoped, by the end of June, restrictions on numbers of people attending mass gatherings will still apply. The festival is one of Scotland#s friendliest festivals with friends meeting up, milling around our many stalls and enjoying a drink in the sun while listening to live music, not to mention sampling some of the best seafood in the country.#This atmosphere is not something we could compromise for , but the  Tarbert Seafood Festival will certainly be an event worth waiting for.#He added: #We very much look forward to meeting friends, old and new, in September for this year#s music festival.

Before the end of the service, the church roof collapsed in what would have been a tragedy, however, all the congregation, being outside, were unharmed.The site is also home to the Clan MacDonald of Largie family crypt. Inside the locked mausoleum, above which the words #Here rest the bones of the House of Largie# are inscribed, are the carved grave slabs of several members of the MacDonald family, including founder Ranald Bane MacDonald, a th century warrior.The stones, featuring Celtic patterns, animals, swords and ships among other things, are said to be some of the best preserved examples in Scotland.Nature has taken hold in many areas of the graveyard but the Killean and Kilchenzie Churches Preservation Association, established in , is working to preserve the buildings that remain from further ruin.According to the charity#s Facebook page, its main aims are: to preserve and make safe the historic churches and the carved stones of Killean and Kilchenzie, by approved conservation techniques, so that these items are available for view and for study by future generations to advance education and encourage interest in the architecture, social and religious history embedded in the sites of the churches, carved stones, and the historical heritage they represent and to preserve and restore the surrounding graveyards so that the headstones are secured and their data recorded so that the genealogical records are preserved."},{"url":null,"title":"easter egg competitions cracking entries","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

In - the figure was closer to ,.It is said that damaged ied from #localised root pulling# to heavy grazing of root crops and pasture.Geese were also blamed for creating large puddles.The report suggests that one reason for geese becoming an increasing problem was the fact that they were being attracted by improved grazing work done by the farmers.The president of the Kintyre branch of the NFUS, Rory Collville, said the survey backed the case for a compensation scheme.The branch is due to discuss the survey next month.He told the Courier: #Two-and-a-half-thousand birds may not sound like much.#Butyou were a farmer with that number in your field you#d want compensation for the damage they cause.

We were blown away by the talent of the young people and it was hard to choose the winners.#Fellow judges were Finlay MacDonald, director of piping at the National Piping Centre, and composer, broadcaster and musician Gary Innes.The event was played out over three nights last week on the Pipe Bands for Pupils Facebook page, attracting thousands of viewers, who also got a chance to vote for their favourite band.The championships are run by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust which has supported piping and drumming in  local education authority areas with thousands of pupils getting lessons each week.The trust helps expand piping and drumming in Scotland#s state schools with cash grants for tuition. It also runs a free bagpipe and concert chanter lending service, and supports paid internships for aspiring tutors."},{"url":null,"title":"leader april 2 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It underlines the fact that it is communities who know best what is best for them.Argyll and Bute Council was at the centre of ensuring our resilience teams got support and Scottish Government funding dispersed quickly and efficiently.That is why I find the decision of the Tory Lib Dem Independent ruling administration to remove the recycling service from Kintyre Recycling Ltdand taking it in-house as short-sighted. And giving them only six months notice is disgraceful.KRL has provided a reliable service for the community since  and given employment opportunities to people with barriers to work. It has a committed board and management team who have ersied the projects it does to ensure sustainability. But this decision leaves a gaping hole in its business plan and a workforce unsurethey will still have jobs.There is a projected increase in cost of £, to supply recycling bins across Kintyre. But this does not take account of the possible social and welfare cost of the impact on the workforce. This is yet another blow to the community already hammered by unemployment.I urge the council to work closely with KRL to find a solution that ensures that all of the KRL employees at risk of redundancy are found suitable employment and that this valuable organisation can continue to employ vulnerable people providing services from which everyone benefits.In , the SNP published a coloured map showing options for the route of the A at the Rest and Be Thankful. Nine years later, all they have done is colour in the map slightly dferently. We are no further forward.Whoever is in government after the election must stump up the money needed to construct a road protected from landslides. This must be done a lot quicker than the  years the SNP say it will take them.Without urgent action, many businesses in Argyll will not survive.Across the Kintyre and the Islands ward I continue to receive complaints about the rather shoddy condition of road signs.In some cases the signs are faded and covered in dirt and in many other cases they are falling to pieces.One example of this is the road signs above the footpath outside of Port Ellen Primary School on Islay and sadly there are many other examples.In my opinion, in the future, Argyll and Bute Council must be more diligent in maintaining our signs. Road signs help regulate traffic, provide crucial visual guidance and give drivers important preview especially during night-time conditions.I will continue to campaign for more frequent road sign maintenance for every corner of my ward.Following the Scottish Government#s pay offer of four per cent across the board for all NHS workers, Unite will ballot its members on the offer over the next few weeks.Unite represents workers in every pay band across the entire NHS structure and recognises that while this offer will put money into the pockets of our members, any monthly pay uplt will y considerably between iniduals. For this reason, Unite will be putting this offer to our members without recommendation.The offer includes an opportunity to revisit any settlement including an intention by the Scottish Government to allocate additional funding through Barnett Consequentials. Unite will demand that any additional payment made to the Scottish Government by Westminster through this formula, is passed on to our members.Workers across the NHS have been described as #heroic# in what has been an exceptionally challenging year.Now is the time to reward those workers with the pay uplt they deserve, not just for their work during the Covid pandemic, but also for the pay cuts they have endured through years of austerity.For Unite, other pay potential remains on the table in the form of additional Barnett Consequentials and we will pursue any additional pay that is intended for our members through further negotiation with any future Scottish Government.I work for a television company called Five Mile Films and we are making a new documentary series this year for Channel .We are looking for people to apply to take part who want to live a simpler le. The filming will take place over a number of months this year in rural Britain.The idea behind the series is about saying goodbye to smartphones, Zoom calls, social media # all the distractions and pressures of normal le # to go and live a simpler le, experience the #good le# fantasy and think about what our modern le and its multitude of choices has really given us. We will explore the idea of whether, in fact, less is more.We are looking for people of all ages to apply families, couples, single people # to take time out from their normal le and step into a dferent way of living.If any of your readers are interested in finding out more, they should email simplele@fivemilefilms, telling us briefly why you would like to live a simpler le.Since the UK was first officially plunged into lockdown, we have lived through what is probably the most extraordinary year in most people#s letimes.Blind and partially sighted people have had to adjust like everyone  to the daily challenges this has created. Thankfully, there#s now light at the end of the tunnel. But some ongoing measures could continue to be barriers to their independence and confidence.People with sight-loss can sometimes find it dficult to judge space, so we#re asking everyone to maintain their own distance, be patient and be helpful.Just getting out and about can be more hazardous for those without sight. The government#s #Spaces for People# initiative has already transformed many of our streets and thoroughfares.We must take care that this doesn#t inadvertently create new obstacles for those with disabilities.The Covid crisis has given all of us a sense of uncertainty and vulnerability, of what it#s like to depend more on others.

It is not depression it is more subtle and has spiritual overtones – I would say it is most profoundly a spiritual phenomenon.Looking into it, I clearly identied aspects of it in myself today! It appears to be the most #underdiagnosed# and unacknowledged spiritual illness of this age.I found that Pope Francis also came across it. Commenting in the context of healing the paralytic by the pool, he said the #first illness# is the one afflicting the paralysed man. He had #resigned himself to it,# the Pope said, #perhaps saying to himself: #Le is unfair, others are more fortunate than I am#. There is a plaintive tone in this way of speaking # there is resignation but there is also bitterness.#He added that it is an attitude reminiscent of #many [Christians] who lack enthusiasm and who are bitter#, who repeatedly say to themselves: #I go to [church] every Sunday but it is better not to become involved! I believe for my own sake, but I don#t feel the need to give it to others: each one peacefully at his own home.#These people, the Pope added, also take the attitude that # you do something well in le, they#ll reprove you: so, it#s better not to take the risk#.Good Friday, Easter Sunday # excellent days to take the risk and resolve to do something well in le, to set sensible goals to be better than I am now.

with East Lothian residents electing their new representative next month.Four candidates - Euan Davidson , Craig Hoy , Paul McLennanand Martin Whitfield- are in the running for the role.Each week, the East Lothian Courier will give each of the candidates the chance to speak about what theyve been up to and why you should vote for them.Euan Davidson I SPENT last weekend in Dunbar and Haddington with local activists highlighting local issues of concern.The theme running through all of the problems we discussed is a lack of local empowerment.Too often, services are centralised and decisions are taken out of the hands of local people for example, the running down of services at Belhaven Hospital by the Scottish Government.If the SNP Health Secretary had agreed to a small upgrade grant back in -, signicantly more services could have been retained.Across the county, we see the same lack of joined-up thinking, with vast new housing estates lacking the essential additional infrastructure to support them: GP surgeries full, schools at capacity and non-existent public transport provision.A centralised police force has seen officers disappear from our streets.The closure of Haddingtonrsquos court forces victims and witnesses to travel into Edinburgh where there is a signicant backlog in cases.Liberal Democrats want to empower our communities to make decisions for themselves.The SNPrsquos centralising tendency damages our local services.Repeatedly, local decision-making is overturned by the Scottish Governmentrsquos reporters.Of course, media attention is focussed on the launch of the Alba Party and Kenny MacAskillrsquos defection.Mr MacAskill has said thatelected to Holyrood, he intends to stay an MP.Personally, I believe this is unacceptable.East Lothian deserves full-time representation at both Holyrood and Westminster.The other concern is that the SNP and Alba seem determined to turn this election into a referendum on independence.Itrsquos almost aswersquore not pinned down by a frightening pandemic asour economy is not on its knees aswe are not struggling against poverty and climate change emergencies asour education standards are not careering down international league tables.Letrsquos spend the next five weeks talking about what matters rather than a constitutional obsession.Craig Hoy NO SOONER was the election starting gun fired than blows were traded.Unlike normal campaigns, it wasnrsquot the cut and thrust of argument between parties hitting the headlines.Instead, Kenny MacAskill MP arrogantly turned his back on his SNP colleagues ndash and betrayed the trust of voters in East Lothian ndash by defecting to Alex Salmondrsquos Alba Party.I will fight this campaign positively, asking for the support of every pro-UK voter in this constituency.While campaigning canrsquot take place in the usual way, I have already spoken with hundreds of constituents by telephone and have delivered thousands of leaflets.Two clear themes have emerged.Firstly, people are sick of the sleaze, ision and incompetence of this SNP Government.And they no longer trust Labour on the Union.Residents donrsquot want to be dragged back to the ision of another independence referendum.Instead, they want the MSP who succeeds Iain Gray to be a strong voice for the interests of local people.Thatrsquos why I have announced five-point plans for towns and villages across East Lothian.We need to create more jobs, improve education, stop overdevelopment and tackle problems such as drugs and anti-social behaviour.The issue of tactical voting has also come up on the lsquovirtual doorsteprsquo.Labour is weak on the Union and can no longer win this seat.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has refused to rule out giving Holyrood power to hold another independence referendum.Labour wonrsquot agree to form a pro-UK coalition in opposition to the separatists.Voters fear that Labour simply canrsquot say no to Nicola Sturgeon.Anas Sarwar helped Nicola pass the Hate Crime Bill and sat on the fence over her misleading Parliament.I am clear that a vote for any of the smaller fringe parties will only split the pro-UK vote.In East Lothian, there is only one way of using your two votes to stop the SNP.By voting for me in the constituency vote ndash and Conservative on the party ballot paper ndash we can block an SNP majority and another referendum.By doing that, you will guarantee the next parliament will be focussed on rebuilding the economy and our communities.Paul McLennan AFTER meeting a number of environment groups in the past few weeks, Irsquove taken time this week to reflect on how we transform how our economy operates with improved stewardship of our environment.Societyrsquos underlying health and a sustainable environment need to be measured by more than just figures on a balance sheet.The Wellbeing Economy Allianceurges transforming how the economy operates, warning that unless we rethink who wins and who loses out ldquowe wonrsquot have a chance of delivering that goal: social justice on a healthy planet.We can explore immediately green jobs for economic development, protect wild spaces for animals to thrive and iniduals to enjoy, and sustain our landscape.The Trossachs and the Cairngorms are renowned as Scotlandrsquos only two national parks as your MSP, Irsquod work with agribusiness, rural communities, environmental and other groups to investigate the feasibility of the Lammermuirs becoming a third national park.This echoes the call by the National Trust for Scotland to explore further options for national parks in Scotland.A natural boundary between the Lothians and the Borders, the Lammermuirsrsquo stunning landscape and history would attract locals to access nature and enhance wellbeing, boosting the rural economy.Other measures specic to East Lothian are achievable, realistic and right for now, including engaging in Scotland as a recognised lsquoRe-wilding Nationrsquo.As MSP, Irsquoll also support a feasibility study for Haddington train station a planning bill overhaul to ensure new-builds include electric car points and  per cent of transport budgets designated for active transport.As a government, the SNP has introduced world-leading climate change policies.We have pledged net-zero emissions by  and are on course to meet that target.Last year, we generated . per cent of our electricity demand from renewables.This is displacing millions of tonnes of carbon a year, bringing jobs and enormous socio-economic impacts to our communities.Iceland and New Zealand, successful small democracies led by women, joined Scotland as Nicola Sturgeon pioneered the lsquoWellbeing Economy Governments Grouprsquo.Highlighting the inter-connection of personal and national wellbeing, Nicola argued ldquothe goal of economic policy should be collective wellbeing: how happy and healthy a population is, not just how wealthy.I want East Lothian to lead on the transformative change our environment needs ndash we can be the change we all desire.Martin Whitfield I WAS joined by Scottish Labourrsquos new leader Anas Sarwar and local party members at the launch of my campaign.Its key message is that Labour will focus on what unites us and on recovery ndash not another isive referendum.Mr Sarwar told the virtual meeting that a lsquonational recovery planrsquo for Scotland would be the centrepiece of Scottish Labourrsquos election campaign, covering key priority areas for recovery from Covid, including jobs, the NHS, education, climate and communities.Speaking after the launch, Mr Sarwar said: ldquoScottish Labour, under my leadership, will make a national recovery our only priority. Itrsquos only by voting for us that you can guarantee that we have a parliament focused on recovery.I have also hit the ground running with key local campaign calls, including reiterating my support for the reinstatement of a rail service and station for Haddington, and calling for a staffed shared banking hub to be piloted in Prestonpans to bring banking services back to the town.This election is all about how we recover and rebuild after the pandemic and the fairer future that local people can havewe work together to focus on recovery.East Lothian needs a recovery plan that will deliver local jobs, remobilise our NHS, provide children with a comeback plan, deal with the climate emergency and support communities to rebuild.These are the issues I will focus on over the coming weeks to ensure that East Lothianrsquos people, communities and organisations have the support they need to come back stronger after Covid-.While I am keen to have as much contact with local residents as is allowed under the current public health restrictions, these constraints mean it mostly needs to be online at the moment.I am also continuing my work as a teacher for the early part of the campaign, so my availability is restricted.Anyone who would like to speak to me either by phone or video call should email contactus@eastlothianlabourparty to set up a meeting.More information on my campaign is at facebook martinwhitfieldeastlothian or www.eastlothianlabourparty"},{"url":null,"title":"four-candidates-confirmed-scottish-parliament-election-2021-midlothian-north-musselburgh","story":"Colin Beattie , Stevie Curran , Charles Dundasand Iain Whytewere confirmed as the four candidates for the seat at the Holyrood election when nominations closed yesterday afternoon.Mr Beattie has represented the area in Holyrood since .

strange that our Holyrood constituency crosses county borders, with Musselburgh, Wallyford and Whitecraig on the east side of the boundary.There are similarities between Midlothian and East Lothian, we have many shared values, but in other ways our counties are very dferent.East Lothian being a coastal authority attracts much more tourism, with a wonderful array of golf courses which I particularly enjoy.Irsquove been a member at Musselburgh Golf Clubfor over  years.Now for some of the politics of this election.I opposed independence in  and I oppose another referendum.We canrsquot risk having a parliament that focuses on old arguments or settling old scores. Scotland deserves a better government and a better opposition.Our focus must be on delivering a national recovery plan so we can build a fairer and stronger Scotland.I will be a strong voice for our communities.I will focus on a recovery plan, a health recovery, an education recovery, a jobs recovery.I will fight for opportunities for our young people and I will campaign for fairer funding for our councils.There are also local issues that require urgent intervention, probably none more so than the very poor patient experiences at Riverside Medical Practice.I cannot accept that it is not within the gt of your MSP to resolve these problems.This will be my very first task.Charles Dundas WHILST some people seem to have been distracted during the first week of this election by the fuss around a new party and defections from the SNP, Irsquom very pleased to report that Willie Rennie and the Scottish Liberal Democrats have kicked things off on a really positive and constructive note.Our campaign has been launched with a needle-sharp focus on putting recovery from the pandemic first.For communities like Musselburgh, that means prioritising the creation of jobs, cutting NHS waiting times, boosting mental health services and seriously tackling the climate emergency.In the first week of the campaign, our Lib Dem focus has been on setting out our plans to boost Scottish education for every stage and age: to get a good start in le to excel at school and to help people retrainthey need to.At the heart of our ideas for education are an Education Bounce Back plan to tackle the attainment gap, because we believe it is an essential investment which allows everyone in Scotland to achieve their potential.Back in , the SNP called our proposals for extra money to be allocated directly to schools and targeted at closing the poverty-related attainment gap ldquodangerous and ldquoridiculous, but we didnrsquot give up, and during the last Parliament the Scottish Government created a Pupil Equity Funding scheme to do just that on a year-by-year basis.Then in the last Scottish budget, the Lib Dems were able to secure an extra  per centto boost that scheme and do more to close the attainment gap.Now, Willie Rennie and the Lib Dems propose to make this targeted extra money for the schools who need it most a permanent feature of Scottish education, and start offering it on a long-term basis to schools so that they can make plans to invest it over multiple years with confidence.That should allow the  teachers currently employed on temporary contracts because of the uncertainty around the PEF scheme to be given more security and allow Scottish education to bounce back the way that it needs to.Iain Whyte WHILE campaigning this week, I have been investigating the car parking provision in Musselburgh.I do not agree with the suggestion from East Lothian Council of introducing parking charges at coastal car parks at Back Sands and Levenhall Links.The council is considering introducing charges here on an experimental basis in line with existing arrangements at other coastal car parks.The council has also mooted the possibility of a further review of parking charges in a much wider Musselburgh Town Centre Parking Review.The introduction of parking charges at coastal car parks further down the East Lothian coast has been deeply unpopular and I am disappointed that East Lothian Council are considering expanding the arrangements to Musselburgh.The waterfront area has seen an increase in visitors throughout the pandemic.This has been a really good thing, as people have needed that break in the fresh air to exercise and maintain their mental health.But it isnrsquot enough just to think about what happens during the remaining lockdown.We need to encourage visitors to keep visiting the area once lockdown is over.This will help to rebuild the Musselburgh economy by supporting local businesses.The same goes for the town centre car parks, which are vital to getting high street businesses back on their feet once they can reopen.Introducing car parking charges would send out entirely the wrong message and will only encourage visitors to park in locations where there is no charging.That could be very disruptive for local residents as their neighbourhood streets would become clogged with cars avoiding the charges, giving them their own parking headache.If elected, I will work with the local Conservative councillor in Musselburgh to oppose this proposal and do all I can to encourage visitors to Musselburgh to help businesses rebuild in line with the Scottish Conservative proposal for a Town Centres Revival Plan."},{"url":null,"title":"dunbar-asssembly-rooms-flat-plan-rejected","story":"Dunbar Assembly

planning committee this week, elected members voted by seven votes to four to refuse planning permission.Dunbar Community Council had supported the application as a sympathetic conversion which would stop the building, built in , deteriorating further.: Assembly Rooms planThe basement of the B-listed at-risk building has already been converted into flats.Concern over plans to raise the height of the roof to accommodate the new flats and a lack of parking spaces saw councillors reject the plans.Planning convenor Councillor Norman Hampshire, ward member for Dunbar, was among those who voted to refuse planning permission.He said that parking on Church Street, where the building is, was already dficult, adding that a recent survey suggested there were double the number of properties in Dunbar town centre than there were parking spaces.He said: ldquoI cannot support this application. The parking is the major issue and there is already double the number of residential properties in the town centre than parking spaces, so to create even more is just unacceptable in my mind.However, Dunbar community councillor Jacquie Bell, who said that the community council backed the application, described the decision as lsquodisappointingrsquo.She told the committee that the community council had been concerned about the future of the building for a long time.She said: ldquoWe do support the proposals and welcome the reduction in units. We did have concerns about raising of the roof height but note listed building consent has already been granted for that.ldquoThe lack of parking has been raised and we concur there is an issue however, we do not believe a lack of provision should be a reason for refusing this proposal.She pointed to other land at the site which remained derelict and could be used for parking spaces, while acknowledging it was a complex issue because of multipleownerships.And she questioned why no elected councillor had informed the community council that the application had been called in to be decided by the planning committee.The application was called in by Mr Hampshire after officers indicated their intention to approve it ndash information Mrs Bell believes should be shared with community councils as well.Following the decision, she said: ldquoYet again, the local community is not being heard and the building will be allowed to continue to rot because of lack of parking.ldquoThe community council was not told this application had been called in.ldquoThe community council and Shore and Harbour Group supported the application to save the B listed building.ldquoPlanning policy permits a reduction in parking provision where positive townscape benefits would result ndash the conversion of the Assembly Rooms and the saving of the B listed building at risk would be a positive townscape benefit."},{"url":null,"title":"caring-dunbar-day-centre-staff-take-road","story":"Dunbar Day Centre has sat empty for more than  months, with the role of staff changing.Jamie McNeil, manager of the building on Westgate, stressed that the doors might be closed but the service is very much still ongoing.He said: ldquoWhen the building closed, everything we had been offering stopped all that community interaction and respite care ceased.ldquoRoutine is essential for people with dementia, so we had to adapt and help, to continue our service but in a completely dferent way.ldquoWe started visiting only four people during lockdown one now that is .ldquoWe visit and chat, take members for walks to help their mobility.ldquoWe can help with shopping or just keep in touch.

We all know an insatiable Labrador .Labradors will devour everything they can get hold of. Some breeds are more picky and highly unlikely to eat anything other than a tasty morsel.There are some toy breed owners who would love their pet to eat a hearty meal every now and then.This is something to consider when buying a pup.Dogs come in a huge iety of breeds, behaviours, shapes and sizes, so choosing a dog to fit your lestyle can be extremely dficult. It is best to do lots of research before contemplating buying a dog.Many dogs have natural instincts such as herding and guarding, and these should be considered prior to choosing a dog.There are seven main classes of dog, each with their own characteristics. These are only guidelines and all dogs have their own characteristics.Border collies are generally very agile and not especially food-orientated ndash but recently, our receptionist Adele took an interesting call at our Dunedin Vets Tranent surgery, from Mrs Jane Green.She had been playing on the beach at North Berwick with her dog Zed, an exuberant -month-old Border collie. They had been having great fun on a dry, sunny morning when suddenly the ball she threw for Zed disappeared.Mrs Green was convinced Zed had swallowed it whole. There appeared to be no other explanation for the disappearing ball.Adele advised her to come to the surgery as soon as possible after ascertaining that Zed wasnrsquot choking.I have seen cases where hard balls have become lodged in dogsrsquo throats, cutting off the air supply and literally choking the dog. Always make sure the ball your dog is playing with is large enough not to lodge in their airway.Zed wasnrsquot choking and seemed remarkably bright.When he arrived at the surgery, Zed was examined by vet Rachel.She discussed the case with Mrs Green. Rachel could not feel the ball when she felt Zacrsquos abdomen, but Mrs Green was sure he had swallowed it and she showed Rachel a similar one, which was certainly too large to pass through his intestines.At this point, as vets we have to decide how to determineZed had indeed swallowed a ball, so we look to diagnostic imaging. The first thing we may consider is radiography.Only a few years ago,vets wanted to visualise the internal structures of your petrsquos body, a radiograph would be taken using an x-ray machine, which showed the image on a piece of photographic-type paper.The radiograph had to be processed manually in a dark room, using noxious chemicals, and it could take about  minutes to develop one plate.If several radiographs were required, the pet would be under anaesthetic for a prolonged period of time. Pets require sedation or general anaesthetic for radiographs to be taken.The patient has to be positioned correctly and be perfectly still whilst the radiograph is taken. This ensures the best image possible is produced at the first attempt and ensures minimal radiation exposure.Nowadays, we have digital x-rays. The patient still has to be perfectly still whilst the radiograph is taken but the processing is complete in under one minute.The images appear on a computer screen and can be viewed from dferent angles and intensities as required. Fewer radiographs need to be taken and patients are anaesthetised for much shorter times.After light sedation, Zed lay still to have his x-ray taken. This confirmed the ball was in his stomach, with the dense squeaker clearly visible.After discussion with Mrs Green, Zed went for surgery. Vet Rachel, with nurse Jenny, the anaesthetist, performed an exploratory operation to locate and remove the ball.With careful surgical skill, Rachel removed the ball from Zedrsquos stomach and checked to ensure there were no other foreign objects or damage to Zedrsquos intestinal tract.It would not be the first time that one object has been removed, only to find something  in the intestines as well!She closed the wound and Jenny monitored Zed as he recovered. He was given intravenous fluid, pain relief and antibiotics to ensure good recovery and stop infection after his operation.Once he was awake and stable, he was transferred to our out-of-hours carers at the Braids Veterinary Hospital, where he was monitored constantly until he was allowed home the following day.Zed has been examined by several vets at Dunedin Vets since hishome and, although at first quite tender and not his normal happy self, he is improving and should be back to his lively, bouncy self pretty soon.Please ensure you do not give your pets items to play with that they could swallow. They are not aware of the consequencesthey do and they may not all be as lucky as Zed."},{"url":null,"title":"dirleton-tantallon-castles-among-attractions-aiming-reopen-month","story":"The National Trust for Scotland and Historic Environment Scotland have shared plans for opening Newhailes House in Musselburgh, Preston Mill at East Linton, and Dirleton and Tantallon Castles from April  onwards, providing Scotland continues to progress out of lockdown.The grounds at Newhailes and Inveresk Lodge Garden have been accessible for exercise all through the winter.The National Trust for Scotlandhas confirmed that most of its built heritage, as well as estates and gardens across Edinburgh and the Lothians, will be open for visitors from the end of April.Historic Environment Scotlandhas said it plans to open  of its staffed sites on the same day, with more reopening on a phased basis over the coming months.All visits to Dirleton and Tantallon Castles, alongside HESrsquo other sites, must be booked in advance.Social distancing measures will be in place, as will a one-way system in some locations and contactless payments where possible.Parts of some sites, such as indoor or enclosed spaces, will be closed and visitor numbers will be limited for safety reasons.Other sites will be reopened on a phased basis over the coming months.For more information visit historicenvironment.scot our-reopening-plans-and-covid--responseNTS is urging anyone planning to visit to check the latest opening information at nts.org.uk before travelling, as some properties have dferent opening patterns this summer.

He had a love spot on his forehead,anyone saw it theyrsquod fall in love with him.ldquoHandy, said Finn, amused by the idea.ldquoWell not always, so he kept it hidden under his long hair. But Grainne was smitten by him and so she had a plan.ldquoShe put a sleeping potion in Fionnrsquos drink and the drinks of others, then placed a sacred oath on Diarmuid so he had to go with her. They fled as Fionn slept. When he awoke he was enraged at the betrayal. He vowed revenge and hunted for them for many years.ldquoWait a minute, said her nephew. ldquoFionn didnrsquot love her did he  I mean they hadnrsquot met until then, so why was he so angry : Chapter  of Tims BookldquoHe saw it as a betrayal. Diarmuid had been one of Fionnrsquos closest friends now hersquod run off with the woman he was due to marry.ldquoBut she didnrsquot want to marry Fionn anyway.ldquoIt was the way of things in those days, women had no choice in who to marry. Thatrsquos why I like Grainne, she refused to accept it and ran off with the man she did love. She defied the greatest warrior that had lived as well as convention. There are many stories about her travels with Diarmuid, places they hid, the adventures they had. All this time Fionn was searching for them. When he finally found them, the years seemed to have softened his anger and they made peace.ldquoSo it was a happy ending then  I canrsquot see the connection to the name of this place, though, said Finn.ldquoThe tale is not finished. Izzy stopped walking to explain what happened next.: Chapter  of Tims BookldquoYou see, the way Fionn felt inside was not the way it showed on the outside. Bitterness still festered under the surface and it showed itself when he went hunting with Diarmuid and the other warriors of the Fianna.ldquoDuring the hunt, Diarmuid was attacked by a wild boar. A prophesy had told that he would be killed by a boar and the beast savaged him. He managed to kill it, but Diarmuid lay mortally wounded.ldquoThere was one chance to save him. If Fionn gave Diarmuid water to drink from his hands, his magical powers would save his le.ldquoAh, because of his magic thumb  wondered Finn.ldquoAye, well remembered Finn. There was no time to lose. Fionn rushed to a nearby burn, cupped his hands and brought water to the dying Diarmuid. But then...Izzy put her hand on her heart.ldquoThen what  her nephew asked, spreading out his arms in a questioning gesture.ldquoFionnrsquos anger and vengeance ed. He couldnrsquot forgive Diarmuid for his betrayal. So he deliberately let the water seep through his fingers.ldquoBut Fionnrsquos emotions were conflicting and when he saw Diarmuid dying on the ground his bitterness eased, and he ran back to the burn to collect water. But, as before, he let the water drain from his hands because, in the last moment, he still couldnrsquot forgive.: Chapter  of Tims BookIzzy began walking.ldquoSo he leaves Diarmuid to die  asked Finn, catching up with his aunt.She paused again.ldquoHis warriors, including Fionnrsquos own son Ossian, begged him to give Diarmuid water. They were all loyal to him, but they also loved Diarmuid. They had all suffered from the split between to two men they both loved.ldquoSo for a third time, Fionn ed to the burn. He walked carefully with the water in his hands. Memories of his old friendship flooded his mind. An understanding grew in him of the power of Grainnersquos love for Diarmuid and how dficult it had been for them. Fionn felt his bitterness and anger finally dissolve he could now forgive.ldquoHe knelt down by Diarmuid and carefully trickled the water onto his lips. But it was just too late.ldquoHe was dead Izzy nodded. Finn walked on, saying nothing.: Chapter  of Tims BookThey had reached the part of the trail where tall planted pine trees grew. There was the faint sound of running water below on their right and Izzy led Finn down a small path that zigzagged steeply down a slope.They reached a burn which tumbled down the glen, with native trees lining its banks.Izzy paused by a hazel tree that leaned over the burn to catch the sunlight. Finn arrived with a thoughtful look on his face.ldquoSo that story is how Creag an Tuirc got its name  he asked.Izzy was looking for hazelnuts, so she spoke as she knelt down and foraged.ldquoNobody knows for sure how it got its name. The tale of Grainne and Diarmuid is actually an ancient legend from Ireland, but legends and stories are carried by people and planted in new places.She stood up happy, holding a hazelnut between her thumb and finger. She put it in her pocket and looked at her nephew.ldquoThere was a shared culture and language here with Ireland. Creag na Tuirc was named in Gaelic in the mists of time. Was the story of Diarmuidrsquos death told here round the fireside  For sure it was. Was the rock named to give the tale a local setting  I like to think itrsquos possible. There are lots of places in the Highlands named after these old Celtic legends. Therersquos a place called Tor an Tuirc which means hill of the boar, near Oban, and close by there is a standing stone called Diarmuidrsquos pillar. Local people said it was where he was buried. So the stories were planted here many years ago and now have roots here too. In fact, just up the road there is what tradition says is Fionnrsquos grave.ldquoReally! Aw can we go there aunty, please : Chapter  of Tims BookldquoOf course, we might even be able to see it later today, Izzy assured him.She continued her search for hazelnuts and Finn helped, but they found no more.ldquoIrsquod hoped to find nine, explained his aunt.ldquoWhy nine ldquoIrsquoll tell you later, in a story, Izzy smiled.Finn was quiet as they walked down the path by the tumbling water. Suddenly, he recognised where he was: the waterfall theyrsquod passed earlier.ldquoYou stay here and enjoy the falls, Irsquoll meet you at Rob Royrsquos grave, said Izzy as she wandered back to Balquhidder Kirk.: Chapter  of Tims BookFinn stayed a while longer, watching the water cascade over the rocks. The sound soothed him and the damp coolness of the air was welcome in what was becoming a very warm day.He eventually walked back to the kirk and emerged from the shade of the trees to see his aunt talking to a man. They broke off their conversation as soon as they saw Finn and the man walked briskly away out of the kirkyard.ldquoJust a tourist asking about Rob Roy, she explained when she saw Finnrsquos inquisitive expression.Two women then arrived.ldquoDo you know where Rob Royrsquos grave is  they asked Finn. He smiled and pointed at it.ldquoCould you take our photo please  they asked.They stood by the graveside with their thumbs up as Finn clicked a couple of times to make sure. Finn was keen to explain the mystery of the grave but they didnrsquot linger. The women thanked him and left, happy theyrsquod got their photo.As they drove away, Finn noticed the other car parked in the small parking space.He was sure it was the same car which had been parked in the layby by Samsonrsquos Stone the day before. But he thought no more of it, as his stomach began to tell him it was time for some proper food.He looked for his aunt. She was in the th-century kirk, looking at a stone with a carving of a person on it.ldquoIrsquom hungry, can we go for lunch  Finn asked.ldquoSure.They walked back to the car through the wood and past the waterfall once again.On the way, Izzy pointed out the grave of Robert Kirkrsquos we, who had died young, and the faerie hill on the northern edge of the kirkyard.It was midday and the sky was almost a Mediterranean blue.They left Balquhidder and drove towards Kingshouse at the east of the glen, which was originally built to accommodate British army officers using the military road.Balquhidder had seen its share of Redcoat atrocities in the aftermath of Culloden in , as many MacLarens had come out for Bonnie Prince Charlie.The military road had been built to make transport of the military easier, and to supply the many British army forts located in the Highlands, which were garrisoned to keep an eye on potential Jacobite trouble.As they drove out of the glen towards Loch Earn, Izzy told the tale of Capt Donald MacLaren.He had joined the Jacobites during the rising of . He was wounded and captured, then taken on a journey to England for execution. But he managed to escape while passing a place called the Devilrsquos Beef Tub in the south of Scotland, and one tradition says he ed to Balquhidder and lived many years in disguise as a woman, despite being heavily built.She told it in a funny way and Finn laughed at the image of this big bearded man dressed as a woman fooling the soldiers.ldquoHow can you remember all these stories  he asked.ldquoI remember the pictures they paint in my imagination, replied Izzy.ldquoMaybe I sometimes get some of the details wrong but for me they are portraits in my head and so when I tell the story I just describe what I see. Thatrsquos the way I remember anyway.Finn understood what she meant. Her stories had helped him paint his own portraits in his head.He was silent for a while as Izzy drove, then said: ldquoI want to phone my mum.ldquoOf course sweetie, letrsquos find a phone box and seeshersquos free.Izzy felt a wave of anxiety. She was worried that Finn might have recognised who she had been talking to at Balquhidder. She also had emotions that were not showing on the surface.She asked herselfshe was she doing the right thing.

spokesperson for the group said: ldquoIt is not always the case that when a public house closes its doors because it becomes financially unviable, it merely takes another landlord to give it a quick makeover then reopen.ldquoSometimes the owner of closed public house premises is required by financial necessity to look at other uses that the buildings can be put to, or indeed whether the buildings can be taken down and something  such as housing built in their stead.ldquoIn this case, the owner of the building has taken the view that this local public house has a future, but not in its present form, and that it can once again become a popular amenity for the local village.The pub already has a kitchen to prepare and cook food.However, it was felt it was ldquonot sufficient to form the basis for re-opening the premises to the public.Now, changes will be made indoors at the pub, with alterations to the location of the toilets, as well as space for al fresco dining.Outside, an existing ancillary building and a small extension, used as a cleanersrsquo store, will be demolished.East Lothian Councilrsquos planning department approved the proposals, which did not attract any

visitors.If our communities and the council do not plan and prepare for this, as sure as night follows day, ending lockdown will be followed by traffic chaos, parking anger and quite possibly a few irate letters to the Courier.Last summer, after the proposal to turn Elcho Green into a car park had been scrapped, a handful of North Berwick residents undertook a week-long survey of the townrsquos car parks, counting spare spaces in the morning, the middle of the day and late afternoon.The week chosen included a Friday on which the beaches were the busiest any of us had ever seen them.There were very rarely any spare spaces in the long-stay, free-to-use car parks in the town centre .Morning and afternoon there were always spaces free in the shorter-stay car parksand in the paid-forcar park.There were always Blue Badge spaces available, but on the busier lunchtimes all other spaces were full in these car parks.On the busy beach days, the parking at Recreation Park and at the station car park was also full by the middle of the day, although at all other times there were spaces at these.Even on the very busiest days, the car parks at the sports centre and the high school were virtually empty, and the car parks of Tesco and Aldi also had spare capacity.No one can expect to be able to park where they want, when they want, for as long as they want, all at no cost.Building more car parks is not viable.The only sites proposed are ones where any other form of development would not be tolerated.Any gain for drivers would be small compared to the loss of amenity, and any parking created would not be adequate.The solution is to use the parking resources that we have more efficiently.If you have an errand which requires a car, avoid lunchtime.Your best bet is to get in and out before am.If you can manage your trip to town without using a car, walk or cycle instead.On the really busy beach days, we need to do more than leave matters to first-come first-served.Even good signage, although helpful, will not solve the problem alone.Anyone who recalls the traffic gridlock on Marine Parade last year will know that what is required is some active traffic management: closing the road to the Haugh car park when it is full, and having helpful and friendly guides at Marine Parade and where directing visitors to the places they might find a place to park firstly to the Rec or the station and, once those car parks are full, to the school and the sports centre.Robbie Wightman,Clford Road,North

about , patients ndash which was making it ldquoreally hard for patients to get through on the phone and book an appointment.It comes as an online petition has been launched by patients calling for ldquourgent change.The number of call attempts to the practice, the largest in East Lothian, rose sharply in March after a period where the number of call attempts were slowly decreasing to pre-Covid- pandemic levels.The Riverside, which is based at Musselburgh Primary Care Centre, said that the pattern of call attempts had changed too, as more calls were made at am to try and book an appointment, with a larger number of redials being seen.Dr Richard Fairclough, GP partner, said: ldquoWersquore looking at all of the data we get via our phone system as quickly as possible, so we can understand the full extent of the situation that we and the local community are facing.ldquoWersquore also trying to better quanty all the dferent reasons people call, so we can better understand how to best direct patients to other more appropriate health services, and to our online services.ldquoBut one thing is apparent: demand is completely outstripping the health systemrsquos capacity to meet that need, and there are more people needing an appointment than each appointment we have available. This has been the case for some time.ldquoThis means that some people are being left without the expert support from their GP that we desperately want to offer, and we recognise the depth of feeling in the community about this.ldquoWersquore doing absolutely everything we can to try and improve the situation, including increasing the number of clinical and non-clinical staff we have, and working to improve our phone system and the way we manage calls we receive.ldquoWe need to be clear, though, that all of these changes will take time and will not improve the situation overnight.ldquoOnce all of the recruitment is completed, we will be at the limit of people we can employ at the practice, so the number of calls we can answer and the number of appointments we then have available will not substantially increase without wider health system change.ldquoThe practice met with Colin Beattie MSP last week, along with East Lothian Health and Social CarePartnership, community councils and our patient participation group, all of whom have expressed their willingness to work collaboratively with us to bring change.ldquoWersquove made clear to all the pressure wersquore experiencing and the impact this has for people in Musselburgh and for our staff. Wersquove also made clear the changes that need to happenpeople in Musselburgh are to have their health needs met ndash namely a rapid move to put in place the changes the Scottish Government has already agreed must happen right across Scotland to relieve what was recognised several years ago as an unsustainable workload in general practice.ldquoThese changes include the movement of urgent care, pharmacotherapy , vaccinations and community nursing away from general practice, to come instead under the control of local health and social care partnerships. This will allow GPs to focus on their role as expert medical generalists, working to improve the long-term health of both iniduals and the wider community they serve.ldquoAs Musselburgh continues to grow, we also urgently need to hear from those overseeing the development of the town to hear how they plan to service the primary care needs of the community.The online petition launched by patients says: ldquoPatientsrsquo frustrations are running high as appointments are increasingly dficult and mostly impossible to secure.ldquoWait times on calls to connect to the surgery are often in excess of an hour, only to be told there are no appointments available and the patient needs to call back the following day to repeat the frustrating process, with no guarantee of an appointment at the end.ldquoReports of calls being made every day for a week with no success in securing an appointment are now commonplace.ldquoUrgent change is needed, as the health of patients registered with the practice is being put at risk on a daily basis.ldquoThe staff within the practice are working flat out but it is obvious demand far exceeds supply.The petition will be lodged with the Scottish Parliamentrsquos Cabinet Health Minister and Lothian Health Board Patient Experience Committee.They are being asked to intervene and assist the practice ldquoto analyse their current problems, thereafter equip them with the resources needed to implement an accessible appointment system which will, in turn, provide comprehensive medical care for every registered patient at the practice.The petition is at change.org p patients-registered-with-riverside-practice-riverside-practice-appointment-systemThe practice said it was pleased that its patients were adding their voices to the calls for change.A spokesperson for the East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership, said: ldquoELHSCP is already delivering a wide range of self-referral services that offer patients sameday access to specialist clinical, mental health and MSK supportin Musselburgh and across the county.

Eggs symbolise new le, and often appeared in pagan festivals celebrating spring.And for Christians, the egg symbolises the moment in the Bible when Jesus is resurrected after his crucixion.As the tradition evolved over the centuries, chocolate versions of eggs became more popular as gts for children than real eggs - for obvious reasons.The first chocolate eggs appeared in France and Germany during the th century, but they were bitter and hard.Yet as chocolate-making techniques began to improve, Cadbury produced the first modern chocolate Easter egg that we enjoy today in .The chocolatier used a pure cocoa butter that could be easily moulded into the smooth shape.Hollow chocolate Easter eggs quickly became popular, and they still remain a favourite Easter tradition with many around the world.A lot of people also give up chocolate for lent, so indulging in some chocolate eggs became a common way to mark the end of the Christian fasting period.As well as consuming chocolate eggs, there are other egg-related Easter traditions that are synonymous with the religious holiday.Rolling hard-boiled eggs is a favoured activity, and for Christians this is a symbolic re-enactment of when the stone was rolled away from Christrsquos tomb in the Bible.Painting and decorating hard-boiled eggs is also a beloved tradition that children especially enjoy.These two activities often go hand-in-hand, with children painting their eggs before finding a hill to roll them down until they crack.An Easter egg hunt is another popular tradition many take part in over the Christian weekend.Chocolate treats are hidden around the garden or the house, ready to be found by family members - and the winner is the person who finds more than anyone .The Easter bunny is said to arrive over the weekend, hiding eggs for when children wake up on Easter Sunday.There are numerous tales surrounding the origins of the Easter bunny.One is that the rabbit comes from the ancient pagan festival of Eostre, which honoured the goddess of fertility and spring.Her animal symbol is believed to have been a rabbit, which traditionally represents fertility.Meanwhile, in America, some people believe that the Easter bunny was introduced in the s by German immigrants in Pennsylvania.Their egg-laying hare, known as ldquoOsterhase or ldquoOschter Haws, was said to lay colorful eggs as gts to children who behaved well.The Easter bunnys egg delivery then evolved over time to include treats such as toys and chocolate."},{"url":null,"title":"scotland-covid-vaccine-certificate-app-explored-lockdown-freedom","story":"Jeane Freeman said that ethical and equality questions would need to be kept under review ndash but added that she favours a digital certicate over a paper version to reduce any unnecessary burden on the NHS.Her comments came ahead of a Downing Street news conference later on Monday at which the Prime Minister is expected to set out further details on the planned certication scheme in England.Proposals were announced at the weekend for a ldquoCovid status certication scheme ndash dubbed ldquovaccine passports ndash for mass gatherings south of the border, from sporting events to nightclubs.The UK Government has said the certicates could be a mobile phone app or a paper document and they are expected to show whether an inidual has received the vaccine, has recently tested negative for the virus, or has ldquonatural immunity having tested positive in the previous six months.Ms Freeman told BBC Radio Scotlandrsquos Good Morning Scotland programme there are ethical and equality questions over vaccine passports as not everyone can be inoculated.She also said there are questions over how the scheme would work.Ms Freeman said: ldquoWersquore currently looking at what would be the digital infrastructure you would need for any form of certication, as we work through those ethical and equality and practical questions about how it might be used and in what circumstances.ldquoI donrsquot want it to be paper ndash where itrsquos possible Irsquod want it to be digitally done.

As Thorn sat in the dressing room, the door opened and the Go-Betweens drummer Lindy Morrison walked in asking to borrow some lipstick at the top of her voice. Older, noisier, more self-assured, Thorn was enthralled. ldquoYou looked like confidence ran in your veins, she writes of that first encounter.ldquoShe just seemed other, you know, Thorn says of Morrison now in March , nearly  years later. ldquoShe was older than me,  years older. I think that is important. I was only . I was still at that stage of being right at the beginning of everything, not really knowing who I was, who I wanted to be. Embarking on this career of being in the music business, but not at all sure whether I wanted to or how I was going to do it.ldquoAnd there she is. She seems on the face of it to be my opposite, in that she seems supremely self-confident, supremely self-defined, to know exactly who she is, to not take any shit from anyone. When yoursquore young and looking around for role models and examples of how to be, you seize upon people like that.It was to be the start of a friendship that would long outlast the bands the two women were members of back then. Some four decades later it has led Thorn to write a book about her friend, the reason she is talking to me on Zoom from her home in London this afternoon.Thorn would go on to see huge success as part of Everything But the Girl. Morrison would stay with The Go-Betweens until  when the band broke up after their last-chance album  Lovers Lane still didnrsquot make them stars. Although their paths erged in the intervening years, Thorn and Morrison, through ups and downs and though a world apart, remained in touch.Lindy-Morrison and Tracey Thorn on Hampstead-Heath,. Photograph Ben WattMy Rock rsquonrsquo Roll Friend, then, is a story about friendship. But itrsquos more than that. Itrsquos also a vehicle for Thorn to write Morrison back into the story of The Go-Betweens, a band whose narrative has been continuously refined and reduced to that of the two songwriters, Robert Forster and the late Grant McLennan. In doing so, Thorn also tackles the wider subject of female erasure in music how men literally write women out of the story.The result is funny, candid and, as the pages pass, increasingly indignant. By the end you can feel the anger rising off the pages.It is also, for those of us who grew up worshipping at the altar of Forster and McLennan, something of a challenge. Have we as fans been just as guilty of that act of erasure It may also be the best book Thorn has written. It certainly feels the most open, the most candid in a way, assome of Morrisonrsquos energy and outspokenness has rubbed off on her friend on the page.ldquoI think thatrsquos true, Thorn acknowledges. ldquoI almost wanted to allow that to happen a bit, let the spirit of Lindy animate the book.And so here is Thorn talking about desire and distress, about recent relationship struggles with Watt, about swimming naked in a spa in Covent Garden. In writing as in le, Thorn has been emboldened through her friendship with Morrison.Morrisonrsquos own story goes like this. In Brisbane in the late s she was in her mid-twenties and in a female punk band called Zero when she met Robert Forster. He is some six years younger than her. His band The Go-Betweens are the antithesis of punk. But Morrison saw something in them, something in Forster certainly. Soon they became a couple and when Morrison joined The Go-Betweens as their drummer the band became worthy of notice.Tracey Thorn. Photograph: Edward BishopldquoShe made them a band, Thorn suggests. ldquoThey were fumbling along, two boys being a duo with these other members who came and went. They didnrsquot have a band identity. And then suddenly theyrsquove got Lindy Morrison who was already semi-famous in the relatively small music scene of Brisbane. That was an audacious act to get her to join them. It was a great thing to do. That was a strength that they should always have played up really.As the years went by the opposite happened. The band became defined by Forster and McLennanrsquos wordplay. They were a band who were loved for their lyrics. But would either have managed to get anywhere without Morrisonrsquos drive, Thorn asks Morrison adapted her playing to their songs. ldquoShe didnrsquot straighten them out, Thorn points out. ldquoThey did have that sort of angularity about them. They didnrsquot know how many bars they were writing. They just wrote how many bars it needed to get to the end of that line of lyric.Read More: Remembering the Go-Betweens with Robert ForsterRead More: Christmas with Tracey ThornldquoA more prosaic drummer might have said, lsquoOK, you need to edit this a bit. We need to square it off.rsquo She said, lsquoWell, letrsquos go with it. Let the songs have this curiousandyoursquove written it like that, Irsquoll play it like that.rsquo That gives the band a lot of character.There were constant tensions in the band, it should be said. Forster and Morrison eventually fell out yet continued to play together. McLennan, meanwhile, never seemed to like Morrison. When Amanda Brown joined the band she was McLennanrsquos girlfriend, but she was also an ally for Morrison.What is very clear from the book is that when Morrison joined the band she was the one with the le experience. Itrsquos also quickly clear that even sensitive young men with an interest in art and literature can be painfully conventional in their attitude towards women.ldquoThatrsquos often one of the most frustrating things, I think, for women in the music scene or probably other worlds of art, Thorn suggests. ldquoYoursquore drawn to those scenes for the same reasons as men are, because yoursquore looking for freedom and liberation from the straight world and yoursquore looking for expression and to shake off the conventions.ldquoAnd then, within that world of music, when you encounter the same narrow thinking, the same conventions, the same prejudices, the same stereotypes, its intensely frustrating. And when you encounter that in the men you are working with, who you have been drawn to because you admire their creativity and artistry, itrsquos a really frustrating thing.That played out in Morrisonrsquos encounters with male music journalists. She was too loud for them, too outspoken. She didnrsquot fit with their idea of the band. Frankly, some of them were scared of her.After years of never quite making it, Forster and McLennan decided to go solo in . Forster arranged to tell Morrison at exactly the same time as McLennan told Brown, a move that was both theatrical and spectacularly foolish as it turned out. ldquoThe brutal display of where the power lies, is how Thorn describes it in My Rock rsquonrsquo Roll Friend. Both women understandably saw it as an act of betrayal. How could the two men have thought they would see it as anything  ldquoIt is extraordinary and naiumlve, Thorn agrees. ldquoThey try to excuse themselves. lsquoWe were just bumbling boys.rsquo They were men in their thirties. It is very easy for men to play this card: lsquoOh well, we didnrsquot know what we were doing.rsquo At some point you have to take responsibility.In the years after the band split up and particularly after the tragically early death of McLennan at just  of a heart attack, the story of The Go-Betweens has been increasingly retold as the story of the two men. Thatrsquos certainly how Forster framed it in the title of his memoir Grant  I.And so, one of the reasons Thorn wanted to write My Rock rsquonrsquo Roll Friend, she says, was the fear that Morrison was in danger of being left out of the story.This is the crux of things. This idea of erasure. It repeats and repeats in the music industry. Itrsquos why someone like Bjork has to time and again assert her own agency when she makes music, why she has to remind people that she is responsible for it, not her male collaborators.ldquoItrsquos endless, Thorn agrees. ldquoAnd it becomes exhausting, and so I think sometimes women fall by the wayside because they get defeated by it and also start to believe their own press. You start to believe, lsquoMaybe I wasnrsquot that important.rsquoMy Rock rsquonrsquo Roll Friend is an act of reclamation, then.ldquoI think that itrsquos happening more and more now. More and more women are starting to write their books, from Viv Albertine to Chrissie Hynde. It does feels to me some of these stories that had slipped out of our attention hellip When you look back at punk it was always the Sex Pistols and The Clash. Yeah, but hang on. I was there. X-Ray Spex and The Slits were as important. But those stories are now being told.If nothing , My Rock rsquonrsquo Roll Friend serves as a reminder that without Morrison the story of the Go-Betweens would be a lot less interesting. Because for all her complexity and vulnerabilities what emerges from the pages of Thornrsquos book is just how much fun Morrison was and is.ldquoAs well as there being anger in there, I did want there to be joy, Thorn admits. ldquoAs I say at one point, lsquothe sheer f****** buzz of being in her company.rsquo I want that to come through the book as well. That yoursquore just thinking, lsquoMy God, shersquos a hoot.rsquoldquoShe is and shersquos unpredictable and shersquos contradictory and you donrsquot know what shersquoll say next. All that about her is kind of brilliant. Shersquos not a neatly packaged entity.What does that make her  Human, I guess. And fun to be with.

I was learning about how to pay off debt, we had pound, of consumer debt. I was learning how to get out of that debt as quickly as possible. I was then learning about investing and saving, building side hustles and all things to do with money that I had never been exposed to when I was growing up.I wanted to share that journey becauseI needed information then there might well have been someone  out there who would like to know this information as well. I picked up a camera and have been creating content to help people ever since.I thoroughly enjoy it, so much so that I have left my corporate job to do this.Q: What was the inspiration behind starting the channel A: It really was out of necessity a little bit - wanting to share a journey with other people, and in some way, I have been in IT sales all my le as well. Irsquove had to talk to customers and get over a message and I really like helping people and teaching people.It just felt really fun, I saw a lot of Youtube channels of other people talking away to cameras and I thought, I could do that, that seems really good fun and I could help people about money. Particularly our own money,I hadnrsquot learned about how to pay off debt and investing and been stuck for UK voices to find - I donrsquot think I would have started a channel, so that was the inspiration behind it.:Mamafurfur: Meet the Glasgow Youtuber with a finance channel that has reaped rewardsQ: You started making videos in  - how have you found the process A: The process has been quite straightforward. I think, as with everything, when you start itrsquos a case of lsquojust do your first video, just tal to the camera and do the best you canrsquoBut the process always feels the same. I love being able to communicate a message. I am always hoping I do it as concisely and also as entertaining as possible because I do believe the knowledge can be le-changing and really affect a lot of people once they learn things and they think lsquowhy wasnrsquot I taught this before rsquoThe process I have found just the same as always. I found it simple, straightforward but I also love that part of my creative journey is I want to be better and better. I want to get over the message better, I want to be somebody who is conveying as quickly as possible but also get that lsquoclickrsquo moment with people. So yoursquoll from the very start of my videos to three years ago, theyrsquore dferent in terms of quality and how I deliver and the topics I deliver. I love the fact its an ongoing evolution for my viewer and also for myself.Q: What are the aims of your channel A: My aims are a journey for people. I want people to go from financial stress and mess, feeling stuck, to giving people a route out of that, to actually have a lestyle that they designed using money as a tool rather than something that dictates what you do with your time.Also, I want people to have freedom, time freedom in their le, so using money thatthey want to work part-time they can,they want to be creative and run their own business they canthey want to work for someone  they can. I want people to have time freedom and the one way to get it is using money to make that happen.Q: You are very open on your channel about your aims and ambitions - how have you found the transition to ldquofull time on the Mama FurFur channel in comparison to your old ldquo-A: I have found it fairly smooth, and I think thatrsquos been guided by the fact that we have been in a pandemic for the past year. I have been at home, my job had the flexibility to work from home anyway, so I was used to being at home and balancing le with the boys, so the transition has been quite smooth.The one thing I do notice is I am having to learn to manage my time dferently because I am used to having an employer, and also projects, and also a family, itrsquos realising that I donrsquot answer to an employer anymore so I have to decide what we do with our day and keep focussed on goals and things that I feel I want to create out there. style\" background:#FFF border: border-radius:px box-shadow:  px  rgba, px px  rgba margin:  auto max-width:px padding: width:.% width:-webkit-calc width: auto\" display:block height:px margin: auto -px position:relative top:-px width:px\"LoadingQ: You have found success on Youtube - what would be your advice to those starting out A: YouTube is just a social media  like anything . YouTube however I feel is one of the tougher ones to break into. I think you have to assume that you might have to put out a year or two of content every single week to then get traction. So I would say make sure you are clear about why you are using this .Is it to help other people  If so then just keep with that intention. I think sometimes people start because they want to make money and that will just lead you down a black hole, there will never be enough money because you will just keep chasing and chasing. It should be because you believe you can actually help people as part of what you see as your vision and goal for le. It is a fantastic tool though - I am really thankful I use Youtube because I like video.I would say start today, just put out your first video but assume that it is going to take a little while to get traction, but do not be disheartened. Donrsquot worry about views, clicks, and likes, just make videos you are proud of and then whatever rewards come your way, thats whatrsquos meant to be.Honoured to be up for Best Personal Finance Influencer . Nominations form is open! https:t.co OstbgzkiwsQ: As well as the Youtube channel you offer courses and books - do you have any further plans to expand A: Absolutely, we have products as well. There are going to be more books on the way, so I am making the time now to write and get those books started. I would like to reach more people and thatrsquos what I feel is the next part of that. Irsquove got products, Irsquove got things online but I know physical books touch people and help people in a dferent way. If there are any publishers or agents reading this, Irsquove got the books lined up, just get in contact. Irsquod love to see my book in WH Smith, thatrsquos one of my visions and my goals - to be able to go to the airport and see my book there. That would be absolutely incredible going into Glasgow Airport and being able to get a copy of my books.Q: What were the major challenges starting out A: Major challenges are mainly just your self-belief a lot of the time. Irsquove never worried about whether I could deliver or have got enough messages to tell people. I think at times its just getting over yourself and realising it is a long journey and that you keep just doing what you feel is right.Q: You talk often about ldquoside hustles on your channel - but how do you start out making your videos  What is the approach to taking on topics Making videos is just as simple as you can pick up your phone and record and upload to Youtube andyou feel like you have a message, maybe its your story that yoursquove got to share about a particular experience in le or you want to help somebody .I just broke down topics I was learning about that I was struggling to find information about for the UK, so I thoughtI canrsquot find them, this is what I have been able to find, hopefully somebody  can find it. So thatrsquos all I do. Irsquove got a big brain-dump of topics, hundreds of topics that I want to cover and I just select and thatrsquos what I have been doing for three years. I just select the ones that I feel great about, that I feel inspired and I make them, I just put them out there and thatrsquos all I can do.Q: How has the Covid- pandemic changed your channel  Has it had an impact It hasnrsquot my channel in terms of any impact but obviously, I did find that a lot of people were looking for topics on money during the pandemic at the start, and hopefully, they found my channel useful and that was a great help. I did feel inspired to focus on more basics of money for the past while I was very aware people might be feeling they had income struggles, so I wanted to show people how to make extra income, how to save, spend well and invest even.I think it was more being aware of what was happening and what were the pain points people might be feeling, and then being driven to make content that could help.Q: What would be your advice to those starting out on Youtube and a channel in particular A: Just pick up the camera and start. The more you do something the better yoursquoll get. Donrsquot be worriedthere are only four views on your first video, there were four people that found you. Also make videos that yoursquore proud of that will help people. Also just have fun with it , make it as a way you can express yourself and what yoursquore interested in.Q: You recently reported people imitating your channel on Instagram - how concerning is this especially around the financial advice and explainers you carry out on your channel A: There are always people who,they can, theyrsquoll find a way to make money from other people. Theyrsquoll borrow your image or brand, set up accounts and what theyrsquore doing is use your image to try and convince people that theyrsquore trustworthy. I will always say to someone I am not going to recommend a forex trading  or anything that seems dodgy, I am certainly not going to ask you for thousands of pounds to trade with me.Unfortunately, all you can do is report to Instagram or Facebook, a lot of the time they donrsquot get taken down but thatrsquos all you can do. If it seems dodgy, a lsquoget rich quickrsquo scheme, it probably is. Irsquom sorry that theyrsquore using my face but thatrsquos probably how these people believe theyrsquoll get you to trust them, which is a wee bit sad.Q: What is your typical day-to-day as part of your business A: A typical day at the moment is getting up, having breakfast and I will have quiet time, and make my husband a cup of tea. I will do some reading from inspirational books and then focus on getting the right intention, the right focus for the day. The boys will get up, I will make them breakfast, wersquoll head off to school and nursery and then Matt, my husband at that time will have been at the gym and then I will go into the gym. And then I will make content or do something for the business. A typical day is we hit the gym as a priority after getting the kids to school, then we focus, maybe do a podcast or a video, do some planning, and then the boys are back from school and we spend time with them.I try to stop my work when the boys get back from school because I canrsquot really film when theyrsquore around but also itrsquos family time. Thatrsquos the whole point of running your own business - you decide the hours.Q: You have your channel based from Glasgow - what has the response been from Scots but also globally A: Scottish people will always leave a comment and say ldquoOh Irsquom from Glasgow or Edinburgh which is fantastic. I love that and I love also that some people have said because I am Glasgweigan theyrsquove been able to relate to me, I seem like a local person. Some people might find my accent dficult to understand but thankfully Youtube offers subtitlesthats the case, but overall I donrsquot think being Scottish holds me back. If anything it makes me stand out more because therersquos quite a lot of UK creators from England. I love the fact that its another element thats quite unique and will maybe stick out in peoplersquos heads.Q: What are the future aims of the channel and the business A: Future aims for us are to ensure that Mamafurfur keeps helping as many people as possible. Thatrsquos one of my goals. I just want to keep doing what I believe feels right for me. I really feel inspired to be a teacher and help people and I want to be true to that. I want to get more books out because I really believe I can help more people out.In the same way that we were able to get out of debt and leave the corporate world and have passive incomes and investments, that really quick journey in over pretty much six years from start to finish, and allowing us to grow a multi-six figure side hustle and business in the process. I know that and some of the strategies that people can apply and change their lives. I want that for as many people as possible.I do believe that when people have good money and theyrsquore able to do things with time freedom has a ripple effect on communities. Theyrsquore able to give more time to things they believe in.The short term is focussing on content to help people and focusing on books, and I am open to wherever the business takes me."},{"url":null,"title":"wake-up-call-scales","story":"It sneaks up on you, a pound here and there.

The waiting room offered a choice of sitting inside on robust wooden chairs with arm rests surrounded by pot plants with batiks on the walls, or out on the stone veranda with a magnicent view across the valley.The current one is in a very modern hospital, computers and ringing telephones everywhere, with the ceaseless excretion of numerous printers threatening to bury everyone under piles of fullscap. Patients and their entourages are met at reception and led to the office, much useful information gleaned visually and verbally on the way. The door is then locked as laboratory staff and cleaners assume they are invisible and enter unannounced in the midst of consultations. The large desk is pushed against one wall, not between the seated patient and the doctor. The computer and muted telephone are not in prominent view.One wall has six large colourful, anatomically correct diagrams of the lungs, heart, abdomen, male and female genital systems and the sensory organs, works of art in themselves and a source of education and interest to all and sundry, even in the Google age where many patients come armed with print-outs or mind-sets supporting their self-diagnosis.Children are examined on their parentrsquos lap or sitting up on the examination bed with the doctor kneeling beside them and mother in sight ndash we were taught never to make direct eye contact with kids and to keep below eye level when examining them this adds to the laundry bill for trousers but keeps geriatric knee and hip joints supple on busy days. The bowl of oranges or apples at hand rewards young heroes whorsquove braved invasive throat swabbing or worse without going over the top with screams.Textbooks, medical handbooks and internet research engines are looked up during the consultation, often to the surprise and unease of those present, their doubt remaining after my admission that I cannot remember the  side-effects of the medicines they are taking.While Picasso can rest easy, I do enjoy drawing simple diagrams to illuminate hidden nooks and crannies which may be a source of their symptoms the downside of this is the occasional trauma suffered by one of our reception or accounts staff who in all innocence turns over the consultation sheet to be faced with some very explicit drawings not found in Sunday schools.The busiest consulting room desk I ever saw belonged to Sam Earnshaw, a formidable criminal and civil lawyer in Swazilandrsquos capital, Mbabane. It was stacked with legal files, perhaps a hundred, with even more on the adjacent floor. Yet he could find those needed without hesitation and quoted me the results of an academic study of lawyersrsquo desk loads which showed it was a not inefficient system for prioritising urgency and relevance ndash including those files that fell off the desk unnoticed.The antithesis of a family doctorrsquos consulting session was the day a small team of nurses and I arrived on a summer morning at a monthly clinic near Isandlwana in Zululand, the site of the battle in  when the Zulu impis out-thought and out-fought the British Army under Lord Chelmsford. There were about  patients waiting. For the next eight hours, they remained calm and good-humoured. Several required urgent treatment and were dispatched to the hospital at Nqutu as soon as transport could be commandeered.During that endless day amidst remarkably resilient people, Punch Magazinersquos famous cartoon often came to mind. It was published not long after the battle at Isandlwana and showed a member of the Zulu royal family in leopard skins, stabbing spear and cowhide shield in one hand, pointing to the blackboard in front of which huddled a discomfited John Bull.

He is generally credited with steadying the listing ship of devolved governance. by Brian taylor: Strugeons inquiry performance was controlled and capableNow Nicola Sturgeon is seeking re-election under that same Additional Member System. Devised, remember, to thwart her party. An exercise which has not been entirely successful in that the SNP has held sway at Holyrood since Mr McConnell demitted office in .But she faces an additional challenge. In addition to her customary opponents, she has to contend with a former chum. Her erstwhile mentor Alex Salmond is seeking to confound that Holyrood voting system by seeking regional list seats to supplement the constituencies he expects his former party, the SNP, to retain or gain.Mr Salmond describes that as a super-majority for independence. For that sum to work, however, there would have to be an almost universal transfer of list votes from the highly competitive SNP to Alba, presumably eclipsing the pro-independence Greens while, at the same time, the pro-Union parties fail to take advantage of this apparent contention on the Nationalist side.To say the least, that is asking a lot. Still, it is feasible and Mr Salmond remains a persuasive campaigner, despite the poll suggestions that, after years of controversy, accusation, acquittal and inquiry, he is rather less popular than was formerly the case.In passing, one might also note that his concept of vying up the independence vote was not discussed with or ratied by Nicola Sturgeon in any way. Further, it runs precisely counter to the message Mr Salmond himself delivered when he won majority power in . Then, the endlessly repeated mantra was ldquoboth votes SNP.Again, though, it remains a possibility in pursuit of what Mr Salmond has called the ldquonoble cause of independence. Contrary to claims that he is intent on vengeance, he insists he is only too eager to help that broader aim, as he has always done.Alex SalmondWhich presents Nicola Sturgeon with a dilemma. Could she conceivably work with a man who told a Holyrood inquiry she had breached the Ministerial code  A man who, she informed the same inquiry, had recounted behaviour towards a woman which she regarded as ldquodeeply inappropriate Before we arrive at such hypothetical post-election scenarios, however, there is the small matter of winning popular support from the voters.This lands Nicola Sturgeon with a more elemental conundrum. To be clear, she yearns for independence. She craves it, like a gourmet treat, all the more appealing for being kept at a distance, and denied by rivals.How, though, to achieve it  Strategically, she has three good reasons for focusing more in this election upon other policies, other issues, while retaining independence as the over-arching aim, through a referendum. In the BBC Scotland debate this week, she said such a poll should be held in the first half of the new Holyrood Parliament, once coronavirus had subsided.Those reasons for caution  Firstly, just like Jack McConnell promoting devolution in , she knows that independence lacks universal popularity. Many remain to be convinced.Even some who ultimately favour or would acquiesce in an independent Scotland might prefer to concentrate for now on other matters, notably this hideous plague and the attendant economic challenge.So she couches independence not as a concept in itself but as a potential answer to those financial woes a solution to be adopted when the time is right. Not immediately. For now, the SNP mot is that Scotlandrsquos problems need Scottish solutions, not a recipe advanced by Boris Johnson.Simultaneously, she is aware that this approach, which she judges to be necessary to sustain widespread popular support for her government, with its range of policies and objectives, is scarcely calculated to enthuse the more zealous of her adherents in the wider nationalist cause.That partly explains the lingering disquiet in the SNP over strategy. It, partly, explains the creation of Alba, although that is very largely down to Mr Salmond.Which brings us to Ms Sturgeonrsquos second reason for caution. An over-emphasis on independence might serve to energise Mr Salmondrsquos offer, to her dismay. In her mind, she sees an all too familiar figure, with an all too familiar grin, offering to help.Thirdly, every time she talks up independence or is asked so to do, we can expect an intervention from Douglas Ross of the Tories or, indeed, from Labour or the Liberal Democrats.Mr Ross is simply itching to make this election a quasi-referendum, to make it a straight fight between independence and the Union, hoping that he will, thereby, cajole indy-sceptics from other parties to vote Tory.A further thought disturbs the Sturgeon sleep pattern. She accuses Mr Salmond of gambling, of seeking to trick the electorate into a referendum. What , she asks, that leaves a residue of discontent and disquiet, even among potential independence supporters, so that any subsequent referendum is lost Mr Salmond denies this would happen and argues that Ms Sturgeon would, eventually, see the advantage of collaboration.Read more by Brian Taylor:Sturgeon versus Salmond.

Indeed, in rejecting Salmondrsquos idea of a two-party supermajority as ldquogaming the system she may have skewered indyref.After May ,her pro-independence majority is composed, as looks likely, of SNP constituency and Green list MSPs, it will be hard to claim this as a new mandate for a referendum.Boris Johnson will just quote her own words back at her.

Alex Salmond was able to beat drsquoHondt in  only because of a unique set of circumstances.However, I do not subscribe to the view that the First Minister has given up on Scottish independence.

However, her body language in last weekrsquos BBC debate, in which she was hectored and harried over the timing of indyref, indicated her discomfort with the whole question.She clearly has other things on her mind ndash the pandemic for one ndash and has now shted the rhetoric on independence totake that into account. Independence is no longer to be seen as a necessary condition for a successful recovery, but something only to be considered ldquoafter the crisis is over, as she put it. That crisis could last for some years yet.The Scottish economy was lagging behind the rest of the UK before Covid. Structural problems are going to be revealed as UK Government support is withdrawn.As they say in America, when the tide goes out you find out whorsquos not wearing a bathing suit.In those circumstances, with unemployment rising, would the First Minister really want to ignite a isive referendum campaign evenshe could  As I say, itrsquos too soon to write off Alba, but one message could be that, while Scots may be increasingly attracted to the concept of independence, they may not be in the market for it right now. Lord make me free, but not yet.Onlyyou are a radical, an insurgent, a risk-taker ndash yes, a gambler ndash does independence really makes sense, at least right now.A politician like Alex Salmond doesnrsquot care about polls or the precautionary principle he makes his own history. Salmond is right that only a mass, popular movement could make the independence cause become unanswerable. It would require big street demonstrations, court actions, civil disobedience. History would need to be placed on fast forward, as it was in Ireland at the start of the last century. Thatrsquos a risky road.Nicola Sturgeon is not arisk-taker, not a revolutionary, and recoils from fighting talk and ision. Itrsquos all too testosterone-fuelled for her. Most middle-class Scots share her risk aversion.One of the abiding themes of Scottish politics over the past  years has been votersrsquo enthusiasm for gradations of home rule that always stop short of actual independence.It might be that Ms Sturgeonrsquos very caution is part of her popularity. She is intensely Scottish, hostile to English Tories, but she can be relied upon not to do anything daft.The independence case is anyway in deep trouble. In , Salmond managed to persuade  per cent of Scots to vote Yes but only after it was made clear that it would not mean a border with England, or losing the pound, or even losing the Queen. Both Scotland and England were assumed to be remaining in the EU. That has all changed.Nicola Sturgeon has avoided discussion of the mechanics of independence post-Brexit, preferring to stick to generalities about how Scots need to take their own decisions and not be under dictation from Brexit Tories.But she knows, and everyone in her Government knows, that the situation is very dferent to . Last weekrsquos report from the Institute for Government underlined in red dficulties that simply canrsquot be ignored.It is true that the act of joining the European Union might only take two to four years ndash the blink of an eye in Brussels terms. But disaggregating the UK would take much longer. Scotland would have to be fully independent of the UK and that would take at least five years going on the Brexit experience.The Institute reckons that wersquod be looking at a decade of complex negotiations before Scotland became a member of the EU.The idea that Brussels might allow some kind of halfway house, letting Scotland join while it was still part of the UK, is a non-starter. It was something the EU refused to consider even before the Northern Ireland Protocol.Recent problems with that mean Brussels will run a mile from Ireland-style anomalies.So there would inevitably be a hard trade border. Scotland may not have to join the euro, at least not immediately, but it will have to be fully independent to fulfil the terms of EU accession.It could not be an independent countryit kept the pound and had monetary policy decided by the Bank of England.Nicola Sturgeon is one of the most gted politicians Scotland has ever produced. She is a trained lawyer and has watched the manold dficulties that followed the Brexit vote.She knows that for independence to succeed it would require a huge level of commitment from the Scottish people ndash a commitment that doesnrsquot as yet exist.Evenshe could secure the essential Section  Order from Westminster, therersquos no guarantee that Yes would win.At best, it might be a ided result, perhaps the inverse of , with a narrow victory for Yes. But that would land her with the nightmare of negotiating independence for a ided nation. The Unionist minority would demand a repeat referendum after the separation agreement with the UK is negotiated. Since that was what Nicola Sturgeon called for on Brexit, it would be hard for her to refuse.All these issues crowd into the mind of a politician like the First Minister.She is too aware of the downside, too conscious of the damage of ision and conflict. That is her great political weakness, but it is also her electoral strength.Her aversion to populism and civil disobedience makes it dficult for her to make history.

While the ways people will vote have not changed, how the campaigns are conducted and covered have been adapted to suit the times.The changed tactics could be seen last week when BBC Scotland held the first of two live televised leadersrsquo debates.The set looked familiar enough, with the five leaders of the larger parties, plus moderator Sarah Smith, standing at podiums.But the podiums were further apart than usual to comply with social distancing rules, and the participants were arranged in a circle, facing each other, instead of a semicircle, looking out to a studio audience.In place of a studio audience was a virtual one dialling in from home. At times, the event looked like one very large Zoom call.: Latest poll good news for Alba PartyHaving a virtual audience instead of the ldquoreal thing was a drawback. Where a live studio audience can applaud, laugh, or scoff when they wish, and be heard doing so, that was not possible here. It is dficult enough to make out what is being said when politicians talk over each other, never mind having the audience do it as well.Scotland is not alone in having a pandemic election. There are local council elections in England, mayoral and London Assembly elections, police and crime commissioner elections in England and Wales, and elections to the Welsh Parliament.Nor is the UK the first country to go to the polls during the pandemic. Last November the Electoral Commission, the independent body which oversees elections in the UK, looked at best practice where to see what lessons could be learned.The initial response to the pandemic had been to postpone elections, the Commission noted. Then the tide began to turn as more was discovered about how the virus spread.Quoting a study by The International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, the Commission said at least  countries and territories held elections between February and November , including South Korea and New Zealand. Voting was postponed in , but  elections subsequently took place.The biggest vote took place in the US. While there had been fears that Covid would keep people away from voting stations, a record . million turned up to cast their ballots. The pandemic sent the number of postal votes soaring to almost m, another record.: Expenses watchdog refers concerns to policeMedia coverage was affected by the pandemic. Mr Trump was out and about on the campaign trial, carrying on mass rallies, despite the advice from medics that they risked becoming super-spreader events.In contrast, the Biden campaign held drive-in, socially distanced get-togethers. Crucially, the candidate stayed home for the most part. Had it been any other year that would not have been possible. As it was, opponents accused the Biden camp of using the pandemic to hide their gaffe-prone candidate from public and press scrutiny.In Scotland, voters can hardly complain that about a lack of coverage. In the past few months there has been wall-to-wall reporting on Scottish politics across every medium. If anything, voters are sick of the sight of the same old faces and voices.That is not the same, however, as being informed about policies. But here, little has changed. The information is still out there, whether in leaflets posted through the door, on websites, in newspapers, in party political broadcasts, and where.One development that is new is the ldquovoter  set up by BBC Scotland.

But after James VI of Scots became king of England and Ireland in , Union took on a new relevance.Many Scots quickly concluded that simply sharing a king was unsatisfactory, since it was likely to impact upon Scottish governance, prosperity, and independence, while offering no tangible benefits in . The question of how to recast the Anglo-Scottish relationship was consequently never far from the political agenda, and as Scots grappled with the issue, four distinct lsquomodelsrsquo of Union gradually crystallised. Each of these, coming to the fore at separate points in the century, imagined a dferent future for Anglo-Scottish relations. Right up until  it was not clear which,any, offered the most plausible settlement.The first of these was the one envisaged by James VI, who fervently hoped to forge England and Scotlandinto a new and greater British kingdom. Evenhe recognised that, in practice, this process was unlikely to be comprehensive, James was still aiming for an lsquoincorporatingrsquo Union ndash that is, the merging of Scotland and England into a brand new political entity, with both ancestral kingdoms ceasing to exist.This wasthe route that would ultimately be taken in , but it was not one to which either Jamesrsquo English or Scottish subject were amenable in the early s. Faced with implacable resistance on both sides, he had given up on this idea by around , contenting himself with cosmetic changes like a new flag and the symbolic, self-awarded title, King of Great Britain.The second model was very dferent indeed. It was an idea sometimes known as lsquoconfederationrsquo, and it was articulated and pursued most energetically by the Covenanters, Presbyterian opponents of Charles I who controlled Scotland during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms . A confederal Union did not necessarily imply the creation of new structures or a new polity. Rather, the point was for Scotland and England to co-operate closely, co-ordinating their activities for shared purposes.The key text of lsquoconfederalrsquo thinking was the Solemn League and Covenant , a treaty between the Covenanters and the English Parliament that pledged co-operation in defeating Charles I and establishing religious orthodoxy across the British Isles. A confederal model implied that Scotland and England would continue to exist, but would work together as equals in a shared British space.The attraction of this idea to Scotland, in the sense that it negated Englandrsquos otherwise overwhelming advantages in size, power, and wealth, was obvious, but confederation was less appealing south of the border. This, perhaps, explains why the lsquohigh pointrsquo of confederalism was the early- to mid-s, when England was badly weakened by Civil War. Once something resembling the ordinary balance of power was restored, confederal Union rapidly lost its lustre.If the Covenanting vision of Union sought to maximise Scottish influence within any Anglo-Scottish conglomerate, the precise opposite result flowed from the next model of Union ndash the Commonwealth. Following the conquest of Scotland by the New Model Army in , the lsquoTender of Unionrsquo removed all the main structures of Scottish national governance, to be replaced by direct rule from Westminster.Key features of English political culture, most notably religious toleration, were imposed by decree. Where elements of Scottish distinctiveness were allowed to persist, for example in the legal system, new English supervisory structures were created. Alongside all this, the Commonwealth maintained a very heavymilitary presence.The Cromwellian model of Union, in short, was de facto annexation, predicated on Scotland becoming part of a greater English state and being subject to direct supervision. It was a model, naturally, that held limited appeal for most Scots, and its implementation depended entirely upon England having the will and wherewithal to sustain it. Neither of these impulses survived the restoration of Charles II in , and so the Tender of Union, like almost every other feature of the Commonwealth state, was swept away.The fourth alternative ndash lsquocommercialrsquo Union ndash emerged in the late s. The idea was to forge closer links between Scotland and England purely on commercial grounds ndash in effect, to develop something like a pan-British free trade zone, without much in the way of political Union to go with it.Ultimately, these ious lsquomodelsrsquo of Union all foundered on two issues. Firstly, they required Scots to be confident that Union would not impact excessively on Scottish distinctiveness, or to be comfortable with its loss. Neither of these was forthcoming.Hobbled by Scottish anxiety and English indference, the Union projects of the th century all proved dead letters. It would take the exceptional constitutional and geopolitical circumstances of the early th century to cut this Gordian knot. What remains to be seen is whether any of them can offer a solution to the constitutional wrangles of the st century, or whether Scots will ultimately decide that only a complete separation of the kind in operation before  will do.Dr Allan Kennedy is a professor of history at University of Dundee"},{"url":null,"title":"election-2021-proxy-independence-election-journey-not-destination","story":"Of course, politicians are debating plenty of related subjects ndash referendum timing, the personality of leaders, simple versus supermajorities and the MSP totalthat will compel Boris Johnson to grant another Section  request.But just as discussing the route to the polling station is not the same as casting a vote, so discussing the wisdom of ldquowildcat votes is not the same as discussing independence itself.

Not sufficiently indy-free for opponents of constitutional change, but not full-blooded, vivid, detailed or real enough for everyone .So, letrsquos be honest.

If re-elected, shersquoll be flat out dealing with the pandemic for as long as it takes ndash in the same wholehearted way shersquos done for a year, in striking contrast to Boris Johnson.So, letrsquos be honest. All these questions ndash while erting ndash are just political window-dressing.If the SNP, Greens and Alba believe we need an independence referendum within the letime of this new Parliament to build back better, then Scots deserve some straightforward, honest discussion of that core question.Will Scotland tackle climate change and Covid recovery better as an independent country or as part of the United Kingdom  Itrsquos the debate voters are having among ourselves ndash with no broadcasters or politicians bold enough to lead the way.Irsquod give my eye teeth to hear or see it on the box. But that will not happen. Not on BBC Scotland anyway. Its first leadersrsquo debate was an unfocused, superficial, sloganencouraging and unrevealing encounter.Meanwhile, the world weariness of some BBC Scotland journalists is increasingly hard to conceal.Last week, one reporter volunteered that she hated election campaigns and was just looking forward to the final results, while another made daring mention of ldquothe I word in an election report asindependence was some unspeakable, embarrassing mad aunt locked in the political attic. So much, so normal.But might Alex Salmond enter the ring and stir things up  The Alba leader is contesting his exclusion from BBC debates but the corporation has successfully resisted many legal challenges to debate line-ups and I doubt it will cave in now.Besides, Mr Salmondrsquos inclusion might not deliver a greater independence focus, given the inevitable distraction and muddying of waters created by two bitter rivals standing on one TV .Furthermore, comments by Anas Sarwar suggest Nicola Sturgeon might not be aloneshe simply refused to appear with the former SNP leader.But letrsquos not be naive. Itrsquos not just the broadcasters ndash it suits every political party to avoid the actual subject of independence as well.Scottish Labour has started its Holyrood campaign on the front foot. It wonrsquot want to risk that impetus by ing deep into issues like low pay, precarious work and brutal benefit regimes which can only be tackled by wrestling power from Westminster. Douglas Ross faces an even bigger challenge.Managing to look awkward atop a large Army vehicle last week, every appearance reminds voters that while the MP for Moray is physically larger than Ruth Davidson, the new Scottish Conservative leader is nowhere near as comfortable in his own skin or politically bullet-proof.So, Douglas Ross will be happy to keep making swipes at ldquoseparation without being drawn into real debate about the benefits of the union.Willie Rennie would have to lay aside the publicity stunts with giant deckchairs and badgers to become the unionrsquos most passionate advocate and while the Greens must persuade Yessers they really back independence after acquiring more profile for their stance on gender rights, they also have to put clear green water between themselves and other indy parties on the list.So, with relatively few bites of the media cherry, the party will probably major on the green recovery. Meanwhile, Nicola Sturgeon has a record to defend and a wariness of half-launching any independence campaign without final, settled positions on currency, deficits and borders.Still, she may have to tryAlex Salmond lets rip at his policy launch tomorrow. Of course, the Alba tail cannot wag the SNP dog.But since Ms Sturgeon has had five post-Brexit years to devise new independence strategies, it may seem strange to votersshe doesnrsquot leap at the chance to unveil them.

In general, Irsquod like things to work on the assumption that the powers-that-be should have to produce good reasons why we shouldnrsquot be free to do something, rather than that we should have to provide evidence that they have permitted us to do whatever it is. ANDREW McKIE:The government is dangerously authoritarian, but the public may be even worse.Irsquom well aware that there is a contrary, net-curtain-twitching attitude, equally prevalent in the British character. These are the people who say things like:yoursquove got nothing to hide, yoursquove got nothing to fear, and who would like to report their neighbours to the police for painting their front door the wrong colour.This lot have been much in evidence during the past year: when restrictions were reintroduced at the end of last year, an amazing  per cent of people in one poll were of the view that they didnrsquot go far enough.But whether yoursquore of a relatively liberal disposition, or an interfering busybody, it would have been dficult to imagine,  months ago, that a passport would be required to buy a pint, get your hair cut, go to the football, or nip down to the shops. Yet that is where we are, with politicians and commentators ndash some of them with previously impeccable libertarian credentials ndash seriously discussing whether a new category of discrimination should be created and recognised by the law. One which might, on some suggestions, require you to disclose and prove your medical history to employers, theatre ushers, restaurateurs and travel companies.There are plenty of reasons why this proposal should be seen as illiberal, unfairly isive and ineffectual ndash not least because it should be transparently obvious to a man with half an eye that it is all those things. But the fact that it would be self-evident in normal circumstances doesnrsquot mean that, in the current climate, itrsquos as open-and-shut a case as ndash one would hope ndash almost everyone would find it. ANDREW McKIE:House of Lords: Calling for reform is as traditional a part of British le as Trooping the ColourItrsquos clear that, like it or not, some scheme where people will have to disclose their vaccination status in order to travel abroad is almost certain. And, until vaccination in dferent countries reaches similar levels, the case for it is not hard to see. A slightly more problematic but still entirely logical argument could be made for some employers ndash the NHS or care homes would be the most obvious ndash to insist that any workers dealing with the most vulnerable should be subject to testing or proof of immunisation. Some workersmay want assurances that their working conditions ndash dealing with crowds, for example ndash are safe, and see passports as a means to that end.There are, in my view, rather more reasons to oppose it: it discriminates against those who cannot have the vaccine for medical reasons, the young, who mostly havenrsquot even had the chance to have it, it gives too much power to the government, it would be expensive and probably ineffective. It would certainly be easy to subvert: as I happens, Irsquom already taking the two tests a week the Prime Minister was pushing for yesterday , but theyrsquore self-reported. Even leaving aside the whole question of  positives and negatives, and assuming the self-administered test is flawless, the confirmatory text from the NHS saying that Irsquom negative is merely telling me what Irsquove just told them.Whichever side of the fence you come down on, though ndash like so many other issues over the past year ndash a question about restrictions that would usually be unthinkable anywhere other than a police state has become a legitimate topic for debate. And, though Irsquod oppose vaccine passports, I can see why.Itrsquos a dferent question from whether you think the circumstances actually justy the measures. It is at least conceivable that they could. It is also a dferent question from whether you trust the government , or think that the Tories, or the SNP, have dangerously authoritarian instincts. I think one can easily believe some in both parties do without veering into hyperbolic accusationsthat fully-fledged fascism is on the agenda.But all the same, the thing that we ndash and those in parliament ndash need to keep firmly in mind is that the question of a curtailment of liberties of this sort would normally be unthinkable. If it is thinkable now, it is only because the state has armed itself with powers that it ought never to have, except in times of national emergency.There has to be the suspicion ndash evenyou think Boris Johnsonrsquos instincts, or Nicola Sturgeonrsquos, are fundamentally benign, or at least not akin to Mussolinirsquos ndash that some politicians and public officials are getting rather too comfortable with restricting our freedoms or, worse, that the fact they simply find it more convenient to do so is coming to seem justication enough.Even the most gung-ho proponent of lockdowns, vaccine passes, continuous testing and draconian travel bans should be on guard against allowing such an attitude to develop.

To support his argument he cites such facts as Slovakia is in the centre of Europe, has a car industry, lower wages, provides cheap migrant labour and. And you know what hellip. drum roll hellip.he is absolutely right. ldquoScotland is not Slovakia.But then again, Slovakia is not Scotland, or have I missed Slovak whisky, its green energy potential, its world-class universities out of all proportion to its population, its world-renowned food and drink, one of the most recognisable tourism brands anywhere in the world  Oh, and by the way, being in central Europe is not necessarily an advantage ndash much better to be closer to western Europe.However, having attempted to diminish the signicance of the recent LSE report, Mr Russellrsquos argument is notable for the omission of one important fact, and indeed the central tenet of the report, that the ending of a single state to form two independent states need not be the trauma that Mr Russell and his unionist colleagues so cheerfully forecast in the event of Scottish independence.On July,  the Slovak Parliament declared the independence of the Slovak nation and six days later the political leaders of the two parts of Czechoslovakia agreed to dissolve the union. Czechoslovakia was formally dissolved on December  that year. Job done.Moreover, the immediate aftermath was without conflict as well. For instance, neither side claimed to be the successor state, in contrast to the UK in , which made clear that this was its intentionthere was a Yes vote. Rather than create barriers both sides agreed a customs union and freedom of movement . By , the Slovak economy was within  per cent of the Czech GDP per capita, having been % less than it immediately prior to dissolution.In short Mr Russellrsquos argument is really only informative for what it does not say, since what it does say is superfluous to the LSE report and unrelated to the future of an independent Scotland, for, as he says himself ,ldquoScotland is not Slovakia.Alasdair Galloway, Dumbarton.* JINGS, crivens, help ma boab!

But why is it that after  years in power this is only finally dawning upon her During the period of SNP governments we have seen a succession of mediocre justice secretaries a well-administered police service being chopped up in the interests of costs and efficiency and a prosecution service starved of funds and reform. These are the bedrock of the inadequacies in our justice system today and with taxpayers money being spent largely on Covid recovery and independence, there will be precious little left to bring about the much-needed reform.Its amazing that when an election approaches, politicians have their \"Eureka\" moments and then quietly forget about things once the election has passed.Bob MacDougall, Kippen.WE MUST CHANGE VOTING SYSTEMBRIAN Taylors account of the role played by the Additional Member voting system in Holyrood politics is interesting ndash not least for the entertaining historical anecdotes . Although Jack McConnell may have agreed in  that the electoral system used for Holyrood elections \"had been devised specically to prevent the SNP from taking power with a minority of the popular vote, AMS was sold as a system that would prevent any party achieving such dominance. Indeed, the concern of many at the time was that the Labour Party might dominate. As Mr Taylor shows, AMS does not achieve what it was supposed to achieve and every successive election brings more failings.Fast forward to the  Holyrood election, which he doesnt mention. Three parties put up manestos which opted for a change in the election system to the Single Transferable Vote. In fact, these three constituted a majority for that view, one might say a ldquosupermajority for STV, to coin a phrase. STV could have been implemented, as the Scotland Act  had conferred power on the Scottish Parliament to decide its own system. Instead we now have a confused situation with pop-up parties, unknown agendas and complete uncertainty about who could be elected.Thomas GF Gray, Lenzie.LOST IN THE COMMUNICATIONTODAY I received an election \"communication\" from the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party.

The European Unionis looking to roll out lsquodigital green certicatesrsquo in the summer, enabling anyone vaccinated against Covid, or who has tested negative, or recently recovered from the virus, to travel across all  member states. Pitched as a part of the safe reopening of New York City, the lsquoExcelsior passrsquo allows residents to access public venues and events after being vaccinated or showing recent negative test results.Given that it is a matter of time when a COVID- passport or a pass or a certicate will become commonplace, here are some considerations to ensure a fair, accessible and effective processsuch a concept is rolled out in Scotland.First, should COVID- vaccine passports be implemented  In Israel, anyone above the age of  years is eligible to get vaccinated against COVID-, opening up the use of the green pass across a wide population. Similarly, New York City has a wide eligibility criteria including adults above the age of  years. In such cases, a pass incentivises residents to get vaccinated and also offers a chance to increase local business, which is why this kind of initiative could be considered especially when larger groups of the population are eligible for vaccination.Second, what information should such a document contain  The EU model offers a good example. Such a passport should be digital or one that can be updated and must not only include vaccination details but also recent negative test results or evidence of recovery from COVID-.This means that proof of vaccination alone will not be a mandatory ticket to travel or accessing any public events and spaces and that iniduals could also provide negative test results. The evolving evidence around COVID- vaccines and immunity needs to be built into the document.Third, will this document be accepted by the people  Consultations with the public, business associations and relevant stakeholders are absolutely essential to understand the needs and concerns of every group as well as the practicalities of actually rolling such an initiative. Will all the vaccines be accepted in this passport  How long will these passports be in use  Can these passports be used across the UK  Will international students and visitors have access to public venues in Scotland without a passport :Digital vaccine passports being considered by Holyrood as PM launches mass testingThese are operational questions that need to be answered through stakeholder consultations. Just like New York City, trialling this concept would be beneficial as lessons learned can be included in any kind of scale-up.Fourth, are there any ethical concerns around such a passport  Certainly. There are issues around privacy, surveillance and equitable access and all of these need to be carefully considered. How personal data is stored and used needs to be transparent to the public and accountability measures have to be built in.Not everyone in the world will have access to COVID- vaccines. While young people in North America and Europe will have received their vaccinations this year, their counterparts in Africa and South Asia will not be as lucky. This is why vaccine passports should not be mandatory, instead, they should be considered as one part of the larger strategy of opening up public spaces and domestic and international travel, while we continue to focus on suppressing the spread of COVID-.Dr Genevie Fernandes is aPostdoctoral Research Fellow of theGlobal Health Governance Programme, Usher Institute at theUniversity of Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-uk-must-realistic-restart-foreign-holidays","story":"The Prime Minister told a Downing Street briefing ldquoI wish I could give you more on that but insisted there was not enough ldquosolid data on the virus.This led to an angry reaction from the travel industry.Heathrow Airport chief executive John Holland-Kaye claimed ldquothe opportunity has been missed to provide more certainty, while trade body the Business Travel Association described the update as ldquobeyond disappointing.A Downing Street paper on easing coronavirus restrictions confirmed that a traffic light system for international travel will be introduced.But it stated it is not known when trips could resume, and advised consumers not to make bookings yet.People living in the UK are banned from taking foreign holidays.The Governmentrsquos Global Travel Taskforce will provide a report later this week on how international leisure travel can resume.Under Englandrsquos road map for easing pandemic rules, the earliest that foreign holidays could be permitted is May .Mr Johnson said: ldquoObviously we are hopeful that we can get going from May , we are hopeful.ldquoBut I do not wish to give hostages to fortune or to underestimate the dficulty we are seeing in some of the destination countries people might want to go to.:Covid Scotland: What should vaccine passports look like ldquoWe donrsquot want to see the virus being reimported into this country from abroad.ldquoPlainly, there is a surge in other parts of the world and we have to be to be mindful of that and we have to be realistic.Mr Johnson said the Government will set out ldquowell before May th what we think is reasonable.He added: ldquoI know that people watching will want to know exactly what they can do from May th but wersquore not there yet.ldquoAs soon as we have solid information, more solid data, wersquoll let you know.ldquoBut thatrsquos where we are for the time being.Under the traffic light system, assessments will be based on a range of factors, including the proportion of a countryrsquos population which has been vaccinated, rates of infection, emerging new iants and the countryrsquos access to reliable scientic data and genomic sequencing.Travellers arriving from countries rated ldquogreen will not be required to isolate although pre-departure and post-arrival tests will still be needed.For people who have been in countries classed as ldquoamber or ldquored, arrivals will be required to isolate or enter quarantine.The document stated it is ldquotoo early to say which countries will be on the green list.It added: ldquoFor the moment, the Government advises people not to book summer holidays abroad until the picture is clearer."},{"url":null,"title":"salmond-set-route-map-indy-alba-party","story":"The former First Minister said it would be a ldquostrategy for immediate action by Holyroodhis plan for an independence ldquosupermajority is realised in May.A weekend poll suggested list-only Alba could win six MSPs, which when added to a projected  for the SNP and eight for the Greens would make a total of .A supermajority is defined at Holyrood as two-thirds of MSPs, or .Mr Salmond said: ldquoThe momentum in this election is with Alba as people warm to our message that only a list vote for Alba can deliver the Independence supermajority that will deliver independence for Scotland.ldquoLast week we unveiled our fantastic team of  candidates, surpassed the Scottish Liberal Democrats in membership and,the polls are correct, look set to see MSPs elected [across] Scotland.ldquoAs our message cuts through, that only a List vote for ALBA will deliver the Independence supermajority to drive Scotland towards Independence, so we will see more and more people rally to our cause.Alba also announced two more SNP defectors yesterday - former Aberdeenshire provost Hamish Vernal and former Edinburgh deputy lord provost Steve Cardownie.Mr Vernal said: ldquoI have been an SNP member since I was  years old so it is a considerable wrench to leave the party.ldquoHowever, the opportunity of building a supermajority for independence is too good to miss.ldquoMy message to SNP voters is - give your list vote to Alba and make both votes count for Yes to Independence.My message to the SNP leadership is lay off the negative personal attacks on Alba.

By  it may be extinct.Yet Rev Fair is determined the church can be reborn so long as it becomes a servant of its communities, a useful muster point for those who want to fulfill local needs.It has been striking throughout the pandemic to see how local churches - of all denominations - have become central to peoples desire to act, their need to feel some way in control during a relentlessly unpredictable time.Rev Fair said Glasgow Church of Scotland churches have handed out more than , food parcels over the past year.The Gurdwara near my flat has been feeding hot meals to those in need of sustenance and company throughout the crisis, a massive feat of organisation carried out by and for those of many faiths and none.Mosques nearby have done similar, so too has a local Jewish group.A Catholic organisation in Glasgow told me it was the only homelessness service providing face to face support throughout lockdown.Thats not to say secular groups have achieved more or less, but that people who would describe themselves as of no faith have joined with religious groups in order to feel part of something useful in a way that was more unusual pre-pandemic.Of course, all this is the ordinary business of faith organisations. Religious groups run foodbanks every week of the year. They were out overnight on the streets with homeless people long before the pandemic.Its not uncommon to hear non-believers be utterly scathing of those with religious faith. But I often wonder whether they think the gaps would be pluggedthey successfully scorned everyone out of their beliefs. The motivation of faith is demonstrably useful. Yes, people do good for others without needing a belief in a God to motivate them but would they do so in such numbers Last year the country saw an increased desire for community and for charitable action, spurred on by crisis. Yet already it feels as though this motivation is waning, as the crisis passes.Facebook groups set up to support local communities experience dwindling engagement, the bursts of volunteers are lagging.At the same time, there is an increase in reports of chronic loneliness, poor mental health and a sense that we have no collective way to process the grief of the past year.There was a programme on Radio  the other week where the loved ones of a French gendarme who died protecting others in a terrorist attack spoke of the aftermath of his death.Each, including his widow, framed how their faith helped them find meaning and continue to experience joy, despite this terrible loss.I felt quite envious, listening to them, of the purity of their convictions in comparison to my fly-by-night ideals.Raised in the church, despite having no real belief in God, I still take comfort from the rituals and routines. It is soothing to be in the company of others without judgement.Secular society is missing a space where all ages and backgrounds, a true cross section, come together. There is no obvious place to join and talk about shared experience, moral questions or community with a wide mix of people.Rev Fair mentions finding a new use for church buildings. He suggests having them open at am on Saturday mornings, for those spilling out of nightclubs to spill into.In response to talk of the death of the high street, suggestions are made that town centres reinvent themselves as spaces for social enterprises and community hubs, in place of shops.If thats the direction of travel, church buildings fit perfectly as part of it.If a vision of radical change is on the cards for the Church of Scotland then now, in a time of healing from a debilitating crisis, is the time to achieve it.That blend of faithful and secular coming together for common community good should be invigorated with churches a place for communion, in both a spiritual and an atheist sense."},{"url":null,"title":"call-cycle-lanes-pandemic-sees-huge-surge-bike-use","story":"Campaigners are now calling for increased investment in infrastructure such as designated cycle lanes to sustain the increase and encourage more people swap their cars for commuting by bike.: Cycling in Glasgow city centre soars by %According to data gathered by Cycling Scotlands nationwide network of  automatic cycle counters, there were  per cent more cycling journeys recorded overall between March   and March  , compared to the same period in -.In Girvan, Callander and Dunoon, the number of bike rides rose by more than % over the year.The sharpest spikes Scotland-wide were seen in the months immediately after lockdown, with % and % more cycle journeys recorded respectively in April and May , before gradually reducing to a year-on-year increase of % by December.In January this year, amid adverse weather conditions, the number of cycle journeys being taken was actually down by % compared to January , before the pandemic.However, the figures rebounded with the cycle counters recording % more bike journeys in February this year and a % upturn during the three weeks from March  to  last month.: Edinburgh and Glasgow react to new cycle lanesCycling Scotland said the figures were a \"bright spot in a horrendous year\".The charitys chief executive Keith Irving said: \"Cycling has a key role to play in people getting exercise and fresh air, managing the ongoing pressure on our transport system and, crucially, tackling the global climate emergency we face.\"Were delighted at the massive increase in cycling and its vital we see it continue and expand.\"Keith Irving, chief executive Cycling ScotlandHe added: \"To get even more people cycling, we need to invest more in infrastructure so people feel safe to cycle.\"We need more dedicated cycle lanes, separated from vehicles and pedestrians.

Last month, the council’s interim chief executive offered an unreserved apology after an investigation found that the order had failed to adhere to procurement policies.But in a true twist of fate, the authority#s calamity could now generate more than its weight in stone for the local economy, according to archaeologists.#This is a very rare and unique find,# said Dr Avril Foulis, an archaeological consultant from the Friends of Orkney Lithology Society.#The figurine is in near-perfect condition, despite being approximately , years old, and having travelled the -mile journey to Orkney within the stone shipment.#This could present a breakthrough opportunity for Orkney archaeologists and the tourism industry alike. If we take the right steps, it could bring in millions of pounds in academic funding as well as additional footfall from visitors. This could be just the post-pandemic boost Orkney needs.#Dr Foulis and her colleagues believe the find could be just the first of many to come.#We have assembled a team to examine and oversee the remainder of the stone which is being shipped from Oban,# she continued.#If there are any more discoveries to be made, we hope to be able to unearth them with little dficulty or disruption to the work at Cursiter Quarry.#We have been lucky to get the use of a fleet of wheelie bins in order for us to separate the wheat from the chaff, so to speak.#While it has been assumed the figurine will remain in Orkney, authorities in Oban have already made representations for it to be ed to its place of origin.Kirkwall East councillor John Ross Scott was quick to defend OIC#s position, and suggested that plans may be afoot for a permanent visitor attraction, to be built on the Cursiter Quarry household Waste and recycling centre .In the meantime, a temporary portacabin has been sourced to house the figurine, he says.#The stone is legally ours, and we paid handsomely for it, so therefore the figurine is ours too,# he said.#I went out to visit the site, last night, as soon as I found out about the discovery. I wasn#t able to get in to see it, but I look forward to sharing photos of it on Facebook at the earliest opportunity.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It is a depressingly all-too familiar sight.“Stagnation” was the term Mr MacKinnon used, and he was spot on.As lives become ever more disconnected from the land, it’s quite understandable why people no longer have the inclination, or time, particularly when there is no great financial . But how it must frustrate those desperate to work the land to see all these crofts going to waste.Survey after survey has demonstrated a huge interest from people wanting to get a foot on the ladder, but they can’t because the traditional avenue of family inheritance is not open to them.The croft tenancies that do come on the market go for astronomical sums, way beyond the reach of young families and completely out of kilter with agricultural potential.And this is the problem, the reason that so many people hold onto non-working crofts is because they can see the pound signs they can see what it might fetch in terms of its housing potential, with estate agents only too happy to downplay the fact that every croft tenancy sale and every de-crofting application has to be approved by the Crofting Commission. It’s not proved too much of an impediment in the past.In fairness to the commission, they have made improvements. As much as the law enables, they do now try and prevent housing speculation – although one recent case in Lochalsh suggests there may be still some way to go. And they have at least made the right noises about dealing with neglect, which has prompted an increase in formal sub-leases and tenancy transfers.But as Mr MacKinnon noted, it is dficult for them to really stamp their authority without the proper resources.So an impasse remains, young families are unable to get access to land while countless crofts go to waste.But there is a solution, evenit will make for an uncomfortable journey: remove the ability to trade tenancies on the open market and at the same time get rid of the right to buy a croft. At a stroke, those motivated purely for monetarywill disappear their incentive gone. Then arm the commission with the necessary resources to properly tackle neglect —rather than the current practice of gentle encouragement without force — and those who have crofts but can’t do the work will have to quickly find a solution. Step forward new entrants.Granted, the opposition to such an approach will likely be signicant. Denying people the opportunity to do with an asset what they please will be seen as anti-libertarian, a curb on personal freedom, and you can easily predict the outrage.But the responsibility of a crofter is not to do as you please. You are part of a unique system of land tenure which was established nearly  years ago to keep people and communities alive. That is still very much of relevance today. Denying those fortunate enough to have crofts from lining their own pockets and ensuring everyone lives up to their duties doesn’t seem an unreasonable expectation in that context.It is expected that, Covid recovery depending, the new term of the Scottish Parliament willto the matter of crofting reformand there is an opportunity here for a proper radical approach which addresses the needs of crofting today but, crucially, with the principles of old at its heart.It will require politicians and leaders of strength and conviction who are able to make a compelling case in the face of undoubted opposition, who can the see the vision that a new, radical approach will bring and who can reject pressure from all sorts of vested interests. The trouble is: there is precious little evidence of that calibre of inidual in Scotland’s political landscape of today.IT SEEMS like only yesterday I was talking about preparing for the winter and here we are with spring on the horizon.

It thrives in wet conditions and is re in Scotland.There are routine treatments, but it’s now recognised that the parasite is developing a resistance to some of the products on the market. As a result of that, the advice is to constantly use dferent ones and I probably wasn’t as meticulous in this as I should have been, although I know that others too have had increased problems with fluke in the early part of the winter – and it was horrendously wet in November through to December.So the dry, hard frost of a couple of weeks ago was a godsend and it was on such a bracing but beautul morning that we gathered for the scanning, the ground underfoot like uneven concrete. You could have gotten away with your trainers.Once the work was completeI linked up my iPhone with the scanner and a detailed breakdown of the results popped up on the screen. A couple of pings later and it was out in the ether, all the way out to the North Sea where it was downloaded by someone not able to be in attendance to view his own results almost instantaneously.It was a lovely symbiosis of tradition and technology, though goodness knows what the bodachs of yesteryear would have made of it all."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/John_Purser-202030713-edited.jpg","title":"tobar and dualchais pure escapism among the fenian","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThat may explain why story-telling and mythology were so highly prized.

You could say she was pursuing the romantic Celtic dream, but with Father Allan and the people of Eriskay she found it, and it was no more a dream than was she herself.We should be immensely grateful to her. Her style of writing may seem slightly arch to some today, but none other than Padraic Colum was happy to write the foreword to her book, full of praise for her writing skills.She was a kind of predecessor of Margaret Fay Shaw, that most redoubtable of ladies, made of Pittsburgh steel, chain-smoking and with a bourbon to hand and her beloved piano just across the room.

Daniel Kane found herself in Malawi - the fth poorest nation in the world. Malawi, with a population of almost million and only a handful of ventilators and very little PPE, was totally unprepared for the pandemic. Charlotte assisted in the initial response to the first surge of the coronavirus as it spread throughout Malawi. Currently, however, a second and more deadly wave is gripping the country with devastating consequences. Charlotte said: “There are ten times more cases than during the first wave and a projected exponential increase in the infection rate. “Access to hospitals and modern health care is extremely limited. Many covid- patients are being treated in temporary wards in carparks with oxygen cylinders and . “There is no ability to give patients ventilatory support and take them into intensive care. Frontline healthcare workers risk their lives every day without adequate PPE and basic essentials such as hand gel.”Another huge contrast with the UK is that it may be some time before poorer countries like Malawi can get the vaccine. Here in the UK, the vaccine rollout has been a massive success with every person eligible for a free vaccination on the NHS. In poorer countries it will take much longer even for the vaccine to reach frontline health workers and the most vulnerable. The “Economist” reckons that it will be  at least before there is widespread vaccine roll out. “This means that Malawians have at least two years to get through before there is effective vaccine cover. As the vaccine rolls out in advanced economies and many of us are starting to see a glimmer of hope that normality willsoon, the story in Malawi couldn’t be more dferent,” says Charlotte.For health systems which are already woefully under-resourced, dealing with a second wave and a new strain of COVID- is a monumental challenge. Hospitals and clinics are operating without the basics to protect their staff and patients. Basic levels of PPE and hand gels are in very short supply. Without this support fragile health systems will be decimated of their most precious resource at this time – healthcare workers as many are at home sick with COVID- or sadly dying. This comes at a time when hospitals are buckling under pressure and desperately need health workers to be able to work.Charlotte now works as a doctor in Liverpool where the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine has launched Bump It Forward campaign to help bring PPE and vaccines to Malawi, Kenya and Zimbabwe in an attempt to redress this massive health inequality. The fund raising campaign actually came about as the result of a dream.A Christian friend of Prof Melita Gordon, who works in Malawi fulltime as part of the Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme, dreamt about how she was to receive her vaccine free of charge and an idea emerged to ‘pay forwar’d the cost of that doseage to help people in countries who did not yet have vaccines. It was a very direct, personal idea that people in the UK who have had a vaccine get it for free while the people in Malawi don’t. People love the idea of the BumpitForward campaign as it provides the opportunity to give back the cost of the vaccine in the order of pound. which they get it for free to help protect healthcare workers in Malawi, Kenya and Zimbabwe until the vaccine reaches them and save lives.Dr. Kane says she would love to see a local response to the campaign after her experience at the Mulanje District Hospital.Charlotte says: “The hospital is doing a great job, providing quality, safe and dignied care in extremely dficult circumstances.“Just like in the UK, they have had staff shortages related to staff testing positive for COVID which has made things all the more dficult. The senior nurses have designed a protocol to make best use of reusable gowns and are very grateful to receive the PPE donation. “I worked at Mulanje for the first six months of  and they have been brilliantly supportive partners in MLW-led research into reducing deaths from sepsis and HIV associated TB, so it is a pleasure to be able to support our partners when they are in need of PPE at this time. #Bumpitforward is a wonderful campaign which I couldn’t recommend highly enough.Give the equivalent of your Covid- vaccine to protect frontline staff in African countries who will have to wait for theirs. You can help keep them safe by donating the equivalent cost of your vaccine, to protect them until they can get theirs. There has already been a huge response to the Bump It Forward campaign and it continues to grow! It has now raised over pound,.

Senior executives in the IDA were also called in to follow up.The plan would involve a specic pharmaceutical plant in the south of the country manufacturing vaccines next year for a multinational which has developed a jab.However, the plan has hit a wall due to a lack of interest from vaccine developers in sub-contracting to other producers.Most of the main players in the Covid- vaccine market are already based in Ireland, with Pfizer in Cork, Dublin and Kildare Johnson  Johnson in Cork, Limerick and Dublin, and AstraZeneca in Dublin. The IDA is regularly in contact with these companies and a host of other medicine and medical supplies companies based in Ireland.Mr Brolly held a meeting with Mr Martin last month, just days before the Taoiseach’s meeting with President Biden on St Patrick’s Day.“The Taoiseach had a virtual call with Joe Brolly on March ,” a spokesman for Mr Martin said.“The Taoiseach asked the IDA to engage with the company to seeit could play any role in helping with vaccine supply.”Mr Brolly was unavailable for comment. The IDA had no comment to make.Sources close to the process say the plan would help Ireland secure vaccine supply into the future.The production of up to  million doses of the Covid- vaccine at the plant in the south of the country was suggested.The plant would need to be upgraded to produce the vaccines, so production couldn’t happen until at least next year.Tánaiste Leo Varadkar’s view on the proposal has been sought and Health Minister Stephen Donnelly was asked about the plan last week.Fine Gael Senator Paddy Burke said he was aware there is a proposal before Government on vaccine production in Ireland.“This would create jobs and would come at no cost to the taxpayer,” he said in the Seanad.“The Taoiseach is aware of the proposal. Some very high-powered people, at the very highest level in the world, are involved. I hope that the minister will pursue this as it would allow vaccines to be produced in this country for next year and would give us the safeguard of having our own vaccines here.”He also said the Irish Government has to ensure pharmaceutical firms based in the Republic, which may have spare capacity because there has been no flu this year, can produce Covid- vaccines. He wants the Departments of Health, Finance and Enterprise to assessvaccines could be produced in Ireland.The IDA made an approach to a major multinational involved in vaccine production to sound them out about using another Irish-based plant. However, the developers were not interested.Belfast Most ReadMLA Gerry Kelly#s Easter Rising tweet sparks unionist furyNI driver in #drunken# US horror smashDeath of Declan Ryan in Fermanagh jetski incident #devastating#, says Arlene FosterRoad closures: PSNI enforce Covid restrictions on north coastSouth East Antrim UDA warned business owners to close early or risk being attacked Top VideosPlayMan caught in petrol bomb flames as rioting in Northern Ireland continues into a second nightPlayPetrol bombs thrown in Cloughfern as rioting continues for a third night\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news d .ece AUTOCROP wh faefedb.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news d .ece AUTOCROP wh faefedb.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news d .ece AUTOCROP wh faefedb.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayPetrol bombs thrown during disturbances in Carrickfergus and Newtownabbey Latest CoronavirusNorthern Ireland hospitality chief urges Executive to engage on reopening of industryNI couples glad they got married despite Covid restrictionsRoadmap: Boris Johnson to reopen key sectors but Stormont is #stuck in lockdown mud#Vaccinate all residents of areas with Covid clusters, urges expertLatest from Belfast Northern Ireland hospitality chief urges Executive to engage on reopening of industryCriminal gangs condemned after fourth night of violence in Carrickfergus In Video: Police chase stolen ambulance in TexasGovernment plan will only reopen foreign holidays ‘for people who can afford it’Johnson faces battle with Tory rebels and Labour over ‘vaccine passports’,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Professor Gabriel Scally said movement in and out of affected areas should be banned, while specialist teams should carry out mass testing, contact tracing and vaccination to stop a further Covid- surge. Prof Scally, a member of the Independent Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies , has also raised concerns over plans to introduce mass home testing. Everyone in England will be given access to two rapid coronavirus tests a week from Friday in a plan the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said will help suppress any outbreaks as lockdown eases. The lateral flow kits, which can provide results in around half an hour, will be available for free at testing sites, pharmacies and through the post. The Department of Health in Northern Ireland has not said whether it plans to follow suit, although lateral flow tests are being used for the workplace testing programme here. Prof Scally said: These tests have limited value as they are only really % effective at picking up positive cases, so I wouldn#t want people making really important decisions from the results. Picking up % of positive cases is better than % and they#re useful for workplace testing, such as in meat processing plants, but I certainly wouldn#t think it was safe to visit a vulnerable relative or friendI had a negative result. It just wouldn#t be safe, I would be worried about these tests giving  reassurance to people who potentially have the virus and it changes their behaviour. Prof Scally said he is optimistic that Northern Ireland can escape a further deadly Covid- surge but he stressed that health authorities must ensure a robust test, trace and isolate system is in place and called for the introduction of automatic testing for all close contacts. He also recommended a specialist response to future clusters. It comes as official figures suggest theof pupils to school has not resulted in a spike of cases. Health bosses had warned they expected a rise in the number of Covid- infections after the phasedof pupils to class, which began on March . According to Department of Health statistics, there were  positive cases in people up to  years old between March  and . There were  cases diagnosed in the seven-day period between March  and April . All schoolchildren are due toto class next Monday. Prof Scally said it is likely there will be an increase in cases as a result of pupils going back to school but he believes it will not be a signicant rise. The vaccination programme has made a huge dference, he said. There has been a lot of talk about another wave but I can#t really see it happening, although it is a possibilityrelaxations happen too quickly. There are going to be clusters here and there and it is essential the authorities respond quickly. What they should be doing is stopping movement in and out of areas where there are clusters, teams should be sent in to test everything that moves and do really good contact tracing.

One animal welfare charity said this may be due to the pandemic, as fewer dog wardens have been on the streets.Karen Matthews of Almost Home NI said owners needed to ensure their pets are microchipped and their details are up-to-date to prevent strays being put down.This will mean that,a stray dog is picked up, it will be reunited with its owner or at least have a fair chance of getting back home, she said.That#s incredibly important at the minute with the amount of dog thefts that have been going on, it#s vital those details are up-to-date. The other thing with stray dogs that is really important for people to know is to check every single pound in Northern Irelandyour dog goes missing.  Belfast Beat Newsletter Receive the big stories from across Belfast directly to your inbox  Enter email address   This field is required  Sign Up      We had a dog last week, for instance, that someone picked up in Newcastle as a stray. They were coming back from a walk in the Mournes, and they brought it back to Lisburn. So that dog would have ended up in the dog pound in Lisburn and, being realistic,you#re from Newcastle, you#re not going to think to ring the dog pound in Lisburn looking for your dog. That kind of thing happens all the time.Ms Matthews said the pandemic has presented challenges for rescue centres.There has been an increase in cases involving stray dogs for us, because during the pandemic many dog wardens stopped picking up stray dogs, particularly during the first lockdown, she said.A lot of councils didn#t send their wardens out to pick up stray dogs off the street, so it was left to the rescue centres. Even at weekends and out-of-hours, we#ve always had stray dogs in because many vets are closed at the weekends and such. Some dog wardens have out-of-hours services, but not a lot of them.The Dogs Trust charity said it is saddened that councils are still in the unfortunate position of having to put stray dogs to sleepthey haven#t been reunited with their owners and no other suitable home has been found.While the number of stray dogs has continued to decrease in the last few years, we want this to remain at zero and would remind dog owners of the continued importance of ensuring they have an up-to-date microchip and licence for their dog, as this can help reunite dogs with their owners should they go missing, it said.Dogs Trust never puts a healthy dog down and we work with local authorities across the UK to find homes for as many stray dogs as possible. We don#t believe that owners set out to abandon their dogs or give them up for adoption however one of the most common reasons for dogs coming into our care is due to unwanted behaviours at home. Our Change the Tale campaign seeks to provide owners with information and resources that can help themthey are struggling with their dog and give them the tools they need to overcome these issues.Belfast Most ReadMLA Gerry Kelly#s Easter Rising tweet sparks unionist furyNI driver in #drunken# US horror smashDeath of Declan Ryan in Fermanagh jetski incident #devastating#, says Arlene FosterRoad closures: PSNI enforce Covid restrictions on north coastSouth East Antrim UDA warned business owners to close early or risk being attacked Top VideosPlayMan caught in petrol bomb flames as rioting in Northern Ireland continues into a second nightPlayPetrol bombs thrown in Cloughfern as rioting continues for a third night\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news d .ece AUTOCROP wh faefedb.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news d .ece AUTOCROP wh faefedb.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news d .ece AUTOCROP wh faefedb.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayPetrol bombs thrown during disturbances in Carrickfergus and Newtownabbey Latest Belfast BeatVigil: Community pays tribute to little Kaitlin McCoubrey-FullertonBelfast city centre retail staff told toto work #in preparation for April  opening#Belfast councillors vote to hike their allowances in spite of oppositionChief Constable Simon Byrne welcomes external probe into PSNI#s handling of Storey funeralLatest from Belfast Northern Ireland hospitality chief urges Executive to engage on reopening of industryCriminal gangs condemned after fourth night of violence in Carrickfergus In Video: Police chase stolen ambulance in TexasGovernment plan will only reopen foreign holidays ‘for people who can afford it’Johnson faces battle with Tory rebels and Labour over ‘vaccine passports’,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We did as many touristy things as we could.Ms Haigh#s most recent visit could not have been more dferent - as the new Shadow Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.Then, social distancing rather than socialising was the order of the day, as the Labour MP met, among others, Troubles victims and survivors at the Wave Trauma Centre in Belfast.There, the people who welcomed her included the centre#s coordinator Alan McBride, whose we Sharon died in the  Shankill bombing, and Jenner McNern, a survivor of the  Abercorn Bar atrocity.Louise spent time listening and learning but, frustratingly for her, she hasn#t been in close contact with anyone locally-based since that day last July.Consequently, she is looking forward to the end of lockdown - and finally meeting the likes of First Minister Arlene Foster and Deputy First Minister Michelle O#Neill in person, rather than on Zoom.I have regular virtual meetings with both Arlene and Michelle, both of whom I respect enormously, but I couldn#t tell you how tall either of them are, she joked.Attempting to do her job remotely has, however, been no laughing matter for singleton Louise, whose maternal grandmother hails from Cork.Of her Westminster colleagues from here, SDLP leader Colum Eastwood is a good friend and she gets on very well with the DUP#s parliamentary leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, but obviously there hasn#t been so much personal interaction with Stormont politicians.It#s actually been incredibly frustrating holding this brief during lockdown, said the Yorkshire woman, who lives alone in her native Sheffield - except for her dog Milo - but shares a property in London with an MP colleague and a couple of other friends in what she calls a strange split le.In the first lockdown I had my best friend and her seven-year-old living with me but since they moved out, I#ve been on my own, she said.This last lockdown has been the most dficult because the weather#s been horrendous and it#s felt almost interminable.Describing herself as a very sociable person, she said she has really missed my family and friends.Some assumptions frustrated me when we went into lockdown, she added.People were assuming Members of Parliament were inflicting rules on everyone  because we were with our families and protected that way, but lockdown has been really dficult for those of us who live alone.She hasn#t ventured near a travel agent just yet but is hoping to visit a good friend in Cornwall soon and more importantly, get over to Northern Ireland in the next couple of weeks.Louise, who became the youngest Labour MP when she was elected as member for Sheffield Heeley in , is also the first female Northern Ireland Shadow Secretary since the late Marjorie #Mo# Mowlam - one of my political heroes - in the s.Mo was unlike any SoS or shadow SoS who had come before, said Louise of her predecessor, a key architect of the Good Friday Belfast Agreement who, tragically, died in , aged just .She had loads of personality and although she took the brief very seriously, she didn#t take people very seriously.It#s people that really drive me, in the way that motivated and inspired Mo as well.There are too many politicians who aren#t motivated by people, and don#t feel comfortable being around people.They feel more comfortable in locked offices thinking about policy rather than being driven by the challenges people face in their everyday lives.Louise, who studied politics at the University of Nottingham, initially toyed with a career in criminal law - she did a Masters degree in Law after her politics degree - like her father Richard . Mum Juanita , is a probate solicitor, and her brother Philis a sports journalist.Politics, however, ran through the family.My uncle was a striking coal miner in the s, while my auntie moved to South Africa and worked for the international Red Cross, fighting against apartheid in the s and s, she said.My grandma also fled from the Spanish civil war in the early th century.I had a very left-wing economics teacher at school who made me see where my views fitted into a party political framework, and that#s why I joined Labour when I was .Louise#s first job after graduation was working for MP Graham Allen and that totally opened my eyes to a whole world that I#d never known before.Being an MP herself - she is still one of the youngest people on the famous green benches of the Commons - still daunts Louise.I look around when I#m in there and think #what am I doing here , she admitted.I still have massive imposter syndrome you can#t help think of all the incredible people who#ve gone before you. But it#s been an extraordinary learning curve over the last six years.Despite the self-effacement, Ms Haigh is regarded as one of the most talented and astute Labour MPs, which is one of the reasons why she is in Sir Keir Starmer#s shadow cabinet.It is her job to keep her Conservative opposite number, Secretary of State Brandon Lewis, on his toes, and has done so on many occasions from the dispatch box.But she backs Mr Lewis#s attempts to override the devolved government here and push through abortion legislation, which was passed in  when the Stormont Executive was suspended but has yet to be officially implemented.It#s a great shame that it#s come to this, she said.Ultimately the UK government has human rights obligations, and the situation in Northern Ireland was found to be in breach of those obligations.Women are still facing the completely unacceptable situation of having to travel to access safe legal abortion so, as regrettable as it is, I support the government in what they#re doing.It is a dferent story, however, when it comes to that other major bone of contention, the Northern Ireland Protocol.Last month the UK moved to unilaterally extend the grace periods for Irish Sea border checks - which the European Union regards as a breach of international law.With Northern Ireland remaining a part of the EU#s single market post-Brexit, and goods and products arriving here from GB having to undergo EU import procedures, the initial grace period was meant to end on March . Mr Lewis and his cabinet colleagues decided otherwise.Theyhave repeatedly put their narrow political interests above the interests of Northern Ireland and we#re seeing the consequences of that play out now, she said.Northern Ireland is not a priority for them like it was for the last Labour government, and the Tories# recklessness and political games, particularly with the Good Friday Agreement, are resulting in the threat of instability now.She added: Labour knew how potentially upsetting Brexit could be to the delicate balance of identities in Northern Ireland.I totally accept what a challenge this is to unionism and loyalism and to their identity and there wasn#t nearly enough consideration given to what their reaction would be. Even in January, Brandon Lewis was still denying there was any Irish Sea border - and that dishonesty has worsened the anger and made things a lot more dficult to repair.Ms Haigh#s former party leader Jeremy Corbyn made no secret of his support for a united Ireland, so where does she stand I don#t think it#s a forgone conclusion, she said.The constitutional question will, however, come up over coming years but there are still a signicant number of people who have to be persuaded of the merits of a united Ireland.For me, the most important thing is making Northern Ireland work for the people there. As Mo Mowlam said, it#s the real lives of people that needs changing and there are huge public policy issues that need addressing right now, from the health service and mental health service to legacy issues.If the current opinion polls are anything to go by, Louise won#t get an opportunity to emulate Mo Mowlam and become a Labour #SoS# here.Despite the many mistakes made by Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his colleagues since the Covid- pandemic struck, the Tories - who have a huge parliamentary majority - remain comfortably ahead of the main opposition party.And Mr Starmer, who has just passed one year as Labour leader, is facing criticism from many of his own backbenchers who accuse him of sitting on the fence too often and abstaining, rather than voting against, the Government on key issues such as the Covid restrictions tier system.I#m desperate to hold onto it until the next election at the very least, said Louise, who conceded that the #vaccine bounce# has helped the Conservatives enormously over the past few months.The government has made enormous mistakes and had massive failures - the highest death rate in Europe and the worst economic impact of any developed economy in the world, she said.They have failed on every metric, but they are enjoying the success of the vaccine.The battle for the next election, however, is going to be about recovery and rebuilding our country. The Tories are the government that weakened our economy and our public services so drastically ahead of the coronavirus and that#s why we had such a disastrous response to it.Ironically, Ms Haigh has personally been helping the NHS vaccination programme her rivals are claiming credit for.A GP askedI would come down and help at one of the local vaccination centres, she explained.They were giving out the Pfizer vaccine to a lot of older people so I was helping them with mobility issues.A lot of them were getting their second vaccine and crying out #freedom#. It was so positive.Despite the criticism of Ms Haigh#s boss, he has acted decisively to rid Labour of the accusations of anti-Semitism which blighted the Corbyn era.Louise admitted the party still had work to do in rebuilding trust with the Jewish community but have already made enormous strides with that.Ithas been a real stain on our party and one I#m deeply ashamed of, she said.On a lighter note, is it true that the Mark Darcy character played by Colin Firth in the Brigid Jones#s Diary series is based on the Labour leader Confirming that author Helen Fielding later denied that, Louise added: I had a massive crush on Colin Firth... I#m afraid I don#t have a crush on Keir Starmer.Belfast Most ReadMLA Gerry Kelly#s Easter Rising tweet sparks unionist furyNI driver in #drunken# US horror smashDeath of Declan Ryan in Fermanagh jetski incident #devastating#, says Arlene FosterNew IRA chief Thomas Mellon insists on bogside #show of unity# Road closures: PSNI enforce Covid restrictions on north coastTop VideosPlayMan caught in petrol bomb flames as rioting in Northern Ireland continues into a second nightPlayPetrol bombs thrown in Cloughfern as rioting continues for a third night\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news d .ece AUTOCROP wh faefedb.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news d .ece AUTOCROP wh faefedb.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news d .ece AUTOCROP wh faefedb.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayPetrol bombs thrown during disturbances in Carrickfergus and Newtownabbey Latest Northern IrelandNorthern Ireland traffic alerts: Snow causing disruption on some roadsPioneering NI speech therapist Eleanor Hewardine dies aged  Republic #needs to understand NI better#, says peace centre chiefSo good I saw it twice: Kathy Burke hails Lyric Theatre production SadieNavy hero of Arctic convoys dies at age of  in AntrimLatest from Belfast Northern Ireland traffic alerts: Snow causing disruption on some roadsAccounting software firm Sage Group sells off Swiss business for £mWarning over possible third wave as UK continues on road map out of lockdownBP hits debt target early after making billions from disposalsMe and my health: Richard Maguire on his lestyle,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

While the liberation of Ireland has not yet been achieved, British manipulation coupled with the treachery of former republicans has upheld the partition of Ireland. For the solution, the army must look in radical terms to attacking the cause of Ireland#s problems.Almost  years since the partition of Ireland, it#s clear it has failed and those who attempt to uphold it will fail.Meanwhile, members of Saoradh, the New IRA#s alleged political wing, held a wreath-laying ceremony in Derry City Cemetery yesterday with around  people present.A planned march for the event to mark the th anniversary of the Easter Rising was cancelled.The ceremony passed off without police intervention. DUP MLA Gary Middleton said he would be raising the issue with the PSNI.Saoradh national executive member Stephen Murney said: Saoradh are reminded that men and women were incarcerated in British and  county jails for standing by the Republic proclaimed in .Mr Murney claimed Saoradh grew more confident daily in our political analysis and position. He said: The British and  county establishments must fear our message and our analysis as we continue to bear the wrath of MI-led harassment across the country. Our social media pages face regular censorship, yet we are getting our message out there and it is resonating with people. Mr Murney added: We hope to pass the unrepentant revolutionary republican flame onto the next generation.We remember that in , it was so-called dissidents and radicals within the broader nationalist movement who led the charge and pushed the revolutionary agenda forward to rise and strike a blow for liberty.We are proud to inherit the title dissident in the Irish context.The Good Friday Agreement was not the end of Irish history. There has been and always will be dissenting voices until the socialist republic that so many gave so much for is achieved.Belfast Most ReadMLA Gerry Kelly#s Easter Rising tweet sparks unionist furyNI driver in #drunken# US horror smashDeath of Declan Ryan in Fermanagh jetski incident #devastating#, says Arlene FosterRoad closures: PSNI enforce Covid restrictions on north coastSouth East Antrim UDA warned business owners to close early or risk being attacked Top VideosPlayMan caught in petrol bomb flames as rioting in Northern Ireland continues into a second nightPlayPetrol bombs thrown in Cloughfern as rioting continues for a third night\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news d .ece AUTOCROP wh faefedb.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news d .ece AUTOCROP wh faefedb.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news d .ece AUTOCROP wh faefedb.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayPetrol bombs thrown during disturbances in Carrickfergus and Newtownabbey Latest Northern IrelandNorthern Ireland hospitality chief urges Executive to engage on reopening of industryCriminal gangs condemned after fourth night of violence in Carrickfergus Northern Ireland traffic alerts: Snow causing disruption on some roadsPioneering NI speech therapist Eleanor Hewardine dies aged  Republic #needs to understand NI better#, says peace centre chiefLatest from Belfast Northern Ireland hospitality chief urges Executive to engage on reopening of industryCriminal gangs condemned after fourth night of violence in Carrickfergus In Video: Police chase stolen ambulance in TexasGovernment plan will only reopen foreign holidays ‘for people who can afford it’Johnson faces battle with Tory rebels and Labour over ‘vaccine passports’,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Barbara Walshe, chair of the Glencree Centre for Peace and Reconciliation, said raising awareness of the complexity of Northern Ireland in the Republic of Ireland over the next five years will be cruciala border poll takes place. In an interview with the New York-based Irish Central website, Ms Walshe said: It#s unfair and short-sighted to ignore the concerns of the unionist community. It#s more important than ever that the Republic of Ireland really engages with this and understands the complexity of Northern Ireland.She added: There are nearly one million people who identy as British and that identity will have to be accommodated. If a border poll s a - result, we have seen across the water what a close referendum like that has caused over the past four years.Ms Walshe said Glencree has stood as a symbol of hope in the quest for an end to violent conflict. Over the past five decades, the former English military barracks in the heart of the Wicklow Mountains has been helping both communities in Northern Ireland move towards peace and reconciliation. In , Una O#Higgins O#Malley, the daughter of Ireland#s first Minister for Justice Kevin O#Higgins, sought to build a reconciliation centre for people living through the Troubles. Her father had been assassinated in  when she was just five months old and she spent much of her le attempting to reconcile violence as a result. O#Higgins O#Malley sought to bring people from both communities in Northern Ireland to the centre where they could discuss their dferences in a private and safe space. It was a safe space. It was expert facilitation, Ms Walshe told IrishCentral. It was a kind of speaking and listening, even when people felt very strongly about things. It was a place for people to hear and to listen at a time when nobody wanted to listen to anybody, she added. There#s no judgment. People who wanted to come, regardless of their background, could engage in peace and create the conditions for peacethey wished. After the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in , Glencree#s role shted toward the legacy of the conflict.The centre has since hosted more than  confidential discussions between politicians and community and civic leaders on both sides of the border, seeking to iron out contentious issues in the historic peace agreement. It has also hosted discussions between representatives from the UK and Ireland and has continued working with victims of the Troubles, allowing people to discuss the lasting impacts of the violent conflict. What we saw in Glencree after the Troubles was the legacy of the Troubles. You had the end of the conflict. You had the peace agreement, Ms Walshe said.

There is not a girl woman anywhere who doesnt like a piece of jewellery or an aromatic fragrance. You could include a few men in that, too! Among them are two young Derry girls who love all things glittery and sparkly – and a nice fragrance – so much so, they have used their time during Covid- lockdown to start up their own fragrance business. Sisters Mia, , and Bella Doherty, , from Cornshell Fields in the Ballyarnett of the city, named their enterprise Jewelled Aroma by Mia Bella- a combination of their names – and after almost a year of research, trials and checking out regulations, they have their enterprise up and running. googletag.cmd.push At the minute, they are making wax melts of ious fragrances and shapes along with room sprays to match the wax melts smells. They are also currently looking into other products as well. Mia, who attends St Marys College, said they began researching soon after the Covid- restrictions were introduced in March last year. She added: “We undertook online courses in candle-making tohelp our wee idea become a reality. “We tried out dferenttypes of soya wax andfragrances with our family being thetesters, much to their delight for a goodfew months. “We wanted to be % happywith our product before we decidedthey were ready for purchase.So the launch of Jewelled Aroma by Mia Bella began last month. googletag.cmd.push “We are both currentlyusing our mum’s kitchen but she doesn’tmind as we clean up after ourselves and her house always smells solovely for her. “Also, by law, we have to follow certain regulations, so have to ensure CIP labels are made for every fragranceoil and then bepresently packaged. This can all take a lot of timebut we really love being creative and by adding glitter and colour and trying out dferent designs makes our wax melts stand out compared to others.Having nice packaging and how they are presented is very important to us “We make wax melts by melting soya wax and adding fragrancesoils and pour into moulds, although this sounds very straight forwardthere is temperature taking anda few step-by-step instructions that need to be adhered toin order to maintain a good quality product that will last.”     Despite the success and the enjoyment of making fragrances, Mia said she was looking forward to going back to school. “St Mary’sis a fantastic school and I love getting up to go to school every morning.” She admitted she was a bit concerned about how much catching up she will have to do but said she was sure the teachers would put everyone at ease when they were all back in the classroom. “We definitely missed schoola lot,especiallynot seeing our friends was dficult but starting this business has helpedkeep us occupied and easeanyboredom. “Learning our craft and keeping upwithschoolwork has made the wholeCovidsituation fly in for us. Weare so busy at the minutewith orders for delivery that our mum had to help out as well. She is able to help at the minute as her business is currently closed due toCovid- restric- tions.She was a great help at the start as she was able to guide us in the right direction - we have even roped dad into helping by doing the deliveries.” She added: “I hope we go back to normality as I like the hands on physical activities at school like technology and science experiments.” Bella, who ed to P at Steelstown Primary School on Monday last, said despite the enjoying of producing Jewelled Aroma by Mia Bella products, school work was her priority. “I was a bit nervous about ingto school but it was great. I have a new teacher and she is really lovely. It was great seeing all my friends as well. This is my last year in primary school so I am really happy to be getting backto see everyone before I have to make the transition to secondary school.” Bella said they had been inundated with very positive reviews for their range of products. “Everyone seems to love the product going by the lovely messages we receive.Customers wish us every success andfor more orders so this makes us very happy. “When we are back at school full-time and not able to commitour time as much to the business as school is the priority, my aunties are willing to help out to keep us well stocked up with our products. “The people in our cityand beyondhave been really supportive inshopping local, it feels good to know we’re doing something right.” The girls mother, Maria, is understandably so proud of her two girls, being the owner of Miabella beauty salon next to the car wash on Racecourse Road in Shantallow which has been closed for nine months of the past year. She said: “If there’s one thing I can take from lockdownis that I work too much and the girls missed me, so spending quality time and helping them out with their wax melts was amazing. I’ve learned so much from them and how much of a work ethicis instilled into them, “I am so proud of them both andhow they have juggled both school work and their newly established business. “They both are managing perfectly so farand I can go back to work and know they are perfectly capable of staying on top of orders. “As their mum, though, I will keep on top of the social mediato ensure their safety - their page is linked to my phone so I can keep them safe.” Maria conceded she has found lockdown extremely dficultat times. She added: “I really miss my clients, as a lot of them have become friends over the years. It’s always good to catch up with each other.I’m so looking forward to seeing each and every single one of them when I canalthough trying to fit everyone in will prove to be a dficult task. “Somehow, I’ll man- ageshould I work night and day to get you all beautied again.I don’t like to disappoint anyone when they look for appointments, my clients are lovely and are very understanding.” So Chanel, Jimmy Choo and Gucci, take note of the name - Jewelled Aroma by Mia Bella.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Four Donegal sisters, Johanne, Susan, Marcia and Dorothy Gallagher, have entered their family home into a prize draw. Along with the property, the winner will also receive pound, in cash. This enchanting homestead, on approximately . acres, is in South West Donegal. It includes a farmhouse with a modern extension and amenities as well an adjoining second property that was previously used as a seasonal hostel and camping site.  It is located between Dunkineely and Bruckless in southwest Donegal. The family are generously donating % of the proceeds to Beaumont Hospital Foundation for the neurosurgery department in honour of their parents who sadly passed away less than eight weeks apart in . googletag.cmd.push If all tickets are sold they will raise pound, sterling for the Foundation. Entrants must be aged  or over. Tickets for the draw are poundthrough UK site raffall and the draw will take place on May  at pm. Ben and Lyndall’s le story is about love and loss and could potentially bring substantial benefit to neurosurgical patients of Beaumont Hospital. In the s, Irish man Ben Gallagher met his we to be, Lyndall, at a dance in Sydney, Australia. They started a relationship that would eventually lead to marriage, the birth of five daughters and ajourney to Ireland which brought Australian-born Lyndall to live permanently on the other side of the world. googletag.cmd.push Ben and Lyndall fell in love with a property in Bruckless, Donegal where they would farm and bring up their family. However, a serious spinal injury that Ben suffered in Sydney cut short his farming career and the couple set up a new business, converting the farm buildings into a hostel  camping facilities. His health problems continued and then Lyndall, following treatment for breast cancer, was diagnosed with a brain tumour and underwent an awake craniotomy in Beaumont Hospital under Mr Stephen McNally. The couple were married just one week short of  years when Ben passed away in March and Lyndall sadly died eight weeks later in .     It was a devastating loss for their daughters who are now putting up the family home that Ben and Lyndall established as the prize for an online draw. Along with the house and land also comes the hostel  camping facilities, a walled garden and ious outbuildings plus pound, stg in cash. The property is situated on the Wild Atlantic Way en route from Donegal Town to Killybegs.

Sometimes I will call the captains, separately, at half-time before the teams are going in for the break. It could be something as simple as warning them to stop chopping. Theyll appreciate it more that you went to them in their role as captain.” Looking at refereeing as a whole, Micky puts himself in the position of the player. What would they want from the man in the middle  “I wanted someone to be consistent, whether it is right or wrong for both teams. I want them to keep up with play and explainas opposed to just blowing the whistle and pointing. If you ask them the score, they are not ignoring you.” There also, he feels, needs to be an openness to error and the possibility of a referee making a mistake. Others may see as a sign of weakness. “I would completely disagree,” Quigg states. “If you can be honest and open with a player, thats all they want back. “I am not sayingIm right and youre wrong. I am saying that from my point of view, it looks like, for example, a pick off the ground. From my angle, it looked like a pick off the ground. I am going to stick with it.” ***  Two years ago a torn cruciate ended the footballing career of Desertmartins Paddy Devlin at the age of . As someone with a deep interest and an avid watcher of games, getting back involved was a must. Tied in was a fascination for the rules. In an age when black card ref became the common shot at grounds across the country, Devlin would often evaluate it. “Sometimes it wouldnt be close to the right call,” he adds. “I was always very interested in  the game as a whole. I would have followed football...Id have nearly gone to every championship and league match, as many as I could.” Played right, the advanced mark, which he finds interesting has helped the game. Two minutes into a conversation is enough to convince you of Devlins constant thirst for knowledge. And improvement. In a similar fashion to the player wanting to constantly evolve. From refereeing his first game in an U Féile na nÓg game, he was on the line for Greenloughs win over Steelstown in last years intermediate final. “I was working along with Poloand Declan OConnor that day,” Devlin adds. “”Those boys have a lot of experience and seeing them dealing with pressure. Every day is a learning day.” Every day is a school day and every game is a fresh script. Use of a rule may pop up for the first time in a few games and its time for another refresher. Its all about preparation. “You have two teams who have trained all year for a championship match, you dont want to let yourself or anybody down. You try to do it to the best of your ability,” stresses Devlin, who referees two minor championship games last season and Greenlough Us final win over St Patricks. LEARNING Criticism can crush or polish you. Paddy filters through it, but chooses the latter. “Some of it is constructive, some of it is unfair,” he says. “You evaluate it and have a good team of umpires around you that you trust, who are not going to lie to you and tell you that you did well, when you really didnt. “You want to get as much information to try and improve every game. Sometimes you are going to be wrong, you just have to take it on the chin and move on.” Watching senior championship games was part of the learning curve and reaching out for help. No question was too trivial. It was all learning. “Listen to the older hands and every one of them has always guided me, taking time to show me things to keep myself right,” was Devlins advice to anyone who finds themselves in his shoes two years ago, ready to step on the refereeing ladder. In terms of getting into the zone for a game, he echoes Micky Quigg. The background noise is irrelevant. And there is enjoyment. “Its about keeping your head and staying calm,you are doing it properly and watching the game, anything  is just like a humming noise.” PREPARATION Devlins knee reconstruction ruled out the twisting, turning and contact required for five-a-side football to keep himself ticking over. He now turns to walking and running. His  and km runs keep his engine primed enough to put him in the best place on the pitch to make a call. His job as a lorry driver for GO fuel sees him away early in the morning and home late in the evening, with just enough turnaround for a quick bite before darting out to a game. Having everything organised the day before avoids any late panic. “The worst thing is rushing into a game unprepared. I like to be there in time and warmed up and show the players, I am taking this seriously,” he points out. “There is nothing as bad looking as a referee landing late and unprepared, it gets the peoples backs up right away.” On the pitch, its about remaining calm and settling into a game early, while getting on the players side. “The game is about the two teams, not the man in the middle,” Devlin states. “I tell them I am here to let them play, and I dont want to blow this whistle.” He will look for a bit of reasoning and concedes that mistakes will be made, but his bug bear is high and rash tackling. It is uncalled for in his opinion. “At underage, a lot of it comes down to coaching and people need to remember you have to tackle the ball,” explains Paddy, who also refers to the Give Respect, Get Respect logo on referees clothing. Paddy Devlin looking across his home pitch in Desertmartin. “If you give respect, youll get respect back,” he stresses. There has to be a balance between too much authority and having control over a game. The referee shouldnt be in the spotlight. “At the end of the game,nobody knew who refereed that match, it is a job well done in my eyes,” Devlin continues. Thats real success. He was keen to stress the point of only being able to make a decision on what he can see. In a championship, there will be umpires and linesmen. But on the average Sunday when he follows the play, he is on his own and someone gets struck off the ball. His hands are tied. “I dont think people fully understand that,” he says. “You have to make the best decision on what you see. Thats the point...its on what you see.” For someone with an interest in the game, Paddy sees getting involved as a referee as a step forward. “It is a good way of getting fit and getting to meet dferent people,” he sums up. “It reflects your personality and how you can keep calm. There are a lot of stressful situations and it is all about coming out on top of them.”\",\"keywords\":\"Derry GAA,Referee,Micky Quigg,Paddy Devlin,IN\",\"articleSection\":\"GAA\",\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"description\":\"With news of ato club activities, thoughts turn to the season ahead.

Reporter: Michael McMullan::  Apr   addthis, With news of ato club activities, thoughts turn to the season ahead. In a special feature this week Michael McMullan looks at those who take up the whistle. Football referee Paddy Devlin and hurling whistler Micky Quigg talk about their experiences.So you think you can do better  Put your whistle where your mouth is. Those words struck a chord with Micky Quigg. As Derry GAAs Facebook post came calling for new referees, Quigg thought he could do better. The Swatragh man followed it up with a short email to Sean Curran, who was looking after referees at the time, and hes been there since. After taking up the whistle in , a spell in the Big Apple as New York GAAs Hurling Development Officer saw him referee his first senior county final three years later. Tucked away in the Bronx, under the shadow of Manhattan College and the passing trains, Ulster took on Tipperary in the decider, with Dublins Danny Sutclfe and Clare goal machine Shane ODonnell in action. googletag.cmd.push Micky Quigg taking change of the New York county final in . “I also did the semi-final and TJ Reid was playing for one of the teams, so that was pretty cool,” Quigg states. Hurling and refereeing have been kind to him. In summary, Quigg sees the glass as more than half full in relation to what is often perceived as the toughest gig in sport. When a call needs to be made, the eyes will be locked on the referee. Two sets of players, supporters and management teams. “Its not even the decision,” Quigg explains. “Its the split second you have to make it and the pressure that comes with it.” googletag.cmd.push There are more good days than bad. Enjoyment comes from the rapport fostered from the relationships with players and managers alike. Provided a referee has the right personality there is craic to be had. Its not all a bed of roses. There is the verbal and sometimes physical abuse attached to the role. Many forget there is a person behind every referee. A family, a job and the challenges le throws at them. “Thats a fair point,” Quigg accepts. “It is to do with the GAA community as a whole, we are a very passionate group.” In his coaching and playing days, he would offer his handshake and a word of thanks in the direction of the referee regardless of his agreement with all the decisions.     “If I am in the middle of pitch and am focussed on the game, I dont hear it,” Quigg states of any abuse hurled in a referees direction. “They are just chancing their arm. The majority of the conversations to me have always been respectful.” Referees, in Quiggs opinion, are only as strong as the advice they get. And with every game, comes new learning. He cites Eamonn Hasson, Tarlach Conway, Owen Elliott, Eddie and Alan Nash on those he can bend the ear of. “If there is a game where Im not sure how that went, Id pick up the phone and give them a call,” Quigg points out. “A lot of boys have been good to me down through the years. With refereeing in general and Derry GAA theyll have your back and look out for you. Advice, a hand doing a line or umpire or whatever it may be.” UMPIRES Quigg took a real liking to refereeing and with the fitness gained comes travelling around the county extends as a social aspect many others gain from sport. He is thankful for his pool of umpires. His brother John Joe, Neil McAllister, Brian Oacuteg Corbett, Francis McEldowney, Rory McGurk and the Mullan brothers – Cathal and Dominic. “You need people you can trust and point out what everyone has to look out for,” Micky explains and is thankful whichever four he calls on will be on his channel. A trusted set of eyes when an off the ball incident needs a decision. “Those boys are always there for me...and we have some craic on Sunday mornings,” adds Quigg of the early Sunday morning trips to a windy Garvaghey to some corner of Antrim. “Get a group of your mates to do umpire for you,” comes his advice for anyone thinking of taking up the whistle. “When you get the first couple of games under you, youll start to enjoy it. They do say refereeing is a hard job, but generally the majority of people have an appreciation for you at the end of a game oryou see them through the county during the week.” Having another referee casting their opinion on his performance was a help to Quigg early on. Like a player wanting to reach the top level, there is no substitute for watching. And learning. “Look what the referees at the top level are doing. How they deal with decisions, communicate with players and go back to their umpires.” One of the roles of any captain is to take the toss. It gives the referee a chance to get his message into the respective pre-game huddles. The simple message that is easily carried. A popular one is a warning against dissent. “Id always have it in my head before a game what I am going to tell the captains,” Quigg states. “I tell them that it needs to go back to the team andit isnt, its on them. “Youll miss a pick-up, youll miss a score and I will make an odd mistake, but I will be consistent and I will keep up with the play,” Quigg explains of his message. “If I call a freecaptains will often ask me what they need to do dferently. Sometimes I will call the captains, separately, at half-time before the teams are going in for the break. It could be something as simple as warning them to stop chopping. Theyll appreciate it more that you went to them in their role as captain.” Looking at refereeing as a whole, Micky puts himself in the position of the player. What would they want from the man in the middle  “I wanted someone to be consistent, whether it is right or wrong for both teams. I want them to keep up with play and explainas opposed to just blowing the whistle and pointing. If you ask them the score, they are not ignoring you.” There also, he feels, needs to be an openness to error and the possibility of a referee making a mistake. Others may see as a sign of weakness. “I would completely disagree,” Quigg states. “If you can be honest and open with a player, thats all they want back. “I am not sayingIm right and youre wrong. I am saying that from my point of view, it looks like, for example, a pick off the ground. From my angle, it looked like a pick off the ground. I am going to stick with it.” *** Two years ago a torn cruciate ended the footballing career of Desertmartins Paddy Devlin at the age of . As someone with a deep interest and an avid watcher of games, getting back involved was a must. Tied in was a fascination for the rules. In an age when black card ref became the common shot at grounds across the country, Devlin would often evaluate it. “Sometimes it wouldnt be close to the right call,” he adds. “I was always very interested in the game as a whole. I would have followed football...Id have nearly gone to every championship and league match, as many as I could.” Played right, the advanced mark, which he finds interesting has helped the game. Two minutes into a conversation is enough to convince you of Devlins constant thirst for knowledge. And improvement. In a similar fashion to the player wanting to constantly evolve. From refereeing his first game in an U Feacuteile na nOacuteg game, he was on the line for Greenloughs win over Steelstown in last years intermediate final. “I was working along with Poloand Declan OConnor that day,” Devlin adds. “”Those boys have a lot of experience and seeing them dealing with pressure. Every day is a learning day.” Every day is a school day and every game is a fresh script. Use of a rule may pop up for the first time in a few games and its time for another refresher. Its all about preparation. “You have two teams who have trained all year for a championship match, you dont want to let yourself or anybody down. You try to do it to the best of your ability,” stresses Devlin, who referees two minor championship games last season and Greenlough Us final win over St Patricks. LEARNING Criticism can crush or polish you. Paddy filters through it, but chooses the latter. “Some of it is constructive, some of it is unfair,” he says. “You evaluate it and have a good team of umpires around you that you trust, who are not going to lie to you and tell you that you did well, when you really didnt. “You want to get as much information to try and improve every game. Sometimes you are going to be wrong, you just have to take it on the chin and move on.” Watching senior championship games was part of the learning curve and reaching out for help. No question was too trivial. It was all learning. “Listen to the older hands and every one of them has always guided me, taking time to show me things to keep myself right,” was Devlins advice to anyone who finds themselves in his shoes two years ago, ready to step on the refereeing ladder. In terms of getting into the zone for a game, he echoes Micky Quigg. The background noise is irrelevant. And there is enjoyment. “Its about keeping your head and staying calm,you are doing it properly and watching the game, anything  is just like a humming noise.” PREPARATION Devlins knee reconstruction ruled out the twisting, turning and contact required for five-a-side football to keep himself ticking over. He now turns to walking and running. His  and km runs keep his engine primed enough to put him in the best place on the pitch to make a call. His job as a lorry driver for GO fuel sees him away early in the morning and home late in the evening, with just enough turnaround for a quick bite before darting out to a game. Having everything organised the day before avoids any late panic. “The worst thing is rushing into a game unprepared. I like to be there in time and warmed up and show the players, I am taking this seriously,” he points out. “There is nothing as bad looking as a referee landing late and unprepared, it gets the peoples backs up right away.” On the pitch, its about remaining calm and settling into a game early, while getting on the players side. “The game is about the two teams, not the man in the middle,” Devlin states. “I tell them I am here to let them play, and I dont want to blow this whistle.” He will look for a bit of reasoning and concedes that mistakes will be made, but his bug bear is high and rash tackling. It is uncalled for in his opinion. “At underage, a lot of it comes down to coaching and people need to remember you have to tackle the ball,” explains Paddy, who also refers to the Give Respect, Get Respect logo on referees clothing. Paddy Devlin looking across his home pitch in Desertmartin. “If you give respect, youll get respect back,” he stresses. There has to be a balance between too much authority and having control over a game. The referee shouldnt be in the spotlight. “At the end of the game,nobody knew who refereed that match, it is a job well done in my eyes,” Devlin continues. Thats real success. He was keen to stress the point of only being able to make a decision on what he can see. In a championship, there will be umpires and linesmen. But on the average Sunday when he follows the play, he is on his own and someone gets struck off the ball. His hands are tied. “I dont think people fully understand that,” he says. “You have to make the best decision on what you see. Thats the point...its on what you see.” For someone with an interest in the game, Paddy sees getting involved as a referee as a step forward. “It is a good way of getting fit and getting to meet dferent people,” he sums up. “It reflects your personality and how you can keep calm. There are a lot of stressful situations and it is all about coming out on top of them.”   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Then it was straight into another MacRory and Hogan campaign before we hooked up with the minor hurlers.” Joe McGurk had Screen man Pat Joe McKenna with him and later added his brother Collie to the setup. It was a rush to get a team pulled together after the  Hogan Cup final needed a replay for Maghera to see of St Jarlaths. It took a goal from for a rusty Derry to see off Down, - to -, in the semi-final at the Athletic Grounds. “That  team was a heavily fancied team...more so than the following year, when there wasnt the same expectation” McEldowney states. “Big Ollie , Brian McCormick and Hugh Mullan were among the older players, but at least half of the team were underage the next year.” In the final, Rory Stevenson blotted out Antrim dangerman PJ OMullan in a - to - victory. Two Paddy McEldowney goals helped Derry out of the blocks. After hooking his marker, he pulled to the net midway through the first half. Collins also hit a brace of goals in a comfortable win. McGonagle plucked a ball in the first five minutes only for an Antrim hurl to follow through and break his thumb. When the adrenaline subsided after the game, the pain knocked him for six. McGonagle had to get it strapped up for the following Sunday, a two-point win in the Ulster minor football final at Clones. On the hurling front, it was off to Croke Park to take on a Cork team that contained  All-Ireland senior winning captain Mark Landers and Kevin Murray, who came on in the final. The  Derry minor team pictured before their All-Ireland semi-final defeat to Cork in Croke Park. Only two points separated the teams at half-time, with a goal from Michael Collins boosting Derry’s confidence. Goalkeeper Fergal McNally made a number of fine saves, with points from Collins , McCormick and Malachy McKenna keeping Derry ticking over at the other end. The Oakleafers, who lost McGonagle to injury after the interval, were left to also rue a number of missed chances which might have left things more interesting in what was a - to - defeat, with Cork losing out to the Cats in the final, after a replay. *** The  chapter was one of commitment and talent, bound together by team spirit built by Stevensons trips down the country. With the bad blood between Lavey and Screen buried, the training sessions – mainly at Glen and Slaughtneil – began to sharpen the skills. Paddy McEldowney, now the captain, remembers how Stevenson didnt even focus on Down or Antrim. It was all about getting ready for Croke Park. It was about developing a quick, direct game. The focus was a system of play to stop the better teams settling while Derry set about getting the ball to the inside forwards as quickly as possible. “Damper was probably taking a chance wed get to Croke Park and he was building for that,” McEldowney felt. “The training he set up was really intense,” McGonagle adds. When Stevensons son Rory told him of the players own decision to abstain from drink, it told him of the player-led desire to succeed. “Some of them were lads of  years of age and theyd be taking drink,” Peter remarks. “I was more concerned in coaching and getting them ready for matches. These lads took it upon themselves, very dedicated and committed...that sticks out for me.” Geoffrey speaks of the talent in the team, while McEldowney emphasised how enjoyable the season was. “We wonthe year before and did well in the All-Ireland semi-final, but the secondteam was dferent, it was something . It was a crazy enough gang and there were some headers on it,” McEldowney states. He struggled to put his finger on the exact ingredient, but it was a special group. Later, it would grow into an Ulster U title in  and later the All-Ireland B winning team. After picking up the  U champions on their way, it fed into Derrys back to back senior titles. “The likes of Gregory Biggs...hes probably the best lad you could get around a . For having the craic, but knowing when it is serious and when it is hurling time.” The traditional Ulster season for Derry minors, was a semi-final with Down followed by a crack at Antrim andyou were undercooked, the season was over almost before it began. Stevenson was dferent. He trekked Derrys crazy gang by bus to challenge games down the country over a four or five week period. “Damper knew what he was at, he knew what makes a team for the tough day out,” McEldowney said. “He knew we had a team when the rest of us didnt.” “They were all good games,” Geoffrey recalls of their preparation. “Results didnt matter, it was all about matching your performance and bettering yourself.” After one of the games, Stevenson summoned his captain to the front of the bus and instructed him to sit next to Geoffrey on the way home, with one task. “By the time the bus was back in Maghera, I needed to convince Geoffrey to stick with us . Damper was worriedthe squeeze was put on by the football camp, Geoffrey might pull out of the hurling. I done what I was told, I said he had to stick with us,” Paddy reveals. “I always gave everything to both codes,” added Geoffrey, who remembers Paddys chat and wasnt surprised. Stevenson was always thinking about the small things. Anything for the good of the team. The challenge games paid off and Down were put to the sword in the semi-final. Mickey Collins scored a hat-trick, Paddy McEldowney found the net, with McGonagle and Rory Stevenson chipping in with points. Antrim were waiting in the Ulster final and looked like they were going to end any thoughts of an Oakleaf Croke Park . PJ OMullan squeezed out - from corner forward and Jim Connolly was causing bother at wing-forward. The fancied Saffrons were in control, leading by five points at the break. “I remember the Dampercoming in at half-time and he wasnt a happy camper,” Geoffrey recalls. “He went off his head.” Man of the match McGonagle shaved the outside of the post with a goal chance and when Connolly added a second Antrim goal for a - to - lead, it was looking bleak. Derrys management made a series of switches. Mickey Blight McCloskey was sent to wing-back on Connolly, with Stevenson going to the centre. Benny Ward and Philip Hughes came into the team. “I remember saying to Seamus Dohertywe need to do something here to change the game,” Stevenson points out. Paddy McEldowney speaks of the mistake Antrim made of continuing to direct their puck-outs to the same wing, looking for Connolly, only to find an inspired McCloskey. “Mickey had some hand on him,” Geoffrey said. “He mustve caught about eight puck outs in a row and the Antrim keeper kept pucking it to him,” added McEldowney. With Derry having Antrim penned in and Biggs hitting a first Derry goal, the game began to change. Paddy McEldowney and Mickey Collins, who were getting no change from their markers, were switched. “It was like a last ditch move,” McEldowney remembers. “The first ball Mickey got, he stuck it in the net. The next ball I got, I put it over the bar and all of a sudden we were flying.” Their - in the final quarter blitzed Antrim as Derry retained their Ulster title. For McEldowney, it was indicative of the spirit in the team. “Thats why thatteam didnt give in during the Ulster final, and that we had a chance, so pushed on and kept believing,” he states. Brian McLernon presents Paddy McEldowney with the cup after Derrys  win over Antrim in Casement Park. With Kilkenny waiting in the All-Ireland series, Derry were brought back down to earth with a bang when Galway hammered them out the gate in a challenge game. “I think part of that was due to a very lax attitude,” recalls goalkeeper Joe Trolan. “That was supposed to be a weekend, but Damper didnt allow us to do anything after we got the beating. We were supposed to stay in Galway that night,” McGonagle remembers. “The whole thing was back on the bus and up the road...when we trained on the Monday night, he gave us some dogging.” With the defeat out of the system, the pep was back in the step. With the summer weather and Glens dry sod, preparations were in full swing for their crack at the All-Ireland champions. With future senior players Denis Byrne, Phily Larkin and PJ Delaney in their side, Kilkenny were three points up before Mickey McCloskeys ball from defence led to McGonagles opening score. Rory Stevenson assumed free-taking duties and a monster from well inside his own half was one of four points that day. “Barabbashardly gave PJ Delaney a puck of a ball,” Peter Stevenson remembers. Delaneys free-taking gave Kilkenny a foothold in the game, but he had a penalty saved by Rory Stevenson and cleared by McGonagle. Before half-time, Kilkenny failed to deal with Philip Hughes diagonal ball into the danger area and when Benny Ward was denied, Paddy McEldowney pulled the ball to the net. Going in at the break, Derry were well in the game. McGonagle remembers the half-time break and the blood pouring out of a cut on Sean McGlones eyebrow. As he lay on his back getting stitched up, Damper delivered his half-time words of advice. “There was no anaesthetic or anything like that,” McEldowney laughs. “Hewas only  and was some operator back then. “You had Sean Farmerat full back. He was only five foot six, but he was buck mad,” Paddy continues. “Damper wouldve worked on him, Squidgyand McGlone...he had them ready for any eventuality.” It was all part of what created the special team spirit. Now, with an All-Ireland final spot well within their grasp, this was the big picture. “Nobody expected us to beat Antrim, never mind giving Kilkenny a game,” McGonagle states. “That was the thing the Damperwas good at, he was good at motivating teams...he knew how to push the buttons.” “Damperwas at centre-half back that day, he was unreal, especially in the second half when we put the pressure on them.” Kilkenny were rattled in the second half and Phily Larkin was sent off for a strike on McGonagle. “I kept getting the ball and running at him,” remembers Geoffrey who set up Mickey Collins for Derrys second goal. “The next ball I got, I went past him and he pulled me down. When I got up he pulled the helmet off me and slapped me right in front of the referee.” Despite their stellar performance, it wasnt enough and Kilkenny held on for a three-point win on their way to retaining their title. “We were devastated, we knew we shouldve won that match. The game was there to be won,” laments McGonagle. “We had them rattled, but we just fell short.” Former Cats defender Ted Carroll, the county secretary at the time, stopped Peter Stevenson under the Hogan Stand after the final a month later. Carroll Derry for their part in Kilkenny minors success. They had poked the bear in the semi-final. Kilkenny were cocky with their heads up their arses against Derry, he told Stevenson. “I remember our conversation well,” Peter continues. “He told me how lucky Kilkenny were to come out of that with a win, that we had brought them down to earth and only for it, Tipperary wouldve beat them in the All-Ireland final.” The following year, Stevenson was back in charge, but lost to Down by four points. Geoffrey laments the loss of Gregory Biggs to injury, while also conceding that a third Ulster was beyond them. Looking back, it was a season of memories. Great days of laughter and hurling, with Cork and Kilkenny breathing a heavy sigh of relief.\",\"keywords\":\"Hurling,GAA,Peter Stevenson,Derry,kilkenny\",\"articleSection\":\"GAA\",\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"description\":\"Derry minor hurlers ran Cork close in the  All-Ireland minor semi-final.

With the Ulster title tucked away again, the following year, it was back to Croke Park where they pushed Kilkenny close. Michael McMullan spoke to some of those involved...Peter Stevenson knew his baptism as Derry minor hurling manager would be no ordinary one. Before theyd let fly on a sliotar in the  season, bridges needed mending. At the heel of the previous season, Lavey hosted Ballinascreen in the final of the South Derry minor championship. Stevenson, Derrys hurling board secretary at the time, was appointed as referee. The game wasnt finished. It was more than handbags. It was a proper rumpus. The sides had previously crossed paths in the county final and the needle boiling under the brim eventually erupted. Derry CCC handed out a blanket ban across both teams. Only Brian McCormick, who would star in Laveys All-Ireland club football campaign, was spared. googletag.cmd.push ”We didnt start training until all the suspensions were up,” Stevenson recalls of the pre-season. The Damper had applied for the job the previous year. Joe McGurk was appointed as manager, but Stevenson took over when the Lavey man stepped down at the end of . When the players arrived in the dressing room for the first step of their preparations, Stevenson laid it on the line. Club rivalry was to be left at home. They were Derry men now and cliques werent allowed. “If there were four involved in any of our drills, they had to be from dferent clubs where possible,” remembers captain Paddy McEldowney. googletag.cmd.push “He was a good manager,” said Geoffrey McGonagle. “I enjoyed him, he was good at getting the best out of everybody. He pulled everybody with him.” Without an Ulster league to shape a team for the championship cauldron, plans were hatched and buses booked for a series of challenge games down the country. Saturdays on the road helped create that special team environment. “Everybody had good time for each other, heading the one road and there for one reason,” McGonagle said. “A team is made on the bus on the way up and down,” McEldowney adds. “If the craic is good, thats the best place to keep that going.”     Thirty years on, a reunion was on the cards until social distancing put an end to that. From hearing the memories of those involved, it wouldve been mighty steam. *** After taking up a post in Dernaflaw school in , Stevenson began to spread the hurling roots to the surrounding areas. Five years earlier Liam Hinphey introduced the game in the nearby St Patricks Dungiven after finding a bag of unused hurls in a store. It helped form Dungivens club team, with Drum and Banagher later pulling away to form their own clubs. The game began to flourish as the level of coaching increased. Tom Magill had Lavey competing in and winning underage leagues in Antrim. The standard was on the rise. At St Patricks Maghera, success began to arrive with regularity and any inferiority complex in Derry hurling was fizzling out. A hammering of Cross and Passion Ballycastle in  brought a fourth Mageean Cup of the decade. Joe McGurk played Geoffrey, a fourth year, at centre-forward, to feed an attack that tore their opponents to pieces, after they hammered Garron Tower in the semi-final. “There was a three-year period when we were winning everything,” Paddy McEldowney outlines. “We had won an U hurling championshipwith the club around that time. Then it was straight into another MacRory and Hogan campaign before we hooked up with the minor hurlers.” Joe McGurk had Screen man Pat Joe McKenna with him and later added his brother Collie to the setup. It was a rush to get a team pulled together after the  Hogan Cup final needed a replay for Maghera to see of St Jarlaths. It took a goal from for a rusty Derry to see off Down, - to -, in the semi-final at the Athletic Grounds. “That  team was a heavily fancied team...more so than the following year, when there wasnt the same expectation” McEldowney states. “Big Ollie , Brian McCormick and Hugh Mullan were among the older players, but at least half of the team were underage the next year.” In the final, Rory Stevenson blotted out Antrim dangerman PJ OMullan in a - to - victory. Two Paddy McEldowney goals helped Derry out of the blocks. After hooking his marker, he pulled to the net midway through the first half. Collins also hit a brace of goals in a comfortable win. McGonagle plucked a ball in the first five minutes only for an Antrim hurl to follow through and break his thumb. When the adrenaline subsided after the game, the pain knocked him for six. McGonagle had to get it strapped up for the following Sunday, a two-point win in the Ulster minor football final at Clones. On the hurling front, it was off to Croke Park to take on a Cork team that contained  All-Ireland senior winning captain Mark Landers and Kevin Murray, who came on in the final. The  Derry minor team pictured before their All-Ireland semi-final defeat to Cork in Croke Park. Only two points separated the teams at half-time, with a goal from Michael Collins boosting Derry’s confidence. Goalkeeper Fergal McNally made a number of fine saves, with points from Collins , McCormick and Malachy McKenna keeping Derry ticking over at the other end. The Oakleafers, who lost McGonagle to injury after the interval, were left to also rue a number of missed chances which might have left things more interesting in what was a - to - defeat, with Cork losing out to the Cats in the final, after a replay. *** The  chapter was one of commitment and talent, bound together by team spirit built by Stevensons trips down the country. With the bad blood between Lavey and Screen buried, the training sessions – mainly at Glen and Slaughtneil – began to sharpen the skills. Paddy McEldowney, now the captain, remembers how Stevenson didnt even focus on Down or Antrim. It was all about getting ready for Croke Park. It was about developing a quick, direct game. The focus was a system of play to stop the better teams settling while Derry set about getting the ball to the inside forwards as quickly as possible. “Damper was probably taking a chance wed get to Croke Park and he was building for that,” McEldowney felt. “The training he set up was really intense,” McGonagle adds. When Stevensons son Rory told him of the players own decision to abstain from drink, it told him of the player-led desire to succeed. “Some of them were lads of  years of age and theyd be taking drink,” Peter remarks. “I was more concerned in coaching and getting them ready for matches. These lads took it upon themselves, very dedicated and committed...that sticks out for me.” Geoffrey speaks of the talent in the team, while McEldowney emphasised how enjoyable the season was. “We wonthe year before and did well in the All-Ireland semi-final, but the secondteam was dferent, it was something . It was a crazy enough gang and there were some headers on it,” McEldowney states. He struggled to put his finger on the exact ingredient, but it was a special group. Later, it would grow into an Ulster U title in  and later the All-Ireland B winning team. After picking up the  U champions on their way, it fed into Derrys back to back senior titles. “The likes of Gregory Biggs...hes probably the best lad you could get around a . For having the craic, but knowing when it is serious and when it is hurling time.” The traditional Ulster season for Derry minors, was a semi-final with Down followed by a crack at Antrim andyou were undercooked, the season was over almost before it began. Stevenson was dferent. He trekked Derrys crazy gang by bus to challenge games down the country over a four or five week period. “Damper knew what he was at, he knew what makes a team for the tough day out,” McEldowney said. “He knew we had a team when the rest of us didnt.” “They were all good games,” Geoffrey recalls of their preparation. “Results didnt matter, it was all about matching your performance and bettering yourself.” After one of the games, Stevenson summoned his captain to the front of the bus and instructed him to sit next to Geoffrey on the way home, with one task. “By the time the bus was back in Maghera, I needed to convince Geoffrey to stick with us . Damper was worriedthe squeeze was put on by the football camp, Geoffrey might pull out of the hurling. I done what I was told, I said he had to stick with us,” Paddy reveals. “I always gave everything to both codes,” added Geoffrey, who remembers Paddys chat and wasnt surprised. Stevenson was always thinking about the small things. Anything for the good of the team. The challenge games paid off and Down were put to the sword in the semi-final. Mickey Collins scored a hat-trick, Paddy McEldowney found the net, with McGonagle and Rory Stevenson chipping in with points. Antrim were waiting in the Ulster final and looked like they were going to end any thoughts of an Oakleaf Croke Park . PJ OMullan squeezed out - from corner forward and Jim Connolly was causing bother at wing-forward. The fancied Saffrons were in control, leading by five points at the break. “I remember the Dampercoming in at half-time and he wasnt a happy camper,” Geoffrey recalls. “He went off his head.” Man of the match McGonagle shaved the outside of the post with a goal chance and when Connolly added a second Antrim goal for a - to - lead, it was looking bleak. Derrys management made a series of switches. Mickey Blight McCloskey was sent to wing-back on Connolly, with Stevenson going to the centre. Benny Ward and Philip Hughes came into the team. “I remember saying to Seamus Dohertywe need to do something here to change the game,” Stevenson points out. Paddy McEldowney speaks of the mistake Antrim made of continuing to direct their puck-outs to the same wing, looking for Connolly, only to find an inspired McCloskey. “Mickey had some hand on him,” Geoffrey said. “He mustve caught about eight puck outs in a row and the Antrim keeper kept pucking it to him,” added McEldowney. With Derry having Antrim penned in and Biggs hitting a first Derry goal, the game began to change. Paddy McEldowney and Mickey Collins, who were getting no change from their markers, were switched. “It was like a last ditch move,” McEldowney remembers. “The first ball Mickey got, he stuck it in the net. The next ball I got, I put it over the bar and all of a sudden we were flying.” Their - in the final quarter blitzed Antrim as Derry retained their Ulster title. For McEldowney, it was indicative of the spirit in the team. “Thats why thatteam didnt give in during the Ulster final, and that we had a chance, so pushed on and kept believing,” he states. Brian McLernon presents Paddy McEldowney with the cup after Derrys  win over Antrim in Casement Park. With Kilkenny waiting in the All-Ireland series, Derry were brought back down to earth with a bang when Galway hammered them out the gate in a challenge game. “I think part of that was due to a very lax attitude,” recalls goalkeeper Joe Trolan. “That was supposed to be a weekend, but Damper didnt allow us to do anything after we got the beating. We were supposed to stay in Galway that night,” McGonagle remembers. “The whole thing was back on the bus and up the road...when we trained on the Monday night, he gave us some dogging.” With the defeat out of the system, the pep was back in the step. With the summer weather and Glens dry sod, preparations were in full swing for their crack at the All-Ireland champions. With future senior players Denis Byrne, Phily Larkin and PJ Delaney in their side, Kilkenny were three points up before Mickey McCloskeys ball from defence led to McGonagles opening score. Rory Stevenson assumed free-taking duties and a monster from well inside his own half was one of four points that day. “Barabbashardly gave PJ Delaney a puck of a ball,” Peter Stevenson remembers. Delaneys free-taking gave Kilkenny a foothold in the game, but he had a penalty saved by Rory Stevenson and cleared by McGonagle. Before half-time, Kilkenny failed to deal with Philip Hughes diagonal ball into the danger area and when Benny Ward was denied, Paddy McEldowney pulled the ball to the net. Going in at the break, Derry were well in the game. McGonagle remembers the half-time break and the blood pouring out of a cut on Sean McGlones eyebrow. As he lay on his back getting stitched up, Damper delivered his half-time words of advice. “There was no anaesthetic or anything like that,” McEldowney laughs. “Hewas only  and was some operator back then. “You had Sean Farmerat full back. He was only five foot six, but he was buck mad,” Paddy continues. “Damper wouldve worked on him, Squidgyand McGlone...he had them ready for any eventuality.” It was all part of what created the special team spirit. Now, with an All-Ireland final spot well within their grasp, this was the big picture. “Nobody expected us to beat Antrim, never mind giving Kilkenny a game,” McGonagle states. “That was the thing the Damperwas good at, he was good at motivating teams...he knew how to push the buttons.” “Damperwas at centre-half back that day, he was unreal, especially in the second half when we put the pressure on them.” Kilkenny were rattled in the second half and Phily Larkin was sent off for a strike on McGonagle. “I kept getting the ball and running at him,” remembers Geoffrey who set up Mickey Collins for Derrys second goal. “The next ball I got, I went past him and he pulled me down. When I got up he pulled the helmet off me and slapped me right in front of the referee.” Despite their stellar performance, it wasnt enough and Kilkenny held on for a three-point win on their way to retaining their title. “We were devastated, we knew we shouldve won that match. The game was there to be won,” laments McGonagle. “We had them rattled, but we just fell short.” Former Cats defender Ted Carroll, the county secretary at the time, stopped Peter Stevenson under the Hogan Stand after the final a month later. Carroll Derry for their part in Kilkenny minors success. They had poked the bear in the semi-final. Kilkenny were cocky with their heads up their arses against Derry, he told Stevenson. “I remember our conversation well,” Peter continues. “He told me how lucky Kilkenny were to come out of that with a win, that we had brought them down to earth and only for it, Tipperary wouldve beat them in the All-Ireland final.” The following year, Stevenson was back in charge, but lost to Down by four points. Geoffrey laments the loss of Gregory Biggs to injury, while also conceding that a third Ulster was beyond them. Looking back, it was a season of memories. Great days of laughter and hurling, with Cork and Kilkenny breathing a heavy sigh of relief.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The shutting of the outlet at Lisnagelvin Shopping Centre is one of  stores earmarked for closure across Scotland, Northern Ireland and the North East of England. The companys other store in the city at Foyleside Shopping Centre on the cityside is to remain open. The closures have been prompted by ongoing challenges to high street trading, which have been exacerbated by the Covid- pandemic. Semichem, which is owned by community retailer Scotmid Co-operative, said it was in talks with landlords in several locations and would make a final decision on a small number of the  stores in the coming months. googletag.cmd.push A total of  Semichem staff have now entered a formal consultation process. Management at Scotmid Co-operative, owners of Semichem, said they were exploring opportunities to redeploy as many as possible within its wider business. Karen Scott, head of Semichem, said: “The high street was already struggling to adapt to the pace of change in shopping habits, including out-of-town developments and the rise of internet shopping. That change has undoubtedly been accelerated by the Covid- pandemic. Sadly, we have reached the point where it is no longer viable to keep some of our stores open. “We are grateful for both Scotmid and subsequent government sup- port, which has undoubtedly prolonged the le of many stores. Our priority now is to support affected colleagues at this dficult time. googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Candystripes remain rooted to the bottom of the Premier Division following Saturday’s - defeat to Waterford at the Brandywell. McJannett’s first goal for the club was in vain as goals from Shane Grfin and Oscar Brennan gave the visitors their first win, goals which were gted to the Blues by their hosts. City’s generosity at the back leaves them with no points from their opening two fixtures for the first time since , and McJannett admitted that Derry had no-one to blame but themselves, holding his own hands up for his part in the second Waterford goal. googletag.cmd.push “We played quite well all in all but the goals we gave away are unforgivable,” he said. “They were just sloppy. We gave away a free kick and it’s gone in and then the second goal is unforgivable from my part and it’s a penalty. For all the good work, we’ve just thrown it away. It is hard to believe we’ve lost but when you look at the goals we gave away, they were as poor as you can get. We can’t say anything.” McJannett scored his first goal for the club on his th appearance as a Candystripe. He is the first defender to score City’s first goal in a season since Armin Aganovic back in , also against Waterford, but the versatile defender was not celebrating despite the long wait coming to an end. googletag.cmd.push “Yeah, at long last, but I don’t mean to be negative, but it feels a bit pointless at the minute because of the loss and the mistake for the goal,” he admitted. “At the time it felt nice and to get back in the game at that time. At the time I was very relieved because I felt partly to blame for the first goal as well. To get that literally with the last kick of the first half, it was a nice feeling but obviously in the second half it was a dferent story.” Daunting double City travel to Inchicore on Friday night and that is quickly followed by a home game against Shamrock Rovers next Tuesday, a daunting double for any team. St. Pat’s are steadily improving under Stephen O’Donnell, and sit in third place having won two of three games so far, while champions Shamrock Rovers have not lost a league game since September , a run of  league games.     Yet McJannett firmly believes that Derry City can respond to take points from both games, insisting that the improved attacking display against Waterford shows that the team is heading in the right direction. “We haven’t got any points from two games but we’ve said we’re sticking together and I’m sure we’ll start getting results,” he continued. “If we can play anything like that and cut out the goals we give away, then we’ll start getting points. It will be hard but we’re sticking together and we know thatwe perform like that we’ll get results. I know St. Pat’s and Rovers are good teams but that’s not to say we can’t beat them and start climbing the table.” Poor results generally set the mood around the club and amongst the fans, and McJannett knows the importance of a positive result in the coming days. “I know everyone will look at the result and heads will be down but the performance was good,” he added. “On another day the chances go in and we take them but we have to start taking our chanceswe are to have any chance of getting higher in the table this season.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

There will also be a new traffic control barrier at Castle Avenue.Caravan spaces will be relocated with the feature entrance gates at the Castle Avenue entrance restored, alongside the restoration of The Grange courtyard buildings and the reconstruction of a derelict building block.The parkrsquos th century greenhouse is also being restored with the reconstruction of the propagation house and cold frames, while one of several outbuildings will be converted to an office and volunteer space.Elsewhere, visitor facilities will be created in the Stove Conservatory including an interpretation centre, with a  lt installed to provide access to the terrance for people with reduced mobility.Since , the local authority has been progressing with plans to restore the natural and built heritage of the forest park with several key stakeholders including Forest Service.The councilrsquos vision is to create a heritage-led destination which protects the heritage of Castlewellan Forest Park for future generations, whilst also providing opportunities for local people and visitors to learn more about the landscape.The lsquoRe-rooting our past in the Future: Castlewellan Historic Demesnersquo project will connect people with the built and natural heritage within the forest park, as well as restore and celebrate its unique bioersity.This includes the restoration of a living arboretum, containing some of the most signicant collection of trees and shrubs on the island of Ireland.As part of the project, the Grange will be developed into a visitor core with the creation of a welcome centre, community space and cafeacute facilities, with the Courtyards transformed into a vibrant visitor hub and dedicated centre for community use with interpretation, activities, events, environmental education and skills development.In addition, the landscape will be conserved and managed sensitively, protecting its plant collection and important bioersity.Council chairwoman Laura Devlin said the flagship project has been designed to deliver the local authorityrsquos vision of transforming the picturesque forest park into a ldquodynamic, heritage-led destination, restoring, celebrating and interpreting the natural and built heritage of the historic demesne.And she paid tribute to members of a task-board that has supported the development of the project since .ldquoI live in Castlewellan and have been on the task-board from day one and am delighted that the council has received this financial support,she said. ldquoI look forward to the delivery of the project as it will generate local economic, social and environmental benefits.As the former demesne of the Annesley family, the forest park is steeped in natural and built heritage dating back to s.The park is an integral part of the Castlewellan community and provides locals and visitors with recreational space for outdoor activities such as, cycling, horse riding, fishing on the lake, canoeing and orienteering.At the heart of the park is the arboretum and walled Annesley Garden, the latter which provides a central focal point for the National Arboretum with the pound.m investment package designed to re-establish the historical nature of the planting in the arboretum.The Heritage Fundrsquos Northern Ireland Director, Paul Mullan, said landscapes and nature ldquoform the bedrock of our culture and heritage, improving wellbeing, sparking curiosity, and protecting and providing for the communities surrounding and inhabiting them.He continued: ldquoNational Lottery players have highlighted natural heritage as especially important, which is why we are proud to award Newry, Mourne and Down Council a grant to create a heritage-led destination at Castlewellan Historic Demesne.ldquoThe Heritage Fund is incredibly proud to be playing a role in ensuring our natural heritage is safeguarded for generations to come, but also that the projects we fund give people the chance to connect with the nature that is on their doorsteps.Council officials say it is widely acknowledged that parks and open spaces play a hugely important role in supporting local communities, both in terms of providing recreational space, but also for supporting health and wellbeing.They add: ldquoAs we move towards recovery from Covid, the implementation of this project is timely and will benefit the citizens of the district through reconnecting people with their heritage, community and nature creating a safe, vibrant welcoming park for all..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/31Mar2021-50.jpg","title":"50 not out as Jeff clocks half century at Dundrum  ","story":"JEFF Maguirersquos love affair with cricket started  years ago.The Dundrum Cricket Club stalwart says itrsquos a love story which ranks second only to that with his family.Jeff says he is proud of the journey which has blessed him with friendships for le. These affinities were formed all across the globe, from as far away as India, Sri Lanka, Australia and across the island of Ireland.ldquoItrsquos hard to believe that I am  years going to the Meadow at Dundrum Cricket Club and I still get a buzz when going through the new gates, says Jeff.ldquoI can still remember playing in the winning side in the Downshire Cup final at the best new ground in the Northern Cricket Union at Strangford Road in Downpatrick.Jeffrsquos Dundrum side defeated Downpatrick Cricket Club, with his brother Noel scoring  odd to defeat a strong home side that featured superb players, including Alfie Linehan, Noel Ferguson and Jim Patterson, who all played for Ireland, Alfiersquos brother, Hugh, who Jeff believes should have been capped, and superb all rounder Brian Ferris.Jeff reminisces fondly of that game. ldquoI got to play in front of a decent crowd alongside two of the best club players our village ever produced, one being my brother Noel and the other being Alan Neill. I remember going to bed a little tipsy, the true version would not be believed long before the snowflake culture.Jeff proudly captained the first team for seven seasons, winning back-to-back McGready Cup finals at Dundrum after beating North West Cricket Union teams Bonds Glen and The Nedd.ldquoBoth games had a fantastic atmosphere. They brought a full  seater bus packed with refreshments and both teams stayed long into the night at the Bay Inn as they enjoyed the village hospitality.However, there were hard times for Dundrum as Jeff recalls a second arson attack against the club  years ago.ldquoIt simply showed the fighting character of the committee and members. I wrote lots of begging letters and phone calls for help, he recalled.ldquoI got a massive shock when I received a cheque made out to myself for pound, from the Foundation of Sports and Arts. I give special thanks to former Australian player James Burston for his input.The club received a further pound, from Down District Council and used local firm Seamus Walsh and Sons to build the excellent present pavilion at the cost of pound,, signying the start of rebuilding the club in every aspect.Paying homage to the clubrsquos ground staff who Jeff calls ldquothe real stalwarts, he gives praise to Tommy Curlett , who has looked after the square for over  years. Over the last decade, Tommyrsquos brother, Jack, has also been assisting, with Jeff mentioning Jack as ldquoone of the clubrsquos best ever all rounders.Jeff also applauded two more Curlett brothers, Bobby and Jim, who built the superb new electric score box free of charge.Also earning praise is new treasurer Stephen Calvert, who Jeff describes as the ldquodriving force behind the scenes, displaying fantastic forward thinking and planning everything down to the last detail.He continued: ldquoStephen now prepares the wickets, and I have never seen a harder worker in my le.

Itrsquos a point that anglers disagree with.DERA explained the work on the banks of the river created two dedicated disabled parking spaces in the car park where previously there had been none and that it is not satisfactory for disabled anglers to make their way to access current angling facilities located away from the car park.A spokesman for Downpatrick anglers said they are pleased that consideration is now being given to providing two new dedicated disabled fishing stands.ldquoWe welcome DAERArsquos confirmation that officials are also keen to meet with us to discuss our concerns which is an important step forward, he said.ldquoThe fact that the rights of disabled anglers at the Quoile River are now being recognised is also a welcome step forward. Redeveloping the car park and providing disabled parking spaces but no area for those with mobility issues to fish from was an error which now looks as though it is going to be rectied.The spokesman said he hopes that DAERA will also inform Newry, Mourne and Down Council about the plan to now provide disabled fishing stands at the riverbank car park.ldquoWe would hope councillors are informed via email or letter so there is a record of the commitment to carry out this work, he said.ldquoMoving forward, we believe that there is a need for DAERA and the Environment Agency to join forces to develop a training programme for their respective staff on how to handle the needs of disabled anglers in particular.The spokesman said lessons need to be learned from the Quoile River debacle and hopes that everyone involved can now move forward in partnership.ldquoDisabled anglers have been stopped coming to the river to fish for over a year since work to redevelop the car park got underway. Had the needs of disabled anglers been uppermost in the minds of government officials at the planning stage, it would not have taken  months to reach the point we are now thankfully at, he said.ldquoEveryone associated with Downpatrick Anglers is looking forward to seeing the new fishing stands in place soon and the welcomeof disabled anglers. They are part and parcel of the fishing community and must enjoy equal rights when it comes to their support.The spokesman added: ldquoAs we have always said, fishing is very therapeutic and we would strongly argue that the provision of new disabled angling stands on the banks of the Quoile should be a priority and will be of tremendous benefit..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/31Mar2021-Shirley.jpg","title":"Fountain Foodbank thanks public for help in lockdown  ","story":"THE Fountain Foodbank is continuing with its vital role in supporting families across the district.A year after going into lockdown, the cross-community organisation based in Downpatrick mdash staffed by committed volunteers mdash continues to meet a pressing need.In its latest newsletter, the foodbank says it continues to be extremely well supported by local people and organisations and that every penny it receives makes a dference.Shirley Lennon, the foodbankrsquos co-ordinator, has revealed that decisions regarding how the organisation could operate during a global pandemic had to be made quickly to deal with the evolving situation and continually revised as time moved on.She explained that initially, the foodbank operated a lsquodrive-thrursquo service which soon had to be replaced with a delivery service for the first period of lockdown.ldquoWe were grateful to many younger people who helped with both the packing and delivery of these parcels.

These workers are not using buses or cars and it is good financially that they donrsquot have to pay for car parking or fuel. And for Downpatrick, there will be dozens more people on the streets in the town, bring lots of benefits.Mr McGrath also acknowledged that the move towards regional hubs could result in empty office space in and around Belfast where a huge number of civl servants were traditionally based.ldquoThatrsquos the challenge mdash to repurpose those buildings mdash but we certainly cannot have vacant government buildings in the city centre being held on to for five,  or  years, he continued.The local MLA also believes that moving civil servants away from Belfast could provide an economic spin-offs for towns like Downpatrick.He added: ldquoIrsquom a fan of decentralisation in the public sector. It guarantees footfall in regional towns and that brings fairness to the rate and taxpayer. They get the benefits of having a workforce near them, especially the hospitality and retail businesses.ldquoIf you have  or  civil servants there they will spend a certain amount of money every week

eight pumps, convenience shop with deli counter, canopy and underground storage tanks.The proposal also features three electric vehicle charging points, car parking for  vehicles, a jet wash, play area, landscaping and site and access works.Planning papers confirm that the site will be accessed off the Magheraknock Road with the proposed development offering over  car parking spaces, four of which will be reserved for disabled drivers and another two for mothers and toddlers.The papers say that due to the ldquomodest scale of the development and low numbers of cars generated, it is not anticipated that the development will have any detrimental impact on noise and air quality of the surrounding environment.Planning permission for a filling station, shop and car wash was previously granted for the development site in , with the planning papers outlining the proposed play area will be located at the south western boundary of the site and lead to a new pedestrian connection from the site to an existing footpath along the Ballynahinch Road.This has been designed to allow children within surrounding residential developments to use the play equipment.The planning papers say previous planning permission for  square metres of retail space is insufficient to meet the needs of the local neighbourhood which is devoid of local retail provision.ldquoThe application represents

course, we have always been very proud of our current, semi-permanent building, which was begun in  mdash financed by parents on a bank loan mdash and which has grown with us through  years, Mr Lambe continued.ldquoIt will, in many ways, be a sad day to see that building come down. However, important though excellent facilities are, the core of a school is the student, staff, parent and governor body and they deserve a new building to match the commitment, enthusiasm and of course the Integrated ethos which drives this school.Mr Lambe thanked the Department of Education and the technical team behind the new school for the energy and creativity they have brought to the project.He also extended gratitude to Newry, Mourne and Down Council for addressing the schoolrsquos application for planning permission.Mr Lambe added: ldquoWe are particularly excited that the sports facilities for the new school will be shared with our local community and all the community partners who already meet in Shimna.Shimna College currently shares its sports halls, grounds and main building with a number of local groups and in  celebrated its th anniversary with its need for new accommodation one of a number of projects earmarked for financial support in the Fresh Start Agreement.The hugely successful integrated college opened in September  with just  pupils, but has since grown to become of Northern Irelandrsquos leading schools.However, the current school does not meet its needs or the standards specied in the current Department of Education Secondary School handbook.In February , education officials approved a development proposal to redevelop the integrated college to deliver a modern, post-primary school capable of accommodating the increased demand for integrated education in the area.The planning papers due to be formally approved next week outline a proposal to build ultra-modern accommodation to the east of the current school, with new sports accommodation extending to the west, encompassing part of the footprint of the existing school.A new single storey sports suite will extend from the schoolrsquos northwestern elevation of the new buildings and includes a hall, gym, fitness area and ancillary accommodation with the main school building intentionally designed to allow Shimna College to continue operating during construction work on the new-build.It is understood that phase one will focus on the construction of the main school building, excluding the proposed new sports provision. All of the existing school will be bulldozed when the new-build is complete, apart from the existing sports hall.It is believed that this part of the current post-primary building will only be razed to the ground when work on the new sports facilities have been completed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/31Mar2021-Soccer.jpg","title":"Soccer action to make comeback  ","story":"LOCAL soccer clubs are in preparation after the resumption of training was given the green light.The Stormont Executive announced a plannedto training from April .Celtic Bhoys FC, Downpatrick and Killough FC are among the local clubs which have welcomed the news with open arms following a frustrating last few months.Celtic Bhoys FC have been working hard behind the scenes to prepare for training to take place at their newly built Ballyhornan facility.Club chairman Patrick Moore said: ldquoWe are really excited to be able to start afresh this season and make the most of our new state of the art G pitch and clubroom at Ballyhornan.ldquoWe will aim to maximise this as a community hub for local people and families throughout the coming year and we firmly believe this will provide a  for the club to grow and prosper in the post Covid- world.He continued: ldquoThere is no doubt that this has been an extremely dficult year for so many, particular those who have lost loved ones as a result of the pandemic.ldquoThe club is excited to have the opportunity to once again provide sporting and social activities to young and old in the local community.

The highest recorded speed was an eye-watering mph at Camlough.The number of drivers detected travelling at mph over the past three months by the seven speed indicator devices has reduced from  during April, May and June to  mdash a reduction of .%. The average percentage of cars travelling in excess of mph has also decreased slightly.Additional speed indicators are due to be erected at the Dundrum Road in Clough, Downpatrick Road in Ardglass and Ballynahinchrsquos Saintfield Road, with the PCSP planning to install seven more during the new financial year.But demand for the devices is high with a total of  requests lodged with the PCSP for them to be provided in the Downpatrick, Rowallane, Slieve Croob and Mournes district electoral areas.South Down MLA Colin McGrath and Mournes councillor Willie Clarke have expressed concern that some drivers are continue to speed in built-up areas but have welcomed confirmation that overall, speeding in a number of hot spot areas is decreasing.Mr McGrath described the speeds recorded at the Strangford Road in Downpatrick as ldquohorric and chilling.He continued: ldquoWhata local resident or child was to step onto this busy road  The footpaths are narrow in places, the lighting in the area is poor and residents are at times walking and driving in fear for their lives.ldquoSuch high speeds will not help allay their fears and I will be writing to the PSNI and asking for regular speed checks on this road to regulate the speed and ensure residentsrsquo safety.Cllr Clarke said while some of the speeds are very worrying, he said the data recorded by the speed indicator devices provides police with the information about where they need to be and at what time to catch those who are breaking the law and putting other road users and pedestrians at risk.ldquoI welcome the reduction in speed which the data reveals, but more needs to be done. Police now have the data they need to catch offenders and this is something that many people want to see happening, he continued.Cllr Clarke said the Department for Infrastructure also has a role to play in helping address the speeding issue.ldquoThe speed devices are having an impact and with plans for many more across the district, it is important that the critical data they provide will enable the authorities to apprehend those who are not only breaking the law, but placing themselves, other road users and pedestrians at risk, he added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/31Mar2021-Strangford.jpg","title":"Strangford it’s like nowhere else on earth  ","story":"STUNNING Strangford Lough features prominently in a new Sunday Times guide with the area regarded as one of the three best places to live in Northern Ireland.While the accolade will not come as a major surprise to those who live and work on both sides of the internationally acclaimed waterway, the arearsquos recognition by one of the UK and Irelandrsquos top selling Sundays is nonetheless extremely noteworthy.While Holywood has been named as the top place to live in Northern Ireland in the Sunday Times Best Places to Live guide mdash ahead of Magherafelt mdash local focus will rightly be on Strangford Loughrsquos inclusion in the top three.The Sunday Timesrsquos expert judges behind the guide assess a wide range of factors, from schools, air quality, transport and broadband speeds to culture, green spaces and the health of the high street.They look for improving towns, villages or city centres, for attractive, well designed homes and locations bursting with community spirit which the coronavirus pandemic has shown to be the most vital quality of all.Of Strangford, the judges said: ldquoLive in Strangford, Portaferry or any of the villages around this beautul island-studded lough and yoursquove got unbeatable wildle and scenery on the doorstep ndash and itrsquos even betteryou can get out on the water.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe road would link Sycamore Cross on the A with Junction  of the M. A -week public consultation last year raised concerns about the impact on the environment and local communities.Responding to those concerns, the Vale of Glamorgan council has now said transport planners must analyse further how the road would fit in with the new context of Covid- and the climate emergency.In a report to the councilrsquos cabinet, which meets on Monday, March , detailed responses were given to the main concerns raised in the consultation. The cabinet will be asked to approve further analysis, before moving on to writing up a full business case for the road.The case for the road is to improve transport across the region, including to Cardf Airport, St Athanrsquos Enterprise Zone, and new housing developments. It would likely cost around pound million to build, and is dependent on funding from the Welsh Government.However, the proposals have drawn criticism from villagers in Pendoylan whose houses would be knocked down, cyclists using country lanes which could be blocked off, and Coed Cymru which has warned ancient woodland would be felled to make way for the road.Two options for the new road were consulted on: one to the east of Pendoylan and one to the west. The report revealed transport planners are edging towards the western route, as it is better value for money than the eastern one.As well as suggesting further analysis, the cabinet report addressed the main concerns including the impact on the climate, environment, walkers and cyclists, and uncertain future of the financially struggling Cardf Airport.On cycling, the new road would include a segregated lsquoactive travel routersquo for cyclists and walkers, the report said. Country lanes blocked off could have bridges or underpasses for walkers and cyclists to cross the new road.     MORE NEWS:The report said: ldquoThere is currently poor infrastructure and local connectivity by walking and cycling through the study area, and there is potential to implement new cycle connections. An active travel route is an integral component of the concept options.ldquoShould a preferred option progress to the next stage of assessment and a need to block the lanes confirmed, access for non-motorised users to safely cross under or over the bypass would be accommodated as part of the design.On climate change, campaigners raised concerns a new road would increase private car journeys and carbon emissions.Both the Welsh Government and the Vale council declared a climate emergency in , pledging to reduce carbon emissions in an effort to prevent catastrophic increases in global temperatures.A big part of the plan to reduce emissions in Wales is changing how people travel: fewer journeys in private cars and more by walking, cycling and in public transport.The report said further analysis would include a lsquocarbon assessment and climate resiliencersquo report, and would explore how to reduce the carbon impact of the road.It did not mention what these methods could include.Several areas of ancient woodland would have ldquovery large adverse impacts according to the report. But further assessment would examine the exact effects of the loss of that woodland.The report said: ldquoThe environmental assessment would examine the loss of woodland in terms of its use in flood retention, water quality, social value, carbon capture, landscape value and cultural heritage value, as well as its value to bioersity.If the ldquovery large adverse impacts canrsquot be avoided by redesigning the road, new trees could be planted where to compensate for the loss of ancient woodland.This would include moving and replanting some of the old trees and soil.The next stage would also include a wider, detailed environmental impact assessment, and recommendations on how to mitigate potential impacts on the environment surrounding the proposed road.Another concern raised has been the uncertain future of Cardf Airport, which was recently bailed out by the Welsh Government with a pound. million grant.But transport planners pointed to plans to make it easier to get to the airport on foot, by bike, bus, train, and in private motor vehicles.The cabinet report said: ldquoWhile recognising that the basis of future studies would increasingly need to consider the emerging trends and patterns resulting from Covid-, it is understood that the long-term vision of the airport remains at this present time.Responding to the report, campaigners have renewed calls for the Vale council to scrap the plans for the road altogether.A spokesperson for Vale Communities for Future Generations said: ldquoWhy the Vale of Glamorgan council is persisting in wasting public money on keeping this outdated road plan alive is hard to understand. The sheer volume of recent objections to the proposal clearly indicates the public has other priorities.ldquoThe original  Vale council assumption was that the road was needed for better vehicle access to Cardf Airport mdash which was denied by the airport management.ldquoSince then the airportrsquos passenger numbers have shrunk, millions of pounds of public money has been spent by the Welsh Government on propping it up financially and the future of air travel globally is uncertain post Covid  pandemic.ldquoThese are hardly the circumstances under which to continue promoting an expensive and environmentally destructive road building plan that was developed before the Vale of Glamorgan council and the Welsh Government declared a climate emergency in .ldquoIt is time for this plan to be recognised as a prime example of outdated thinking, and finally scrapped so that Vale of Glamorgan council can prioritise spending on environmentally sound projects. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

That passing trade is something we rely on, and wersquore blessed to be in a great location.ldquoThe problem is, when people have a drink they forget about social distancing.\"Asked what he thinks of the latest changes, he said: ldquoItrsquos so important we try and get open outdoors as quickly as we can, more so for people in more remote areas where people are unlikely to drop by for a takeaway.     ldquoFor the good of the industry we need the beer gardens to open as soon as possible. I canrsquot see any reason why that wouldnrsquot be being spoken about now.ldquoPerhaps therersquos something we donrsquot know. If that is the case, then come out and say it because none of us want a third wave ndash that would kill businesses. The critical thing is we can have an uninterrupted summer.Is he expecting the high numbers some of his customers are predicting this weekend ldquoYes, probably ndash there has been a buzz since they let people travel locally, so Irsquod expect another rise in numbers again.ldquoWe need to be careful for our residents. We are a public service and we donrsquot want to cause trouble. Traders have got to remember that.Residents and friends Tracey Scott and Debra Cooper have enjoyed visiting the unusually quiet beach at weekdays through the pandemic, but said they will avoid the seafront this weekend.ldquoI hope people continue to be weary, Ms Scott, who lives alone at her home in Llandough, said. ldquoBut it seems to me recently people have stopped social distancing as much.ldquoI come here with friends and family sometimes three times a week, but I have to avoid it on weekends now.ldquoThere are just hordes of people not keeping to social distancing rules. Itrsquos a great shame.ldquoI walked with my mother here not long ago and was being bumped into by people. I canrsquot put myself at risk, and I canrsquot put others at risk.ldquoItrsquos so dficult because I live alone and I keep away from people Irsquod very much like to hug. Then someone comes and brushes past me. I know it sounds odd, but you do feel almost violated when that happens.ldquoItrsquos dficult, because I really do want the businesses to thrive here and I would like to support them on the weekends.ldquoMy message to people would be lsquogive it time, and letrsquos play it safe ndash donrsquot all rush at oncersquo.Ms Scottrsquos son and his partner, in their twenties, are also avoiding weekend trips to the seafront due to her son having asthma.Ms Cooper said: ldquoFor months now Irsquove only gone out in the week because it gets so busy. Itrsquos strange ndash the nice weather comes and the residents keep out the way.Hugh Pickford, who owns Pickfordrsquos Gallery and Bar With Rooms on the seafront, says he feels for residents, and itrsquos become dficult for traders to police overcrowding.ldquoItrsquos probably bred by us not being able to open indoors and police the situation ourselves, he said.Social distancing signs remain after the road had to be temporarily closed due to people packing the Esplanade over ChristmasldquoAt the moment people come and get a takeaway and go across the road. The problem is thatrsquos what everyone is doing. It doesnrsquot look great at times. But what can we do ldquoOver Christmas it looked almost like a carnival atmosphere to be honest.ldquoIrsquod like to look on the bright side. The seafront has really seen a revival in the last couple of years. Even at am now Piotr at Stol Coffee draws a crowd here. Itrsquos nice to see.That revival is continuing this weekend too as a new cafeacute opens inside the Pier Pavilion.The new rules mean the Pickfords can open their rooms to all people in Wales again.Hugh PickfordldquoWersquove not had much interest at the moment in the rooms, he said. ldquoPeople booked for April and then cancelled when they realised it was room service only. People donrsquot seem to want to eat off the premises or in their rooms, so thatrsquos hitting us a bit.ldquoWersquore looking forward to the summer. With staycation season likely to be ahead of us, it should be a great place to be.What you saidResidents have been responding when asked what they thought of the new changes.Jo Broad, from Blackwood, predicted: ldquoPeople will go crazy. Of course we need our lives back or at least some sort of normality. The beaches will be full again.ldquoLetrsquos hope people will be sensible, not go crazy, and letrsquos hope for safety, or I think there might be a summer lockdown coming.Newport resident Lisa Edwards said: ldquoPeople need to stop hiding behind the government. We are in charge of our own destiny and we have to resume some normality.ldquoTo do this, we need to be allowed to resume living, but sensibly.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityMonday, April , marks the official ftieth birthday of Chapter Arts Centre in Cardf.The multi-artform venue was the first of its kind in Wales.CEO of Chapter, Andy Eagle said: ldquoChapter was originally set up by a community of artists and that remains its foundation and principal purpose. Itrsquos an eclectic and fascinating place that has, over the last fty years, evolved to be welcoming and inclusive to many dferent types of peopleChapter Arts Centre came to le thanks to the driving force of writer Mik Flood and artists Christine Kinsey and Bryan Jones.CEO Chapter Andy Eagle. Photo Kirsten McTernanDiscussions about the opening of an arts centre in Cardf started in  and were part of a vision for a space where artists could produce and present work, free from commercial pressures. Experimental work was seen as key to its identity, and the needs of artists were at its heart.The venue was formerly Canton High School, and the initial period of set up was a demanding time. The founders, and a gang of enthusiastic and dedicated volunteers, lovingly cleared, restored and adapted the building to make it fit for purpose as Walesrsquo first arts centre.The first official Board meeting was held on  April  and in July that year Chapter opened its doors with a temporary cinema, gallery and bar, and with former classrooms used as studios, workshops and offices.

Photo courtesy of Christine KinseyToabout the history of Chapter and itrsquos early years between  and , visit: www.issuu chapter docs earlyyears_copy.Five decades on, Chapter has grown into one of the largest arts complexes in Europe, with two cinemas, two theatres, a gallery, a large number of artistsrsquo studios and creative industry offices, meeting places for the community and a cafeacute bar.Chapter in the early daysIt produces and presents the best in national and international contemporary visual art, experimental and thought-provoking performance, and challenging independent, mainstream and international films, all alongside an inclusive learning and engagement programme.     Every year, the venue welcomes , visitors to more than  film screenings,  live performances,  visual art exhibitions and  community classes, artisan fairs and events.Mr Eagle added: ldquoChapter is many dferent things to many dferent people. For some, it will be the international gallery exhibitions and the programme of independent films.\"For others, it will be the cafeacute bar and restaurant to meet friends before a Cardf City home game, or it will be for dance and theatre classes or a cup of tea before working in the community garden.\"But at its heart itrsquos a centre for contemporary art, supporting artists and creatives from Wales and beyond to produce and present work.Chapter works with practitioners at every stage in their careers, supporting and stimulating opportunities for exciting new talent as well as promoting the work of established artists.It is a springboard for the creative community of Wales with a focus on bringing the world to Wales and Wales to the world.Chapter is home to over  of Walesrsquo most dynamic creative companies and artists, including BAFTA Cymru, Printhaus, ie ie Productions, Everyman Theatre, Beryl Productions, Cardf Music School and Taking Flight Theatre. Chapter has remained open to this creative community during the pandemic.MORE NEWS:They also offer a range of spaces in support of local artists and companies for the research and development of artistic projects, including Hijinx Theatre.Like most art and entertainment venues, the last year has been one of the most dficult times for the organisation as they were forced to close their doors.

We are an arts organisation that generates almost all of its income through ticket sales, classes, hires, cafeacute bar and other activity.\"The small remaining amount comes fromArts Council of Wales and is used to support our arts and education programme. Our capacity to earn incomeliterally stopped overnight and that was profoundly scary.Support has been generated from extremely generous public donations and from a range of funders including Arts Council Wales, Welsh Government, BFI, Art Fund, Ffilm Cymru and Admiral.Since its closure, Chapter has offered an exciting Chapter from Home programme, consisting of over  virtual film screenings, online theatre productions and art exhibitions, monthly online comedy gigs presented by Welsh comedian Robin Morgan, virtual lectures with Arts Society Cardf, as well as outdoor theatre performances with Cardf-based companies including Theatr Iolo and Kitsch  Sync.Currently showing at Chapteris internationally focussed art exhibition Artes Mundi.

Depending on Covid guidelines, they hope to welcome customers back outdoors sometime after Easter, and they have been working hard to improve their outdoor catering offer to keep visitors warm and cosy day and night.Although Chapter canrsquot bring everyone together for a big Birthday party as planned, they will celebrate their five decades through to next April with a series of special events, activities and online content - they particularly have some exciting plans for outdoor events this summer.Mr Eagle said: ldquoNeedless to say  is not the year we were anticipating for our th!ldquoWhile the move to digital is great in many ways, ultimately, people want to be able to enjoy themselves and meet and do things in person.

But I would appeal to people not to let their frustrations affect their judgement. These restrictions are in place to protect us from a vicious virus that has brought great tragedy to so many families. “When we are following them, we are helping keep ourselves and others safe – and helping our community get to a better place. “We are continuing to make good progress. The statistics on COVID- have been moving steadily in the right direction and more than three quarters of a million people in Northern Ireland have received their first vaccine dose. “We are on a pathway towards gradually easing restrictions. Theof schools and expansion of outdoor activities are the first careful steps on this route map. He added: Some regulations have been eased this week, and more welcome decisions will steadily followwe can keep COVID- infections down. “But it’s still important to follow the basics. That includes maintaining social distancing, wearing a face covering and washing hands frequently and well. Stay at home as much as possible and stay local when you are enjoying the great outdoors. Avoid crowded places, especially where it would be hard to keep your distance from others. “Make fresh air your friend this Easter weekend – outdoors is much safer than indoors. Please please don’t mix indoors with people from other households. “I want to thank everyone once again for all they have done over the past year to help repel COVID. We still need to keep our guard up for this next period, as we look forward to summer.” The department has also today issued a factfile: https:www.health-ni.gov.uk news ive-just-had-vaccine-what-can-i-do-now,  This advises people who have received the vaccine to keep following public health advice on the COVID- threat.  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_ebbfadabbcab   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_bebfbbddecd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1617468679790.jpg--covid_19___sat_3rd_apr_figures.jpg?161746867900","title":"covid  sat rd apr figures ","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows No further coronavirus related deaths and  new positive test results.
